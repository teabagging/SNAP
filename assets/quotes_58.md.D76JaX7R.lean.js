Pro-tip - cut but don't twist, this prevents the edges from sealing. While I like the variety, I found the largest 2 cutters get the only action in my kitchen. Good quality product at a good price.

It is a book that you will be able to turn to again and again for tips and tricks to use as different situations come up during organizational changes. The topics not only prepare you for change, they guide you through it and position you for the future. You will be able to identify your own style and recognize areas that need to be improved to facilitate change allowing you to create a one-minute advantage over your competitors. It covers not only how to deal with people and their attitudes but also topics as important as establishing an action plan. I recommend this book to anyone that needs a simple, concise guide to help move their company forward in today's and tomorrow's fast-paced competitive environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on what you expect...","review":"No one in their right mind would consider this to be a great re-make or cover of the original album by Pink Floyd, but then again, I don't think it's supposed to be. As the cover says, it's a tribute. As such, Out of Phase took the original lyrics and music and played them according to their own vision of how the music should sound. Although this often doesn't jive very well with the Floyd original, it is musically interesting most of the time. Some of their musical alterations work well, others don't. As a whole, though, it isn't half bad. I haven't heard the Wall tribute yet, but they also recently did one to \\"Animals\\", which I also have. It's worthwhile if you're a Floyd fan who can actually stand electronic-flavored music. One has to wonder, though, if they plan on trying to tackle \\"Wish You Were Here\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quite there","review":"Pink Floyd is a hard band to cover, but I have seen it done. Not here though. These guys did alright for a while, but when they hit \\"Any Colour You Like\\", they really bombed. It sounds more like a gang of monkeys attacking a keyboard.

Pink Floyd is a hard band to cover. However they didn't even try to do the songs justice. For Example, Money sound awful, what did he do to his voice?! the only song that's halfway decent is eclipse.

I wanted to get Dark Side of the Moon, and thought that's what I was buying. (I figured it was a newly remastered version of the original or something. Having never heard of \\"Out of Phase\\" I had no indication that this wasn't recorded by PF.) As soon as I got in my car and put it in the stereo, I thought, \\"what the heck IS this garbage???\\" I'm going to return it later and complain to the record store about where they have it. (They also had The Wall 2000 with the Pink Floyd stuff, which I now know is ALSO garbage!!!) If you know what you're buying, then enjoy it. But I can't imagine any true Pink Floyd fan enjoying this -- it's THAT BAD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah blah blah","review":"Blah Blah Blah, youve heard one youve heard them all.

However, as a biologist and catholic was greatly dissapointed by its lack of professional analysis. I understand that not being a biologist many of the aspects of natural selection will fly over Mr.Johnston's head... but first, to disregard the wealth of confirming data in favor of natural selection as ONE of the forces playing in evolutionh was too much underhandedness, the same fault he acuses Darwin of doing! Second, to keep saying over and over again (without SHOWING PROOFS) that natural selection does not happen is going against more than a century of research. I would suggest that instead of reading Phillip Johnson (a lawyer!) or Dr.Behe (a biochemist!) he better start reading BIOLOGISTS, and Science and Nature Magazines, the best in the field.

The disappointing technical quality of the sound on this CD disturbs me. In fact, it sounds worse than the vinyl I already own. Very loud hissing, some popping. The music doesn't actually sound like it's been recorded in a tunnel, but the sound is not as full as I had hoped.On the other hand, I bought this after comparing Kreisler's performance with Joshua Bell on the samples; and I find I always prefer Kreisler. With no disrespect to Mr. Bell, I find I prefer the composer performing his own music."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor recording","review":"Besides the bacground hiss, I found I had to turn the volume up to max just to hear it.

So I recommend passing on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"No crap...really? OF COURSE THIS RECORDING IS A TRANSFER!

Great song selection and video and the tunes from their new album are wonderful (I only wish the vocals were a little louder with respect to the instruments - even adjusting my speaker sound options doesn't quite get this where I'd like it to be). I especially loved Safronia's Mark and Hey You from the new material. I do wish Nancy had sung the lead on These Dreams instead of Allison Krause singing the entire thing even though I do like Allison's voice (but it's Nancy's song, you know?). At least we get to hear Nancy singing lead on a couple other songs instead. Ann kicked serious butt on everything her vocal cords touched which was awe-inspiring to see and hear.

The Lexicon Syriacum in this text is also not a model one would want to adopt unless re-learning Syriac from more modern updated sources was your goal. The new updated Brockelmann is best for a Syriac lexical reference.As far as print goes this one is blurred a bit too much for my liking and the print is very small. If you've ever tried to read Serto that was well printed then you know reading it in a small foggy print isn't the best of situations.

Sword of Attila does just about everything wrong: simplistic cardboard characters, contrived historically inaccurate sequences, modern attitudes, and even a pre-battle speech straight out of some cheesy Hollywood action-adventure movie. In fact this book reads like Mr. Ford was writing it with a Hollywood screenplay in mind.

So they sent us a new one and it is still cracked! Right now its not worth the effort of sending it back and forth, works out okay because it is for my parents house, so he is not there all the time. Would not recommend it to others"},{"rating":"1","title":"craftmanship is poor but it will hold together","review":"overall it is just OK for its price, the joints are not clean cut, it has some really rough edges, we had to grind down and sand paper it so it leaves a smooth edges. you can feel sprinter when you pass your fingers through it which is not baby friendly at all.

I recieved one on Monday and when my husband went to put it together we discovered that we had two right sides instead of a right and left side.

Amazon did a great job arranging for a pick-up by UPS the next day, and Amazon also immediately re-ordered a replacement which came two days later. I'm very happy with the way Amazon handling everything.Unfortunately, the product itself is not well-made, there are hairline cracks and peeled paint on the high chair. Also, the seat height is only 19 3/4\\" which makes it too low to be used with a dining table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong color and damaged -- but nice otherwise!","review":"Two giant problems with this chair. First, one of the main side pieces had two giant cracks in it. So right there I needed to return it. As a bonus, though, the color was completely different from pictured, but not really enough like any of the other colors pictured to make me confident enough that they just sent the wrong one. I ordered the walnut, but the color that came was more like a golden oak. Not light enough to be natural but not red enough to be mahogany. I'll attach pictures to the review if I can. The wood did seem nice (aside from being cracked and a bit scratched in one place) and for the price it might be worth ordering again to get an uncracked version, but I think I am going to try to find one in person instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"$35 quality","review":"I purchased two of these high chairs knowing that there was a 50/50 chance of getting something broken or scratched ( according to the reviews)..And yes!

Instead of shipping me 1 foot rest bar (14-11/16\\" long) and 2 stretcher bars (16-7/16\\" long, the horizontal bar at the bottom) as they should, they shipped three foot rest bars in the package.2. The barrier bar has a 1-1/4\\" diameter. However the size of the waist belt loop is way too small for the barrier bar to fit it.As a result of above two issues, I am not able to assemble it.Free shipping is offered.

I guess I won't know for another month or so. I've been waiting 3 weeks and it hasn't shipped. A few more weeks of waiting before they get around to shipping it.I guess they have to wait until they chop down some trees in a tropical rainforest and then send to wood to a sweatshop in China to be milled and then put in a cargo container to come across the ocean.

So what's your point?","review":"Don't be fooled by the reviews from people doing their \\"you call that art\\" routine.

I used the same operating system, Win98 SE. The program froze up a number of times. I was able to transfer most of my files, some of my applications. The problems is, when it freezes up, it starts all over again rather than being able to see what has already transferred. At one point, with just a few minutes to being finished, it was merging my old registry data with the new and froze up again. Very frustrating! Also, on a previous freeze up, the target computer would not boot fully, even into safe mode. I wound up having to revert to a previous system configuration.

It doesn't work. Eisenworld's tech support can't return your call the same day. They returned my call about 40 hours later when I wasn't even home. And then when I tried to return the product, they won't take it back unless you get their \\"permission\\" to return it and a special number. Nowhere is this stated on the cover or the written instructions inside. It simply says \\"100% guaranteed,\\" return for full refund if dissatisfied for any reason.

Then, of all the folders that wouldn't transfer, half of \\"My Documents,\\" had to be done manually on Zip disks. I didn't want to carry over Netscape (an old version 4) but it wouldn't let me deselect it; I had no choice but to bring it over!

This thing has saved me a number of times already. I've used it on multiple computers with different PS2 keyboards and mice with no issues. Just plug it into a working USB port on any PC and then plug in your PS2 peripherals. I have not tried this with any other operating system other than Windows XP, Vista, and windows 7. If you'd like me to test it on Linux and Mac OS X, just leave me comment and I'd be happy to. Overall this is very convenient and works just as described.

I currently have it hooked up to a low-power ASROCK AMD E350 machine(which only has one PS/2 port) through an 8-port ATEN Masterview max PS/2 KVM(CS-1758).

Occasionally, the keyboard would seems to lose its connection and reconnect within a second. I'd notice that the lock lights on the keyboard would flash off and on and I'd lose a letter or two while typing. It didn't bother me too much. I'll refer to this as restarting because I figure a short or something in the chip in the cable is causing it to restart. Last night, while playing a game, the device freaked out on me. It began continually restarting. The lock lights just kept flashing on and off and I'd get almost continual missing and/or repeated characters.I've had nothing but bad luck with Belkin products in the past, so this will be my last Belkin brand product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIsappointed","review":"We purchased the Belkin USB to PS\\\\2 Adapter so we could use our Kensington Expert Mouse on our new computer (new computer didn't have a PS/2 port).

Even the works on this disc by great composers such as Mozart and Beethoven are generally trivial. At the same time, this is fine playing of a highly unusual instrument by a polished virtuoso. Some of the pieces, however, I could do without. For instance, while Thomas Bloch's playing is excellent, his compositional skills are somewhat lacking. His own original work, complete with overdubbed whiny male soprano, is the disc's finale and sounds more like a corny film soundtrack than anything else. In addition, it must be noted that the performance here of Donizetti's \\"Mad Scene\\" from Lucia utilizes possibly the worst soprano ever recorded (short of Florence Foster Jenkins). I wouldn't wish her off-pitch shrieking on my worst enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you money.","review":"Bought these because they were supposed to be molded or custom-fitted to our vehicle.

A beautiful silky 2 piece kimono with velcro tabs, so it can be removed and is washable. Adorable little red shoes, keep an eye on them because they don't tend to stay on her feet. A pretty little hair comb gold with a large white flower. Of course, it has been out of production for 10 years and is hard to find.

A couple of girls kissing (and playing, but nothing more), an implied threesome in a casual sex bar? Would that offend you?Then do not, under any circumstance, buy this set.It is not, as many others have pointed out, a cartoon for kids. Graphic sex and violence are the norm. These elements are essential to the story.On the other hand, if these things don't offend, and you would like to watch an animated film that, to some degree, tackles what real evil is (and its place in the world), this series might be of great interest.And it is highly entertaining.But only if graphic sex and violence are, to you, entertaining. Otherwise, you will most likely be offended.I suspect that is where the divide between the reviewers comes, although no one has specifically addressed it. This series can be harsh, if one is not expecting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this NOW if you like Spawn","review":"Simply put, this is one of the best animated series ever made.

This isn't a bad thing--it rather made me wish there were more seasons done for the series.Lots of violence, a bit of nudity, rather gratuitous profanity, dialogue that's mildly painful here and there (but nowhere as groan-inducing as much of Cogliostro's portentious over-narration--this is relied upon to a much lesser extent in the second and third discs, which is a good thing), and nice animation quality throughout.

If you are interested in Spawn you should definitely check this series out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insert laudatory title","review":"Starting true to form, let me say that I've been watching animation since I was about three or four. When I was a kid, I said I wanted to be baby dumbo. When I got older, most of the shows I watched were animated (most of them anime, pity that went mainstream). As much as I had enjoyed what I watched, I never knew what a show could be until Spawn (the only complete series I'd seen at that point were starblazers, robotech, lupin, this was 1996 or 7 mind you, hard to find stuff).The shows writing was the comic distilled. Which I still have by the way, it's Alan McElroy's only success, and the show maintained a certain level of quality even if not in the animation.You may like this you may not. I do.

Devin has long been one of my favorite MCs since he was part of Facemob. The album has its comedic moments, but most of all, it's real, with his oh-so-candid method of telling it like it is: he loves weed and women, and still drives his 'lacville '79!

To Tha X-treme focuses on the everyday man with everyday problems, not the fancy cars, jewelry, and drug kingpins that are flooding today's rapper's albums. Devin speaks and people relate, there's no other way to describe this smooth flowing southern rapper.

The orange skin was the most useful thing from this kit. The orange immediately helped her know that was her camera and the skin was an additional moisture barrier for her camera. Also, the skin, she said, helped her keep the camera in her pocket - a pickpocket would have had a difficult time wrenching the camera from her because the skin helped grip the pocket lining. She returned from Costa Rica with everything smelling like mildew because of the heavy humidity.

I've just gone through the process with my oldest son and a lot of the information in here would've been extremely helpful along the way. College Baseball is unlike basketball and football-scholarships are normally partial scholarships, and the most any school can give is 11.7 total (and many give substantially less than that) among all of its players, so the competition is fierce.

It was impossible for me, putting this book down. The intensity of my curiousity lead me to reading this book in less than a week. Showell weaves a intricate murder mystery, leading the reader straight to the probable causes behind the murder of a man viciously hated by many. I especially loved the main character, Mosey Love. Asa, you must hurry up and put a spin on part II. Please drop this novel soon, as I am anxiously waiting to read your next Mosey Love murder mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome cust service","review":"Had trouble with the item, called them and the item was replaced in 3 days.

The price after rebate made it even more attractive. Well, remember the two adages, \\"you get what you pay for\\" and \\"bait and switch,\\" as this program satisfies both. First, while the menu asks what type of files/programs you want to transfer, it transfers everything, even if all you want are files in your My Documents folder. It starts by transferring the programs on the Source PC and then will make registry mods. I don't like messing w/ the registry.While first running the program it asks if you'd like to upgrade to the Ultra version for $19.95, the bait and swith.

His character has grown much older now but still roams the back roads seeking peace but always running into opposition from both the law and the gangsters (yakuza).

A must for fans of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"This was my first Zatoichi movie and I was amazed, at both the action and the character.

There are riches hidden below, but unfortunately for he and his crew, there is a sadistic doctor there still performing offbeat operations. Disease ridden and strange tribes are spread out through the \\"River of Death\\" and the group either survives or perishes by the end of the story. The movie based on Alistair MacLean's novel is pure genius (never read the book). If I knew a river was called the \\"River of Death,\\" then I wouldn't go into it. No casual swim, no fishing. Probably infested with piranha, anyway, those tribesmen needed to save makeup time for their Barbies. Why couldn't those people take a shower? If you want to stay healthy, all you have to do is stay clean. Common sense. Michael Deitykoff is a genius once again. Please put this movie on DVD right now!

Before going thru this book I considered myself an intermediate guitar player. This book has greatly developed my fingerstyle ability. If you are already fair on guitar and want to learn fingerstyle blues tunes this is your book. First 8 songs not to hard but sound good. Last 10 songs all fingerstyle alternating thumb base with index, middle and ring fingers playing melody. Songs progressively get harder as he introduces and builds on each technique. It took me some serious practicing but I'm now hooked on fingerstyle acoustic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Best of the urology overviews out there.","review":"I can not say enough good things about this little book. It is both a very well put together overview of urology, while still being very useful to both lower and upper level residents AND medical students. It covers many of the common problems seen in urology in such a way as to be useful in day to day patient managment as well as giving a nice overview of facts that may be helpful for the urology boards. This little guy is a very easy read while at the sametime time being full of helpful info. As overviews of urology goes, this is the best book out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay its a phone","review":"These phones are great. the 2.4 gigahertz allows you to make and receive calls without to much interference from your neighbors phones. The only other option that would be nice is for it to have the ability to add other phones to it. Another down fall you can not hang up either receiver on the opposite base or neither will work and you have to reset it by placing the original phone receiver on the base charger and the second receiver on the secondary wait ten seconds then take the second receiver and place it on the base charger. When the led reads it has been reconnected then you can then use it again. Confusing I know but that is one of the draw backs to multiple phone sets.

I picked it up based on the title and editorial reviews becaus I had never read Etchison's work before. Now that I have read it, I am not sure I will ever be the same. Each tale takes reality and twists it in perverse and astounding ways. The author takes the simple everyday things and makes them terrifying. Each story deftly plays a psychological game with your mind and will change how you see things. He reminded me a lot of Stephen King in the short story form in that his ability to take daily life and turn it into one of the darkest things you will ever encounter. I only thought a couple of the stories in this anthology could be stronger...but by no means were any of them poor.If your a horror fan who wants to see how a master does it...pick up 'The Death Artist'."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, boring,","review":"Some of the stories were fair, but after a while, you could pretty well tell how they were going to end.

It's advertised as a First Base workout, but of the 45 minutes, only about five are devoted to first base.

My guess is that there's about 15 minutes of actual content, with 30 minutes of nonsense. There are plenty of better baseball instructional videos out there.

Her thin wheedling is a dreadful match for Tchaikovsky's music; perhaps better suited for an oriental concerto such as the Butterfly Lovers, but basically unpleasant for one who enjoys the robust tone of a Keylin, Barton, or Bisengaliev.

I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"No matter what the series, it has always been a disappointment when Lucy hobknobs with and fawns over guest stars. With the exception of the Hollywood episodes, even \\"I Love Lucy\\" had a few clinkers like these on the \\"Here's Lucy\\" set.The packaging and quality of this set are great. Care was definitely given on every aspect of production.The was the first-run Lucy program with which I gew up and I certainly remember having a good time watching it. My disappointment only grew as each episode on this set unspooled. Surely there are 24 other episodes in the remaining 120 that would actuallly meet the \\"best of\\" criteria. I don't know that I will keep this set - earning back some of my money would be better than letting it sit unseen.The \\"I Love Lucy\\" disks are worth the expense and let's hope \\"The Lucy Show\\" is released season by season so those of us who wish to can limit ourselves to the \\"Viv\\" episodes- the ones before that series degraded into a \\"Who's Who\\" of Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Lucy Completists","review":"Lucille Ball should have stretched her talents in a comedy-variety format. Instead, the immortal redhead dusted off the old routines for \\"Here's Lucy.\\" Time has not been kind to this 1968-74 sitcom, which finally exhausts the Lucy formula. Though Ball, Gale Gordon, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr. make a winning ensemble, the scripts and direction are a faint echo of the \\"I Love Lucy\\" days. Even the guest spots ring hollow - whether it's Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton or Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon. Worse still, Ball's once-sublime physical humor takes on a forced, repetitive quality. Except for a few welcome appearances, Vivian Vance is no longer around to pick up the slack. With its gaudy colors and cheesy sets, \\"Here's Lucy\\" looks more dated than \\"I Love Lucy\\" ever did. The extras in this DVD collection are better than the actual episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music!","review":"Some fine music on this CD, particularly the title song.

Most importantly, the English of the translation is frequently incomprehensible.

Our hero travels across the Channel, not once but several times, and spends much time in France. He is actually \\"employed\\" by Prince John, which should come as a shock to the series readers, but the author explains the seeming contradiction.

The rolicking good times of the Irish drinking songs make this Irish-American girl laugh aloud while alone in my car, stuck in traffic...and disturbing other drivers with my wild-eyed glee such that some even casually lock their doors.

With the unit plugged into the wall, this little system will fill a room with hi-fi sound. Running on batteries, however, is a different story. Six 'C' batteries are required if you have no access to an outlet. If you plan on playing CD's while running on batteries, expect to listen to only one disc. The CD's laser, presumably, uses an exponentially larger amount of juice than any other function, radio or cassette. Radio listening will get you the most time from the batteries. If you decide to go rechargeable, get the higher capacity batteries. Overall, I'm completely satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sleek Model.","review":"I purchsed this on Oct 18 , and I loved this Boombox, the design and sound quality is excellent for a small budget.The Only thing Which I see as a Drawback is it doesn't play Mp3 Cd's.Overal I will suggest this as a good selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"cassette lovers beware","review":"The bummer with this player is a little rubber drive belt, very very thin, which busts after minimal use. I had to call Sony to get a replacement belt, and disassembling the player is not easy.

Well I'm off to find another mystery. Gina"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this mystery","review":"I have to go along with the majority here, this was a well crafted tale. The characters were depicted as real people, from all walks of life. From Doctor's to Convicts, abused women to pampered ladies. The most interesting outcome of this mystery is you can't judge a person by his or her status in the world. Nadine Monyer managed to chip the casing off some characters we would least expect to do the unexpected.

The writing style was bland, the pace was all over the place, the reader was spoon fed information the plot was revealed in the space one or two pages! The plot would have been better placed in a \\"days of our lives\\" episode. Mills and Boonish pulp.Like many of the othe reviewers, I bought the book because of the number of 5 star reviews. In retrospect, I now see that they were mainly \\"one liners\\" and contained no substance. I don't know where they've come from but they certainly haven't read this book. Save your money and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak characters, weak plot, predictable ending","review":"A friend of mine gave me \\"Quiet He Might Hear You\\" to read. I was thoroughly disappointed. The plotline of the \\"skeletons in the closet\\" theme that Monyer pounds into the reader, page after page, was too cliche, and her development of the characters was even more trite. The ending was also very predictable, in that Monyer's obviously tried to end the book \\"unpredictably.\\" I would recommend this book for a quick, thoughtless beach read; but if you're looking for substance, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"I truly loved it!","review":"With my cat by my side I read \\"Quiet\\" in one evening.

I hated this movie. It sure did scare me to see the princess becoming a jackal and taking over the screen.It gave me a ten-week nightmare!

I guess we will never know but this is a very interesting version nonetheless and thats just 1 small part of the book. This guy talks about hit jobs like he talks about taking the dog for a walk. Its a piece of cake for him. Its hard to go into everything in a review but if you dig mob books you will dig this one. Its a really easy read and its pretty decent sized and it holds your interest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So So Mob story","review":"The more mob story's I read, and I've read most of them, I find that they all conflict each other as to dates, relationships to each other, and authenticity. Our thirst for mob literature is such that, with respect to Contract Killer, the author seem's to take huge liberty in his description of events that leads one to question wether or not this book borders on fiction.True readers of mob literature will see right through this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad but is it true?","review":"It's not a bad book but I wonder how much of what he says he did is actually true. If you red alot of mafia books, like me, You don't find many new stories except Jimmy Hoffa. He says he was there but I could say the same thing. There is no one to back him up except Jimmy Coonan, and I doubt he will. As long as you read this with a large grain of salt in mind, it's entertaining. New versions of old stories. If you want read a real book about the mob, read \\"Murder Machine\\" by Jerry Capeci and Gene Mustain. It's the best of all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This was one of the best books I ever read! At first I found myself rooting for the bad guys, \\"Mad Dog\\" Joe Sullivan and Tony the Greek. The story was well-written. I felt like I was there with them. I was upset when they both went to jail but then I remembered that all the stories were real and they got what they deserved. I'm glad they have to spend the rest of their lives in jail. They murdered many innocent people. But still, I felt the book was great and worth reading, but if I had it to do again I wouldn't buy it because I despise the fact that I put my hard earned money in the hands of scum like Donald Frankos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great format, but lacks accurate content","review":"As a former interpreter, I am rather critical of this book, mostly because of the numerous incorrect signs and the heavy use of \\"English\\" signs instead of American Sign Language (ASL).I bought this book to brush up on my signing skills and found this book to be very frustrating due to the mis-usage of signs.The format, photos and layout are very nice, but the content left me desiring more.It is unfortunate the author \\"missed the boat\\" (TRAIN-GO-SORRY) on this project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sir, get your facts right","review":"This book is poorly written with many incorrect dates and information splashed throughout.He gives the date of Madhva's birth as 1199 CE when Indologists believe it to be 1238 CE. This is just one of the many casual mistakes he makes.In page 12 he tries to wilfully put down the images of Siva and Vishnu and show them to be brutal in comparison to some Avalokita and manjusri - like the \\"archangels of Christian and Jewish tradition\\", reeks of his clandestine agenda to promote his beliefs. Very biased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plays Almost Everything","review":"It's been able to play virtually everything I've thrown at it, just as advertised (Divx, avi, vcd, dvd +r/-r etc). Good player for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pioneer Not What Is Needed","review":"This DVD player was purchased on the basis of the description and links that described it as a region free, PAL/NTSC, 110/240 volt campatible system. It did not meet any of these criteria. It requires code entry to attempt to play DVDs that are not A category; only puts out NTSC signals; and requires 110V and is not dual voltage capable. Unit was returned and I am still waiting refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled: this product is NOT REGION FREE!","review":"I am so disappointed with this product!

I've only had it a couple of months, so I can't speak to its longevity and reliability, but for a pretty low price you're getting a lot of capabilities. First of all, it plays Video CDs better than any player I've ever had. I've had a lot of problems with skipping and stopping - not on this player. Also, I put my first British DVD in it yesterday and it played perfectly with no setting adjustments - couldn't even tell there was any special multi-regional functionality involved. It remembers the last several DVDs or VCD you've played, so that if you eject it (accidentally or on purpose), it'll pick right back up where you stopped. It seems to be a great player, and I'm very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!","review":"I bought the Pioneer DV-393-S DVD player for its multi-region capabilities. A friend of mine bought this very same model, and he received a region 3 player that played any region and was PAL and NTSC compatible. The player I received was a region 1 DVD player and it DID NOT play my region 2 DVDs. I was able to play a region 0 PAL DVD, so it still can translate PAL to NTSC, but other regions were now locked out of this player. So if you're in the US, and it's a multi-region player you're looking for, go with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after about a year","review":"My 393 just failed after about a year of use. Was great up to now, but out of the blue (we just watched a DVD a few days ago) it has started showing distorted images on and off.

Unless you really value recycling and like REALLY eclectic jewelry, don't bother. The book is short on basic jewelry techniques such as attaching clasps; and frankly, I agree with other reviewers that most items look like they were made by a pre-schooler - there is seriously an entire chapter on pasta necklaces ! Items made from golf tees, computer parts, candy ?! And truly, some items are made with wire screen and cut tin or aluminum without benefit of any finishing to the edges, causing safety concerns. There are so many other good books out there - if you want one for younger children (up to pre-teens) I recommend \\"The Girls' World Book of Jewelry\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A euro book that lost some in the translation","review":"This is another book on jewelry making that should not have been brought to the U.S. for sale.

When listening there are a few problems... Timing, chord progression, and vocals all show minor flaws that might have been cleaned up for a studio album. That being said... Those same problems give a feel of being there minus the crowd noise of a live set. Which made me think of some of the great club bands of my youth before they became Pop Icons, (REO Speedwagon, J.Guiles, the E.Street Band),so what I think about this group is as soon as they can decide exactly what kind of band they want to be (songs seem to change in theme from Greenday to the Monkees)these guys will be great, and having this album will be one of those \\"Have I heard about them?!!!? Iv'e got all their albums!!!\\"Anyway give or take a few obscenities, this is a fun album from a tallented group."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Dry","review":"This book is a bit on the dry side. Plus, I didn't notice - until I received it - that the book isn't an authorized biography in any way. (Yes, I'm aware it says a statement to that effect on the front of the book, but I didn't think to read the small print.) As an avid \\"I Love Lucy\\" fan, I've read a bunch of biographical books on Lucille Ball. I was excited to find something about Viv and Bill. What a disappointment. First of all, you question everything you read (since it's not authorized or endorsed). Second, it reads a lot like a dry news article. I found it to be a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had looked forward to reading this book for some time, but what a disappointment! The writing is merely adequate, the research something anybody with an internet connection could accomplish. The text amounts to little more than a list of productions that Vivian Vance and William Frawley participated in. The only pictures are a few publicity stills that again, anybody could get their hands on. Many of the quotes are surprisingly boring, making me wonder why the author bothered to put them in. All of that said, there is still a glimmering of interest here, because the two subjects are of such interest. They do deserve a full biography each, although it is interesting to find both of them profiled, however vaguely, in the same volume. There is a biography of Vivian Vance out; I don't know if there is one of Bill Frawley or not, and if not, I guess this volume will have to serve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your service was great as always but the book sucked!!","review":"Amazon always has shown me excellent service.

Would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!","review":"This book had so much useless information I could barely get through it. What a waste of paper! I have loved watching the Mertzes on I Love Lucy, so I bought this book to learn a bit more about them. Well, with the info that is in the book, that task could have been accomplished in 10 pages. Instead there is a lot of useless, BORING, information that no one cares about. Furthermore, It paints such ugly pictures of both of those people. I am sorry I every bought this rag. If you love Lucy & the Mertzes, you will honor them by NOT purchasing this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BIO, A MUST-READ FOR ALL LUCY LOVERS","review":"Very little has been written about William Frawley and Vivian Vance. As a life-long I Love Lucy fan, I was anxious to read their life stories. This book offers a full-bodied, three-dimensional portrait of the pair. I was fascinated to learn about their lives pre-and post-Lucy, and I loved the book's anecdotes, especially all those involving Frawley and Vance's mutual dislike and Vance's relationship with Lucille Ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It's About Time!\\"","review":"This was an absolute joy to read and is now one of my favorite biographies.I'm an avid Lucy fan and have waited years for just this book,the first bio of Frawley and only the second of Vance and that book only came out not too long ago.If you love Fred&Ethel get to know the talents who portrayed them .SHEER BLISS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet the Mertzes","review":"As a lover of Lucy and Ethel, I wanted to find out as much as possible about them.

I like real juicy, gossipy insiders view but this only skimmed the surface of the two actor's relationships to one another. The book mostly focused on the two individually rather than both of them together. You get a detailed description of Bill and Vivian's acting careers and how they evolved, which in my opinion, wasn't that interesting. I had to skim over a lot of pages because it just wasn't that insightful. \\"Next Bill went to this play. Then he went to that play. Then this one. etc. etc.\\" Come on, give us the scoop! :) So that's why I only rated it 2 stars. I'm a huge I Love Lucy fan, but this book doesn't even have a reserved spot on my bookshelf.

It has positively ruined me for my birthday every year, I do absolutely nothing I don't want to do. I eat cake for breakfast if I want, and I never go to work that day. What a positive and creative book this is, it totally convinced me that everyone is worth spoiling rotten at least one day a year. And the pictures are so emotive and beautiful - that last image of the child bundled up safely on the flying platter is so comforting. Both my sons love the book and request it read often. The copy from my childhood is missing both covers now and some of the pages are separated, but we still love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget Birthday Cards","review":"After one reads and delights in Dr. Seuss' book, Happy Birthday to You!, one will see the giving of birthday cards in a much colder and more sterile light. This book should be given to anyone celebrating a birthday who could use a snack from a Hippo-Heimers back (and, quite frankly, who could not). It is a book for all ages through the ages, entirely timeless in its zany approach to that special day. It will have you shouting \\"I am I\\" which is the purpose of birthdays and even better is having someone with whom to share one's birthday to shout \\"We are we\\".

It starts out with pretty easy ones and then gives you progressively harder ones towards the end. There are plenty of step by step examples of how to solve the problems using the formulas throughout the chapter and they give derivations for almost all the equations.

Some logical inconsistencies exist in the plotting, as well as a seemingly substantial emotional inconsistency re: the actions of the boyfriend toward the end of the story. (I'm trying not to give the ending away.) But, as the mother of a Down syndrome boy and an educated person with extensive knowledge on the subject of Down syndrome, I am queasy about Fossum's treatment of her Down syndrome character; sexual predation is virtually never part of the Down pathology. Down's people have enough troubles without being tagged with this kind of reputation. Granted, the last scene is ambiguous; however, its ominousness is clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"norway/ interesting","review":"interesting look at small town life in norway. karin fossum has done a fine job of creating a real feel for the scenery, personalities, problems of everyday people in this region. book was best when dealing with the 'outsider' characters, who live life quite separated from their neighbors. can't wait to read her other novels. jack,charlevoix,mi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Good mystery.

The 1st in the series was Eve's Eye; Wikipedia says there's an English translation coming out in 2012 but as of late May it is not yet available. The 3rd in the series (which I'll start in a couple of minutes) is He Who Fears The Wolf.Anyway, this is very good. Has obvious similarities with the Martin Beck series but has psychological elements on top of the police procedural layering.

Japanese writer Matsuo Karino's \\"Out\\" was last year's inkling of the great stuff that is slowly finding its way into English.

The book is virtually without any twists, and surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree that this plot mischaracterizes down syndrome people","review":"The characterization of the young man with Down Syndrome is offensive, incorrect and distracting. The book is very readable, but unpleasant. Many questions are unanswered. I personally think that leaving questions unanswered or an ending ambiguous is a cheap way to affect artistry. I call it the \\"Lady or the Tiger\\" crutch. I hate the ending. Looking at the plot lines of KArin Fossum's books, too many involve murdered children. I can live without that, myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bookschlepper Recommends","review":"This is the second Sejer book I've read. I'm not really in to mysteries but I love the Norwegian locations. A girl gets in a car with a stranger. A body is found. An odd man in interviewed. Neighbors are suspected. There is a solution.

The suspense is handled with care and precision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable and well-written","review":"I finished this book months ago, and have read many books since then, most of which I have forgotten, but I remember this one. I think that says a lot. Fossum is an excellent writer and this is much more than just another mystery novel. I would give it 5 stars, but I just wish the ending had been a bit clearer. I'm pretty sure I know what happened, but it would be nice to have it confirmed. I should clarify that by the end it's clear who the murderer is, so it doesn't leave you hanging to that extent. It's just that it leaves certain details...unconfirmed I guess would be the word. But then again, that may be one of the reasons it's so haunting. I don't know. Maybe it's just perfect as is. In any event, I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention keeper!","review":"Author writes with great characters fleshed out with information and adjectives to draw you into feeling you know them.

A list of low GI foods would have been nice, or help on eating out. Realistically, noone is going to stick to eating her recipes for the rest of their lives. Some of the ingredients I had never heard of and there was no way the rest of my family would eat ANY of them. I was doing triple the work in the kitchen not only to just make meals for myself and different ones for my family, but trying to prepare ahead my 5 mini meals for the following day. I don't know about you, but I would rather spend less time in the kitchen and more with my children!

No, it is not. Like several women, who wrote below I have hypothyroidism, but also hyperinsulinemia, which means that many mini-meals are the worst thing I could possibly choose for my eating plan. I am now following the Carbohydrate Addict's Diet (designed for those with hyperinsulinemia) and am losing weight for the first time in twenty years.My advice is that before you jump in head first, you should try to determine the nature of your own weight problem, as no diet fits ALL, and not all women are the same.Gillespie's book may or may not work for you. Just be aware that the claim that it is a godsend for ALL women is simply not true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Confusing Book I've Read","review":"I agree with the reader form Europe who complained about the recipes needing strange ingredients. For example, whey protein powder is called for (1 Tbsp) and it is sold in a huge canister for $14.99. No other recipe in the book calls for it. Also many of the recipes make food for 8. Who has that big a family-as if my family would eat any of this food? I like what I've made so far, but my kids? Never.The book's format has wide margins with pithy quotes here and there, no doubt to make it look simple and clear. I found it to be anything but clear! And I am highly educated, I might add. I was really fooled by all these great reviews.

The chapters are rearranged but it is the same \\"summarized\\" information in each book. Reviews tout Dr. Gillespie as having the ability to diseminate medical informaion in easy to understand terms. If you want the Cliff Notes of Low GI eating, then this is the book for you.

It measures 8.5\\" w x 11\\" t x almost an inch thick. And it is 364 pages long. The book was published in 2005, so it is a shame it doesn't go into cents past 1995, but overall a nice and interesting read.

You can see some typical VHS dropouts.The sound of this DVD is poor, too because I think the real sound was mono and they upgrade it to stereo.The movie self is a good and cheesy eighties film with Sam Jones and in a little role Linda Blair but the DVD release is a fragment of jurassic time.Keep your money for better DVDs like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good...","review":"Third rate martial arts knockoff whose only saving grace is an underused Linda Blair in several scenes as the damsel-in-distress.

Fairy Tail started in Japan about 2 years ago. Since then, it has become one of the most popular animes in Japan and America. The Story is gripping, the animation is very high quality, And this one is almost perfect for the whole family (I say almost because in Japanese, there are a lot of sex related jokes. I know that is not everyone's cup of tea so fair warning). Based on the cover, this boxset will end the conflict with Phantom, that was started in the last boxset, and will begin telling Erza's past and her connection to the battles ahead. If you are going to buy this series though, I would highly recommend that you buy the first 2 boxsets. This can be a very hard series just to jump into.

The stock cables with the SlingBox were picking up a lot of noise/interference from the power cables powering the cable box and the SlingBox itself and this noise is totally eliminated with this new cable.The only thing that really makes it feel cheap, imho, is the fact that the colored bands on the ends are essentially a thin plastic tape. They were already coming off of the connectors before I even opened the bag.

Unlike other brands, these noodles did not unclump after cooking and no amount of stirring broke apart a large chunk of them that tasted like a ball of greasy dough. The sauce was pretty good but very thick and heavy for pad thai and had an artificially sweet taste (considering this is supposedly an \\"all natural\\" product). It does not look at all like the image on the box. For over 600 calories and 22 grams of fat I just don't think this brand is worth it when I could either have much healthier options from comparable brands or indulge in and enjoy real Thai food that tastes infinitely better.

Edward Thorp a Mathematician developed a card counting system that beat the Casino's. This book tells what the gambling scene was like in Las Vegas in the early 60's. This book is a good book for system traders in the market to read. It shows how Thorp tried to think of everything that could go wrong that might cost him money. He took a game with a negative expectation and turned the odds in his favor. Traders should look at this book for the Quantitative approach to games of chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outdated but Interesting","review":"If you are looking to learn blackjack for the first time or even if you are an intermediate player, I would not recommend this as the book to read. You should read Frank Scoblete's BEST BLACKJACK which teaches a much simpler and easier to learn card counting system. Also, Scoblete's book is a lot more fun. But Thorp is the genius who invented card counting and his book is a must as background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priceless","review":"I think some of the reviewers below are missing something: this is still an essential purchase. Much of the detail can't be found elsewhere. There are ideas here which can still be used to devastating effect on occassion. Most modern texts dwell on the dry detail of card-counting: Thorp has that kind of visionary mind which is always searching for the big score. In addition it reads like a thriller (and you would'nt believe some of the stuff Thorp could'nt put in!). The card-counting systems are obsolete now, but I very much doubt anyone would make it as a pro counter without familiarizing themselves with the material here.John May (Author of \\"Baccarat for the clueless\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta have this book in your gambling library","review":"The fact that this book, which was originally published in the 1960s, is still ranked so high in the bestseller lists says something about its historical value in the gambling world.If you've ever had any interest in card counting (which accounts for many people since the successful ride of \\"Bringing Down the House\\"), this book is definitely worth picking up -- especially at its small price.Much of the information is outdated, but to actually relive the earliest stages of basic strategy and card counting is pretty freakin' cool. For the blackjack enthusiast, this book won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"This book is of historical importance because it is the first book written, as it is the oldest, with a viable counting system.

The ideas for activities to go along with the books are great and have a wide range for different age groups. We have just started using it but I view it as an essential source for our plans and would recommend it for others homeschooling or even just to supplement your child's learning in the classroom. The fact that our children love books and are curious about many things certainly is a plus but I believe that the books recommended combined with the range of activities would get even the most reluctant student engaged -- or at least mildly interested.

The lead singer dose not ever shout, or sing just grunt. With the way he is doing things lyrics are pretty much worthless because its just a seires of endless grunts that is sure to bore. One thing that would help the band is if they used keybords but they don't. Avoid this one.

People don't know about the talent of many bands like Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, Nile, Obituary, Hate Eternal, Cryptopsy, etc. But then you have grindcore, which is more noise than music, and is definitely not for the ears. Then you have a band called Mortician, which sadly, is one of the most predictable bands out in the underground death metal scene.I have listened to a few tracks from this band, and here's the layout:-A horror movie sample which lasts from about 30 to 60 seconds-Noise. Simple guitar riffs and a drum machine. No solos whatsoever.The songs only last from about 30 seconds to 3 minutes.They have done this on EVERY CD they have made. \\"Domain of Death\\" is no exception. This gets boring real quick.

Every song was horrible and needed to be re-adjusted.\\"House by the Cemetery\\", and \\"Zombie Apocalypse\\" were excellent albums. But for some reason I think Will and Roger of Moritician lost something in this album.Now in there new album \\"Darkest Day of Horror\\" they pick right back up on the right track and it is once again enjoyable to listen to.I am not disrespecting Mortician I am just saying this CD needs to be put away in a place that no one will find it.

He did a few more clips and it continued to rip the hair out. I even tried to cut his inch and half long hair with scissors so it was even shorter. Even at half an inch the shaver was still ripping out hair. It claims that it is self sharpening and I have never seen a blade so dull!

Jim exposes a lot of what he went through after Ball Four was published and has no problems kicking butt and naming names. He states several times that he is just being honest, but there is a real thread of revenge running through this book. Heck, if I was treated like that, I suppose I would feel the same way!

I get the same reading on my other car as well. I hooked up both cars to a battery tender and with the tender in floating mode (indicating the battery is basically fully charged) the voltage reading still doesn't exceed 12.4v and the battery icon shows the batteries about half charged.

When I added up the cost including the machine, drums, and toners, our total cost for 2 years/100,000 copies was $2600. Had I done the same usage with an ink jet, it would have cost about $5000-$6000, so most definitely this is the better buy.

The \\"Presto Page Manager\\" thing is nonsensical. The Brother support site is pathetically unhelpful and the Mac firmware is buggy, however the phone support is great. Techs cheerfully had to walk me through a non-intuitive TWAIN acceptance procedure to get the scanner to work. They acknowledge it's a problem but that the web has yet to address it.

Bottom line: they don't support any, but aren't willing to admit it.I would be embarassed to send my letters out in envelopes looking like this.

In Fist of the North Star He shows himself to be like a deity and in Bloodmoon and Recoil and Cold Harvest but in this movie one has to settle for very very good. This movie has joint locks without the snap or the one vital second of silence where the audience and the henchman realize that the limb has broken.Yes, this is a good martial arts movie Yes, it makes Van Damme look like a pudgy schoolgirl.

I gave it a D, my colleague gave it an A-. For me, there were far too many secrets to be revealed, each at an excruiatingly slow pace. Reading it was like receiving the Chinese Water Torture.This is a story of the reuinion of a couple who split up a dozen years in the past. While such a story could be poignant, this one failed because the split did not seem realistic. If you were newly married and struck by tragedy and your mate said, in a fit of sadness and anger that they never wanted to see you again, would you just leave - like that?

Eventually I just skimmed ahead and read the \\"secrets\\" and they were exactly what I had predicted they would be. About 2/3 into the book I just gave up reading every page and skimmed the rest of the story. Even skimming the book the story just went on and on and on. Why do authors think that their readers want to be tortured when reading a love story. Sure we want the couple to have to get through some obstacles before they find love, but we don't want the entire book to be filled with them.

In any other presidential book, one will see Neustadt's referred to quite often. As a realist, he describes the presidency not in terms of how it was designed by the framers. Neither does he describe the Constitutional process of accomplishing policy objectives. Neustadt explains that the truly effective president uses his position of authority to persuade others. FDR, Neustadt's shining example, knew how to work with people and get them to do his bidding. Downfall (and perhaps because I am no brain surgeon): but the book was sometimes tough to follow, hence it is often boring. Oh well, perhaps the true intellectuals will grasp it all. A DEFINITE FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO UNDERSTAND AMERICAN GOVT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outdated? Yes, But Still Sound","review":"Neustadt offers a view of presidential power. One that stresses the many informal resources that are at the disposal of each President. What each of these resources has in common is that they are best used to persuade others to follow the President's wishes. The President must persuade because they do not have many formal powers to require other actors to do what they want in very specific instances. Rather, the can reward these individuals for acting in a way that they favor, but they must rely upon informal tools to accomplish these goals. Rewards such as a ride on Air Force One or Presidential Box Seats at a National's game can be used as rewards to persuade other actors to follow the President. Neustadt presents this information in a way that is both accessible and scholarly, but not too intellectually relaxed as not to be useful for political scientists. Great example of a scholarly book being useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This album is amazing. Its melodic skate-punk the way it should be.

HD over air signals produce crystal clear images. The sound is adequate. System adjustments are simple, remote function is, as well. The unit generates a considerable amount of heat which is welcome in the winter, not so much in the summer. Cooling slots on the bottom discourage placing the unit on a solid surface. The unit arrived attached to the swivel stand. This stand utilizes a metal plate on the bottom. When swiveling the tv, burrs or protrusions on this plate caused scratches on whatever surface it was placed. It was a simple fix by using sandpaper to remove the burrs, but caused scratches on the floor when the unit was unpacked. Quite annoying. Also, finding an acceptable wall mount proved to be very difficult. Nevertheless, it is an awesome television with incredible color and sharpness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great picture, PIP not functional......","review":"Great picture and style.

This tv is a good investement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This unit is great. A couple of hints. 1, don't purchase those $129 6' cables, I got some from sears for $59.00 that are 10' long which produce a great picture, I mean really great. I did make the mistake of purchasing some cables on line which are 6'. They worked great, and for short money, but if you are going to wall mount the unit, you will probably need the 10' cables. If you are just mounting the unit on a table top, the 6' cables will do fine. If you want to buy some 6' cables cheep, contact me (atchemical1@aol.com). 2. You don't need the 1080P. At this time nothing is broadcast in 1080P, and there is nobody stating that it is the technology that will be the next standard. Look at the LNS4692D next to the LNS 4695 or 4696 on your next trip to circuit city. No diferance. Don't waste the $500 on the hope of getting a 1080P signal from your cable company.

I now have a $2200 paperweight.Bottom line: The TV has a great picture but is obviously very fragile. DO NOT get an extended warranty from BB. This and probably most any other \\"extended\\" warranty will only cover very technical problems, not easily cracked screens."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Complaints; awesome TV, awesome service","review":"The Amazon price was so much cheaper than everyone else, I was a little worried. The delivery was quick and perfect. I also inquired about the return policy, since I was worried I would have to pay for shipping if the TV was a dud. I was told that it would be returned at their cost.As to the TV, I did a ton of research before buying and decided this was the best TV for me. It was. Great picture, very bright [as LCDs should be]. The black levels aren't great on dark shows [like \\"24\\"], but I am not one of those video-phile nerds who cares. Bottom line is, this is the best TV for watching sports, which is about all I watch. I don't see the need for 1080p right now, nor in the next 3-5 years, so for me, this TV was perfect. No complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HD picture - standard def is worse than old tube","review":"After lots of research I decided on the LNS 4692.

I also ordered the peerless tilt mount. Mounting was easy and i am glad i got the tilt function. The picture with the hdmi cable in hd is perfect. The colors and the clarity right out of the box were breathtaking. This is why it doesn't get 5 stars. I have Long Island cablevision with the scientific atlanta 8300 hd dvr box. I hooked it up via hdmi cable and everything was fine,the picture in hd is scary its so clear. After 30 minutes picture went blank with \\"MODE NOT SUPPORTED\\" banner on screen. After talking with cable tech he said they are having many problems with certain tv's not recognizing the hdmi cable. His advice for now was to hook tv up via coaxial cable which i did. It works but picture quality isn't anywhere near as with the hdmi. As of now i don't know if this is a cablevision bug or Samsung's. If it is Samsungs the ratings going down. I'll post an update."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great TV - Poor Support - Beware R15","review":"I love this TV, it's a shame I can't use it.

Service visit scheduling should be approved \\" some time soon\\" according to Samsung customer care.

Finally we had a service rep come out for 200.00 but he only charged us 100.00. He told us that our T con board was broke and it would be 1200.00 dollars to repair. He then continued to tell us that that they didn't make the t con board for this TV anymore, so basically we should get a new tv or something comparable from samsung.

For one, there's no excuse for the sorry graphics on a PS2. They would've been acceptable on the first Playstation, but its downright terrible. The camera angles are not your friend. Everything else about this game is just stupid.But what do I know? I only played it for five minutes before I quit because I couldn't take it anymore. I drove all the way back to the video store and returned it within a half hour of renting it. Even if I didn't have the car, I would've walked the two miles just to get it out of my house.

I admit the graphics are very cheesy, but hey, graphics aren'y everything! Most of the attacks are pretty funny, but after the first few times they lose that sense. But they are still cool. The weopons are very cool. It has a better \\"hunting experiance\\" than my favorite PC game Aliens versus Predator 2: Gold Edition. It is fun, but the predator in first-person was kind of weird. However, Predator Concrete Jungle has a combination of third-person AND first-person is simply awesome. This game is worth the [...] I payed for it.

However, as promising as this game may appear, it is sadly disappointing. A choppy frame rate, muddy graphics, clumsy controls, and migraine inducing camera angles really ruin what could have been a great gaming experience, and the usage of the Predator's various abilities doesn't go as well as one might hope. Not to mention that once upon completion, there is practically no replay value whatsoever, and the game's story doesn't delve into the Predator mythology as much as it proclaims to. All in all, for Predator fans this game is worth a rental at best, but for the rest of us this is better left on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"For parents","review":"This game is very violent and gorey so if your worried about that kind of stuff, dont get it and if you dont trust me, heres some examples, you can skin people and hang them up by their ankles, skull people, chop them in half and etc. but if you don't mind that kind of stuff, get it because its pretty fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"how the predator got his groove back","review":"predator concrete jungle is a very fun game, first off. The plotline is thick, and well thought of, and the gameplay is spick and span( meaning it is very fun)especially because of the certain aspects of the game. for example, this game uses an engine called \\" RAGDOLL PHYSIQUE \\" if you do not know what this is, have an avid gamer tell you. the point is it is very fun to use, and a lot of the game is addictive ( in the good way) the problems are that the sound is a little shabby( especially the voiceovers) and pixels of the graphics could have been smaller( A.K.A -better-)watch out though, because this game contains nothing for children eyes ( drug use, violence and gore, hardcore language, and sexual content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator CJ","review":"Although this game looks awesome on the cover, it is painfully annoying and no fun at all to play. The game has no beginning plot and does not have one for the rest of the game. The camera controls are hard to deal with and the controls are very confusing to learn. Not even a die hard predator fan, like myself,would like this game. Personally, I think watching paint on a wall dry is more exciting. If you are really looking for a predator/alien game to play, I would reccomend Aliens vs. Predator 2. Otherwise DO NOT waste your money on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"post-Dumas rubbish","review":"This is a good example of the sort of rubbish that was written about Louis XIII and Richelieu in the 19th century (and which, sadly, survives in some quarters today).

I quickly realized how little ink life there is for this thing. The refills from stores were also way too costly. I have not used this printer all that much but have just realized that the sensor that detects that you have an ink cartridge loaded or not is not working. So it believes there is no ink cartridge in the slot when there actually is one with plenty of ink. The killer here is that if ANY ONE cartride is supposedly out of ink, you cannot do anything with this machine! So forget about using black till the color is refilled. All in all, this unit is a piece of junk and a waste of money.

For someone who is a magazine editor you would think she could do a better job of cutting this book in half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich people are boring...YAWN","review":"This book is too over-the-top madcap to enjoy. The author tries hard to be original and cheeky, but the result is that the prose is forced and obvious and the novel is one slow read. The most boring parts are the mother's diary and Fergus's imagined articles about himself. I skipped over most of that drivel. Who cares what happened back in the 70's in London? The reader wants to know what's happening NOW. Essentially, this book has no plot; it's just a bunch of unrelated scenes strung together. The characters are too farcical to be believed.Also, having lived in Akron at one time, I was disappointed that the book had so little sense of place. It could have happened anywhere. Oh yeah, and books about rich people are always boring, unless written by Sidney Sheldon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I saw this piece of trash in the clearance section of a used book store for $2. It isn't worth two cents. I opened the book at random and read a few sentences, and almost vomitted. The writing is horrid. I handed the book to a clerk and asked him to look through it. He had the same reaction. This is possibly the worst book ever written in the English tongue. Appalling. Horrid. Sickeningly inept.Painful. Vapid. Useless. Incompetent. Pointless. Worthless.

I only read audiobooks because reading for me is background atmosphere to most of my activities, so I think I will just write my own audiobook and self-record it.

From a distance it looks good and my pots and pans fit inside. If that weren't the case I would have given it a single star only. I was lucky--no missing parts or pieces. The stainless steel top had a slight dent in it but I assembled it to be on the opposite side so it's not visible unless you pull it out.

For hair like mine, it made it shiny, smooth, less frizzy, easier to manage, and just generally healthier. The moment I put it in my hair, I would leave it in for 5-10 minutes while I shaved or did something else, then brush through it without a problem. Rinsing it out, my hair felt like silk.

CD 1 is the real gem here and the tracklisting is flawless (sure it would have been nice to have album tracks like \\"New Gold Dream\\" or \\"Book of Brilliant Things\\" included as well as the early singles \\"Premonition\\" and \\"Changeling\\", but let's face it, this is way more complete than Glittering Prize and you can't complain about everything).CD 2 is compiled of weaker material in general, exception being the outstanding 1995 singles \\"She's a River\\" and \\"Hypnotized\\". Other than that it becomes very obvious that between 1979 and 1985 (CD 1) the Simple Minds were at the front of the pack, releasing some classic singles and albums that really mattered, while from 1989 on they tried to keep the momentum going in a changing musical climate with mixed results (CD 2)Worth 5 stars for CD 1 alone. Pick this one up. Fairly priced too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jon and Kate Plus 8 - Season 3","review":"I love this show. I have watched it every Monday.

What's most important, is that they never just 'phone it in'. Their offerings are always emotional, within the scope of the respective pieces and - for this old player, anyway - extremely satisfying. They are one of the few, I'll listen to the whole CD,, then go back and listen to a specific cut or two - again - in the: \\"Did I really hear what I thought I heard?\\" - mode.

Anyway, Samsung is one of the best so the TV has great picture quality and colors, it has a sleek and sophisticated look, it's lcd so there's no residual imaging, and on Amazon you can get a heck of a deal.

While I negotiated a good price for that TV, I still paid only $100 more for this 40\\" through Amazon - a great deal.The TV arrived on time and undamaged.

The construction is great too; it is pleasantly heavy and certainly appears and feels like it will last you a lifetime. The sad thing, though, and this prevented me replacing my worn, cheap student cookware with Bodum Chef peices (which I really wanted to do!) is that when I use this pan on my gas cooktop, even with a low heat (no flames licking the side), the handles get too hot to touch. Perhaps it's just this peice, because it's quite a small stock pot, but regrettably I deleted this stuff from my wish list. I wanted to buy their gorgeous pasta pot with strainer, and decided not to take the risk, because of my experience with this one.I would really urge the manufacturers to take another look at this aspect of the cookware and see if they can do anything about it, because it really is some nice looking, quality cookware."},{"rating":"1","title":"a shabby scrapbook","review":"Little Richard is such an important figure in 20th-century music that it is crucial that there be a biography of him out there. However, this biography is more a scrapbook than a polished work. Oftentimes, you can't tell when the author, Richard, or an acquaintance is speaking. There is no analysis of the events in Richard's life. This book pales in comparison to texts on Billy Strayhorn, Josephine Baker, etc. This book drags on about concert after concert after concert. Besides, Richard is in his homophobic phase at the time of the book's writing and there is no attempt to put his self-loathing into context. I needed to learn more about Richard, so I am glad this book exists. However, this was a poor piece of autobiography and I am surprised that the author did not take the time to fine tune his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking but True!","review":"The book gives a good insight into the wild life of Little Richard which rings true but is nonetheless shocking even for an open-minded reader.

I have the DVD-Video version of the concert and I would like to say I think they've spent more time on DVD-Audio perfecting it.

A 15 minute Cowgirl in the Sand opens-this song a young classic which hadn't been played in many years. Walk on, another lost Young classic appears for the first time since 1974. Other highlights include a 12 minute Jam on Words,a lovely rendition of \\"peace of Mind\\" from 1978's Comes a Time rcord and a scorching cover of All along the Watchtower with Chrisse Hyde of the Pretenders. Mainly a live album of vintage cuts from the 70's Young as always puts on an passionate performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, just horrible!","review":"Come on Neil! This is awful. Another terrible live recording shown in all it's misery on DVD-A. This is surround?

I will always remember Sturgis, S.D. circa 1993 when Neil played to a full concert house of bikers in Rapid City as the BEST concert I ever attended by any artist. Advice: forego this CD and listen to any of his earlier live concert recordings. Bring back Crazy Horse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Audience Recording","review":"This cd sounds like a really good audience recording (you can hear people shouting out Bruce Barry). However Neil Young overcomes the quality of the recording with such energetic performances of gems like \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" and \\"Words\\". \\"Fool for Your Love \\" is worth the price alone with Ben Keith's slide guitar. It's a worthy addition to any Neil fan's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless Compilation","review":"Weak arrangement of tour cuts.

However, this CD is lame at best. The performances are tired, the band(including Mr. Young) seems like they would rather be somewhere else, doing something else. You can get much better quality versions of these classic Neil Young tunes on other recordings. The five channel aspect of this recording is almost non-detectable.

It gives an up close and personal view of what the priesthood is like for so many that have answered God's call for their lives!I no longer think of the priesthood as a \\"lonely\\" life.....this book has proven what \\"fulfilled\\" lives these men lead and that they truly do have lives in addition to their ministries of preaching, counseling, administrating parishes, performing weddings,funerals, baptisms, Holy Communions and Confirmations!What an inspirational read, especially for those interested in vocations, young and old alike!

I wanted something consoling, helpful, informative, and imbued with my Roman Catholic faith. This book didn't do it for me. I found it to be mostly psych talk with Scripture and references to certain Church teachings thrown in. My other question/concern about it is that I can't figure out the author - is he Catholic? This book title says \\"Catholic\\" in it, he refers to himself as a \\"priest\\" in the introduction; but within the book, he refers to The Book of Common Prayer (from the Anglican church) and the bio at the end of the book says he's an Episcopalian. What gives?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I am not rating this review low because it should not have been made; which is a different discussion for another time. It is low because how it was written. I can try and explain to someone who has never been to church or seen a church about church, I can present pictures, I can give detailed drawings about HOW it works and how its done. But that person still will not know what its like to be there, to actually experience church. Same is true with this. Yes, is it accurate on how things work, for the most part (albeit the author does talk about \\"contemporary\\" Sun Dances, which are different than Traditional). Again, without discussing why that is important as that is another topic for another time. The book gives the HOW a dance is done, but it doesn't explain the why or the what. The most important is the why and the what. It gives people a FALSE understanding of Sun Dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, disturbing and completely mesmerizing","review":"Imagine a modernized Brothers Grimm tale for adults. Perfect for anyone that loved The Manchurian Candidate or Jacob's Ladder. Wallace leads the reader into Poland as well as a forgotten Hamelin to face the horrors of war, a mysterious disease, and a town under siege. Gruesome and gripping, Wallace cuts to the heart of the Pied Piper tale and exposes the frightening truth--the Piper is here to save us from ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging to the end","review":"This book was captivating from the beginning, and the author creates an eerie sense of anticipation that builds as the story unfolds.For parents encouraging young teenage children to build their reading and reasoning abilities, this book could be quite an exciting challenge. The author has sufficient command of the power of language that he didn't have to stoop to using \\"strong\\" language to cover his own weakness. The few love scenes are fairly discreet as well.The only small criticism I have is that the ending is not quite as surprising as the author would have us believe. Imagine sitting through a very well structured talk, only to have the conclusion be something a bit more obvious than you might have expected. Enjoyable all the same. If Mr. Wallace has more books out, I expect to read another soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Single Likable Character In This Book","review":"You can read well written descriptions of the dual plots of this novel from other reviewers, so I will share what I believe to be its weaknesses.There is not a single likable character in either plot. Wallace's moving descriptions of the despair and squalor found throughout every scene is dulled from a lack of attachment to any character. Creepy and bloodthirsry? Sure. Yawn.The two plots do not weave together seamlessly. Both plots went into fascinating detail that make me want to read up more on the 30 years war. And there were some red herrings- notably about rye and argot- that were tantilizing. But the book's conclusion about the 'rat inside all of us' waiting to revert to baser instincts was a real letdown.If you are an admirer of loose ends, insufficiently fleshed out characters, and anti-heroes, you will find much to praise.If you are like me, you will not toss this book aside lightly, but will fling it with great force."},{"rating":"2","title":"A companion to your alternative medicine treatment...","review":"If you use alternative means of health practices, this book will assist you and your practitioner in guiding your care.

Roman's insight into contemperary young urban \\"professionals\\" is at once fascinating and repelling. His two characters are revealed variously as effuse, maudlin, furtive, magnanimous, nervously open, vengeful and, in the end, comfortably unimaginative. Roman's essay is chock a block with the same type of simian-like chatter disguised as conversation that we have all heard ourselves make--much to our later horror and secret embarrassment, which makes her (or his) insights all the more entertaining, valuable and personal to each reader.

I have also mixed in a teaspoon of cinnamon with just water and the vanilla protein and it is good as well.Another plus is that it uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners such as sucralose or aspartame.If you can't handle Whey/Casein protein then I would absolutely recommend this one (even if you can but want to try something else). Best bang for your buck compared to other egg proteins and the taste is actually good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for lactose intolerant and delicious too!","review":"My 23-year old son is lactose intolerant. He needed a protein powder to supplement since he boxes and cycles alot! We decided to try this because of the egg protein. Not only is this powder kind to his digestive system but it also tastes delicious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible taste!!","review":"Well I have tried many protein shakes and the taste is never been a problem for me but this was just horrible. It's GOOD for YOU but I just couldn't do it. It might be a good protein shake but it's extremely salty, i tried to drink it with other liquids to help the taste but every time it tasted worse and worse =( too bad because I was looking forwards to see some results!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's in this stuff?","review":"What's in this stuff? Where's the list of ingredients?I don't eat anything unless I know and approve of what's in it.For example, although this product's description says it contains no sugar, it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners, which are also bad for you.For one thing, aside from tasting awful, artificial sweeteners often cause horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea.In addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises (e.g: \\"natural\\" cane juice, fruit juices, \\"raw\\" sugar, \\"organic\\" sugar, etc.), I also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind.So, what's in this stuff?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"The protein powder is ok, not to good as i expected. if you pour hot milk over it will will form substance like egg white, which is very bad in taste, not at all drinkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes DISGUSTING but great protein","review":"I bought the Strawberry Passion and it tastes absolutely DISGUSTING.

Sometimes a story can change the way you live your life. I wish I could say the same about Chains of the Sea. The was almost the worst piece trash I've ever read. The worse being so bad that I will not mention it's name. A good book should make you care for the characters. I can honestly say after reading this piece of drek that I do not give a damn about Tommy, his mother, his little friends, or anyone else in this book. The only thing I can say about this book is I wish I had the 2 hours of my life back that took to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pandora's Pablum","review":"This book is an appalling, hyperbole-laden, utterly misinformed assault on the scientific basis of environmental regulation. It reflects the growing anti-science trend that is masquerading as the \\"democratization\\" of science. It is an unfortunate example of how science can be deceptively manipulated to make seemingly reasonable policy arguments. The author not only fails to acknowledge the tremendous gains that have been made in environmental quality since the environmental regulations he deplores have been put in place, he also fails to acknowledge the tremendous work done by others to move towards a more \\"holistic\\" strategy to control chemical contamination. This book is dishonest, misleading, and pious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chlorine - not a poison but a benefit","review":"The author appears to have a distinct anti-science bent. But without chlorine and science, you would find yourself living without medicine, clean water, bulletproof vests, and the list goes on. Moreover, the author gives no viable alternatives to replace all the benefits of chlorine. If I had not been made to read the book, I wouldn't have wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's What He Leaves Out That Hurts","review":"This is an ambitious book that has a lot to teach us, but it is flawed by what the author chose to hide from his audience. For example, he fails to report the dramatic decline in human exposure to toxins during the past 20 years; the major methodological flaws in research he cites as \\"proof\\" of a negative effect on human health from exposure to background levels; the very tenuous and often false assumptions that lie behind his proposed \\"new paradigm\\" (and the fact that this paradigm isn't new at all, but standard fare for many years from Greenpeace and other anti-technology voices); and more. I give Thornton credit for admitting his anti-corporation and pro-government biases at the outset and, at the end, calling for a socialist reorganization of the U.S. economy and higher education. Discerning readers will recognize just how far from the intellectual mainstream Thornton and this book are. I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Was very disappointed when I got this package. I thought I was ordering a CD-ROM and discovered that it was a floppy disk.

Yes, there is some excess vibrato in the voice, and occasionally there're minor pitch problems. Yet, to hear such a grand voice sailing and soaring through Strauss's rich orchestration with imperious might is a unique experience that other singers can't provide. Thomas's Menalaus is suitably heroic and the other roles are well-filled. Krips conducts with a sure hand. Although the recording is made in live conditions more than 30 years ago, the sound is quite good. I found this recording very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"too incomplete to satisfy","review":"Strauss' much neglected masterpiece Aegiptische Helena is finally available once again, but BMG does the buying public no service in releasing these cds wihtout enclosing a libretto.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive disposable pool","review":"i would not recommend this pool. we purchased this pool last june for our daughters and while last year they had a great time in it. this year we set up the pool and everything went well until the next morning we woke up and the top ring was completely deflated. called the 800 # and was told the only thing to do is apply soap water and search for leak. well did it and cannot find leak.obviously a slow leak somewhere but so small no way to find it. so yes this pool is easy to set up, but 90 days after you purchase this pool beware no more warranty and your on your own,almost wish we purchased the pool with aluminum walls now ,because with that kind of pool little more work but no worrys about holes and deflating pool walls. and no help from intex the manufactuer.so for the price we paid we got use out of this pool for 1 year.do not buy this product unless you dont care about throwing money away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Set Pool by Intex","review":"After reading other reviews ... we decided to buy an Easy Set Pool. We are very disappointed with the pool. It is no where near 30\\" high! I have an average sized seven year old and the water comes up to her knee. Needless to say, we are very sorry we bought this pool. They made it sound like it was a pool for the whole family, at best is is an okay kids pool, but far from worth the money that we paid for it. You would be better off with one of those big blow up pools for 1/4 the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Read","review":"This book was by far the most horrid attempt at historical academic work I've ever read. Not to mention the fact that the author is one of the coldest, most mean-hearted men alive, historical ignorance and remedial writing ability permeate this mind-numbing tome. Definitely not a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to the real thing...","review":"Who hasn't heard of Jacques Brel (1929-1978) the extraordinary Belgian signer/songwriter. Lama has! His early work even tries to emulate Brel's style (he will eventually find his own). It comes as no surprise, then, that he wanted to sing Brel's beautiful songs. The problem is that Lama comes short.Don't get me wrong, I love Serge Lama... when he sings is own songs. I even own is entire work (see \\"ame a nue - l'integrale\\" 12 CDs box set). But, not many people (if any!) can sing Brel. Lama is no exception. Even the song selection leaves to desire.In short, if you are looking for good material by Serge Lama, check out: \\"Collection: Femme Femme Femme\\" [IMPORT].If you would like to discover Jacques Brel, go for: \\"Ne Me Quitte Pas\\" [IMPORT]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!","review":"Blue's vocals are really good and this single reveals it aptly.

This is the true boyband with an edge and attitude!~"},{"rating":"2","title":"this album rocks.","review":"first of all i would like to say how surprised i am that blue still have not made it big in america. anyways, i bought the 2nd album before i bought this one. comparatively, i liked this one better because in the 2nd album, most of the songs have the same tempo and beat. it gets kinda repetative. i liked all rise because it had more nice slow-fast songs like \\"if you come back\\" and \\"girl i'll never understand\\"...i would also like to say that if you like all rise, you should buy one love, despite the fact that there are many repetetive buys. it is a well-worth piece of shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Story with Beautiful Illustrations","review":"This is the story of a bear cub that copies his mother in everything she does. The illustrations are absolutely wonderful, and the story is heart-warming. My son (2 1/2) loves this book and asks me to read it over and over. It shows a son learning from his mother by doing what she does, and a nice mother-son bond. Being a mother of two boys, I appreciate such a loving story written and illustrated in a way that strikes a child's interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I was very dissapointed with these earrings. Had purchased them as a February birthday gift but bought something else instead. The stones looked dull, color was more pink than purple and one post was bent out of shape. Lesson learned: I won't be ordering jewelry online again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price...","review":"The order was listed as new but I agree with the previous reviewer. The box(s) clear plastic was a little damaged and the box(s) do not look brand new. Personally, I don't mind if the box is a little damaged as long as the contents are new and not damaged. I ordered this for my wife, who loves Wizard of Oz and thought it would be a nice addition to our Christmas decorations. I haven't taken them out of the box yet but, mine do not look as dingy and dirty as the last reviewer mentioned.I recently went visited a Christmas store and each Nut Cracker was selling for $25 a piece. $100 for the set of 4. I think it's a great deal given you get all 4 for roughly $25.3/31/2011 - It has now been several months since my purchase and there is one issue that I see with the paint. The paint on the Dorothy nutcracker is flaking off of the legs. I suppose I could try and match the colors and repaint the areas that are flaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty!","review":"I ordered this for my sister who collects nutcrackers and loves the wizard of oz. All in all it is very cute but I purchased what I thought was a NEW nutcracker. Everything about both the doll and the box suggests that it is old and has been used. Her face and hands are dirty and her hair has dust and other unknown particles. The box looks dirty and tore up. The seller lists the item as new but I'm not so sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"terry bozzio's chamber music","review":"I think we can all agree (with the other reviewers) that this is not a rock album. If you have ever heard Frank Zappa's album Orchestral Favorites with Terry Bozzio on drums, this is kind of like Bozzio's follow-up to that. Bozzio's orchestral drumming is superb on both albums. Reccomended for fans of GOOD drumming and/or people who enjoyed Orchestral Favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little out there","review":"Renowned rock drummer meets established orchestra; the combination works on an eccentric level, but on a casual level, not so much. I'm sure that drum aficionados will appreciate Bozzio's unique approach to his drum work here, but the songs are so long and drawn out (and far from rock), that they tend to lose their appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insane!","review":"it takes a skilled, insane man to be able to gather, blend, and mix these tracks together all so seamlessly and yet make you stand at attention and LISTEN WHILE SHAKIN' your money maker. damn! now, i'm sorry i missed him when he passed through town last week. who would've thought? portishead and funky breaks and beats? next only to norman cook (or perhaps had in hand with norman) this man is able to make disparate sounds come together. i mean, come on! peggy lee and grandmaster flash holding court together in one disc? buy this album if you're looking to be arrested by a plethora of sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd was awesome","review":"This cd has some great music on it, it's definetly worth a listen. I haven't heard the originals, so I can't say I know what exactly was done to them, but even if DJ Andy only picked them out and crossfaded one to the next (I know he did more than that, but this is for examples sake), I'd still give him props for pickin' out some phat tracks and layin' 'em down in good order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a collections of songs...","review":"Albiet a decent one. This is basically a mix tape of songs that are in no way mixed up. No cuts, no scratched. Songs just fade away and then a new one starts. It's hard to figure how this guy is a DJ. The songs are cool, but who wants the James Gang? Not a bad introduction to some classic hip hop and artists that have been plundered for samples (like the Meters). This is what happens when you are portishead-obsessed and want to buy anything/everthing Portishead related."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Just not a very good movie. I love football, and enjoyed parts of the movie, but overall neither my wife nor I enjoyed it all that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, couldn't stay focused on it","review":"This was a boring movie. It seemed like not enough was happening. I like George Clooney, but not in period pieces, and I like John Krasinski, but apparently he is best in \\"The Office\\" because none of his movies have been any good. Renee Zellweger overacted. I kept drifting away while this was on to vacuum or wash dishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, partly because I think George and Rene are great actors. The chemistry between them in this movie is classic. I love the witty, fast paced, sarcastic dialogue between the two of them. If you like movies like \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" or the kind of fast paced humor in the Ocean's movies, then I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this. And it was fun to see Jim from \\"The Office\\" play a bit different role."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???","review":"I was looking forward to a fun comedy about the early days of Professional Football and I got... um, what?I am a fan of John Krasinski and Stephen Root, but not even they could bring life to this movie that seemed to be full of twists that weren't fun but just leaving me with the feeling of \\"What?\\"I didn't find any of the characters appealing, nor worth carrying about it. Actually, I got to the point of wanting to fast forward it to the end just so that I could say that I watched it from beginning to end, but I did. I'm glad that I only rented it and didn't buy it like I had intended to do.There are other things I could say about this film, but I won't. I'll leave that to you who watch it.The good is bad and the bad is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful - incompatible with many DVD players","review":"Sometimes a product review is needed instead of a movie review. This is one of those times. This review is about the product - a DVD that is supposed to have a playable movie on it.I never managed to watch Leatherheads because the DVD has some type of new DRM (digital rights management) that is incompatible with my DVD player. It isn't an old player either. I've received and sent back 4 different Leatherheads DVDs with netflix. Once I finally researched it a bit I found the truth. It's an intentionally crippled product. I don't feel like getting a new player every time a studio decides to alienate the public.So, if you buy this thing, keep the receipt and test it pronto. Even if you aren't going to watch it right away. See if it works in your player. You may need to get a different movie for that night at home.Beware buying this as a gift for anyone. They'll politely smile as they ask if you saved the receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"It's lousy. Don't waste your time. It does not work on many levels.

The script is so lame after about 1/2 hour you just don't care anymore. I shut it off about 3/4 of the way through because I couldn't take it anymore. It really doesn't deserve anymore of a review than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leather Movie","review":"\\"Put together a beatiful girl, a handsome guy, a popular sport, the roaring twenties, some witty comments and people will come to see it, there is no need to worry about anything else.\\" This seems to be what writer, director and producer thought when launching this movie. One even has the impression they did not even have a clue of what they were doing. Is it a comedy, a sports movie, a satire about sports and journalism... ? It could have been many things, had somebody taken care of it, but left completely to itself, the movie is... nothing. There are some strokes of a story that could have been funny, some situations and ironies that could have provided the basis for a good satire, historical hints about the development of one of the most popular sports in America, but everything hangs loose and disconnected. Fortunately, I did not have to pay a cent to see it. I saw it during a long flight back from Asia. The positive side of it is that it helped me to get asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Don't Have to Be a Football Fan to Enjoy This Movie!","review":"I enjoyed watching \\"Leatherheads\\" as it contained good acting by all cast members, wonderful costuming, great cinematography, witty dialogue and good storyline/screenplay.The only downside was that it was a slowing moving movie overall. Otherwise a very well down movie. I enjoyed the fact that you didn't have to be a football fan to enjoy watching \\"Leatherheads\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old School Humor","review":"I thought this movie was pretty good.

However, the actual edition was quite disappointing. For one thing, it is so small (3\\" x 3\\") that it is very hard to read, the pictures are hard to see. The reviews on the website implied that it was the full set of stories, with adventures about goblins. Indeed, the back of the book has an excerpt talking about goblins. However, the subset of letters in the actual book has none of the stories dealing with goblins! The stories that are there are nice, but often disjointed because they refer to previous years' events that are past, and there are too few stories, and the pictures are too small. If I had seen this book in a bookstore, I would not have bought it, but it was difficult to judge over the internet. I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful quality and acting","review":"This film is very low budget. Not the italian \\"gore\\" film it appears to be. Terrible acting and awful shooting,grainy and imbalanced. The only thing scary about this low grade film is the actors look like they got hit with the ugly stick. Includes VERY unforgettable nudity. Trust me,the image is still burned into my head. You don't want to find out what I mean,just stay away. This DVD is not worth fifteen bucks hell it's not even worth the ten bucks I just wasted.

The Jewish lawyer is a boring character whom the actor tries to portray as a broody, pseudo-witty do-gooder but comes off rather lame. (SPOILER WARNING:) The ending is borderline cheesy as the neo-Nazi criminal \\"finds the light\\" when he reads his victim's letter and realizes that he speaks like a (rather clichéd) Buddha. Sure, you can convert an angry, violent, hate-filled fascist at the drop of a bat by getting an Indian guy to write him some nice words, did you know?

There's only a little tie at the back of the neck and because the chest/belly part was very roomy the material tended to balloon and so everything from my shoulders to my lower back was bare to the elements...A bit more material wouldve done nicely in the bum/crotch area - this tended to pull tight when bending over or sitting down.The foot is basically a shoe cover secured with an elastic band.So unless you are prepared to put in a zipper or to get someone to stich you into the garment - might be a wiser idea to look elsewhere for a Thing costume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work on MAC","review":"I brought this as a gift because a friend wanted clip art for her classroom, but it doesn't work on MAC (Apple Computers) at all.

The orchestra and chorus are fully up to the virtuoso demands Beethoven makes and Aler and Miles are among the handful of modern performers who do full justice to their parts.I have recently acquired the Zinman recording on Arte Nova and prefer it to this one. Although the bass and tenor are inferior to Miles and Aler, the soprano, Luba Organasova, is marvelous and the orchestra (Tonhalle Orch. Zurich) and chorus are a notch better than Norrigton's. In addition, that performance has more nuance and personality, while still being in the same \\"historically informed\\" camp as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"would never buy again!","review":"I used this product for a year and a half and felt as though it was filled with weed growth!

The Fiercer Heart is not a book I would typically seek out, but I happened to see the jacket cover at the library, and decided to try it. Being a native of Louisville, I was especially drawn into the story after finding out that one family of characters were from my city, and several chapters were set in familiar areas. It was also fascinating to discover that the characters were real, and the story was constructed around old diaries and letters from the family. Ms. Gilchrist has done a wonderful job in transporting the reader back in time. The 1800's is an era I do not know much about, but the author describes in vivid detail so well you truly feel like you're there. By the end (well, way before the end of the book) you're rooting for the characters, and feel emotionally moved at times (also something that does not usually happen to me!). I've recommended this book to my book club as well as several friends -- and am hoping they love it as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"The Fiercer Heart: A Novel of Love and ObsessionIt was for my daughter who loves the book.

It is bizarre and adorable at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"OverHype","review":"The claymation was poorly executed using plastic figures for most of the frames. My son and his 5th grade friends did the same thing for a class project with a better script and 12 minutes long, perfect for this medium. Panic becomes tired and boring after 5 minutes, nothing original. Using plastic and clay to perform ordinary things is not art, it's tedious, boring and redundant. Stick to Ardman or Vinton if you like claymation. Not worth buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids!","review":"My kids love Wallace and Grommit. So when I saw this on the shelf I thought it might be worth a try. I had never heard of it before. The first viewing of the movie was with an eight year old boy, 2 five year old boys and 3 grown ups. My eight year old son provided the subtitle translation to the youngest viewers. I'm not kidding when I say that there was spontaneous laughter from ALL age groups at the SAME time. This little film is VERY VERY FUNNY. It will suck you in parents, don't think you can put this on for your kids and turn away, it will certainly get your attention. I thoroughly recommend this movie. I am going to have to buy it. It has been requested everyday since renting. Love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. Just...wow.

This is unlike anything else they have every seen. It reminds me of old time Gumby animated shows. But the story, characters, voices are so much better. There are so many things out of left field with this little flick, you never know what's going to happen next. Good for both boys and girls. Ages 8-14 I think. There's a lot going on throughout this movie, so multiple viewings is a must. The only thing kids might not be used to is the subtitles. But mine have watched all the fun Japanese animes and are used to them. And maybe they pick up a little French here and there...

But, photogs are by nature visual, and if you hate wading through the boring printed owners manual (like I did anyway), this DVD is a great way to get up and running with the camera. Some people learn and retain video better than print. It is well done and interesting. It is also the only intro to the D200 that addressed the need to establish a pre-shot routine to ensure all of the settings would work for the shot. Maybe advanced amateurs do this in their sleep, but a beginner like me needed someone to show me how to do this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent explanation of the D200","review":"Warning, This is a beginners guide. I bought it, because it would teach my partner, how to get the most from the D200.It gave a decent explanation of the basic photographic workings, like depth of field. It did the job better than I ever could, because she could rewind and see it again.

I was apprehensive to get this CD due to the absence of a track listing and the abundance of \\"Flash\\" titles over the years. I finally bit the bullet and bought it. It was a good move.

Alice Cooper in his prime doing \\"I'm Flash\\", Jim Dandy of Black Oak Arkansas doing \\"Country Cooking\\" Elkie Brooks doing \\"Trapped\\", John Entwistle playing bass throughout the album. If these folks would have got together for a serious outing it would be thought of as a classic rather than \\"Quirky\\".Avery pleasant surprise to me was \\"What's Happening\\" by James Dewer (of Robin Trower), one of the best ballads about unrequited love I can think of, with the great line \\"If I try for all time you will never be mine, but I will always be yours\\"Although this album has slipped into obscurity over the years, if you feel like something fun and different, this is one to get and keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun CD","review":"I am just glad this came out on CD.

In fact, the Sprint Store tech guy's recommendation was \\"tear it off, it's not really needed anyway\\".

Colin Farrell is brilliant as the lead character, Paz Vega is luminous as his wife, and the supporting cast does a great job. But the sparkling chemistry is between Farrell and the oh-so-accomplished Christopher Lee, who appears well into the film but is worth the wait. This is a graphic film and not easy to watch. Even so, although war is hell, it also is not exactly clinical depression. There seems to be a subtle lack of lift in the screenplay and direction. There are too few places where a smile and a sense of beauty break through. Even so, this is a dense drama that is well played, nicely filmed and worth watching more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"maturing talent of Colin Farrell","review":"This is an excellent film abour war zone photo-journalism, and is Colin Farrell's best role to date. He is maturing as an actor; going deeper and deeper into character. The appearance of legendary actor, Christopher Lee, is also a plus. Highly recommend this for serious film buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"Triage is a solid, thought provoking film set amongst the world of photo journalism in war torn countries. Whilst to the public their material is often just a news article or photo to peruse whilst reading the morning newspaper the toll it takes on these journalists to bring these stories to life is much darker and their plight often overlooked in the name of sensationalism. Triage examines the human experience of working in hostile environments and the repercussions of such actions. All the performers are great but as usual it is a much thinner than usual Colin Farrell who really shines here, filling his reporter with strength, weakness and tragedy to really capture the essence of a man truly torn apart by what he has witnessed and what he has done. Its a shame films like this slip through the cracks and end up straight in the back corners of video rental shops and retail outlets whilst shallow big budget dross appears at cinemas across the country regularly. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"This movie is an honest look at trauma and war. The actors do an amazing job portraying the complexities of just how painful processing trauma, war, and loss can be. So very good.

Yes, war is hell, but so is bad acting and writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible Pieces","review":"Totally implausible as follows:(1.) Cheesy, superficial acting on all parts. It seemed like actors were pretending to be roles they had no feel for, e.g. the terrorist/freedom fighters; the photographers; wives; the physician; the psychiatrist/confessor.(2.) Cheap and low budget - filmed mostly in hospital, living room, restaurant and a few acres of semi-brushy desert with a fake cave.(3.) Script and editing seemed rushed and insecure. The flashback technique to fill in the story just didn't work. The denouement showing a few seconds of someone with their legs blown off; screaming \\"I don't want to die!\\" and being carried piggyback style seemed more comical than such an important moment deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"tom hanks comedy favourites","review":"I never much liked DRAGNET but i bought the package because i love the BURBS and the MONEY PIT.Tom Hanks has a special way of doing comedy and i think he is just awesome"},{"rating":"1","title":"What are they trying to pull?????","review":"I just recently bought this product and disc one is fine!!!

Small passages from well known sources are intermingled with the authors' personal views that seem to twist the story into glorification of the Federal army and not necessarily what was witnessed by children.

For me they opened my eyes to the complexity and heterogeneous environment of the antebellum south.If you want a great reference for this period of history look no further! If you want to find out more on the antebellum south and the reasons for the Civil War, look no further!

A skillful use and analysis of contemporary debates and even personal correspondence makes this a definitive work on the long slide of the fragile Union towards civil war over the one non-negociable issue it faced during its early years. This book is highly recommended, with its sibling, for the reader who wishes to understand (even if they disagree with) the southern view during the years before the Civil War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!!","review":"This book should *only* be read by those who are already well educated on all the issues it covers.

The cover makes it \\"look\\" interesting, but looks are deceiving in Freehling's case. His writing style is downright weird--he intersperses what seem to be fictional accounts with his actual history, and uses strange colloquialisms that no serious historian would ever even think of putting into a scholarly publication (I mean, who even says \\"blackassed?\\") I had to read this book for a history graduate course in fall 2002, and it was hated by all in the class (even the professor), except the sole southerner.

While I admire the parents and their willingness to share this story, it is the courage of the woman, the star of Curtain Call-Dee Dee Fields-that impacted me most.

It's a rather small book (compared to the giant size computer books normally seen). The chapters are arranged in the same format as the test, four major sections: Media and Topologies, Protocols and Standards, Network Implementation, and Network Support. This edition of the book is current to the 2005 objectives as stated by CompTIA.All in all, this book is a cram guide.

Reid Collins' narrative is straight forward and consise. The only flaw is the supposed KBOX Report \\"at the moment the motorcade is fired upon\\". The KBOX material is actually a recreation recorded AFTER November 22nd by the reporters who were there. The simulation was done because the original KBOX tapes were thought lost and unavailable for use. Everything on the CD is authentic.

But why?Henry isn't prepared for what's to come from a stain on the outside of his house. It brings people together, instills faith and belief, and even gets Henry romantically involved with a neighbor, all despite the fact he's not happy with all of this happening at his house.

The story moves so slowly and it has a 100% script-o-matic ending which you can predict from about 10 seconds after the movie starts. The only reason I kept watching this movie is because part of me was really hoping to see Ashon Kutcher pop out at the end and shout: \\"You've been Punked!\\". Sadly this was not the case, instead it follows the direct arrow of a plotline from where it began and Henry Poole finds Jesus and is magically cured of \\"fatal illness\\". Luke Wilson however plays an excellent skeptic but as soon as he turns to believer, all of the acting magic is gone.All in all it feels like someone just forced out a formulaic feel good movie and added in a little Jesus so it would make it's numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I missed something on this one.","review":"I really, really wanted to like Henry Poole. I tried, really, really hard. It just didn't work for me. It felt artificially \\"arty\\" and contrived, and utterly formulaic. A threadbare (but not bad) idea stretched out endlessly (or so it felt). It's a talented cast, a decent story, but for me none of the elements coalesced into a whole, unnecessarily lending the performances by the actors a \\"Hush, I'm acting over here\\" kind of self-importance that a genuine ensemble film can't withstand.I'm open minded, however, and in reading enough positive (some very much so) reviews on this little film, I may give it another choice. Sometimes attitude, mood, timing and other \\"outside\\" elements can affect how we see things (sometimes?) and I DID want to like this. We'll see. We'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rather corny movie","review":"This is unrealistic and quite predictable. The guy in them movie was rather depressed and wanted to be left alone, yet complete strangers/neighbors went out of their way to help him. I doubt this would happen in east LA where people tend to keep to themselves especially when new (weirdo's) move in next door.I didn't think the acting was all that dynamic and the love story aspect was not developed to its full potential. It tried to be a comedy at times, but I didn't find it humorous. It may be a great inspiration to those who believe in miracles, but I didn't fall for it.About 1/2 way thru the movie the sound track was delayed slightly from the video and was even more difficult to watch.The 2 page note from director Mark Pellington included in the DVD was rather touching and gives you his perspective on the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I hadnt heard much about this movie, except it had Luke Wilson in it. I decided to give it a try. Heading into the almost empty theater, I left pleased. It starts us with Luke Wilson buying a house and not caring about the price because he \\"wont be here very long anyway.\\" We dont understand that at first. A few neighbors come by to check on him, and his realtor Cheryl Hines even shows up to tell him about repairs, which again he doesnt care because he wont be there for long. It is the beautiful next door neighbors daughter that will finally bring him out of his shell, bring his troubles and concerns to the surface and admit to his past pain. It is a brilliant film that while it does mix some with religion it doesnt create itself as the main point of the film. All of the actors did a great job, including his nosy next door neighbor that refuses to leave him alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Here","review":"After reading this book, I can understand the negative reviews. There is nothing particularly interesting about either the author or his alleged story.

He didn't find one, but somehow managed to foist his non-story upon a gullible publisher anyway. Thompson tries to convince readers that he was in some sort of \\"danger\\" while on his \\"undercover\\" mission, but fails miserably. His threadbare \\"expose'\\" reveals that the Klan is a pathetically small, virtually powerless group of misfits and fanatics (which we knew), and that David Duke uses racial slurs (no surprise there, either). In other words, Thompson simply wasted his time, and attempts to waste the reader's time as well. Jerry Thompson is no Stetson Kennedy - this book is pure junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dud!","review":"Add me to the list of readers who couldn't find any redeeming value in this sorry excuse for a book. Mr. Thompson had nothing of value to say, but somehow managed to have this slice of tripe published.

Mr. Thompson should be profoundly ashamed of this steaming heap of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Story?","review":"The idea of an undercover investigation of the KKK is a sound one, and I opened this book with the expectation that some new and startling facts would be uncovered. Unfortunately, however, I discovered the same fact as the previous reviewers, which is that there is no story here at all. A would-be journalist sets out to infiltrate the modern-day Klan, but apparently fails to find a story worthy of being published. This book merely confirms what the majority of Americans already know, which is that the KKK is a group of misfits and losers. It is also painfully evident that Jerry Thompson is just as big a loser as those he attempted to investigate; however, the biggest losers of all are the unfortunate readers who wasted the time and effort to read this boring pile of trash. Mr. Thompson should have stayed awake during journalism classes, if he even bothered to attend them in the first place. This book is pure crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Bore","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer.

There is no real hint of danger, especially from an organization which, from the description given by the author, was frequently unable to muster enough members to conduct an initiation ceremony or hold regular meetings. Given the non-existent threat from a skeleton organization made up of a handful of nuts and rejects, Thompson's story amounts to nothing. It is incredible that his newspaper was willing to back such a fruitless project (or that they were willing to hire him as a reporter in the first place), and even more incredible that any publisher would bother putting this pile of crap into print. The only thing Thompson exposed was his utter lack of talent. I regret having wasted my time reading this lousy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much story, but stills tells us something","review":"The critique of this book that it has no real story, is solid. Thompson merely flirted with the Klan, found nothing new out, and talks mostly about finding apartments and building cabinets. HOWEVER, the most interesting thing is the fact that the Klan he found in the \\"hotbed\\" of Klan activity in Alabama (the US even) was disorganized and almost nonexistent. This is what he should have been talking about. He should have written about how the Klan in popular consciousness is a large, ever-present organization. I get this opinion from classmates who are afraid to move to rural areas, for fear of \\"the Klan.\\" When in fact the Klan is a much smaller organization with little power anymore, save the power to draw media attention. The name still has power, but that is all that has power anymore. I wish Thompson would have taken this fact and turned it back on the media to show their baseless sensationalism and irrational fears for what they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference book for all your conspiracy needs.","review":"If you are like me and are fasinated by the origins and history of conspiracy theories then this book is for you. The author trys to maintain an objective viewpoint and weighs the evidence before evaluating a given theory.Although he sometimes does advocate for the validity of a theory, it is never overbearing and ultimatly the author leaves it up to the reader to decide whether a theory is sound.The Encyclopedia covers all major Conspiracy theories including JFK, Illumanti/ New World Order, 9/11 conspiracies and chemtrails to name a few.It also covers lesser known conspiracies and various real and imagined plots against various government throughout history.Some might feel the book does not go deep enough into each individual theory. However given the amount of material covered it is understandable.A wealth of knowledge in the paranoid aspects of politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on parenting from a biblical perspective.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gives good insight on raising children. As a father, I have seen how putting these principles into practice has improved my relationship with my children. I have also seen how each one of my children's behavior has improved. It has given me insight on giving vision to my children. The four key areas he deals with are vision, discipline, stewardship, and relationships. His concepts are rooted strongly in the Bible. My only criticism would be that I would have liked to see a bibliography at the back of the book to further enhance my parenting skills. (He names books in each chapter and footnotes them but I think it is more accessible having a bibliography in the back of the book.) I give this book 5 stars and highly recommend it for parents of children of all ages!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Sounds Good","review":"A dam good collection.

This is a good one, but so are many others. The principles in this book and others should really be taught in school, because they are more valuable than math or english grammer for attaining sucess in life. Of course all of these sucess books are very similar. Set a goal, repeat your goals to yourself every day and keep working until you reach your goals .

Same points and no mention of the other meatier material that is in the book. Nothing wrong with listening to an abridged version of tapes, I do it myself, as long as you clarify.And with all due respect, I think you send out the wrong message by referring to Brian Tracy as a pumper \\"Cheerful Coaching\\" instead of a trainer. And I really don't understand what you mean when you say this book is more about how to get everything you want than achieving goals.

Such authors also irresponsibly repeat the myth that we only use 10% of our brains. Pure fantasy. Steven Covey repeated that one in First Things First. It's getting tiresome when I fact-check these self-help gurus and 90% of the time discover that their making it all up.Well, it turns out that this \\"study\\" is merely an \\"urban myth,\\" as extensivereviews of the research literature by me and by Steven Kraus (a social psychologist fromHarvard) as well as investigative reporting by Fast Company magazine revealed that nosuch study had ever been done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This review is for the audiobook","review":"Most of the content is great, albeit Mr. Tracy seems to have a hyper-ambition about how much money one earns.

Andy's percussion's, Colin's bass and the rest of the guys' (Nic, Steve, Michael and James) harmonious sounds blend together perfectly.

My VHS copy was wearing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis always pleases the fans","review":"I really liked this DVD. With many different camera angles, fans will truly enjoy. If you want to watch Phil and Chester drum, this DVD provides the angles. If you are a keyboard fan, many angles focus entirely on Tony. Guitarist also have a chance to view the work on the srtings. For those who enjoy not only the music but the lightshow- many angles are above the stage and in the balcony so you are not forced to look at the close-ups.

Many of the metaphors of the nondual awareness school were handed down to our present day through generations of mystics and scholars and provide an extraordinarily rich source for meditative expansion and stabilization. The root guru of Adi Da Samraj was Swami Muktananda, who in turn was a product of the Kashmir Shaivist school of nondual awareness. The richness of the terminology, derived from the ancient Sanskrit, is remarkable for both it's clarity and depth. These teachings are readily accessible in meditative absorption, and are a wonderful adjunct in the development, expansion, and assimilation of transcendental awareness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science and Spirituality meet","review":"Yoga is the greatest science.

This cd is much better, however. It is more solid rock and sounds more like skillet or POD's music than Fireproof, which is has more rap influences. The first half of this cd is amazing. Every song from Hypnotized through Frontline is very good, while the rest is okay. This cd is what made Pillar one of the best Christian Rock bands in recent years."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised and i'm glad!!!","review":"As a new fan of pillar, i did not know what to expect on their new disc, where do we go from here, i had just got interested in their second release, Fireproof, and was wondering if it would be similar, and while i do enjoy the strident and powerful sounds of fireproof, where do we go from here beats it in my opinion, Rob's voice soars and every song is different, not leaving you wondering if you heard the same song earlier. I am pleased, as a Christian, to see many great rock bands being produced forth in Christian circles, and have been pumped to hear the releases by pillar, skillet, and kutless to name a couple lately, and pillar is right up there with them on that list. This is a must if you're a pillar fan and i strongly advise to give it a try if you previously didn't like pillar, you may be gladly surprised. Looking forward to seeing pillar rock the stage at Spirit Song in two weeks!! Rock on pillar, and may God bless your efforts!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither here nor there","review":"I will probably get blazed for this but I think this CD is overrated.

Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Does Pillar Go From Here?","review":"Pillar is going straight to the top. I can't stop listening to this album. I saw them perform at Beachfest, Ft Lauderdale, and I was hooked. My absolute favorites are Hypnotized, the first single - Bring Me Down, and Simply.

Buy this album if you haven't already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Album!","review":"Unbelievably good album from beginning right on through!

Great job, Pillar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an awesome band praising God!!","review":"I was blown away by Pillar's first album, and now, they outdo that one by a longshot. They have faster, heavier, more intricate song writing here, as well as some awesome worship songs to truly give thanks and praise to our one and only savior and Lord, Jesus Christ. All songs are awesome, not a bad one on the CD. I would recommend this CD to any Christian and to those that like this style of music, it might change some lives. Well, not much more to say but buy it. No way will you be disappointed when God is the center of an album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not into rock-rap but...","review":"I am not really into the Linkin Park/Limp Bizkit style of music but Pillar's songs has the musicianship that I believe carries the genre to a whole new level.

They've finally moved away from the rap/rock that dominated their first two albums to just solid rock, a change that will only help them in the future. This change makes their music a rival for popular mainstream groups such as Linkin Park and Trapt. Even more importantly they did it without sacrificing the strong Christian base they had when they started. With this change we have a band that can rock with the best and still have a positive message for everyone listening. A must buy for anyone who likes rock, or is just looking for a musically and lyrically sound album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk..do not order!","review":"This is a complete waste of money.

It offers a perspective on the bombing of Hiroshima that anyone interested in the topic should read.Two separate issues- the horror of war against civilians and the use of the atomic bomb- are usually confounded. World War II was a time when all sides butchered civilians. Japanese civilians were going to die in large numbers, either fighting in the streets with bamboo poles against invading tanks or in the horrific fires resulting from incendiary bombing. As many people burned to death or asphyxiated in the Tokyo firestorm as the immediate casualties in Hiroshima.Van der Post believes that the use of a totally new weapon and the timing of the bombing on the night of the new moon allowed the Japanese to surrender and that a continuation of conventional warfare would have led to a much lengthened war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all impressed","review":"I am not at all impressed with this book seeing as I had to live with this man for 5 years. Ihave heard all of his antics on \\"Ruckmanism\\" and I honestly thought that he would eventually grow out of his obsession with it all. But seeing as he hasn't, let me share a thing or two with you. Christopher Brendan McHugh,of Freehold,New Jersey: has always been obsessed with religion.The only problem is that he doesn't know when to quit. He will argue the bible with anyone no matter what veiw they hold.You could agree with Christopher and he will still argue that you are 100% wrong.That's his nature.So if you buy this book,take it at face value what he says in it.Because no-matter what side you choose to take, you will still be confused and wrong at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!!","review":"I don't know why someone said it smells bad because it smells like a regular body lotion and once you apply it the smell disappears within 30 minutes.

However, when ordering my compass recently I overlooked the problem asociated with magnetic dip in the southern hemisphere. Here in Melbourne, the compass is unusable due to strong needle tilt obstructing movement. The compass needs to be held at an angle of about 10 degreees from horizontal to get a directional reading, so clearly rebalancing is required. One would hope that geographic area of use could be specified when ordering from Brunton and local suppliers would presumably know this. So if you are buying from Australia check!As it happens, I have a job for my new compass in the northern hemisphere, so expect it will work OK there."},{"rating":"1","title":"husker13","review":"The anticipation for installing this faulsely advertised product was great.

It happens with everything that can be considered \\"hot\\" and \\"marketable\\" to young people who spend money.As far as Gator himself goes, he bought into the hype and you could see what a joke he was in the latter stages of the film. He may have been a great skater and a nice guy but the most telling interviews are those conducted with the police officers and the court footage. Gator murdered this poor girl w/o even knowing her very well. He incapacitated her head with severe blows which caused massive bleeding. He then proceeded to take her to his room and cuff her and sexually assault her for 3 HOURS. Then he stuck her in a surf board bag and strangled her before dumping her body in the desert.REAL NICE GUY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad Skater!","review":"Oh man, I hated this movie! I'd just watched \\"Dogtown And Z-Boys\\" (which I loved!) and was looking forward to seeing some eighties skate action after that great view of the seventies. Anyway, this movie is a total bummer. The skating is boring, the style is bad and it doesn't cover the eighties skateboard era well at all. If you don't already know the story, Gator was a sub-par skater who became a corporate sell-out and a has-been in short order. He was an arrogant jerk. He once punched one of his young fans after the kid asked for an autograph. As his career started to fall apart, he became a born again Christian. He then raped and killed his ex-girlfriend's best friend as a revenge ploy after she dumped him. He's currently serving life in prison. Perhaps some kind of redeeming documentary could have been made out of this sad and depressing story, but this film is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work Here!","review":"If you used to follow Mark Gator back in the days and want to know the whole story, this pretty much covers it.

It was emotional to read what happened to her, and the reactions of members of our community I looked up to as a child, because they were involved in my life also. When it happened, being a child, details were given to me pretty vaguely, but reading the story as an adult was a really good expirience for me.

Because it details actual criminal cases the book is far more disturbing and frightening than any fiction could hope to be. Recommended, but you're going to need to get some fresh air between chapters. I sure did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsession by John Douglas & Mark Olshaker","review":"If you want to understand what makes serial killers and serial rapists this is the masterpiece. There is some very graphic descriptions of what some of these amoral criminal minds have done. Every one, even the faint of heart should read the sections about what characteristics to look out for and how to make yourself less likely target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Douglas is stepping out of his expertise","review":"In Obsession, Douglas is telling tales based on the accomplishment of others. He cites the Behavioral Science Unit's Ken Lanning on child molester matters and Robert Hazelwood on rape classifications. He cites Gavin deBecker's work on stalking giving superficial advise on topics he really does not understand himself, nor does he have any personal experience on these matters. It is obvious in his last two books that Douglas has run out of material and is now searching for topics to keep his books going. Douglas should quit the books while he is ahead of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling presentation","review":"The most interesting information in this book was found on a few pages near the end- a description of the bizarre case that inspired the \\"Buffalo Bill\\" character in Silence of the Lambs and the famous movie Psycho. The rest of the book was a long presentation of classifications of types rapists, details of some cases, some law enforcement programs to work with victims, and some advice for victims- both past and potential. Contains editorial about how certain types of serial offenders cannot be rehabilitated- the ones who enjoy what they do and repeatedly decide to do it. Overall there was some intersting information here, but you have to labor to get to the end of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on preaching, short on teaching","review":"I bought this book after reading John Douglas' first 2 books. I have to say this book was a huge disappointment. The actual substance of the book could easily be boiled down to less than 100 pages. I suppose the authors felt that this wasn't enough so they rambled on and on about some woman named Fairstein who works in New York (one of the authors seems to have some sort of 'crush' on this woman) and other barely relevant and mostly uninteresting topics. At one point I started to wonder if this book was actually about Miss Fairstein and not about profiling at all. The details of actual cases and methods for profiling and solving the cases (for the ones that were solved) was as interesting as ever, but the long winded philosophizing about controversial subjects that did not relate to the cases or the process of solving them was extremely annoying. Each chapter could be cut in half by simply deleting all the long sermons and pointless rambling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsession...of what?","review":"This book started out to be a really interesting book, but it was almost like reading a lecture. What could have been a real page turner was repetitive, dry, and boring. Actually, I got so bored with the book (unusual for me) that I didn't even finish it. I was prepared to not be able to put this book down, and I'm sorry to say that it was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and disappointing","review":"This book is filled with repetitions, long wined prose, and the oversize ego that marred Mindhunter. There is less insight and interest than in his book Anatomy of Motive. Motive is a far far better book; read it and pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge, insight, compassion","review":"Obsession takes us back to what we want from John Douglas--his brain, information, suggestions, and insight. This time around Douglas and Olshaker (who is all too often over-looked for his contributions) take us into the minds and behaviors of rapists, stalkers, and the victims of these predators. Furthermore, they take us into the lives of those who became extended victims of the perpetrators--the families of the victims. Douglas offers many words of encouragement and tips on survival. If you've been a victim, he has noteworthy advice for you; if you're the family member of someone who has been a victim, he has noteworthy advice for you; if you haven't been victimized yet--yes, he has noteworthy advice for you. Obsession offers you genuine, experienced, compassionate insight.

While Loretta Young did give birth to a baby she gave birth to the baby in a house that she and her mother owned, not at a hospital.I would not recommend this book if I wanted to know about Loretta Young.

For people who must rush to pick up their children from daycare by 6 p.m. or risk a fine, do not read this book. It will kite your blood pressure.The true playground-and-playgroup book about Washington has yet to be written. The most satisfying book in this canon remains \\"You'll Never Nanny in This Town Again,\\" by a small-town girl who went to Los Angeles to become a nanny.

Name-dropping and full bragging of how important she is to the \\"over achieving\\" parents who are basically folks trying to integrate work and family lifestyles does not make Ms. Kline a likeable decent person. (Whether you agree with how the parents are spending their time or not)Instead of being empathetic, Ms. Kline comes across as a self-ordained I-am-a-very-important person in Washington. She brags about the fact she can choose you as a client and gets more important clients than she really cares for.The book is a quick easy read, but there is no substance and a lot of snide remarks on Ms. Kline's clients make her a character that any parent should stay away from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain dumb...","review":"When I saw this in the library, I guess I was expecting another version of The Nanny Diaries, which was cute. This \\"novel,\\" however, was poorly written and jumped all over the place; there were no smooth transitions at all. It was basically one big promo of her company--any time she mentioned a \\"horror story\\" she was quick to add that it wasn't one of HER nannies. Basically, I thought it was boring and that the writing style emulated that of the 3rd graders I teach. It took me about an hour to read, after which I thought, \\"How did THAT get published?\\" If you want to read a nanny book, try the Nanny Diaries. This book is stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor payback for clients","review":"We have used White House Nannies and they did a fine job. After reading this book, however, I would be reluctant to use them again. I own a business and would never dream of violating my clients' privacy the way Kline does in this book. She is quite nasty, and unnecessarily so, as many of the stories speak for themselves. Sure, it's easy to mock power couples, but this is Kline's main source of income -- shouldn't she show a little more class?Some names are real, others (I think) are not. Given the highly sensitive nature of the book, some clarity on this point would have helped.For those not bothered by the ethics or the tone, there are some interesting stories and genuine insights into the nanny-parent relationship. Still, I'm rather sorry I contributed to the author's profit for such a mean and self-promoting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough name-dropping already","review":"I bought this book because Kline was signing copies in a bookstore in Baltimore. Everyone said it was funny. I'm 50 pages into it, and I have to say that I am already so sick of her exposing the private lives of her clients and dropping names left and right (one of THE most annoying DC traits, I must say). She is clearly trying to ride the wave of the popularity of The Nanny Diaries. It is NOWHERE near as funny or interesting, and at least Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus had the decency not to name names. As one of the other reviewers stated, this is just an advertisement for herself. I actually considered returning to the bookstore and asking for my money back. What a sore disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book with 2 personalities","review":"This book gives the impression of being 2 books pieced together. The first part is a somewhat cursory account of Archerfish's famous exploit of sinking the Shinano, a story recounted elsewhere much more comprehensively. Once that part is out of the way, the remaining 3/4 of the book deals with the boat's later history, or more accurately, the hijinks of the various crews, which all sound like the submarine equivalent of McHale's Navy personnel.

I've seen at least one other documentary on the Salton Sea that did not insult one's intelligence. I recommend everyone save their money, this wasn't worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'Don't Miss'","review":"Can't recommend this album highly enough. If you're a fan of the Hindemith style of Classical Expressionism than Hindemith's student Arnold Cooke is for you. Arnold Cooke was very much respected in his lifetime and praised on more than one occasion by fellow composer Havergal BrianHavergal Brian: Symphonies Nos. 6 & 16; Arnold Cooke: Symphony No. 3(another British composer not to be overlooked). This performance of the Symphony no 1 also includes the wonderful ballet suite from Jabez and the Devil as well as the String Concerto in D. The music is brilliantly performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Nicholas Braithwaite.

They do not sound at all like the mature Petula from the mid-1960s forward, when she began singing with a sexy and swingin' sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"Why are the costs of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment not called into question from the point of view of the corporations that benefit from this system? Maybe some industries are too important to allow profiteering from?"},{"rating":"1","title":"do you really want to read a 208 page whine?","review":"This starts well, the car jacking is horrible and superbly written. However pre and post the jacking Brad Land simply whines. He whines about not being as good as his brother, about not getting the girl he wants, about not know where he is going in life. He then gets to college and whines about fraternities and whines about....well everything.Any patience you have for him dies by about page 120, it is just none stop whinging. And what happens to him that is so bad? To be honest his 'hazing' experiences seem about as harsh as a boys night out on the beer. So he drinks a lot? smokes a lot? gets laid a few times? feels socially uncomfortable....who doesn't now and then.Not recommended at all unless you, like Brad, like to whine - maybe for his next book he can tell us how horrible it is to go shopping or how terrifying it is to use a public toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid and Annoying","review":"I suspect this book is the product of a mind trained mainly on IM. It is shallow beyond belief. I can't recall a single moment of feeling the author was sharing any observation of importance or even one when an insubstantial moment or observation was conveyed cleverly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I Miss Something?","review":"I am a recent college graduate, so the premise of the story was definitely intriguing to me. The beginning of the story was written in such a choppy and direct, yet appealing style that I was excited about the possibilities of where this book would take me. As the story went on though I found that the \\"twist\\" or \\"spin\\" that I expected the story to take never occurred. From the first chapter this book gets progressively worse until you are left closing the book in disappointment. I love Land's style of writing. That was the only thing that kept me interested just enough to finish this book. I would pass on this story, but I am interested in seeing Land's creative technique combined with a worthy story to go along with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"Although I knew this would be a very hard book to read, I found myself not able to put it down. As a native of Florence & a Clemson student, the book more than intrigued me. Although I'm sure some stuff had to be exaggerated, I thought this was an amazing expose of the nature of some Greek organizations... one that most people don't want to talk about at all. I'm terribly sorry that this happened to the author, but I'm glad that he's able to put everything into words & hopefully help others.For any of you considering coming to Clemson, please know that his experience was far from the norm. I have found that my years there have been some of the most wonderful in my life. I have found a wonderful, embracing community, & I hope that others can find that too, wherever they go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"South Carolina steps up to the plate","review":"Mr. Land's account is both harrowing and rife with accuracy. As a person who has been both a witness and a participant in such rituals (albeit with women, who are barely more merciful), I feel that this is an important account for two reasons. The firsthand account of depression, anxiety and hazing itself is enough by itself to keep the reader thoroughly occupied. Second is the effect that prostrating oneself to the mercy of others: Mr. Land describes the complete demoralization that takes over his life with frightening force. and his character pays a heavy toll. This is a must read for anyone interested in the sham known as the college scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Brad Land has made a powerful book. I want to read it again, to savor it more slowly. The narrative pull is so strong that the first read is fast. But even so, what I am most struck by is the craftsmanship. What is amazing is the apparent transparency and immediacy of the voice; yet the text is actually complexly layered. Land has somehow managed to let the damaged boy he was tell the story he couldn't have told then; so the man, the writer, is part of the story without ever intruding upon it. Indeed, that presence is, I think, a crucial part of what makes the narrative ultimately bearable in the end -- because the story couldn't have been told unless the teller survives and transcends. I suspect that a naive reader would come away with the impression that the words just came white hot and unmediated straight onto the page, but there is clearly so very much hard work that has gone into achieving that effect and impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak kid, Weak book","review":"This book is about a pledge that couldn't cut it. I am sorry the author suffered through what he did in the beginning of the book, but I am sick of people whining about how terrible hazing is. Hazing is the only way fraternities can keep out the guys who aren't serious about joining. If you want to read a book that confirms your beliefs that fraternities are bad, then read this book. If you want to read a book that shows you both the good and bad of fraternities, then read Epsilon Zeta."},{"rating":"1","title":"just really bad","review":"Someone should have told Mr. Land to stop writing before he started. His story, even if it were well told, is not worth writing about. It made me tired and irritated. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful self-aware first effort","review":"While this book is lauded as a great first effort, it is hardly worth the praise - or time. Mr. Land's writing style, while attempting to be stream of consciousness doesn't hide his lack of style or familiarity with current prose. Catch this one in the discount bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzz","review":"Ok, the random attack is kind of freaky, mostly insofar as it sends this writer into a sort of depression that certainly comes across in the writing. His description of fraternity life didn't seem that scandalous or revealing; perhaps the violent attack made such an environment more ominous than it actually was. The writing is whiny and kind of drags; I felt that, heavily edited, this would have made a much better magazine piece. If you're looking for a great account of walking through hell in a gasoline suit, I'd tell you to check out James Frey's \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" but you probably already have."},{"rating":"1","title":"reader and liker of memiors","review":"...Is the prose \\"amazing,\\" and the narrative \\"uniquely hip.\\" Sweet Christ on crutch it is not.The subject alone is powerful enough to carry the story, and does not need I don't think a melodramatic, bad nickname-giving, grad schooly nonfiction voice to stand between us and the stuff that went on. There's the sensitive-observer-in-a-harsh-world approach, and in that case the observer becomes important. JT LeRoy's work is a good example, but the problem is that almost no one is anywhere near that good, including Mr. Land, who even with the help of Random House's editors, sounds like a whole lotta other memior-writing-at-the-time-where-memior-sells writers, whose pasts are self-inflicted, and whose talents are not proportional to the number of zeros on their paychecks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sour Grapes and Imagination","review":"After reading the book I found myself to be skeptical of what Mr Land had written. His writing style was trite with a \\"poor me\\" tone about it. Attending a small liberal arts college, Hillsdale with a student population of 1000 about 70% of the students were at that time affiliated with the Greek system. Many were sons, nephews and grandsons of alumni affiliates. Our members were never met with the violence,degradation, lunacy and the like Mr Land describes........how long was he an active member? Not only do I not commend his writing style it seems apparent that he's written a very one sided piece of fiction set to further damage the Greek system. Don't waste your time on this drivel. And should you, remember to tell yourself that this man has one hell of an imagination stemmed from very obvious resentment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Familiar","review":"I found the subject of this book familiar and interesting, but Land's staccato styled memoir often felt like reading a child's diary. There is little variation in tone, punctuation, or enthusiasm.If you are familiar with Clemson or Clemson fraternites, I recommend reading this book. It did bring back a sense of nostalgia, and at times I found myself laughing when I think his intent was for the reader to be angry? Being familiar with Clemson, Kappa Sig, characters, and other aspects of Land's book I question much of the picture he has painted. But I guess in fiction there is truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Pathetic","review":"I love the cover - that goat would make a cool tattoo!The book itself was very boring, lacked purpose, and came off as quite pathetic. I have no problem with a 'cloudy day' book...but I really missed the point of this one. I mean it's terrible what happened - but shocking things happen everyday - just pick up the paper. This book was not shocking, not interesting and definitely not inspiring in any way shape or form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"Mr Land does an awful job of portraying a fine university and greek system. He represents only a fraction of unhappy members of the greek system. As member if the Clemson greek system for five years I was one of thousands of members who did not have the same feelings as Land."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Passive-Agressive Handbook","review":"i wasted my time reading this book. while Mr. Land has a remarkable attention to minute detail, i am left at the end of the book unmoved. in short, i find his indictment of Clemson University to be wholly unfair. in addition, the horrible events detailed in this book? he caused them by his own actions.this book seems like a passive-agressive way to get back at people whom the authour was unable to stand up to while the events unfolded in real-time. throughout, i'm convinced that trouble started for him and his brother long before the events of the book (child abuse? maybe?) but are never touched upon. maybe Mr. Land is saving this for his next book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over substance","review":"As a former fraternity member, this did nothing to capture the essence of fraternity life, or hazing for that matter. Also, the writer tried so hard to have a distinct writing style that it interfered with the storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't wait for the book to come out.","review":"Wow. For a book about violence, this one sure failed to make an impression. There is death, random violence and an unwillingness by the author to speak any louder than a hazy murmur, and not in a good way. The main character is a mountain of passivity who somehow comes to decisions without a whit of reason or will. I just don't get the arc of the character... Feels like notes to novel to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"unputdownable","review":"One of those rare, wonderful books that, once begun, must be read swiftly through to the end, to be absorbed all of a piece. Land's an astonishingly mature and assured writer for one so young, and his spare, idiosyncratic style truly seems appropriate and deft, not just the affectation of someone trying to seem writerly.The other reviews here have well covered the story, and there's no point in further dignifying the accusations from the nose-out-of-joint frat boys and former frat boys who don't like their dirty jockstraps aired in public, so I'll just say that you don't have to be a frat boy, or a former frat boy, or even a boy, to find much to ponder, and be terrified by, in Goat.Superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate fratboys and i still hated this book","review":"i grew up in the south and went to the university of georgia, where i learned to hate fratboys. bought this book and was sorely disappointed. you eventually start wondering who the hell this guy is and why he's such an idiot that he would pledge a clemson frat, in the first place? no small point, believe me. maybe he's just actually kind of a dumb guy. as you read, he really starts seeming that way. his 'style' is thoroughly annoying, and yes, it is 'faux hipster.' but eventually, i started thinking he did this on purpose so he would have something to write about. i think he joined the frat so he could write about the brutality of frats, juxtaposed with his assault--another first-hand thing he could write about. patch those two subjects together and voila, you've impressed all the kids in your creative writing class. bottom line is it's impossible to enjoy a memoir when you discover 50 pages in that you really dont much like the narrator."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"This is my first review and I am only doing this because i want to help people avoid the mistake i made in reading this. There is no point to this book. There is nothing special about Brad Land's story at all. Ok, he was mugged and he had trouble with hazing and fraternities. Aside from that he seems to be doing ok. And those two problems are very small and extremely uninteresting to read about. Don't waste your time on this. There are so many better memoirs about things that are actually worth reading about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This author has trouble constructing a meaningful sentence. This was a painful read for sure about what could be a compelling topic. I labored to finish it even with its short length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhhh. Whatever.","review":"Not my cup of tea. The first person perspective and complete absense of narration is distracting. The story is not sufficiently interesting to get the reader past that distraction.

I had planned on sending it to a friend who went to Clemson but on second thought I will save him from Goat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Bother","review":"Terrible book. End of story.

I use them in all conditions, wet and cold to hot and dry. So far they have performed flawlessly. Best of all they don't fog up when it's cold outside. The optics are bright and clear without any rainbow effect, and the colors are normal even in low light conditions. One of the coolest things about these binos is that they will focus well up close (these seem to be able to focus as close as about 7ft.), which is great for small fauna observation. The focus wheel dials smoothly and easily. In all a joy to use. I can \\"see\\" why the Coast Guard uses these, and why so many of my birding friends recommend them. When I was comparing binos in a telescope specialty shop, the only ones that came close to these cost twice as much. Five Stars and a Big Smile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial and boring work","review":"This is meant to be an inter-disciplinary work, which should have been quite interesting. Yet, the authors here did the job in such a way that, although the book covers a wide range of matters, the treatment that any subject received is superficial. One can't obtain much insight from the book.Also, the book is written in a rather boring tone, and there is much room for improvement as regards the language. As a result, it doesn't make very easy reading, too. I don't think I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"About the format not the story","review":"First I have watched the entire second season \\"Sekirei 2: Pure Engagement\\" (the subtitled version) via Hulu and enjoyed the continued storyline.What I find wrong is the blu-ray/dvd combo idea.

Which would most likely generate more sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boobies FTW!","review":"I loved the first season and so far the second season hasn't disappointed me yet.The only thing that has bothered me so far is the fact that this set unlike the first one was packaged in a DVD case instead of a blu-ray case.

This was the first commercial recording of the work written in Finzi's last year (1956), and it remains the best. John Denman plays the 1946 Clarinet Concerto - and it more than holds its own next to Thea King (Hyperion) and Richard Stoltzman (RCA, oop). This is unfashionably melodic, albeit dark, music by a composer more preoccupied with the urgency to express himself in an idiom of beauty than the musico-academic tussles that went on between Schoenbergian and Stravinskian composers at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Rossini knows how to construct an amusing and entertaining opera that people everywhere love to view.

This in comparison to 'Sung Tongs' and 'Feels,' where on tracks with verbal presence these parts are one through distention. (Yorke ran into a similar problem when his 'Eraser' was compared to other Radiohead stuff.) The first exception on 'PP' is the lead track 'Comfy in Nautica,' where the sonic is sparse enough to keep from planing, and so dovetails in flight with Panda's voice.

The only other products I know that include these forms are Andy Weil's and one from Canyon Ranch. Both similarly priced.On the down side, they could have included higher doses of Vitamin D, B12, and Pantothenic acid, that many people need.

We start with a really swinging arrangement of \`They all laughed'. We then slow the tempo for a delightful arrangement of \`Someone to watch over me' that obviously owes much to Oscar Peterson. We have an up-tempo \`Lady be good' and \`A foggy day' that has something of the Jacques Loussier touch about it. Next we are treated to a skilful medley of \`Soon' and \`Do it again'; then into \`I got rhythm', \`Embraceable you', \`Fascinating rhythm, \`Love walked in', \`The man I love' and still more.

There is an absence of linguistic or useful models designed to help the student find his or her way through the labyrinth of sounds and symbols that confront the beginner in Vietnamese. Nothing is explained and everything is inferred that the mysteries of the language will be unlocked by interaction with the guru.

Most of the memories had little substance, and the tone of many essays was so poor that I had the impression the authors had scribbled them on cocktail napkins in a rush.With few exceptions (Thomas Merton's section, for example), the recollections were boring and lacked any sort of bite. Neither humorous, nostalgic, nor thought-provoking, the tales would leave one constantly turning the pages, hoping some substance would follow. The quest for the Holy Grail would be less futile than that for any wit or charm in this book.The promise of the title undoubtedly would prompt people to order this book as a gift for a Catholic friend or a hope of memories for oneself.

However, he has written one very famous novel that was turned into an equally famous movie; The Sand Pebbles.Besides this novel this work contains his only other easily available work. This work deserves close study since it shows him to be a remarkable story teller and a maritime author in the class of Conrad, Hemingway, and Patrick O'Brien.McKenna's most remarkable skill is his evenhanded approach to both sympathetic and unsympatehtic characters. He writes stories that deal with human interaction, but never has to resort to the use of villains to add tension to the story.McKenna's back ground as a sailor and an author who did not put pen to paper until late in live must have contributed to this remarkable gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like at the Thai Spice Kitchen!","review":"We have this tea all the time at a local restaurant - they serve it hot and we love it.

Looking at a list of about a dozen musicians on the back cover, the only two that I recognized were bassist Michael Gunter and guitarist Gustav Lutjens. This is NOTHING like the other Agitation Free CD's. Turns out to be decent quality 'progressive jazz', something that most of our parents might like. Notable tracks are \\"6th Floor\\", \\"Latino Catherine\\" and the well written \\"Offstage\\".

This item qualifies for 4 for 3 promo.This is really a huge container so too big for coffee or tea in my opinion.There is ample room for a five pound bag of sugar or flour (I bought ten pound bags from the big box store.) I took the cue from the previous reviewer about not submerging the canister when washing it out the first time. This is basically a plastic lined metal canister or a metal enrobed plastic canister.

My bookshelves are stacked with them and I love trying new recipes. But I hated this cookbook. The recipes are pedestrian, uninspired, and, to top it off, I was really put off by the author's tone.

I DID have to tape a piece of plastic (curved, from a soda bottle) against the edge of the hole in the lid of the tank, where the food is dispensed. Some of the food was ejecting over the edge and this simple \\"fix\\" guided the excess food into the tank instead of onto the floor. I think this was because our lid has a rather small opening - not a fault of the feeder.It worked flawlessly while we were away - no problems with wet food or hangups.

That said, I am disappointed with these \\"headphones\\" for the following reasons: 1) the tips are removable and they come off too easily if caught on anything in your backpack, car, etc., and 2) the cord is very long, which may be good for home audiophiles, but it's excessive for something like an iPod that you may carry in your pocket or backpack. The previous comment about these earbuds being \\"high maintenance\\" is unfortunately true.

I own a pair of Sony in-ear buds that have better sound quality (they produce a much richer and life-like sound) and bass reflex and were only about 40 dollars.

Unfortunately for me, the silicone ear pieces didn't fit well. The small silicone ear piece was too small and the medium too big. I can't use the ear buds that came with my iPod or anything designed like them due to the discomfort I experience after having them in for a short time.

I was just browsing AOL's cd listening selections and came across this album. Have listened to it a few times online - it's very nice - I plan on purchasing a copy. I'd place it somewhere between Maxwell's Embrya album and Seal's latest record. Love the production, the presentation and Mozez's voice. Leaves me curious about whether or not he plays any of the instruments - I hope he does. But it does suggest that he writes his own lyrics. That's a good thing. This is just a surface level review, since I have yet to sit down with the lyrics and really listen. But I'm intrigued and impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"feel free - to buy","review":"\\"Feel Free\\" is just awesome. I have not listen all the tracks but loved couple tracks a lot.

The history of the AIDS epidemic is enlightening. The story of this woman is amazing and the history of US drug companies failure to help and the government failure to step in initially is heartbreaking. The book is well written, wonderfully told and a captivating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This author is fantastic","review":"I don't write to echo all the praise below, because that would be repetitive, but to also mention that all of Melissa Faye Greene's books are of similar, stellar quality.

Beautiful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-changing","review":"This book was so incredible words can't even describe it. I finished it a couple of weeks ago and it still occupies a large amount of my thoughts. My sister is now reading this and I will get a copy for my mom and mother-in-law for Mother's day to educate them about where their grandchildren are coming from.This is such a moving book, very emotional, but very informative as well. I consider myself a fairly well-educated woman, but this stunned me.

I also love her blog of the same title, which is how I found the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"This account of the orphanage run by Haregewoin Teferra in Ethiopia is a fascinating, well-written book. The honest stories of Haragewoin as a person (her personal background, the story of her country) and the individual orphans that she comes to care for, are skillfully woven together with the story of the science of the AIDS epidemic, including a very eye opening account of big pharma's role in this crisis. The last section of the book is devoted to the very, very touching (but again, honest) stories of a few American families who adopted Ethiopian children. Some of the phrases in the book will stay with me forever......\\"in a world without people, be a person.\\" I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"A great story not only of seemingly boundless love and generosity mixed with overwhelming care and challenges, but also informs the reader about AIDS/HIV in Ethiopia.

Read it.","review":"I couldn't put this book down. There are several stories-within-a-story here: the tale of a grieving woman who almost became a hermit, before finding out the world needed her more than she knew; the story of a country's people decimated by AIDS; the story of thousands of orphans, many forgotten and some saved; the story of children who had to leave their families behind due to poverty and disease... who were truly \\"saved\\" by international adoption, but at the price of losing their culture....

Unfortunately, you can only wear these for about 5 minutes before they hurt your ears. So I bought alternative headphones and put these away. Stupid me, I brought them out when I needed some in a pinch and they actually have been shocking my ears! They are not molded to fit in any ear and they have this nub on the side of each that kill!

I listen to internet radio which is not ver loud anyway. These buds are really uncomfortable. They are not molded in any way to fit the human ear. because they do not fit well, the sound quality really siffers. The cable is very short, which means if I stand up at my desk, either I rip the buds from my ears or jerk my laptop off the desk by my ears. Either way it hurts.Now, the good points: well, they're nice and shiny.I suggest Maxell's beckband earplugs, or if you must have the ear buds, just get anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked scholarship","review":"I differ from most of the other reviewers. I read this book as part of a requirement for a doctoral seminar. I think the book had much potential, but fell short. Dr. Roberts failed to articulate who her audience was intended to be or what she hoped to accomplish. She clearly was biased against whites. Notably, she always capitalized \\"black\\" but never white or any other race. She uses data, but never frames it in any type of context. Data that cannot be compared is of no value. Further, she did not use good scholarship in some of her statements. Early in the book, she states that Thomas Jefferson and others were racists and footnotes it by referring to what someone else said about Jefferson. In good scholarship, if you want to know what someone thought, you go to the primary source, not what someone else said about what they thought. The book could have been very good, but I couldn't tell where she intended to go, so I will never know if she arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as a textbook","review":"Excellent text, but highly troublesome material.

The things that make this pillow awesome are the hard foam it's made from, the Velcro strap, and the plush cover. It stays on and doesn't slip like the Boppy.

It's a good thing that it did get made, because it includes Yvonne's heart-rending version of Long Gone Lonesome Blues, performed acapella, a number that she did at every show, producing an eerie mood which the CD almost captures. The last track, Gothic Herb, is a melancholy postscript to the album, rich with a sense of loss that sums up Preston Klik's feelings about the band he built and lost.

I love his writing style, but the \\"all's well that ends well\\" Hollywood ending was a let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still on the way down","review":"For me, Hiaasen's work has gone downhill steadily from the awesome standards he set with Tourist Season and Double Whammy. I still very much liked Skin Tight and Native Tongue, even Striptease had its moments, but from then on I got the feeling that even the author wasn't really enjoying himself. Lucky You was pretty silly, Stormy Weather and Sick Puppy a pair of interchangeable bores, so with Basket Case he has made an effort to freshen things up by adopting the first-person, present-tense approach. Nah. Didn't work. You get the feeling he signed a lucrative 10-book deal with his publisher and is cranking them out so he can go do something else which he enjoys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disobeys Aristotle","review":"It starts off as a mystery. An obituary writer notices an attempt to cover up the fact that a dead businessman was a famous rock star. The identity of the killer and the motive are revealed about half-way through. Then there's an attractive female kidnapped plot to build up suspense and then a second a.f.k.p. Another plot is one of Hiaasen's crusading ones. He's against the decline of good old-fashioned journalism and this involves the takeover of a worthy newspaper by a heartless chain.A lot of expertise about rock music.I like Hiaasen best when he keeps his feet on the ground and stays closer to reality. \\"Striptease\\" remains the best for me. My problem with this one, and several other recent Hiaasens has been the way the plot veers off into fantastic unbelievability. Too many unlikely things happen in too many plots. Aristotle said (I think) that fiction should deal either with either impossible probabilities or improbable possibilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than 'Sick Puppy'","review":"I've been a Hiassen fan from the beginning. When I read \\" Sick Puppy ', I could barely get through it. I'm sorry to say that I gave up on ' Basket Case ' after around 70 pages. I only laughed once during those long, long, 70 pages. I have to admit that I do miss his other regular human characters. However, the character I miss most of all is Florida. In all his previous novels, you could get a sense of the Florida feel; the heat, the rain, the oddball people, the ocean, etc. Not in this novel. Except for a few bland references, the novel could be taking place anywhere. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carl, take a break for a few years","review":"Don't get me wrong, I own everything this writer has published in hard and soft cover. This novel, however, is not one of the high points on my bookshelf.It's like Carl on low wattage SlimFast. While it's an easy read, it seems like it was also an easy write on the part of the Hiaasen automatic writing engine.Sorry, Carl...it is indeed a basket case. Throw away that dictation software and get back to the paper/pen/hand thing. You're talking too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I think too many of the other reviews are biased by Hiaasen's previous work. This one was a real disappointment. The plot was weak, there was only one decent character (Carla), and there was a gratuitous frozen lizard to give it the Hiaasen trademark. I've read and enjoyed Hiaasen's other books so his name alone was enough for me to buy this one. The next time I see one of his books I'll be more careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hiaasen does it again, but a little differently","review":"I've read all of Carl Hiaasen's novels, and every one of them is a very entertaining read. This one is great, too, but a little different - it's more of a straight mystery than most of his, and it's not nearly as comic-book-ish and over the top as his last two (which I also enjoyed, though), \\"Sick Puppy\\" and \\"Lucky You\\". There IS humor in this one, too, though. How can you not be taken in by a story featuring the mysterious death of Jimmy Stoma, the infamous lead singer (and rhythm guitarist?) of the Slut Puppies, whose ex-wife is not much more than half his age and a certifiable golddigger, to be very, very polite. The narrator/main character's job as an obituary writer is quite interesting, too - he only labors there because of a little altercation with the zit-brained young zillionaire owner of the paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BIZARRE CASE!","review":"\\"Basket Case\\" is another bizarre, witty, raw, graphic, clever novel by Carl Hiaasen. The plot has more twists and turns than a roller coaster and are just about as thrilling or gut-wrenching depending on your point of view. A wannabe investigative reporter trying to revive his writing career uses his obituary column to link himself to famous dead people. He stumbles into the quagmire of some horrific calamities and weird characters and the chase is on.This is vintage Hiassen. Those who have enjoyed his previous books will like this latest caper. All others, read at your own peril."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mystery for Rock n'Rollers !","review":"This was one of the most enjoyable fiction books I have read in a long while. For anyone who enjoys rock and roll, this is a great \\"who done it\\" book. Not only does the author keep you guessing - but he throws humor in along the way. Alot of these characters sound like they walked right out of a night club on the Hollywood strip, or from the pages of Rolling Stone magazine. The frozen lizard part is really funny. I could not put this book down, I had to find out what happened next. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few and far between glimpses of genius","review":"You know those non-descript concrete tiles, with all the pebbles encrusted onto them? Every once in a while there happens to be a pebble in the mortar mix with a different color, a special shine, something that makes you stop and look at it again. This is what happened to me with this book. Overall, it is quite dull and predictable (although I have to admit I didn't imagine Cleo's final was going to go down the way it did). Scattered here and there are proofs of Hiaasen's genius. This is the first book i've read by him, and I am not terribly impressed. For this genre and background, I think Elmore Leonard does a better Job. Nonetheless, this is the perfect book to take for a trip, for waiting rooms, for the side of the pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"unconvincing music business mystery","review":"Hiaasen is convincing when he covers the newsroom, but his music business setting and ersatz rock lyrics ring untrue -- a real outsider's look. And my feminist hackles were set off by the triple cradle-robbing of the 39-year-old rock star and his 22-year-old bride, the 83-year-old newspaper mogul and his 36-year-old wife, and worse yet, the 46-year-old obituary writer and his 27-year-old hotshot editor? A perfect book for readers who like hoary old plots and horny old men. You'll see the plot twists driving down A1A."},{"rating":"1","title":"He mailed it in","review":"I'm working on the assumption that Hiassen is on contract and he \\"painted by the numbers\\" and then mailed it in to get his check. It took me a month to read this pap -- couldn't put up with it for more than a 1/2 chapter at a time -- the irony is that he trashes the work of popular thriller novelist in this book. The only reason I finished it was that I paid full price at a bookstore chain and I had to justify the expense. It is really to bad because I could not put his earlier books down -- especially Stormy Weather and Skin Tight. Hope I have better luck with Hall's new book.If I could be so presumptuous as to give Mr. Hiaasen some advise it would be to take a year off and bring the Governor back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"As a fan of Hiaasen's books, I was especially looking forward to reading his latest.In \\"Basket Case\\" the Hiaasen we know and love from \\"Strip Tease\\", \\"Lucky You\\", and \\"Stormy Weather\\" is hampered by clumsy (and unrealistic) rock-n-roll references. This is intended to lend an air of credibility to the book and its characters, but IMHO it was like a VH1-watching Hootie & the Blowfish fan trying to write about the Strokes or the Breeders or the Replacements- not believable.And when the dead rock star's posthumous anthem is described as \\"early Buffet\\" - please! Jimmy Buffett is NOT rock-n-roll!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hiaasen Bad","review":"As a northerner for real but a south Floridian at heart, I read everything Hiaasen I can get my hands on, including his twice weekly column in the Miami Herald. This was certainly not the Hiaasen we all know and love. The book had a few funny moments but all in all I was very disapointed. It was an OK read but not the vintage hilarity that Carl usually creates. A \\"Tourist Season\\", \\"Stormy Weather\\", \\"Sick Puppy\\" or \\"Lucky You\\" it surely isn't. Bring back \\"Skink\\" and the old South Florida cast of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tisket a Tasket Cheers for the Basket","review":"Such an awesome book! I'm new to Hiaasen, and this was one to get me geared up to read the rest. The characters were so likeable, and I adored Jack Tagger! A true laugh riot that one! The story line moved fast, with plenty of sarcasim, humour and fun along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Way to Lighten Up","review":"This book is a first for me by this author which I came upon by chance. I had been looking for a suspenseful yet rollicking ride of a read for the past couple of years. This book satisfied the criteria of hilarious mystery escapism. Even though a lot of the premises were pretty far-fetched, I thought it was also balanced by some insightful character portraits. I especially liked the way Jack's stepfather was depicted as shamefully flawed in some ways yet still lovable. This author is highly recommended for those times when you really need to chuckle. A lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"horse of a different color","review":"If success strikes early and often, you can write your own ticket. Such is the case in Carl Hiaasen's latest book - BASKET CASE. Perhaps this is some pet project he's held close to his heart for sometime, waiting for the right time to strike. Whatever, it's a departure from the normal mayhem and rollicking zaniness we come to expect. Stepping off more into centerfield, we are treated to a more straight up murder mystery, flavored with Hiaasen's famaliar, trademark goofballs yucking it up. There's still his offbeat humor and idiosyncratic characters, but it's all been toned down a bit to acheive a different end. We'll call it Hiaasen Lite. Not quite the page turner we've become accustom too, but a pleasant and enjoyable read just the same. The plot concerns a dead musician, a deviant widow, possible lost, now found musical recordings, a down, near out journalist, turned detective, and some colorful support cast. Scrupulous, scrumptious, and scintillating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Read","review":"This is the first book by Carl Hiaasen I've read, but it will not be the last. I love his quirky characters and the humorous style he presents. Very fun read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Moving and Predictable","review":"I usually love this authors books, however, this one was predictable and slow. I really had to force myself to keep reading til the end. There were times I skipped pages just to finish. The plot is interesting but, It seems to be over written. I did like the singers sister, Jacks romance with his editor and Jacks obessesion with death. The frozen lizard was funny too."},{"rating":"1","title":"re-read \\"lucky you\\" instead","review":"Or Tourist Season, or Stormy Wheather, or Skin Tight. Hiassen's previous novels are comic gems. He wrote this one in his sleep. The protagonist is a walking cliche: an embittered \\"real\\" journalist whose dedication to the truth has naturally led to his professional downfall. Throughout the novel he beats the dead horse of his disillusionment with the newspaper business - instead of the crisp, wry social commentary I expect from Hiassen, this comes off more like whining. The \\"villain\\" is a totally uninteresting pop singer, the music biz context is unconvincing and -- more to the point - unfunny. The thrill is gone - I hope Hiassen recharges his batteries and brings back the raucous, joyful, wacked-out style we love so much. Dave Barry just doesn't cut it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta read Carl Hiaasen, ya gotta read Carl Hiaasen!","review":"Well, maybe you do but this sure aint the place to begin that journey.What can you say, this book is a total mess. Its not interesting, its sure as hell notfunny. I had read Strip Tease several years ago and thought that was one of the bestexamples of pure caustic wit I'd seen since Dan Jenkin's Dead Solid Perfect, but thisthing.....got to be a ghost writer. There's a lot of that going around these days. Bad,very bad. You've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellow author gives thumbs up","review":"[...] I give this a thumbs up for outrageous comedy at its best. I have been a Carl Hiaasen fan for years and have loved every one of his books that I have read.What I loved about this book, as is the case with all of his, is that his characters are so engaging. The plot twists and turns are unexpected and the situations keep getting more and more outrageous. It is dark, satirical, and delicious. I don't know how he does it. The flavor of all of his books is the same. Yet this, just like the rest, was as refreshing as the first book I read by him.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"New fan","review":"Basket Case is the first Carl Hiaasen book I've read and I have to say I was very entertained. I picked it up because I'm a big fan of Lisa Lutz and the Spellman novels and his name was mentioned on the back cover. I really enjoyed Basket Case. I thought it was funny, witty, and found Jack to be such a great character, quirks and obsession with death and all. I'm starting on a new Hiaasen book and I'm hoping it's going to be as good as this one. If you are looking for a funny/mystery/witty book with great dialogue then this one is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Hiaasen's better novels.","review":"The first Hiaasen I ever read was \\"Sick Puppy,\\" which I enjoyed immensely. The problem with reading a really entertaining book as your first by an author is that the others have a harder time living up to the first. Intentional or not, every Hiaasen novel I've read since (there have been many) has been measured against \\"Sick Puppy\\" and very few measure up.\\"Basket Case\\" comes closer than most...I loved its main character Jack Tagger, a neurotic (about dying) but ballsy news guy who has been busted down to writing obits for...well, being ballsy. He sinks his teeth into a bizarre mystery surrounding the death of a washed-up (literally) rock star who he once admired in the hopes of getting back onto page 1 of the newspaper.The mystery is intriguing, there is a very sexy side story (Jack, you naughty boy!), and the way it all wraps up is QUITE satisfying! I was very pleased to once again finish a Hiaasen novel and go \\"YES! Now that's what I'm talkin' about!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical Novel Filled With Witty Banter!","review":"I don't usually love crime novels that are full of comedy, however, since discovering Carl Hiaasen I cannot get enough of his witty plots.Not only does he keep the reader interested in the crime investigation he gives the reader an extra helping of dessert with his unique characters. The character depth is simply amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't have been written by Carl","review":"I kept trying to get involved in this book.

If you must read it, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one Sick Puppy..............","review":"I'm a big Carl Hiaasen fan, but to be honest, this was not as enjoyable as say Sick Puppy or Stormy Weather. The humor is sporadic, and the characters fail to take on a life of their own. If anyone has read any of his books with Skink in them, you will understand what I mean by that.The main character, Jack Tagger is a reporter who has been demoted to the obit section of the paper and becomes a walking almanac of who died at what age. It's a running gag that is funny, but again, it's not enough compared to his other works. The plot is boring, a rock musician (Jimmy Stoma) dies in the Bahamas, and during the course of writing the obit, Jack has a lot of questions surface. He investigates and speculates Jimmy was murdered.Sadly, this just is not a very good effort from an author I thoroughly enjoy. Hopefully he'll get back on track. Bringing back Skink always seems to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as the hiaasen","review":"Hiassen's first few novels were so fresh and funny that he became a victim of his own success and kept failing when he tried to top them. for a while he was unreadable, zany just for the sake of being zany. with basket case he's back in great form and has written a very funny, dead-on indictment of american newspapers all while keeping the reader interested in the plot turns and characters. it's a wonderful accomplishment and laugh-out-loud funny. anyone interested in how newspapers work, forget all those self-serious reviews of the business that have come out lately and read this. it's better, more accurate and a hell of a lot more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite vintage Hiaasen","review":"I certainly was ready for a new Hiaasen book. However, I miss the Hiaasen of old. The Hiaasen of Skin Tight and Double Whammy. The good old dark comedy that has kept me warm through many winters.

The only bright side on an otherwise dull night is the St Pierre vs Matt Hughes fight.

I buy 2 at a time so I have a back up when one ear goes dead . Fussing with wires will work to return sound but once they go out they stay unreliable. This is the 3rd time I have returned to this great value. Each set lasts me for about 2000 hours, so if you do not use them continuously like I do they may last quite a while.UPDATE 2/16/2013. Fast delivery! They have changed this product. It has a Better design. Same quality of sound. There is now only a single wire coming from one ear rather than having wires to both ears. Since this design will have less tangling issues I expect the lifespan will be longer.

William Luce has crafted an imaginative clever script that paints a memorable portrait of John Barrymore. John Barrymore is alone on stage talking to a prompter, running through the memories of his life as an acting icon from a family of acting icons. And Luce makes it work.This script works because Luce has a gift for writing; the imagination of an artist; and a genius with dialouge all too rare today. Buy this play it's worth the read. Produce this play it's a winner with a dream part for any journeyman actor.Christopher Plummer may have taken home the Tony for his performance in this play on Broadway, but, it's Luce's incredible script and genius that gave him the means to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't recommend it enough","review":"Had a bad day?

I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enya Wannabe","review":"I bought Land of Forever and River of Stars and it was the worst purchase I have ever made. It nothing but repetative tinkering and no movement to follow along with. It reminds me of someone tinkering with a piano and experimenting with the sound effects. The chanting singers in the background OOOOmmm and AAhhhhh til you wanna throw the cd to the dog as a fetch toy. Instead of mellowing out, I found myself gritting my teeth. You cant hum along with it, because there is no set method. You cant say to yourself \\"Oh! I know what song is next\\" with joy, because whatever clunks you way will just repeat over and over and over and over and over. What is so sad about both tapes is, its a wannabe Enya, and no way on earth will these tapes EVER be like her. Dream on, but not with these CD's. If the rest are like this one, no thanks. It doesnt even deserve one star.Sorry, but I calls 'em as I hear's 'em.

I was listening to LiquidMind CDs, but they got on my nerves after a while because they're too astral and airy sounding and move at a snail's pace. Land of Forever is EXACTLY what I was looking for. The compositions are beautiful and very melodic. You can hum to them. They're memorable. Listen to it on a good player and the bass tones are deep and very moving. For some reason the first trac reminds me of that George C Scott movie Islands In The Stream. That song is the perfect background music for the end of a sunny tropical day. Warm, nurturing, calming, all's good in the world. I LOVE this CD. I'm going back for more by this group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this CD - whenever I want to relax, meditate, or even get work done and hopefully avoid stress, I put this CD on and it is just soothing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Title should be a \\"guide for families.\\"","review":"Kudos to Rasheda Ali for writing a beautifully illustrated guide that educates its readers both with fact and compassion.

This text is a \\"must have\\" for families coping with seeing a loved one deal with Parkinson's disease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with iPhone 4, iPod.","review":"I have tried using this adapter with iPhone 4 and iPod, however, it is a huge disappointment! Unless you turn the volume of the source and the tape player all the way up, you cannot hear anything but a background noise. Even if with the max volume, there is a background noise. I am not sure if the jack configuration is the problem or the adapter itself has a problem, but there is definitely a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work!","review":"I purchased this item because my other adapters tend to \\"click\\" when in use. Not only did this product click, but the auto reverse would not stop flipping, and my car eventually just popped out the cassette. This happened in two different cars I tried it in. I guess I'll go back to my \\"clicking but working great\\" Phillips adapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The back speakers have been dead in my car for years and I see no reason to get them fixed - that's how not-picky I am about sound quality. But this adapter is awful even to my undiscriminating ears. Any hint of bass in the music, even at a low volume, and you get a buzzing, popping sound from the speakers. If the singer has a high voice, it comes out very muffled. It's not the tape player -- regular audio tapes sound fine, as did my old no-brand adapter until it had soda spilled on it. This is just a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Not a good product, sound only comes from one channel, left or right speaker depending on which way you put it in the tape deck.sounds just about as good as the FM Transmitters do.Only positive is it was cheap enough to not really care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds good to me","review":"These things cost around $20 at most B&M stores, so this is a great deal. Maxell is also a great brand name. I've had 2 others for my car cassette player, both of which worked well, but broke after a year or so. Sound quality is good, the cord is not too long, and so far no issues.

I would not recommend this device for this combination of MP3 player/car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but obnoxiously noisy mechanicals","review":"Works but got rid of it because of the loud mechanical sounds from the internal gears -- squeaking, grinding, crunching sounds. Much worse than my previous Maxell adapter. Poor manufacturing! Ordered the Philips USA PH-62050 CD/MP3/MD-To-Cassette Adapter for which the Amazon reviews about noise are much better (and it's a buck cheaper to boot). Indeed, the Philips was very good. Buy it. Don't buy the Maxell. You'll be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappointed. Loud Humming and NO lower end Bass","review":"I've owned a Monster, Panasonic and a Radioshack cassetter adapter and I just bought the maxell adapter and here's my review. First off I also have a LOUD HUMMING sound coming from the adapter that I don't get from the other 3 adapters. Not so obvious when you have the music turned up but definately obvious when you are in between tracks. I was pleased to see that it has dual magnetic heads like my Monster adapter but it produces very low pre amp volume thus requiring you to turn up the volume and getting the loud humming. There is absolutely no lower end bass unless you crank up the bass on the tape player. The mids and the treble sound fine though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Click Click Click","review":"The cassette, as other have said, makes a clicking noise as it runs. I have it in a 2001 Rav4 OEM stereo. It will also cut out when tracks change on the music player. Very annoying. I would not have bought this except for the Maxell name. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maxwell cd adapter","review":"Should have listened to the reviews instead of chancing it. Horrible, I'm sorry, did you hear me, HORRIBLE product! The cord began to go out the first day we used it. Even no music is better than spotty, in one speaker then out the next music. We purchased another one at a local store. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"le sigh","review":"Most of the time my cassette player spits it back out after it has a mini seizure and when it finally does accept it there is an incessant clicking noise.

Not worth the money. Do some research and invest in one that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked","review":"This device worked as advertised. The sound is a little muddy, like a cassette tape, and not as good as an AUX input, but it does the job. I hear it is light years above an RF adapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maxell CD-330 Adapter","review":"Can't turn up the volume too much or I will start hearing some distortion. Not very pleased with overall sound quality. Sound seems muffled. The product does get the job done, but not the way I would have hoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Sony instead.","review":"I got this because I thought my Sony cassette-to-3.5mm adapter was broken--turns out it was my mp3 player that I had attached to it that was malfunctioning.So once I replaced that, I figured I'd go ahead and keep using this Maxell adapter. Bad idea. Even with my ipod at max volume, I had to have my car stereo volume at about half (twice as high as it is for the radio or my old sony one), and when everything is turned up that high, the quality is just bad.Also, I like to leave my ipod plugged in in the car now and then, especially on long road trips. But this? The audio cable is very poorly shielded and charging it and listening to it at the same time is a no-go--unless you happen to enjoy that incessant buzzing sound.So I've been using my old Sony one and it all works just fine--and I suggest you save yourself the time and hassle and do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe","review":"This book tells the story of two people whose careers took totally different paths - one to success and one to near complete failure. The author of this book, Edward De Leo, worked with Al as a mentor very early on in Pacino's acting career, and probably helped him a great deal, but once Al became successful, De Leo was little more than a nuisance to him, hitting him up for movie parts and money over the years. The story of Edward De Leo's life is really pretty pitiful and the introduction of little bits of information about Pacino, although somewhat interesting at times, fail to disguise this book as anything other than one more attempt by a man who perhaps feels entitled to a piece of Al's success, to exploit it. Kudos to Pacino, who, by all accounts, treated this \\"old friend\\" with kindness and generosity.

The author has melded ideas from several scriptures for a daily reading. The writing is postive, encouraging and insightful. The author includes the Bible verses used as the inspiration for the text. It is written as if God is talking to you personally. There is space at the bottom of the page for one to journal if you want.I'm a busy person and reading this short devotional each morning is a great way to start the day.The book is hardcover with a nice ribbon book mark built into the book. I recommend this book for someone who wants to connect with God each day using a short devotional written in contemporary language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"I found this book to be rather shallow. Does the author really believe that Jesus talks to her every day while she listens? Yes, I'm sure Jesus does sometimes tell us things through the Holy Spirit if we take the time to listen, but I sensed that too much of this book was out of the author's own mind. We have to be careful when we attribute thoughts to God. Some have fallen into error because they think God has told them something, but really it has been their own thoughts. For instance, I was at a meeting where someone spoke and said that God had told him something that was absolutely contrary to scripture. In Jesus is Calling, nothing is contrary to scripture, but it is fairly trite.I would have been more comfortable with the book had the author said it was thoughts she had had. The Jesus I know is neither trite nor shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"There are several problems with this book. Here are just four:-The obvious one is that the book puts words in God's mouth.-The author seems to depend on mystic experiences she's had for her belief in God. Also, she wants something more than God's Word in the Bible. It has a New Age feel to it.-It's a feel good book. It avoids the real problem of personal sin. It's all about God filling the personal needs that you feel. It's very self-centered.-Dependence on experiences will lead to frustration and confusion in the Christian life because we need to have more and more experiences to be satisfied.In a nutshell, the book is misleading and is self-centered, rather than what Christianity teaches- to realize our sinfulness and look to Christ, and to serve God and others as a response to our salvation.I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah Young's \\"Jesus Calling\\"","review":"I initially gave Sarah Young's \\"Jesus Calling\\" a great review, mostly because I had never encountered a devotional that had Jesus speak directly to the reader. At first, this concept was intriguing to me. As a born again Christian, however, I have become increasingly convicted when I pick up this book. Why? Because the words written on each page are not Jesus' words, but are portrayed that way. Even though the author *may* have felt Jesus saying these things to *her*, how are we to know for sure? The only words that I trust as Jesus spoken words are directly from the Bible. I don't feel comfortable reading this book anymore. It feels like heresy. I feel the same way about the final \\"Left Behind\\" books that write in dialogue from Jesus. I don't think anyone should put words into our Savior's mouth. As a Christian, be wary of trusting any words attributed to Christ that aren't in the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age spirituality","review":"I had been recommended this book by 2 highly regarded acquaintances who have had a long history of solid Biblical foundations. The book contains many Scripture references, but when I finally got around to reading the introduction I was struck by the New Age-type viewpoint expressed. Too much of a mystical sentiment is expressed.I would recommend extreme caution in reading this devotional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice sounding but speaking for God is unsettling...","review":"Of course there is nothing really offensive in this journal; however, all the text is written in the first person as GOD HIMSELF speaking -- in other words, prophecy I suppose? Truly I believe in all the Gifts of the Holy Spirit but prophecy or God Speaking messages need to be judged and confirmed. It is a little troubling for someone to just start talking and speaking directly as GOD HIMSELF. At the end of the day, God can speak for Himself and has already in the Bible. I suggest a daily reading of the Bible would be more beneficial since Christ's words are Spirit and life. I don't know where untested prophecy comes here? Overall, what is said is not offensive; it is merely just another book that takes the Christian away from reading the Bible itself. I consider that fact a loss to us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Christian, it's New Age!","review":"As I read through the book, a red flag instantly popped into my head. This reminds of the channeling books that I read when I was deeply into the new age, like Conversations With God. I am NOT comfortable with this as a Christian.

This is heavily liberal, progressive, new age propaganda!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, Christ-centered devotional","review":"This devotional is God-centered, Christ-exalting, and soul-refreshing. This one-year, daily devotional would make a great gift for a Christian brother or sister.

I am thinking of the woman whose husband just left her with 3 kids and a house payment. I am thinking of the man who just lost his job and has no idea where to go next. There are numerous people in my own life that I can think to give this book to and I am sure there are in yours as well.

The author is accurate to the Scripture. I have been enduring a long and tortuous trial. When I started to pray the way \\"Jesus was talking to me\\", I found that my dependence on myself decreased and my absolute dependence on Christ increased.

It is the best devotional I have found for touching my heart about drawing nearer to Jesus and walking closer to him with instructions on how to walk close and depend on him.I have not found a better devotional that conveys the love of our Savior with practical, scriptural based instructions on how to follow him.The love of God streams from these pages. She writes as she heard Jesus talk to her, so He addresses us from Him to us, his beloved children.Anyone experiencing anything less than resting in Christ Jesus and abiding in His love would benefit from this text, scriptures references for each day included.It is my main gift to all, They have a wonderful CHILDRENS version too!

I am hoping to give this book to all of my friends over the course of the next year. It starts every morning on such a thought provoking note - to focus on Jesus, lay our worries at His feet and trust Him to show us the way, live in the moment of each day - not tomorrow or beyond, and to let his spirit work through us to make a difference in other people's lives.

I purchased a few copies to give to people, but I hadn't read it myself. I do believe that there should be a didactic relationship with the Lord, but this author seems to go to a mystical level that appears to have little to do with God's Word and a lot to do with the prodcution of redundant gibberish."},{"rating":"1","title":"self centered","review":"I was excited to start this devotional, but was very disappointed. The message of this devotional is incredibly self-focused. It's written as if Jesus is talking to you, and I find that strange.

I have found many other better devotionals that encourage me to grow in my faith and love for Christ and others without causing me to constantly be obsessed with myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, bible thumper crap","review":"Someone [Who didn't know me very well at all] gave me this crap.

You can take it anywhere, it's only 5x7\\", and hardbacked. I don't think I would recommend a paperback, if there is ever one made- it probably would fall apart to easily. We've had or given away 3 of them already. I only have 1 copy left-it's that powerful! My mom & I reccomend it to anyone struggling, going through the \\"Valley of the Shadow of Death\\", or just needing inspiration every morning or evening, with the reasurrance that Christ died for us and is speaking into our lives.

What I can attest to in the sense of longevity is that I feel assured I can re-read this daily devotional year after year and still feel the Power and Presence of each message. The author's style at first caught me somewhat off guard with its tone but soon found my attitude toward it to be \\"mood setting\\" in that I now know a sense of calm will come over me as I read. The overall message to this point is one of a truly positive relationship and desire on the part of our Lord to place all of our trust in Him. We are expected to err but must trust in His love and support of each of us. Each devotional is accompanied by supporting Bible references and serves as a great way to \\"get one's daily dose\\" of the Bible. One of the best gifts I have been given.

I long for all people to have deep communion with Christ. I believe God has given us His Word so we can do this. God has \\"once for all\\" delivered the faith to us (Jude 3). Sarah Young says she is speaking Jesus' Word. She might not believe her words are inspired (and I believe her) but she still says her words are Jesus' messages.

Grace and peace to you all."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Christian\\" Horoscopes","review":"The entries in this book are filled with vague lines that you can make fit to whatever your situation is.

Rather, respond calmly and confidently, remembering that I am with you.\\" Compare this to my horoscope for today: \\"An encounter could bring turmoil to a relationship; discuss it immediately to diffuse the tension.\\" Insert \\"with me\\" after the word 'discuss' and it could be an entry in this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus calling","review":"I love this book it speaks to my heart every morning.

Which in turn has led me into God's word with a renewed sensitivity and desire to read the Bible on a daily basis. I recommend it for anyone who wants to grow spiritually and become more attuned to listening to God directly. We are so busy today and lean too much on a church service, radio, and commentaries to tell us what the Bible is saying. Although it is not written by Jesus personally, Ms. Young has made the effort to include scripture as her basis. This leads the reader to his words and the Word, and much to ponder each day."},{"rating":"2","title":"My devotions","review":"I love this book I can not figure out how it knows what goes on in my life.

The author himself (in another book) says that we need to have teachable attitudes and be humble (he also says that we should stand up for the truth against things that are totally unBiblical, so it's not about believing everything either).

This means that the atlas easily fits into binder pockets, folders, brief cases, and back packs. When I went to the bookstore, it seemed like most of the other atlases were larger than this one and therefore inconvenient to carry around.Another great thing about this atlas is its index. The index is easy to use and therefore makes finding landmarks a simple task.The maps found within the book are clear. However it does take a little time to get adjusted to the presentation of the maps.The best thing about this atlas is that it is cheap! If you are using an atlas for a course in school, you don't want to break your bank acount.The atlas also has useful facts listed in its inside covers.

Their website lets you request an RMA so you can return it for replacement with no questions asked, but from other reviews I don't expect a replacement that will last very long.

Andrea Kane brought life and personality to both characters. This set had a strong storyline of the strength of women--especially Breanna, who had the quiet but iron fist type of will and determination. Each woman found their perfect match in Damen and Royce and the couples were perfectly suited for each other. Altogether, you could not put the book down!

In short, do NOT buy these headphones; while not ill-conceived, they are poorly designed and flimsily made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy unless you want to be part of the class action lawsuit","review":"Purchased two separate units, both of which have failed in exactly the same way as detailed in the CNET discussion forms.

The fix was replacement of the motherboard at a cost of $484.

I have lost my life's work for trusting the namebrand Maxtor. Seagate bought them out. So far, Seagate can replace my drive but cannot recover my files free of charge. In fact, they charge $1,400 to do so. Therefore, I have had to resort to joining a possible class action lawsuit. Be forewarned - there are no guarantees for any hard drive on the market. If you must get this particular drive I highly recommend backing it up to DVD or another drive as often as possible, unless you intend to use the drive for temprary scratch files such as video editing, which it is capable of doing so with the extremely fast data transfer speeds, given its 16MB cache.

They blatantly promote one home exchange agency which, although around for a long time, I wouldn't think is the best for everyone, certainly not now when there are so many alternatives (most much cheaper) on the internet.I hope that other writers with a knowledge of the subject will take on the challenge to write a good book on home exchange as I'm sure there is the interest and this one is not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged slippers received and returned","review":"This was to be my third new pair in less than three years.

It's not your run of the mill costume for kids. The quality is great too. Looks like an authentic astronaut costume, what with the NASA patches and all. It does run a tad small, and I took the advise of other reviews and bought size 4/6, although my little boy is only 3.5yo and he's on the slim side.

Trust me that says a lot because my husband and son are both very picky when it comes to baseball hats and will only wear those that look nice (usually only those issued by baseball teams). The suit is thin, so something should be worn underneath. The nice thing is the child can dress in layers under the suit depending on weather. It is white, so don't expect it to stay pristine because children will be children and white does not stay white. It does fit true-to-size and is easy to get in and out of.

Unless you are a fan of the actors I'd give this one a pass.As far as performances I really can't say too much positive about any of them. Bachchan has played this role a million times before and has done so better. Rani doesn't have the depth or the sensitivity to portray these types of characters. My opinion of her performance here is the same as with KANK. I don't find myself sympathizing with her characters despite the bucketfull of tears she's shed in both roles. Salman was playing Salman. Seriously, why do directors keep casting him. His relationship with Rani's character had zero credibility with me. John Abraham was okay but besides looking good, he really doesn't bring much to the character.

This could be their toughest assignment ever and one of them may fall.James Riordan does a much better job with this one (yes, he is the author and not Bill Myers). Very little in the way of facts to get wrong like in his earlier contributions to the series. There is the standard question of what is going on with the kids and their school that they never seem to attend anymore.My real disappointment this time comes from the author's insistence on using the term Indian and not Native American. If we are to truly love our neighbor, should we refer to them by a derogatory word? I think not.While this is Riordan's best effort in the series, it is also his last. Bob DeMoss will be taking over the series with the next book (The Wiccan)."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't get what i ordered","review":"I ordered this book from New Chapter Recycling, Inc and did not get the book that i saw on the computer.

He is a chess lover, and we wanted to get him something a little different. Chaturanga was perfect, since it is the precursor to chess. He has enjoyed the game. All of us were impressed with the bookshelf edition. It is an attractive box. We are very pleased with every aspect of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying shortcomings","review":"While the pieces are appealing, the playing surface is marred by the company logo and other irrelevant markers. A chaturanga playing surface was traditionally made of non-chequered cloth (although you can use any kind of 8 x 8 playing surface). I would therefore have preferred a playing surface without logos and other markers. What is worse, is that I received a copy of the game where the black colour had two kings and no horse. Returning the game to the US would have been an expensive exercise, and writing to the supplier and producer asking for a black horse did not help. No reply, no service. So, although the game is interesting in itself, this version and the service behind it are not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"CURTAIN GOES UP ... AND RIGHT BACK DOWN. 25 TIMES.","review":"It would be something wonderful to say that Steven Suskin's book is an entirely delightful, dishy, gossipy guilty pleasure. However there is something ultimately heartbreaking about the 25 Broadway shows he chronicles, produced to entertain us and make everyone connected with them rich --- and each failing ... mightily, miserably and very expensively. Suskin illustrates each example with a contemporary newspaper or magazine article, explaining the birth (and death) pains with often witty commentary. Gore Vidal once said that it's not enough to succeed, one must see others fail. But in this case, there is a sense of overkill. Ultimately, the divas, directors, egos, hysterics and fights all go to prove that sometimes people have no business in show business."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did Suskind get authorship credit on this book?","review":"If you are looking for a fresh look at some of Broadway's bomb, do not stop here.Suskind wrote very little in this book of previously-published material by other people. This book is more accuratly \\"compiled by\\" than \\"by\\" him.I refrain from entirely discounting this book because it publishes (more or less) in their entirety sources that were used by much better authors by their much better books. It may be a reference for theatre students, but there isn't much else to recommend this book.And don't get me wrong; flops are a source of morbid fascination for me. This is why I am so disappointed with this particlar volume -- there's nothing in it that you can't get in other, better written, better compiled, and better organized tomes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Compared to the wit and flair I had expected, I found this volume boring and dull. It is largely a compilation (with Suskin providing brief notes) of theatrical reviews. Approach this with care if, as I did, you searched on a star's name and found a mention in this book - it may be only one line.I had expected great humour, inside knowledge, entertaining stories of the backstage. Frankly, I wish I had kept the receipt - I would have returned it the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble with 2nd Act trouble","review":"I was extremely disapointed with this book, having read most of the essays contained therein from other sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"endlessly fascinating","review":"I had my doubts about this book, especially based on some of the feedback I read, but I have to say I'm very happy I bought it. The best articles here present wonderful fly-on-the-wall observations about the musical theatre process, and there aren't any articles that are less than fascinating accounts of what bombed when and how. This is an important and entertaining collection that shows that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. Fascinating stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Strikes Out!","review":"If you really want the scoop on B'way shows, look for a couple other titles by the same author: \\"Opening Nights on Broadway\\", and it's companion, \\"More Opening Nights on Broadway\\". They're far better. What's missing in this book is all the great detail at a glance: Opening night date/year, length of run, original cast listing and snippets of numerous reviews by the major critics and publications, as well as a paragraph or two of interesting trivia. \\"Second Act Trouble\\" is limited to little more than a couple dozen shows in as many chapters each made up of long narrative, as opposed to the reference guide-style of the two other works mentioned above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My wife just received this book and was very disappointed. It is only 44 pages of content with the first 17 pages dealing with history. There are only 18 substantial recipes in the whole book. This book is very thin and almost seems designed as a children's book, but with a ~[price]pricetag. Not worth the shipping to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good simple, easy to use Vietnamese Cookbook","review":"I liked this cookbook and can recommend it to someone looking for his or her first introduction to Vietnamese cooking. This book is one of a series \\"easy menu ethnic cookbooks\\" published by Lerner Publications Company. It introduces Vietnamese cooking and features some well-known Vietnamese recipes such as spring rolls, Vietnamese fried rice, and my favorite, Bun bo sao (Vietnamese noodle bowl with beef). In addition, the cookbook includes information on the land, history, and holidays of the country.I have a copy of Nicole Routhier's Foods of Vietnam, which also covers some of the same dishes; however, Ms. Routhier's cookbook is more suited to the cook that has quite a bit of time available to prepare her recipes. Cooking the Vietnamese Way is more suited to the everyday cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids books? Hahh!","review":"This might have seemed like a children's book because, believe it or not, IT IS!

Our stove timer/clock died and this one is magnetic so it stays on the back of the stove. Since it has two timers it offers more than the original timer did. The only thing I don't particularly like about it is the beep it makes as you set the numbers. It is kind of loud. But it's fine for telling you the timer has gone off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunbeam","review":"I use this product 12 hours each day at work. A Sunbeam I was using before worked excellent.

Unfortunately, this books contains information that is rather out-dated. Most damagingly, the treatment here is really quite superficial. It may be useful for those who wish to have an overview of the matter, but it won't prove to be of great use to those who're looking forward to a more scholarly treatment of the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful tale of love and loss","review":"Reading this book was an emotionally draining experience-the kind that always comes after reading a thrilling literary novel. Many of the characters in this book feel loss in one sense or another, but it's the way Crombie conveys this that make the book so potent. With magnificent characters and startling plot twists, this elaborate whodunit keeps you guessing up until the end. Even though I was disappointed by the identity of the killer, the book was still worth it. Superintendent Duncan Kincaid gets an unexpected call from his ex-wife, who is writing a biography of ill-fated poet. Asked to look into the poet's suicide, Duncan finds some inconsistencies but the police refuse to reopen the case. Suddenly his ex-wife is murdered; poisoned just like the poet. Now Duncan and his partner and lover, Sergeant Gemma James, must find out who murdered the poet in order to expose his ex-wife's killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and riveting","review":"I've been a fan of Ms. Crombie's since I first picked up one of her books but this is by far her best. I felt every emotion her characters felt and found myself not wanting to put it down, even at one in the morning. The writing in this book is on par with the great P.D. James and I anxiously look forward to Ms. Crombie's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I like cozies, and I've enjoyed the first 4 books in this series. They're well-plotted mysteries, with interesting characterizations.But this one is disappointing. I've read the first 75 pages, and so far, at least, there's a great deal of description -- of places and thoughts -- and virtually nothing related to a mystery.In other words, it's boring.Some other readers have stated in their reviews here that the first part of the book is slow, but I think they've understated the reality. It's extremely slow, uninteresting and almost dreary.Has the author come to take her readers for granted?I think I'll just skip to the end (something I do very rarely), and hope that the sixth volume in the series returns to the excellence of the first four."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real Hit","review":"Her writing is extraordinary; paints a beautiful picture of the English countryside and her prose is wonderful.

Also, authors like Brown, Poznansky and others mention Tchaikovsky's homosexuality, but don't explain or stress why. My thoughts here are about Tchaikovsky and his sexuality. Some people may misunderstand it or simply not know what caused it. You may not find this interesting, but I do. If Tchaikovsky's sexuality is mentioned, authors should at least try to figure out and stress why. I've read different sources on Tchaikovsky and psychology. Why isn't this psychology stressed and emphasized by Tchaikovsky's authors? So, like Brown, I don't think Tchaikovsky's authors tried to emphasize why Tchaikovsky was homosexual, and I think they should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Loves It","review":"this is a great toy for my dog.

We couldn't use them and know I am getting ready to get my money back!!!!! It is a shame that Amazon stated they would come from one company and used the cheaper one. I still got a Great Price, but they couldn't be used. Do NOT order these from Oriental Trading!!!

She agreed that this CD is in a class by itself, as current music goes. There are lots of singer-songwriters out there (and I'm one), but this actually says things, both musically and lyrically, that nobody else is saying, or, at least, not quite this way. -- Definitely deserves greater exposure ... I've just added it to my Pandora playlist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated, swinging Billy May and Sinatra...","review":"May and Sinatra's 'Come Fly with Me' is the best known of their collaborations, but 'Swing Along with Me' (or 'Sinatra Swings', if you read the CD spine) has plenty of firepower for listeners who like their Sinatra hot. May had a reputation for off-the-wall arrangements, and 'Swing Along' is no exception.'Curse of an Aching Heart' is relentless, but with great lyrics. 'Granada' is one of the loudest things they ever recorded, and a lot of fun, while 'Moonlight on the Ganges' brings a lot of brass and a huge gong at the end. 'You're Noboby Til Somebody Loves You' is wonderful.The confusingly similar title (probably the 5th or 6th 'Swingin' Sinatra album) does not help this album, and the liner notes on the original CD issue are the skimpiest anywhere, but a few Sinatraphiles consider this more enjoyable than the 'Come Fly with Me' album -- high praise indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinatra is swingin' again!","review":"Not as good as previous swingin' albums, but quite alright. Songs are arranged by Billy May."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best work, but still better than most","review":"Sinatra is in his swinging form on this one, and has a pretty good set list for this album.

In both cases I was making cookies (with a lot of butter). I didn't add any additional spray/lube/butter to the mat, because I thought that was the point of using them. Theoretically cleanable in a dishwasher, but they're so floppy and large that it's impractical. I left them soak in the sink and the dough did come right off after a few minutes of soaking. But... how is this better than a regular cookie sheet? I can put that in the dishwasher. A cooking salesperson today told me she had the silpat (or similar) and they worked great.

The authors attempt at humor and light heartedness just makes the material more confusing. Also the books lack of any color makes it much less attractive and useful than other books that show their graphs and diagrams in color. The color helps distinguish better between lines and other material. I would not recommend this book, and if you have a choice don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"all time fav of Cathy Maxwell","review":"I'm not really good at writing, but I just wanted to say that this book is one of the best I've read and I've read quite a few. this book is on my top 10 list. I don't see how any one could be dissappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartoonish","review":"While not a necessarily bad book, I found this book to not be worth the time it took to read it. Cathy Maxwell writes a lot like Julie Garwood - often anachronistic, rather silly at times; Some of the conversations had me rolling my eyes in exasperation. Again, it's an ok book, I just like a historical romance that's more intelligently written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"The narrator has a good voice and does the characters justice. The story itself is pretty decent too. Aiden Black, Earl of Tybalt is thought \\"mad\\" by London society and has been living in Scotland. His sister, forever convinced she'll die before he weds and has an heir, finds him a wife by proxy and marries him off. Anne Burnett is a poor orphan on the fringe of society and apparently the only person desperate enough in the ton to engage in this type of marriage. Set against the memories of the Rebellion of 1745 and the massacre at Caloudin, you get more Scottish rebellion and angst. What you don't get is when and how and why Ann and Aiden fall in love. But if you can get past that...it's entertaining enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"The plot is very promising and the first half of the book is quite decent, but the second half was just one big 'blah'. There is no real chemistry between Anne and Aiden and the first sex scene happens way, way into the book. This is not necessary bad, but there really was no spark between them and the author focuses on everything else than their relationship. As the other reviewer here suggests, it almost seems that the author was too uncomfortable to write about real feelings and sexual interactions. This book can be easily read by a 14 year old if you go and cross the two page sex scenes out.Maybe it's just me, but I like my romance novels to have some steam and real passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives a warm glimpse into Meher Baba's cause","review":"A fine glimpse at the life of Meher Baba. This was the first book I read on Meher Baba, and it left me wanting more. It tends to have that effect I think. The life of activity is orderly presented, with photos gracefully deployed to facilitate a strong identification with the nobility of Meher Baba's cause. The extended messages (some of the many famous messages of Meher Baba) in the appendix are all the more meaningful after reading the drama within the biographical material. - over -"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointed","review":"I am a bit disappointed in this book.

This book does have some instruction but very lacking. The few templates are pretty congested on some pages. In my opinion this is an author who is showing other peoples quilts and not how too make each one. They are gorgeous quilts don't get me wrong I just wanted detailed instructions how to make the quilt as shown. It has suggestions but no real directions. This book is definitely not for the beginner quilt maker. Had I looked at the book in a store I would have never bought it.

I highly reccommend this to anyong who liked serials, and strong plot lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something...??","review":"This review has absolutely nothing to do with the show itself, as I'm completely obsessed and love it. I'm actually coming here to buy all of the seasons for my brother for Christmas to get him hooked too. I'm confused -- why does it cost roughly $90 to purchase all 3 seasons together, but if you buy each season individually, it comes to about half the price (about $45 for you math whizzes). Am I missing something? Um, I think I'm cool with buying them separately and saving $45.

Just be careful that you don't make a mistake and spend extra money - save it and then spend it on season 4 when it is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Album","review":"This album is a true blessing. Casting Crowns has a knack for writing songs that every Christian can realte to at one time or another. Songs like Who Am I, Here I Go Again, What if His People Pray and so many others are incredible. Production is tight, vocals are good, and lyrically sound. And this package has a DVD which is not as extensive as I would have like to see, but it does give a good background introduction to Casting Crowns. I recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD Side won't play","review":"If you are expecting to get a CD with the DVD as a bonus DO NOT BUY THIS!!! The CD side has some type of copy protection that keeps computers, Media Centers, and some newer cd/dvd players from recognizing disk. Forget about fair use or using this on a portable player. I've bought hundreds of CDs and this is the only one I can't play. I'd give this a zero star or lower if Amazon allowed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Book but perhaps in need of an update?","review":"I've had Ms. Bubel's book for over 20 years, my copy is dog-eared and falling apart at this point from being referred to so often. There isn't much to add to the other superlative reviews as this is still considered the definitive work on seed-starting for the home gardener, and indeed, perhaps for the market gardener as well. When in the throes of winter in February, reading this book reminds one that Spring will arrive, sooner or later, and that all manner of tasks must be attended to. I am giving the book four stars vice five because perhaps it would be worthwhile for the author to consider issuing a second, updated edition that perhaps incorporates new developments and technology available to gardeners since 1988. The book was contemporary in 1991; it is now 2011; a fresh look at the content may be worthwhile. A new, revised edition would be welcomed and immediately purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I got my order fast only took 2 days.

The advice in this book seems to be written for the gardeners of a 100 years ago. And it's way too verbose. If properly edited the book would be about 1/4 of its current size, it would be direct and to the point instead of constantly rambling, and would incorporate useful information about contemporary products and techniques.

Even when things are going wrong in their songs, like on \\"If This is It?\\" you can't help but sing-along and grin mindlessly. From the distinctive combination of roughness and melody of Lewis's vocals to the solid backing of his talented band (Whatever happened to those great sax breaks that were so common in the 80's?) Huey Lewis and The News rarely disappoints. This collection runs from the band's breakthrough second recording to the DUETS soundtrack. A few quibbles...I think they could have thrown in a cut from the debut album when the band was a little less polished and why the songs are not in chronological order just irritates me. (and that's probably just me!) This band won't change your life, but they definitely have the ability to brighten your mood; sometimes that's exactly what music should do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Hits","review":"Great music.

An eye opener, a must read!","review":"I saw the interview the author did on Tony Brown's Journal, and was curious and impressed, with the subject. Evanz, did meticulous and pain staking research to come up with this one. I am so glad he did it so our people, especially the different church factions, can start to realize that Malik El Hajj Shabazz was correct when he said \\"they don't hang you because you muslim, or baptist, they hang you because you're black!\\" Nuff said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evanzz's bias unfortunately leads to many conjectures.","review":"Although Evanzz provides a large amount of data in this book, he wastes too much time on the conjecture and biasis of his own ideas in areas where his research lacked. Because of the complexity of views on the subject, this book should serve as a suplement for others in its category.For the true historian, a good balance to Evanzz's manuscript would be Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan's narrative of events which led to the tragic murder of Malcolm X.. \\"The Murder of Malcolm X\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Very interesting perspective on Malcolm X's assassination. Karl Evanzz provides (for the most part) an objective portrait of Malcolm, his followers and his enemies.

But, when Jem discovers a secret about her mysterious tutor, her hatred turns into love, thus beginning the romance. I've never been a fan of too much romance - one or two love scenes are enough. That's why I was hesitant about looking at this book. But, trusting the background of the story, I read it, and LOVED it! I'm glad there wasn't too much romance, cause too much just isn't good.

Ann Rinaldi has an amazing ability to tie history together with things that are interesting to young readers. I was very interested by the relationship between Jemima Emerson, the main character, and the other characters in the book. In the beginning, Jem is a 15-year-old girl who runs off on her tutor, John Reid, making her parents worried and getting into trouble. Once the Revolutionary War begins and her brothers join the army, she realizes that she must grow up. When her mother falls ill, she takes over the housework and running her father's shop.

She is a sassy, free spirited girl who hates having to act like one. Instead of going to the local girls acadamy, she gets tutored by John Reid who she loathes even more than old King George himself! She is a true Patriot and will do anything for the cause and can't stand the fact that he is a noted Loyalist. But as the Revolutionary War occurs, and things change Jem's feelings change a lot and some have to deal with even John in a romantic way. I have been reading Rinaldi for a couple of years and with this read you will never get bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Revolutionary War Novel","review":"\\"Time Enough for Drums\\" was another great novel by Rinaldi - I would say her best!15-year-old Jemima Emerson is a feisty, headstrong Patriot girl during the Revolutionary War, constantly getting into trouble.

But when her brother and boyfriend go off to war, and the war and everything with it comes dangerously near to her family, she learns John's secret, and his freedom is now in her hands...This was a great, exciting novel, with everything to make a well liked story - romance, adventure, intrigue, strong characters, a historical background - anyone aged 12 and up would enjoy it, I'm sure!

However, some of the jokes and puns start to feel a little bit flat, and the 'surprise ending' really isn't much of a surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, if i liked it.....","review":"i am deathly, violently afraid of spiders and i oppose their very existence. usually i cant even stand to hear people talk about them. i read this book, and i absolutely fell in love with Jumper, who is basically a creature from my nightmares. a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit better than the rest","review":"This was my favorite of the Xanth books, mostly because of the relationship between Dor and Jumper (the spider which was accidentally sucked into the tapestry with Dor). I mostly remember the quest Dor goes on to find a potion of restoration for a zombie, while fighting for his feelings for Millie (his nanny in the present and the woman he's protecting in the past), whose \\"talent\\" is magical sex appeal.Not worth delving into the sorrid land of Xanth for this one novel, either. Plus, given the rest of the series, I suspect there are a number of sexual references that I've forgotten, something that should not be in stories marketted for young teenage boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen Critic","review":"This is not the good version of the classics by Jane Austin, you want the masterpiece not the BBC version."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I thought a Janie Austen Collection would have to be good, even if it wasn't the more popular films that I had seen on PBS.

Had I not read the novel, I wouldn't have known what was going on. The DVD was like a fast forward and eliminated the development of the characters. The one character, Isabella, was important, but she was portrayed as very cheesy and very briefly. She was the reason I bought the DVD. Not all of Jane Austen's maddening characters get their just due, but I was well satisfied with Isabella's.The actors were mediocre but even though the DVD left out huge chunks and chopped the rest, what was left to view was like the novel.

(Be aware this series is made up of older, classic versions.) Though from a script and character point of view there are some new insights, you have to get past the low budget production quality and that's not easy.

My wife and I saw The DeVinci Code in a theater and I couldn't understand what the female lead was saying most of the time because of her mumbling. It wasn't until I got the DVD that I could understand what she was saying. I enjoy English TV shows like Midsomer Murders and have bought several sets but because I couldn't access the captions, I haven't watched them because of the accents.

However, one learns that the BBC has a number of different versions of the Austen books out and they are not all created equal. This set with productions ranging from 1971 to 1987 is generally irritating and soap opera-ish because most of the scenes are shot live on a sound stage. The only one that we could actually watch to the end was Northanger Abbey which was mostly filmed on location and is the last made in the collection. So beware if you see an Austen version that you like, mark down the actors/actresses so you don't wind up with a different, inferior production!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super service, very pleased :-)","review":"Thanks a lot for the DVD.

The PBS series is literally hours and hours of drama and laughter. In a Jane Austen movie there a lot of detail from the books that is left out, which is understandable since you can only fit so much in a two hours.

I hope you enjoy the collection as much as I."},{"rating":"2","title":"For true fans of the novels","review":"This collection will likely please Austen readers who enjoy seeing the novels faithfully and more completely portrayed than can be accomplished in a 2 or 3 hour movie. The productions are like plays, with little editing or background music, strong on dialogue. The characterizations are more often true to the novels than those seen in feature films, Fanny Price in particular. If you read Austen, love the language, and find the era and society portrayed in the novels interesting, you will probably enjoy these productions.

But there are no subtitles for the hearing-impaired and people for whom English is a second language. It is very important to be able to catch the nuances of the language and style of Jane Austen, and without the subtitles, some of us miss meanings that we need to hear in order to understand the story.

And four bucks is a fair price to pay for a two song single, especially considering that this is the DEFINITIVE original version of Into the Groove, one of Madonna's best, most induring ( and endearing ) dance classics. A deceptively simple song, with tossed off lyrics, but something about it just gels unbelievably. This song STILL sounds fresh, after 20 years. The version of Into the Grooove you get on her Immaculate Collection disc is remixed and simply butchered by Shep Pettibone, the music is sped up and the whole thing is edited down to just over 3 minutes. Here is the original 4 minute plus version. Great to find this one still in print, I can add it to my collection to burn myself my own Immaculate Collection of Madonna's greatest hits. Buy it before it's gone, and you have to pay the ridiculous import price."},{"rating":"2","title":"still bumping","review":"this is the Madonna era of music making that i still dig the most and Into the Groove was one of my cuts back in the day.

However, his writing style is almost stream-of-consciousness. The nuggets of true value in this book must be gleaned from excessively wordy paragraphs and multiple tangents to explain trivialities.

This book is exciting and fun while at the same time widely informative and revealing. It gives the reader a complete look at our modern economy. Calling it readable would be an understatement.

Having read the book several times, children can choose their favorite image from the book and draw it. This can be made into a bulletin board at school or can just serve as an enriching parent-child activity. Seeing the images flash through the train window is a wonderful reminder of summer vacations and family trips. I am going to be using this book with my kindergarten class' back to school unit which is based on Watty Piper's classic, The Little Engine That Could. Another book to use with The Train Ride is Freight Train by Donald Crews. Hop aboard for some exciting reading with your young child."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Grave to Death","review":"As my 1998 collection of poems was entitled \\"Grave of an Amiable Child,\\" this title naturally caught my eye. It's a well-meaning, idealistic attempt to make reading about (and remedying)deplorable urban conditions more immediate in the dramatic context of a mystery. Unfortunately, it's very over-loaded on good intentions (interfaith marriage, interracial adoption, etc.), and it doesn't sound as if the author knew the neighborhood well.It's a good summer beach book, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"What great look!","review":"Award winning WLBT-TV weather anchor and filmmaker Walt Grayson offers a loving, personal look at the river country of Mississippi. The historic section includes Port Gibson, a town General Grant said was too pretty to burn, Natchez, the wealthiest and most infamous antebellum American city, and Vicksburg, where the famous battle was fought. Covered here are the antebellum mansions, country waterfalls, oddball mailboxes, lovely abandoned churches and cemeteries, the abandoned ghost town of Rodney, and most interestingly, the little known history of Woodville, where the Old Southwest really began. Grayson's narrative is down home all the way, and this will make the perfect Christmas present for those who love stories and beautiful color photos to back them up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside the core","review":"Volume 3 of a series of lectures that Rudolf Steiner held during his last year before he died is a peak of his spiritual research through many years.

His work was that good. His voice is his number one asset and it is shown off to great effect here. And of course, his superior keyboarding abilities are also displayed.Boomchild is a five star recording in every sense of the word. The title track sums up in short, spot-on phrases, the entire baby boom generation.Harry's Hands is a commentary on the working man that easily holds its own with those by Billy Joel (Allentown) and Springsteen (Born in the USA). Oustide Looking in Again is a haunting song of loss. Won't Go Wasted is similar in theme with a more hopeful outcome.The Best is Yet to come is a synth driven rocker that gets you on your feet.The rest of the tracks are equally top notch. Not a bad song on this entire CD.It is a must-have collector's item from an artist of superior talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title says it all","review":"This was the best book I'd ever used for learning French. It starts out very basic, but by the end your dealing with rather advanced French that's understandable because this book is so effective at helping you unravel the mysteries of grammar. I highly recommend it if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As great on paper as he is on radio!","review":"This is a terrific book...warm, sad, interesting, funny. I have listened to Jonathan Schwartz on the radio since 1967 and his WNEW-FM days. But you don't have to be a fan of his from the radio to appreciate this fine memoir. Jonathan includes touching stories about his father--the incredible composer Arthur Schwartz--as well as his mother, his witch of a stepmother, and his own complex relationships, including with Frank Sinatra.Great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny Autobiography","review":"Several times during my reading of this book I said to myself, \\"This is one weird kid.\\"As so many other people in these reviews stated, Jonathan Schwartz is a great singer and DJ with a huge knowledge of his subject. But he comes across to me as thoroughly unlikeable in this book.A good deal of the book talks about how terrible things have been , yet he never lacked for money. His dad and stepmom may have been quite odd (or eveil, in his stepmom's case), but he never lacked any material things.Speaking of odd, didn't they take pictures in the Schwartz house? None are in this book, I would have liked to see some of his dad.BTW, didn't Jonathan have one friend in any of the schools he went to?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Writer Of Note(s)","review":"I first came to know Jonathan Schwartz as the writer of liner notes for Sinatra CDs. Thanks to him I will always hear \\"The Long Night\\" as a sequel to \\"One For My Baby.\\" Then I read his thoughtful essay in the Frank Sinatra reader, where I learned of such things as Sinatra's seemingly random phone calls; the way he could validate a man's existence in a day. And then turn to stone the next.Anyway, when I saw this book reviewed in Entertainment Weekly I knew I wanted to read it and I'm glad I did; I liked it a lot.Unlike some reviewers here, I'm not one of Schwartz's listeners. But all that means is that I'm not absolutely sure whether the voice I hear in my head is completely right. But tis' enough, 'twill serve. The love of music, and the stories from his unique background come through loud and clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character growth","review":"I have so far read all but the last in the Song & Swords series. I am greatly enjoying the character development with Arilyn and Danilo. Elaine has a wonderful way of expressing the uniqueness that is the Forgotten Realms, though I would recommend reading the short stories in The Best of the Realms III that pertain to Arilyn and Danilo before reading this novel or soon after. It helped explain what happened between the previous novel \\"Silver Shadows\\". I do wish the final novel would have made it out, but that is another topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fall from previous form","review":"Same characters, less flavor, less humor, less tension, less substance to the plot. Is EC tired of Waterdeep's limitations?Waterdeep's setting has its own flaws, but it cannot be blamed for the lack of a dominant theme in this story. It seemed at first that EC was addressing the contemporary problem of psychoactive drugs, but that got lost about halfway through the book, as did most plot threads. Since when did Evermeet gryphon riders hire out as caravan guards? A more plausible explanation for their presence would have been nice. Cassandra Thann? Is EC trying to say that we never really know our own parents? Perhaps true, but clumsily handled. Her stories are usually more tightly written, and I missed Danilo's normally droll wit.They can't all be gems. This exception may prove the rule, as EC usually spins a well woven yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Adventure","review":"I absolutely devoured this book! Elaine Cunningham does not disappoint with this, her latest treasure. I do agree that there must be a sequel, though Ms. Cunningham's novels usually do end with the characters still striving forward, moving from adventure to adventure. Even if you haven't read the other Harper novels that involve Danilo and Arilyn (\\"Elfshadow,\\" \\"Elfsong,\\" \\"Silver Shadows\\" - they're all wonderful!), I believe this book stands nicely on its own. Bravo, EC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and 1/2 stars","review":"This an acceptable entry level book to fantasy, it doesn't have any real depth or much in the way of originality. If your looking for a moderately enjoyable book that you can blow through in an evening then its right up your alley.Cunningham shows some promise, but she tends to be lazy it seems. This book had some fairly decent ideas, but what could have been a stellar story instead just left me wondering \\"that's all?'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly enjoyable Arilyn and Danilo story--more please!!!","review":"\\"Dream Spheres\\" is a true triumph--for Elaine Cunningham and for her characters. I found their continuing development to be the true highlight of the story, though the plot was quite gripping as well. I enjoyed the focus on Danilo's family--something previously only hinted at. Perhaps my only criticism comes with the inclusion of Bronwyn and Ebenezer. Though I enjoyed \\"Thornhold\\" as well, I felt that their presence beyond the initial meeting at the Curious Past was a little too much. Nevertheless, I do understand how they fit into the plot, and am content. I eagerly await the next installment of Arilyn and Danilo--after all, the full extent of the war in Tethyr has yet to be explored (as summarized in the \\"Lands of Intrigue\\" boxed set). Thank you again Mrs. Cunningham--I can't wait for your next work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Moonstone","review":"As I read through a few of the other reviews here I felt I had to give my opinion. I read this novel the first time in 2 days. A few weeks later I read it again. Both times I found this work, as with all her other novels an improvement from the last. Her beautiful use of words and description are amazing. What's more amazing is how she can keep focused on the plot and interesting character developement while being so desciptive. No other Forgotten Realms author comes close to the complicated, detailed, evolving characters she creates. A top rated novel in my opinion and I eagerly await the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the experienced E. Cunningham reader...","review":"Definately not for a first time reader. It would be confusing to someone not previously introduced to the characters within. However, it gives wonderfull insight into some of my favorite characters. Elaith's character has always been interesting but always been left a mystery. In *Elfsong* you got to understand his character, but never the reasons for his behavior. In this book, you get those explanations. The plot was twisted and full of surprises at the end. Elaine showes a lot of growth in her characters in this edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant music","review":"Music is like a menu there is so much to choose from.

My bindings are excellent; however, I often struggle to get my pieces to meet and my work product to lie flat.

I wish that one of my beginning quilting teachers had taught these simple methods and discussed some of the tools (such as using a non-steam iron) recommended by Sally Collins.

But I re-read the book after several years and find that it stands on its own merits. Bujold is trying something different, and her readers need to let her. The beginning of the book is a bit tentative but by the second chapter, the plot is coming together and Bujold is writing as well as she ever did.

The author's give real-life examples and, thus, make learning fun. For example, when one is introducing someone, my children dressed as an older person, a dad and mother. They would then practice introducing several people in orderof importance. I.E. older people first, ladies and then men. The author's suggested doing this as a way to add fun to the practice. A second example, is practicing prepositions. In this activity, the author suggested making a circle on the floor with a jumping rope. Then using commands with prepositions. For example, I told my children to put their hand in the rope. Other activities include reading classic fables, which are included in the book, vocabulary and thinking skills, language games, memorizing, learning about telephones, enjoying poetry and learning on trips.

Charlie Whop!! and Soldier Chant are worse than you could ever imagine. The fifth track aint that bad neihter, there's Juvenile and BG who save the track. This whining girl definitely doesnt need a bigger album (this one being only 21 minutes)..

Mothers hurting their own children for attention. I think that is why some people have a hard time believing Tara Reid could be guilty because it is such an odd disorder.

I was disappointed with Cruel Deception by Gregg Olsen. The flow of the book was terrible; he jumps through time back and forth, back and forth. He focuses more on the prosecutor than the family. He introduces so many doctors, from so many states from so many time periods it was greatly confusing. I got the feeling that several of the chapters were already discussed in other parts of the book and I was rereading the book again.The story itself was intriguing, but again the author focused too much on the prosecutor than on the people who were involved with Tanya and her family.

They are extremely comfortable, well made, and look good, and I wear them all the time when I'm at home. My only negative comment is that they do get dirty easily and they're hard to clean. That's why I've bought several pairs. I still use the old ones, leaving a pair near the front door and a pair near the back door to make a dash to the mailbox or to grab some firewood. The latest pair I use only indoors and am trying to be careful not to spill anything on them (I cook a lot and an accidental spill will marr the deerskin. Yes I'm a messy cook.).

True love finds out he is a murderer and comes to her rescue. To foil plans for the wedding true love and damsel marry, but true love won't consummate because he wants to save her honor.Bring in the personal maid, whose sister was murdered by the villain, lots of cat and mouse chase scenes, etc...Bottom line: there are much better romance books to choose from!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great insight to hip-hop around the world","review":"if you are into hip-hop this is a great book to give you perspective of the hip-hop scenes around the world. really good read and interesting to see how the rest of the world has adopted hip-hop in their own way"},{"rating":"1","title":"would never buy anymore of this","review":"I just baked a loaf of banana bread in my loaf baker and the entire bottom stuck to the pan when I turned it over.I am throwing it out and will never buy another piece of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one really cooks!","review":"Not often I buy a 90s album on which every track is not only strong but memorable.

The only thing he has done is tear off the \\"8\\" portion of the ball, which looks like it could make it weaker in the long run. This is just as strong as the Kong treat ball, which he also loves, but this is easier for him to keep in his mouth and bite down on.The only complaint, other than the 8 coming off, is the Orbee products come with tags attached, and even after cutting the plastic that holds them on there it leaves a potentially sharp object that could poke and pester not just the dog, but anyone dealing with the toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 out of 5 chew factor","review":"This has a different exterior feel than others, slick.

I just found their speculations on the Aymara language a bit silly, since it is merely a member of the Andean family and ultimately part of the Amerind macro-family, and certainly not an \\"artificially constructed\\" language. If they are correct as to the location of Atlantis, another mystery would be the absence of ruins, monuments or any evidence of early human habitation in Tierra del Fuego, southern Chile and Patagonia as these areas would have been temperate and very near to the fabled city.

I looked forward to the next chapter in the hope that it was short and I could return to the characters in the present day who I liked. But wait, now I have to read another long chapter from WWII. Never mind, I gave up. This was supposed to be a pleasant read but I'm giving up and going to another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic - a compelling read","review":"I can't think when I last read a book that enthralled me at som many different levels. It's about art and war and life, and there's a subtle message runing thru that says it's the art that makes us human. The plot might seem complex; we weave from 17,000 years BC in the culture that produced the Lascaux cave paintings, and then go to the same part of France during World War Two in the time of the Resistance, and then come home to today, where a hunt for an undiscovered cave takes us back to the same valley. Because Walker creates real characters who make us care about them in each of these three time lines, it's like getting three books in one. And there is this sense of continuity, as if characters from one time find their echo in another. I sat up till 4am to finish it, and loved it. What a brilliant movie this would make. I can almost see Tom Cruise in the leading role, from Stone Age artist to Resistance fighter to modern French politician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action novel without violence","review":"This novel moves from vague present time to period of yhe resistance in France, to prehistoric times. An object, taken almost as an afterthought from a cave used as an ammo dump by resistance forces appears at an auction house and the attempt to discover the cave leads the possessor and a number od specialiats through a discovery of events during World War II. Underlying this is a story of the creation of the cave artists and a storyline that follows one of the speculative concepts concerning the role of beauty and art in the human psyche. Qhile violent actions are motives, there is little of the siet of dwelling on the details in the lives of the present day participants. The idea of a truly priceless work of art and the struggle of humanity to survive and rise above its demons poses a question of civilization and barbarism. It is written at a level above mere historical trivia and with skill that keeps the multiple plots moving toward a believable conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read that precedes the excellent Bruno series","review":"The talented Martin Walker produced \\"The Caves of Perigord\\" before embarking on his always entertaining Perigord village detective novels, and a winner this early thriller is. A kind of temporal triptich that covers pre-iron age, WWII and contemporary eras in Southwest France. The book delivers a clever storyline, well-sketched characters, some engrossing history and battle descriptions and a satisfying ending. The book's been well-reviewed, so I would only add that this gives Martin Walker an even firmer grip on his the genre terroir in my opinion. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good learning experience","review":"The Caves of Perigord was a very interesting read. It was well-written and the author did an excellent job of tying in three distinctly different time periods. The book was a good learning experience. My main complaints were personal ones. The first pertains of the WWII section which I found too drawn out. I confess that as a woman, I am squeamish about war stories, and much prefer reading about the homefront than the battlefront. Nevertheless (and in spite of myself), I did learn a lot about the guerrilla tactics--both courageous and shocking--used by the Resistance. Also, I generally prefer character-driven novels. Given that this book kept going back and forth beween time periods, the characters were not as well developed as I would have liked. Once again, these are a personal preferences and certainly would not stop me from highly recommending this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic for those who like history. 3 good stories in one.","review":"The author has written three interlocking stories to help us to understand one history about the famous cave paintings in the Perigord Valley. A contemporary story about an art theft, an ancient tale about the creators of the cave paintings, and an exciting suspense thriller about the French Resistance in the Perigord during the Nazi occupation of WWII -- these are the 3 stories, all of which hold together well.If these subjects interest you, you'll thoroughly enjoy this well-written piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable Authenticity?","review":"This book does a poor job of describing the history. Throughout the book Robert payne's approach is evidently not neutral. As a result, there are a lot of hidden sentiments that are negetive. The book was written in a time when discrimination, predice and favoritism were common features of the society (1959). These feelings are apparent at various intervals throughout the text and hence do not do justice in portraying the true history of Islam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Islam Reality Check","review":"Written in 1959, Payne's history of Islam is one of the few books on the subject that has revealed Islam and its origins in a manner that is free of today's political correctness and sensitivity. That alone would appear to be sufficient for defenders of Islam to avoid this book at all costs. Payne provides an historical context to discovering Islam's earliest years when it transformed the Arabian peninsula from polytheism to belief in a single god with Muhammad as his sole voice through the sword. Reading this book provides you with a clear sense of how Islam is as much a politcial ideology as it is a religion. In that context, he conveys a day to day history of Islam as if you were watching Fox News.Those who want an unvarnshed view of Islam's origins need to read this book to provide a foundation of Islam not easily found elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convinced...","review":"As Bossa Nova purist I think Jobim is better when playing his own works with little or large orchestra ensembles.This may be Sinatra but not Jobim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tuna in oil ever !","review":"I have tried many, many canned (American and imported) brands of tuna in olive oil.

I couldn't find the old boppy so I decided to try the new nursing pillow.It IS very supportive, it makes a shelf on your abdomen for your baby to lay on.But...-You can't safely hold baby while putting it on.-It's quite large and an odd shape, which makes it difficult to store.-It's pretty stiff and at times I feel like my baby is unsafe on the pillow (It feels like he's going to roll off).The Boppy...-Was more compact to store.-I could swing it on and off without putting down my baby.-It was multipurpose! I used it for nursing, tummy time, and for sitting baby in a reclined position, we had lots of fun with that boppy.I have to find my Boppy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ended up not using it, too awkward.","review":"I brought this with me to the hospital to use while breastfeeding. I found it to be so awkward to use, the lactation consultant who visited me just told me to put it aside and use a regular pillow. I am thin and had a little belly left after my baby was born and this did not sit right on my belly. I felt like I needed a flat tummy to use this pillow effectively and I'm not large at all. The regular pillow worked better. I wish I had gotten a Boppy or nothing at all; at least the Boppy can be used for more than just breastfeeding and it wouldn't have been a total loss. Now, 2 months into exclusive breastfeeding I can't imagine struggling with My Brest Friend. I don't even use a pillow now, it's just not necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I, too, bought this at the recommendation of the lactation consultant I met during my hospital tour, and it was essentially worthless to me. It was too painful to use after my unplanned c-section, and once I started using the Boppy pillow to nurse, I never was able to get excited about the My Brest Friend- to many moving part to get situated for nursing. I read one review that said that the Boppy was \\"not made for nursing.\\" Come on! The pillows are not necessary, but they are nice to have, and selling them as more than that is really disingenuous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money :(","review":"I wanted to love this, because it received such good reviews, but we tried using it to no avail. If you are nursing I recommend you use pillows at the hospital to prop your baby up, and then decide once you know what positions, etc. you are going to use whether you need something like this. My guess is you will not once you figure things out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this product for breast feeding my little one. I feel that she is safe and secure when she is on the pillow. It also puts her in the perfect position for the cross cradle hold. I couldn't use this for football hold because it was hard to turn in sideways and fit in a chair. I have recommended this product to other expecting mothers. It makes breastfeeding more comfortable. Another positive is that it is wide enough for her to fall asleep on after feeding (while still being held of course!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused Dent in Baby's Head","review":"The cushion has two raised bumps. One of these bumps caused a dent in the baby's head after prolonged use. We had to cut through the foam to remove reduce the bump so that we could avoid a cranio-facial specialist. I would have given it 4 stars if it didn't have these stupid bumps. It would also be better if it were longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"try before you buy","review":"I was not impressed with this pillow...I started using it right away in the hospital and at home. It was not comfortable for me and my babe didnt seem to like it either. This pillow is very rigid and is now put in storage. I really feel I wasted my money. I ended up using the Boppy and was much happier with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dent on your baby's head","review":"I got one as a gift. It's bit annoying to buckle it every time and also it was difficult to level it. I often times had to put extra pillow underneath it.After a month of using it I noticed that there's a dent on my baby's head. If a baby nurses for more than 20 min per feeding 8-12 times a day that's a significant amount of time your baby is spending on that hard bumpy raised head rest. My friend's baby also has a dent on her head. I started to use the bottom part instead. Also the thickness of the back belt doesn't allow me to lean comfortably on the couch. What I am upset about is the bumps and how it dented my baby's head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I agree with most of the pros and cons other reviewers have written. I really like using this to feed my baby; I don't use it every time but I like it for when I need a free hand. My biggest complaint is that it is tough to put on with one hand, but I just put baby down for a second and we're all set to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Falls Off!","review":"My Bradley instructor suggested this breastfeeding pillow and I have to say it was perfect for me. It stayed in the correct position throughout the feedings and was easily adjusted to different levels on my body as he grew in size and needed to be positioned differently. Those middle of the night feedings were so much easier because of all the support it provided me while I sat up in bed. I bought an extra cover so when he had big spit ups I could have one in the wash while using the other, that worked out great and the covers, I had the soft ones, handled being washed in the machine just fine. They came out looking new. I also had a Boppy, but only found it useful for tummy time for our son. It was an awful feeding pillow in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"god bless the brest friend","review":"I bought this at a local store for $60 and feel it's been worth every penny and then some. I struggled with breast feeding, especially the first week, and a big part of that struggle was finding the best way to prop up baby and get comfortable. Piling up pillows and hunching over baby was not comfortable and was a major hindrance. This pillow addressed all those problems and kept me very supported and comfy. I've used it faithfully for over 5 weeks. Slipcover come off easy to clean. The cons are that the baby can basically only feed in a cross cradle type of position, pillow can't be moved around really to do a football hold. It could be a bit easier to put on, as sometimes one-handed it can be challenging. At any rate, if you're having challenges with feeding, don't hesitate to get this - makes so many things SO much easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic!! Please do not buy.","review":"How are they getting away with selling a BABY product with such a toxic, gaseous smell??!

This pillow is foam so it is soft but not squishy, and baby doesn't sink into it. Now that he's bigger I've switched to a smaller pillow but for those early newborn weeks a good supportive pillow is essential for me when breastfeeding is hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Fantastic product! This is my 3rd child and the MBF Deluxe is the best nursing pillow I've had. My little one is 7 months now and she is still comfortable using it. When she was first born I would tighten the strap and buckle it but now I just wrap it around for easy use (I read some think it's too time consuming to get on - just don't buckle). The attached pocket is great for holding items like nail clippers so you can trim nails while nursing. I also read some have had trouble with shrinkage after washing - I've not had that problem(do not put in dryer per instructions) At 6 months I used it to help support her sitting on the floor and she would also use it for a little tummy time. She also likes playing with the buckles."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO much better than a Boppy","review":"I breastfed my first baby for 10 months and used the Boppy all through but for my second baby a lactation consultant recommended the Brest friend and I LOVE IT.

I had to use a ton of pillows to support it but not with the Brest friend, which I can use by itself comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow my world just got so much better with this pillow!","review":"I have been breastfeeding my newborn by propping up pillows each time. He was just never comfortable enough to fully feed, he kept slipping off and I had to keep adding a blanket rolled under his head an an extra pillow here and there. It got overwhelming and as a first time mom I was super frustrated. I've only had this pillow one day and wow what a difference it made! It is so much more comfortable for me and the baby. He feeds for longer periods and is more fulfilled after each feeding. He is much more pleasant now where as before he was always crying because I had to keep shifting him. I was ready to give up breastfeeding but decided to try this pillow as a last resort. It was recommended by the lactation consultant and boy am I thankful.

Tasha, Rodney and Octavia are the fithgraders coming of age during the time of the Atlanta child murders. Each tell of the trials and tribulations at home, school and during their personal time. There is sadness, fear and tears especially when children they know start disapearing! It was fun to read what the children thought about their parents and teachers, it took me back to my own childhood. Octavia is my favorite out of the three. She seemed wise beyond her years. Tayari Jones did a great job but I felt the story could have gone on for a while longer. I got emotionally attached to the kids and wanted to know how their lives turn out. Over all this book was very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Story","review":"Leaving Atlanta, the debut novel by Tayari Jones, successfully blends fact with fiction and her story centers on the real-life child murders in Atlanta during 1979-1980. In this story, the author tells three stories by 3 children during that time period. Tasha, Rodney, and Octavia are three students who all go to the same school and they each have their own set of problems to deal with as well as learning that children have been disappearing and getting murdered. Somehow, almost miraculously, Tayari Jones tells a gripping, sometimes humorous, and engaging story that doesn't make you dread turning the pages since you already know what the end result's going to be.I personally loved this novel and it's been one of the few books that I can really strongly recommend this year. The fact that this book deviates from the norm and combined with excellent storytelling, Tayari Jones is an author to watch and I look forward to reading more from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read on a Troubling Subject","review":"I read the book in less than 2 days. It was amazing. I have read many books (fiction and non-fiction) on the child murders. This portrayal of the incidents from a child's perspective was the missing link...This book will structure how I relate to children and their perceptions of their reality.The characters were wonderful. You felt for Rodney and could imagine his struggle with an overbearing father. You could hear the playground yells of here comes Watusi. What is more interesting is how the children all attempt to cover their fears in \\"grown-up\\" terms.I enjoyed how the book didn't pass judgement on law enforcement or the other officials at the time. It simply relayed the story from the child's perspective.

Not only were the songs mediocre the Ellington band didn't take the time to learn the arrangments and play them ala Ellington. The bands soloists are outstanding as usual; listen to Hodges on \\"Indian Summer\\", but the band just isn't \\"in the groove\\" to make the singer a swinger. Sinatra recorded with the band in the studio in real time and the great indifference to the arrangemets and the recording effect him in a personal way. His pitch is off as well as his great phrasing-listen to \\"Come Back to Me\\". Maybe the Chairman and the Duke should have done an Ellington Songbook album with Duke writing the arrangements.

Sinatra seems to be out of every song, even in the swinging \\"Come back to me\\", probably influenced by a cold and uninterested orchestra, which seems to play just because they are paid for. Sinatra's voice doesn't even sound as smooth as it should, just listen to his hard voice in \\"Poor butterfly\\". And what can be said about the repertoire, how can any producer loose the opportunity of having The voice sing the great songs of The Duke with the latter at the piano. The final result is a record that seems to sound like a Basie without any talent or interest. I think it is only ment for those (like me) who like to have everything Sinatra recorded. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but flawed","review":"I think the best thing about this album is the Billy May arrangements. Sinatra is not in great voice - listen to the flat clunker he hits at the end of \\"Come Back to Me\\" and the Ellington band, other than a few soloists, sounds disinterested, as if they didn't bother to learn the arrangements. On the ballads, May was obviously trying to back Sinatra with a layered Ellington sound, and the fact that the band really wasn't into it hurts tunes such as \\"I Like the Sunrise,\\" which sounds just awful. But the mid-tempo tunes like \\"Yellow Days,\\" \\"Follow Me,\\" and especially \\"All I Need Is the Girl\\" are as swinging as anything Sinatra ever did. He and the band and the arrangement fall into an amazing groove.I frankly like this album more than the two Sinatra/Basie studio albums, which often try too hard. Sinatra sounds more relaxed here. \\"All I Need Is the Girl\\" is probably in my Sinatra top ten of all time. Recommended, with reservations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong fitment from Amazon","review":"Although Amazon says that this brake caliper fits my 1985 Toyota Corolla GT-S Coupe (Rear Wheel Drive) it does not fit.

While there are some good pointers on what to look out for during your first year, I think this book needs serious updating. The way we connect with people has changed dramatically over the past decade. A book on network marketing is just not complete and for me is useless, without any reference to social media.

I found some of the author's questions to be rather shallow, such as, \\"Is your life as a Muslim woman any different from that of your mother's or grandmother's?\\" (as if time has not changed anything).

Besides the political and religious aspects of the story, there is the underlying love story of unrequited love between Simon and Deborah, who is pledged to his best friend, John. It is the story of courage and hope despite overwhelming odds. By writing from the Roman general's point of view also, we get a look at his insights into the situation as well as political greed, corruption, honor, and cruelty. The themes in this novel are universal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling story of the last Jewish stronghold of Judea","review":"Gloria Miklowitz has written an interesting work of historical fiction, that will leave young readers awed at the Zealots courage, and disgusted with the Roman resolve to conquer all. The author uses several devices to keep young adults both male and female reading including the friendship/conflict between the young narrator and John, the rising military leader for the Jews and their struggles in loving the same young woman. Alternating voices of the young Jewish narrator and the commander of Roman forces are easily distinguished and insightful. Adults and young adults will have plenty to discuss and think about. Not recommended for ages ten and under, for the mass suicide at the end would be both frightening and difficult for younger children to comprehend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating historical novel told from Roman & Jewish viewpt","review":"This book held my interest from the first pages. It's told from the Roman commander's viewpoint and the son of the Jewish leader who wants to be a physican and succeeds just at the time when he must kill those he loves. The last chapters had me in tears. It really brings alive the people and problems of the period. Imagine the Romans, surrounding the fortress, having to haul in water and supplies for months in the desert heat, and the Jews - trying to stop the building of the ramp which would let the Romans use their battering ram to break into their fortress.

He shows you the actual places and helps you understand the people and there situations. If you are looking for a typical British mystery series, you might be a little dissapointed. If you enjoy looking into actual cases, following the clues and having someone explain who done it and why, this is the one for you.

As I'm trying to retrieve the top to see if it would attach to the interior sides, lo and behold, both ends came off! I'm now left with two detached ends, one roll top and a sheet of very flimsy stainless. Couldn't even put it back together well enough to stick it back in the shipping carton so just \\"poured\\" all pieces in separately. Just horrible. If I could have given it \\"0\\" stars I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that comfortable","review":"I like the idea of this product, but the gel padding in the straps was more painful than the original snugli (which I can wear for a few hours at a time). They need to make the straps more comfortable and give instructions on how best to adjust them! I returned the product after a few days of use. I hope Snugli comes out with another (more comfy) carrier with the cupholder though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Talent","review":"Thsi girl has a amazing talent! I saw her on Ryan Seacrest and after I heard Raindrops Will Fall for the third time and I loved it! I bought the cd the same day! It is absolutely wonderful!

You wont be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"heard her on the radio- just got the CD","review":"lol- i guess i must be living in a rock, because i have never watched american idol, because i thought there would not be real talent on there. WEll, if Tamyra is any indication, i have been proven wrong- this cd is great and she rockS!! all the songs are great to listen to... i definately recomend anyone to go buy this cd- u wont be dissapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Cheese","review":"I suppose this type of music has an audience but it smacks of been there done that. She has talent but she needs direction to realize her full potential. There is nothing really memorable about her voice or style that will cause you to keep listening. It's a nice CD and you wont hate it you just wont play it much.I feel more sorry for Fantasia as she has to release a Tamyra song as a single. At least Tamyra had the good sense not to put it on her album. Tamyra was clearly foist upon us in the last Idol and they are certainly pushing her for success, I just don't know that it will be realized until she is better produced and managed. As others have said writing is not her strength. This CD needs direction and she needs some difinitive style that will separate her from the herd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"It took two years for Tamyra to release this album and it was not worth the wait. I was so disappointed because I liked Tamyra when she was on Season One of American Idol. It was like I was listening to one continuous song. The lyrics of the songs are somewhat juvenile (rainbows, stars and fluff). Tamyra really should have worked with professionals instead of writing the songs herself, especially for a debut album. Hopefully, she will put out a better project her next go around."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEESY DEBUT!!!!","review":"I love(d) Tamyra on season one of AI. I thought that she was an AMAZING talent, and I still believe that. After hearing her album, I am starting to think that she is nothing more than a karaoke singer. Her lyrics are full of boring cliché's and her songs are pretty bland. Her voice is not fully exposed on this album. I am very dissapointed Tamyra!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do NOT buy this crap","review":"This album is what is wrong with music. Just people trying to make a few bucks, not caring about the quality of the music. All of these songs are so cliche and bad.

Sadly, this album is just as bad as Justin Guarini's."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE \\"SUPASTAH\\" FIZZLES","review":"She got a contract. She wants to be a \\"SUPEASTAH!!!! It will not happen with this release. It is fizzling. Check the charts, check everywhere. Granted, she has talent. But talent alone will not get one \\"SUPESTAH\\" status. One has to have charisma and that extra something of which \\"STAHS\\" are made. Tamyra Gray did not have this when she was on idol. She does not have it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for a great talent!","review":"This is one American Idol finalist who's truly a winner through and through. She's got the talent, the looks, and the personality. Her CD is great: the songs are good and her voice great.It would indeed be unfair to make comparisons with Fantasia. Unfair to TAMYRA, because it's insulting for Tamyra to be compared with someone who doesn't have the voice, the talent, or the personality (unless squeaking, dropping out of school, and making babies out of wedlock have been elevated to the level of \\"talent\\").Get a copy of this CD and treat yourself to what is called REAL SINGING."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this what we waited for?","review":"tamyra gray is a good singer, but so what??? fans have waited two years for her album to be released, and it falls very short. taryma tries to be different and be a singer/songwriter, but when someone writes their own songs, it does not mean the songs are good. i watched taryma unvieled her work on this seasons American Idol, and im like, \\"is this girl for real?\\" she had a chance to showcase her work for a mass public, so of course she had to sing good songs to promote her self. 'star' and 'rain drops will fall' sucked. isnt 'star' like mariah's 'make it happen'? and isnt 'RDWF'? like 'through the rain'? i listenend to her album when it leaked on the internet, and she is not original at all. her lyrics are so juvenille and cliche, and on top of that, her melodies are not even good. im not a hater, im an honest music fan. if its good, i'll say it's good, if it's not, then it's not. tamyra can sing, but her songs are not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"good voice but weak material","review":"Her voice is on point through out for the most part but the Material is lacking any kind of depth.this is a debut that Should have been better balanced out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gray Won't Make Green","review":"This was possibly the worst release from all the AI artist.

This CD also proves that you dont have to win American IDol to become a Superstar! way to go T! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Excellent","review":"I'm a huge music lover..and this is hands down one of the best CD that have come out so far this year. She was cheated out of the A.I. crown but this CD proves that she is better that any of the the winners so far. Not only can she sing but her writing skill is also very good for a new-comer. I predict that Tamyra will be around for a long time and will become a household name. Did i also say she's very beautiful.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamyra is THE Idol","review":"Without a doubt Tamyra is the best contestant to release a cd from American Idol. I'm a HUGE fan and was expecting HUGE things from Miss Tamyra Gray and even though it doesn't have as many power ballads as I would have liked she still does AMAZING!I like every track on the album except for \\"ha ha\\" I can't pick a favorite I like them all.Usually I can pick one track that can stick out but not on this cd because they are all stellar for the one exception.Now, I just hope that she puts out a single and that she gets more exposure from people than American Idol fans.She has the talent and is an Idol to me.Good Luck Tamyra!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Debut for Tamyra Gray","review":"She has a great voice but the music sucks.

Do not waste your money!","review":"I saw her sing that god awful song \\"Star\\" on American Idol last week. \\"Star\\" is just beyond terrible. This album is the quintessential American Idol album.

Please, do not waste your time with this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment, don't bother","review":"Gray should stick to her mediocre acting if she can't come up with a better CD than this mess.

They just kept falling asleep..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well keep dreaming because this album SUCKS!!","review":"Whitney/mariah wack wannabe went wrong! All the songs are wack and childish.

I learned my lesson when I bought Clay Aiken's CD without hearing part of it first, won't make that mistake again, until i can sample some of the songs on this CD I'm not plunking down any cash on it! I gave her the benefit of the doubt only based on what I've heard her do in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I can see why RCA dumped her, no vocal range, cannot carry a tune, but she is very pretty. Songs are totally annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!","review":"This is one of the WORST cds I have ever heard!!!! I don't even have it, I just listen to 30 second clips of all the songs and they suck. DO NOT buy this cd under any circumstances!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I waited a long time for this CD, and I am not impressed at all with the outcome. The writing is terrible, if this is why RCA dropped her then I finally understand... it's dated cheese at best. Her voice is awesome as usual, but not good enough to make up for the bad songs. I hope Tamyra gets a chance to make a second album and lets other people write some of the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"See You Later, Tammy","review":"It is just laughable how Tammy is being presented as this \\"serious\\" singer/songwriter. Face it, she is merely a mediocre singer and songwriter, and she has nothing to distinguish herself from the rest of the singers out there. My prediction: Her first and last record."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SONGS ON THIS CD ARE TERRIBLE!!!","review":"Tamyra Gray has talent. The songs on this CD are terrible so it does not showcase her talent. It even questions it. Enough is enough people. Stop buying into this American Idol travesty and wake up!!!!! No more American Idol for me!! They have ruined it all with this release which was much anticpated but is fizzling out quicker than one can say \\"SUPASTAH\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring!","review":"I really expected more out of the album. I think Ms. Gray would have been better off if someone else had written the songs. They all sound the same and lyrics are silly. If this album doesn't do well, which I have heard that it isn't, she can't blame the writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamyra's debut album...","review":"This album is not only the best Idol album I've heard, but one of the best in general. Syle wise it has so much variation, but it flows so nicely. My favorite is \\"Legend.\\" Her voice is so great, and her song writing is great. WOW, just buy this album, you will not regret"},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh...I don't know...???","review":"Other reviewers think that Tamyra should have been the eventual winner of AI1. But clearly, after listening to half of this album, and hearing her shakey perfomance of the Star Spangled Banner on American Idol, she has showed that she should not have made it to the top four. Maybe the top 6 would have suited her more. The only song that blew me away was, \\"Raindrops Will Fall.\\" Such songs like \\"Legend\\" and \\"Ha Ha\\" had lyrics that meant absolutely nothing.Album: 6/10\\"Raindrops Will Fall\\" 10/10\\"Star\\" 8/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Cd was a \\"Good\\" debut for TAMYRA","review":"This was a good debut for Tamyra. Her songs were alright but ui still think she could have done a lot better. Standout grooves \\"Legend\\" and \\"Star\\" \\"The Only thing\\" also \\"Raindrops Will Fall\\" and the song \\"God Bless The Dreamer\\".Solid debut but i still think the sophmore album should feature some better producers.Can't wait for the next go-round."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tamyra!","review":"Tamyra Gray's new album is a good, strong venture into the R&B world. I wish that she'd debuted stronger than she did on the Billboard Charts because I think she has some very strong tracks such as \\"Raindrops Will Fall\\" and \\"Star\\" as well as \\"Ha Ha\\" and \\"17\\" and others. I think the problem for her somewhat disappointing debut was the lack of promotion of this album. When I bought it, It just seemed like it wasn't a big deal American Idol's absolutely stunning 4th place Tamyra Gray was releasing her debut album. I hope she can improve on the charts because her album is very good. Anyways, I only give this album 4 stars because it is like other R&B albums that are out today. There isn't any new innovation, it is just a good album. For \\"Star\\" I give 5 stars and for \\"Raindrops Will Fall\\" (and the high A that she hits at the climax of the song), I give 6 out of 5 stars! Keep recording and holding strong Tamyra! Great Job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is hot","review":"i am surprised i liked this cd so much... the samples that you can listen to do not do justice to the songs- they are all mostly really good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Tamyra!!!","review":"This Album was well worth the wait! Tamyra is a very talented singer who can hold her own. I have listend to this cd almost everyday since the release date. Her vocals are amazing! I will continue to support her throughout her career! The cd is a must have!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I never thought it was possible for anyone in the American Idol competition to release an album that would be worth listening to. Tamyra has done it and I am AMAZED!! Not even Ruben or Kelly has been able to reach this quality. Her vocal ability is awesome and her various styles show how she can last in any genre. She has done an excellent job. I love it. Some of the music is a little elementary (simple) but her voice takes over and forces you to listen anyway. I wasnt even a big fan of hers in the first season of American Idol, but now I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After all of the hype over Tamyra being the best singer from AI1 and being voted off too early, I was very excited to hear her new cd. I must say I was disappointed. There was nothing new or different about her voice or her songwriting. I was expecting a more R&B sound. This album is a bigger flop that Justin Guarini, in fact, it seems none of the Idols other than the big three are having any more success than Justin. Says something about the \\"talent\\" on this show. It's more about who gets the most promotion than about the talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"After hearing rumors that Tamyra was working with Babyface, I got excited about who I considered the true winner of the first season of AI. I got the album and was VERY disappointed. While I believe that she has a good singing voice, the songs were very elementary. The inspirational songs were decent, but the album sounded too pop for my taste. I was really hoping that this album would be a little more soulful and mature. The producers on this album sucked!!! I hope that she will be able to try this again. However, considering the current state of the music industry, this might have been her only chance to shine. I wish the best for her in her future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Although Tamyra was not my favorite Idol on Season One, I did think that she was very talented, which is why I am so disappointed with her debut CD. What happened? She had two years to work on this album. Her voice sounds OK but the songs are boring and the lyrics are laughable. I do not recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"It's an absolute waste of money. Her lyrics are so cliche. \\"Pot of gold at the end of the rainbow\\" Come on, she is not creative at all. I was at first impressed that she wrote her own songs, but then I heard them and I was not impressed. Her CD is horrible, I don't know why people would buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This album has the worst producers ever. This girl can sing, but her voice is wasted on such pathetic excuses for songs. Tamyra, do yourself a favor, and never work with those people again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought the cd because I loved Tamyra on American Idol. I have been waiting patiently for this release and was so excited when I saw that it was finally coming out! It HAD to be great, right? She had two years to put it together, she had written the whole cd and her voice is GREAT! Well, let me just say that it didn't even come close to meeting my expectations. The girl is NOT a good song writer. The songs are eh all around, minus one song (17) and something has happened to her voice. She sounds ok to good on the cd, but her live performances have been VERY subpar.I am glad I supported her by buying the cd, she is a great girl, but I would not recommend buying it to anyone. There is one good song, two passable one's ( Legend and Star ) and the rest is dreck.Maybe next time Tamyra, but I will wait to hear the material first."},{"rating":"1","title":"The album is a flop","review":"After working two years on this album, I really thought Tamyra's debut would have been better. The album has been receiving quite a \\"yawn\\" from the American public. Her debut on Billboard was lower than any of the other idols at #23, with the exception of William Hung. Last week her album dropped over 50% to #65. The songs and lyrics are dated and I think Tamyra would have been better off having someone else write her music. If you buy this album, you will be disappointed. I know I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good singer, good voice, horrible material","review":"I think that the truth is Tamyra Gray is an UNDENIABLY good singer. Give her an ordinary song, and she can do wonders with it. But the real problem with such an album all has to do with the weak material in this album. Given that she penned most of the song lyrics for the album, it is ironically self-defeating that she took an active part in defeating her own music career by trying her hand at such song writing without any guidance. In addition, I was surprised that given the two years' wait, it all turned out that the standard of the songs were at best running \\"thin\\" and superfluous in terms of their themes(dreams, rainbows, falling out of love etc.). They can potentially bore someone like me who believes that she is one of the best voices around in the current music industry to run against the main current of selling sex, sex and more sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait for this CD to get to the U.K.","review":"A friend of mine shipped the Dreamer to me ... WOW! Tamyra Gray is truly an amazing talent ... I can't wait to have a listening party here in London :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the rest.","review":"When I first saw Tamyra Gray on American Idol I wanted her to win desperately, but now I'm glad that she didn't. Unlike the overly produced stars that American Idol has spit out, Tamyra is completely different. Her sound on this cd is completely her own, each song is a piece of her, unlike those written for an artist to sing(see Kelly, Ruben, Clay, Kimberly and even Justin). This is Tamyra Gray and I am nothing less than impressed...each track is amazing, especially 'Star' which I had to play over and over and not to mention 'Raindrops will fall' and the rock-ish 'Faces'....This album is must a for any music fan!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Whitney Wannabe","review":"I get soooo tired of these American Idol Singers who Simply copy the style of the likes Of Whitney Houston , Mariah carey and Celine Dion! You will hear nothing on Tamyra's cd that you havent heard before! Her voice is okay but all the songs are so Sugary Sappy! Thank God Fantasia Barrino Won The Latest American Idol< Now she ie an Original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Tamyra But was Very Disappointed in this CD","review":"I have been a Tamyra fan since I saw this incredibly classy lady in season 1. Her delivery on AI was second to none. After having waited 2 years for this album, I was sorely disappointed by the \\"weak\\" songs on it. To her credit I applaud her for wanting to write her own songs, but the lyrics and arrangements are \\"bubble gum\\" at best. Tamyra would have been much better off had she had an accomplished team of writers, producers etc. do her debut album. If Tamyra is blessed with another opportunity to make a cd, I would hope that she would seek the assistance from seasoned professionals!Much love Tamyra, but better luck next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TAMYRA ,TAMYRA,TAMYRA !","review":"what can i say that has not already been said about this gem of a talent. someone of tamyra's greatness does not come around that often ,and when they do it can put a smile on the faces and warm the hearts of those that are able discover these talents as they happen . everyone should listen to this album,if you like it listen again you will sure to be blown away like i was as it gets better with each listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underated by Far!!!","review":"This CD is really soulful. There are times you buy a CD and there's only a song or 2, but every song is great. Being beat out on AI2, I think she has done exceptional well with her career, and I'm sure bigger and better things to come. AI has produced some great talent like Tamyra. For these contestants to beat out thousands of other \\"talents\\" says a lot. By the way, Fantasia Barrino made it, and to be attacked by some as having a duck like voice was not the purpose of rating Tamyra's CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic Debut!","review":"Tamyra Gray has made a very strong debut with cd! For all of the reviewers who are crtiticizing her writing skills! This is her first album of course their will be some room for improvement. But, in my opinion not much. Tamyra shows us on this cd why she should have won the first American Idol contest in the first place! But, then we would have gotten a Kelly Clarkson album! I like this approach so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pay attention to the 5 star reviews, this album sucks","review":"Don't waste your money with this, it is crap. And do not pay attention to the 5 star reviews, they are just spam. I read on a tamyra fan messageboard that there are a lot of people that write a bunch of (8-10) positive reviews per person just to get the rating up. It is just spam and this album sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pot of Gold at the end of the rainbow?","review":"Tamyra's songwriting for the American Idol finale song confirms what I feel about her songwriting: cliche, cliche, cliche. Sorry to say it, but a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow? That's just wrong. I'll give it to Tamyra that her vocals are brilliant, but the songs are really poorly written. Listened to the album three times and found myself grimacing at the lyrics. Her vocals, unfortunately, are not enough to save this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album of the year","review":"This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. I didn't buy it, i just listened to a little bit of it at FYE. I had to turn it off after 2 minutes. Do America all a favor and do not buy this crap. Send a message by not buying this and maybe we won't have to hear this American Idol crap ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed!!!","review":"Sorry, but I was hoping for so much more from Tamyra's album. She is so beautiful and I voted for her so much. Wonder if she will ever record another album after this? Her voice is so pretty, the songs are terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album!","review":"Interesting mix of songs, but consistenly good singing. The opposite of the Queen of Ghoul's recently released and very overrated \\"all-squeaks\\" album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring singer, cheesy tunes","review":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!! Oh sorry, I must've faded out there for a minute. This album has some great tunes to help you sleep. Tamyra is a pretty spotless vocalist but a absolutely horrid song writter. Her vocals are pretty good though nothing at all is special about it. Yeah, she hits the notes and stuff but she has the most generic sounding, uninspiring tone to her voice I have ever heard. I don't know who told the girl her song writting was good, or even acceptable, but the songs on this album are even cheesier than the songs that have been pushed on other AI contestants. I appreciate the fact she is trying to succeed on mostly her own merits but this album falls way short of great or even good. I couldn't be more disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better luck next time","review":"Tamyra Gray is without question the best voice to come out of the American Idol Stable. It is a shame that her label would allow her talent to be wasted. This is the woman who sang Dance with my father on Boston Public and did a better job than Luther will ever do. This CD does not allow you to hear the best that she can do. It has reduced her great vocal talent to that of a Karoake singer. I am glad I did not have to pay money for this. Save your money for when you can hear her live or hunt down copies of her appearences on American Idol. She is worth the price to hear her in person. You will not be disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tamyra Needs To Find Her Own Voice","review":"Tamyra sings well and I'll give her credit for that, but there are times I think she copies 70's disco and Christina Aguilera. I think Tamyra needs to take time to find a sound all her own. That's unless she doesn't mind singing covers of other people's songs and singing styles. I would have given her 3 stars for a decent effort, but this CD is too shaky for me to give her another star."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder we haven\`t heard from TAMYRA in 5years","review":"I mean honey has STAR potential but this ALBUM is not very good and leave me to wonder who gave the GREENLIGHT to this PROJECT what were they listening to and what were they thinking?all of the songs here are AVERAGE or BELOW AVERAGE which usually TRANSLATES into a SOUNDSCAN CALAMITY and the ARTIST going into OBLIVION."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"I really like this CD, I originally bought the CD for the song \\"Raindrop will fall\\" but I ended up liking a couple of songs on the CD. I am not telling everyone to run out and get this album, but it really is a nice CD. I really hate the fact that she is not getting the exposure she deserves. I am a huge AI fan, but I don't go out and buy everyones CD's cause they cost money, but this was a good purchase. My favorite songs on this CD are \\"Raindrops will fall\\", \\"Faces\\", and \\"God bless the dreamer\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl can SING!!!!","review":"If you don't have this CD, then buy it.

Great songs, great voice -- great album! As many people have observed, the opposite of The Duck's all-squeaks first flop effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Overall Winner!","review":"Tamyra Gray may have not been the first American Idol winner, but she was the First American Idol \\"Idol.\\" For the person that said that she didnt understand her voice and lyrics must listens to people who pronounce their words proper. We are talking average people that are trying to be stars, not trying to replace Whitney Houston. Tamyra Gray is a Star, just like in her song. Kelly Clarkson on the other hand wants to be the next mariah carrey and deliver notes all over the place when its not needed. Tamrya Gray's comeback preformances was better than that of Kelly. Kelly won, but Tamyra Gray CD is the true winner. Listening to her will get you through the good and bad times."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so excited to see this come out but now disappointed!","review":"I really liked the raindrops song...but the rest of the cd. I was frankly bummed. It is so disappointing. I listened to it on Itunes and I was so disappointed. I purchased raindrops and that was all :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre CD for Outstanding Voice","review":"Tamyra was not given songs that use her voice to its strongest capabilities. She has a great voice but it is not defined anywhere in the songs on this CD. Maybe Tamyra will read these reviews and make a new album that uses her vocals to their best potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Justin Guarini and Nikki McKibbin beat her?","review":"This is the second great debut album from a contestant from season one. It makes it all the more impressive because Tamyra wrote and produced a lot of the fantastic and fun songs on this album. Pick this up, you won't be disappointed. She proves herself as a versatile performer and songwriter, showcasing her amazing vocals and catchy lyrics. I was hoping that Tamyra would not just disappear into obscurity and this album proves she shouldn't ever have to have that fate. I hope everybody gets a chance to see this album on the shelf and pick it up because I think a lot of people are missing out on a great and flawless debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Support This Talented Artist","review":"I almost never give a CD 5 Stars, but Tamyra's \\"The Dreamer\\" is outstanding. There is simply nothing about it that I don't like! From start to finish, this talented young woman takes you on a musical journey that touches on a variety of themes and genres. She can rock, she can pop and she can groove. Tamyra has a beautiful voice and the fact that she had a hand in writing all but one song in this remarkable collection makes the music even more compelling. She wrote for her voice and everything works for her.Tamyra has persevered and fought to get this released. She is getting virtually no support from 19 Recordings and it is up to the people who believe in her and who love this CD to help promote it. Buy it, don't burn it. I want to hear more from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof","review":"Before I get to my review of this phenominal CD, I would simply like to say that this area is for critiquing Tamayra's CD. This is not the place to attack people that have very little to do with Tamayra-I speak of the barrage of insults about Fantasia Borrino. People are entitled to their own opinion. Anyway, this CD is simply phenominal and I highly recommend it. It is proof that Tamayra's departure from American Idol was indeed premature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid first release for Tamyra","review":"I'm going to try to be an unbiased critic right now. the problem is I really loved Tamyra when she was on American Idol. I wanted her to win the year she competed and I didn't watch it the rest of that season after she was eliminated. Anyway, I digressed. The Dreamer is a solid collection of songs that shows off Tamyra's vocal abilities. I'm not sure if it's \\"Classic Worthy\\" material. I just expected more from her. Out of approximately 13 tracks on the CD, I problably like about 8 of them (which is pretty good). Again I want more from Tamyra because she has soo much potential. With the right people behind her she can be a vocal powerhouse. But for right now, her debut CD is strong/solid. I'll keep it because I love Tamyra; she's phenomenally gorgeous and she can straight up sing. But she needs someone to help her pick better songs to further put her into the mainstream..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented & Unique","review":"Tamyra Gray is a wonderful singer, and her album has a Jazz/Smooth R&B/Soul feel to it. I liked it, and would buy a second album of hers, if she ever releases another one. I also, like the fact that she is unlike any other R&B singer out there. Buy This Album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Every track is wonderful and catchy. I've listened to this CD beginning to end many, many times and have yet to skip a song. Tamyra is really something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Give it 5 Stars; Review is from Billboard","review":"When one door closes, another opens. Tamyra Gray, fourth runner-up during the first season of \\"American Idol,\\" is resounding proof. The singer parlayed her \\"Idol\\" stint into acting gigs (\\"Boston Public,\\" \\"Half & Half\\"). In between, she recorded her first album, which marks the U.S. launch of \\"Idol\\" creator Simon Fuller's new label, 19 Recordings. Gray's pleasing vocals and co-writing skills propel this engaging debut. Segueing from R&B to pop, jazz and rock, the album showcases the many moods of the former Miss Atlanta. Whether paying melodic props to old-school (\\"Star\\"), letting loose with an inspirational ballad (\\"Raindrops Will Fall\\") or having sassy fun (\\"Ha Ha\\"), Gray displays emotional depth and a penchant for storytelling that is sorely lacking these days. Gray may not have won the initial race. But if this debut is any indication, she will be around long after others have dropped out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"Like many others, I waited for Tamara's cd with heartfelt anticipation! Loved her on Idol and when she performed this year as well...she took my breath away! The CD, unfortunately, is a huge let down. Her song writing seems amateurish at best. I would have rather heard her sing songs by a more established writer, or remakes. Come on- where's Over the Rainbow that she floored us with??Great talent, we all know she has it...but this was a big let down. (Oh, and could she have thanked anyone else on her CD sleeve???)Sorry, hope you do better next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD!","review":"Don't believe the naysayers. Like others, I waited over two years for Tamyra to release her CD and she does not disappoint. I would rate Raindrops Will Fall 11 out of 10 and the rest are very good, too. It boggles the mind that some would rather hear her sing schlock like A Moment Like This!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition to Neo-Soul","review":"I am a huge Neo-Soul fan and this is a great cd. If you are a fan of real music and lyrics this is definitely the CD for you. I have totally respect for her as an artist is rare these days to see true artist at work who can write as well as sing. My favorite tracks have to be \\"legend\\" and \\"ha ha\\" - great songs to jam too!, and \\"raindrops\\" touches the soul and reallyy shows you what she is all about. Glad to get a CD that I can enjoy all the tracks and not just a few. She is definitely on her way. I am so glad one Idol made a good CD.If you like the CD then you must try Erykah Badu. They are on the same level in so many ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"As an American Idol viewer who enjoyed the previous albums of Kelly Clarkson, Clay aiken, Justin Guarini and Ruben Studdard, I was looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, I came away utterly disapointed. There is nothing original, nothing new to Tamyra's songs. Her voice is overproduced on several of the tracks and on many the lyrics lack musicality. They run on and on like a letter more so than a song. Maybe Miss. Gray would have been better off letting Clive Davis or someone else pick some good songs for her, or maybe she should have opted for a more entertaining product. I feel like I'm listening to the same song over and over.In a word. It's bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song mixup","review":"The reviewer below who said that Tamyra did not write \\"Raindrops will fall\\" is confused. There is a song called \\"Raindrops keep falling on my head\\" which was sung by B. J. Thomas (lyrics by Hal David/music by Burt Bacharach) from the movie Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid. This is not the same song, my dear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gray's Singing Makes me Blue","review":"I cried when she was voted off and cried even harder when I heard this disappointing album. Problem #1, she lacks the ability to evoke any kind of emotion in her songs and therefore is unable to carry off the dramatic ballads. Problem #2, the album contains mostly ballads. In addition the music composition it self is bland and boring. Tamyra find a new producer, PLEASE! Something happen between the time she was on AI to the recording of this lame album. If you are looking for the showstopping, power performance you saw on AI, don't buy this. It's not worth the money or the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire the writers","review":"The vocal talent is there but the mediocre songwriting doesn't support the stellar voice. I was hoping for better."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAS TALENT BUT NO CHARISMA","review":"Tamyra Gray has talent. The songs here are merely o.k. They could have been better. I've heard worse. However, Miss Gray lacks that special something called \\"charisma\\", that of which stars are made. If this CD has not sold well and has not exceeded expectations it is because Ms. Gray herself does not have the \\"X\\" factor for success. This is why she lost American Idol. Talent yes....but talent is not enough. The pop culture and what appeals to the masses is not talent alone but charisma. I fail to see it coming through on this CD. It is a true disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way, way better than Fanatsia the Duck Barrino!","review":"Now, this is what I call SINGING. Tamyra has a great voice, a great range, and a great style. Unlike the overrated AI3 winner who can't sing (though I must admit she's excellent at SQUEAKING)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"Just listened to Tamyra's CD after I borrowed if from a friend. I was somewhat disappointed. She doesn't sound like the Tamyra from the first season of American Idol. The music is too dated and I can't imagine hearing any of these songs on the radio. I also expected the album to be more R&B. I would not recommend this album to anyone unless you just want a souvenier of the TV show."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEESY DEBUT!!!!!!","review":"I love(d) Tamyra on season one of AI. I thought that she was an AMAZING talent, and I still believe that. After hearing her album, I am starting to think that she is nothing more than a karaoke singer. Her lyrics are full of boring cliché's and her songs are pretty bland. Her voice is not fully exposed on this album. I am very dissapointed Tamyra!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I really thought Tamyra's debut CD would be better since it took her two years to release it. She was one of my favorites in season one; however, the CD is too much of a mix of different types of music. I thought it would be more R&B. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"can not get nose piece to work","review":"i bought these directly from aclens. i can not get the nose piece correctly into the eyepiece. the directions are sketchy at best and i have tried two different nose pieces and can not get them to work. i will likely have to throw away the entire set and order another pair of goggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"AC Lens, prescription goggles for swimming","review":"Bad, useless product.

Although not as popular on record, they were the favorite band of the rich college-student circuit for many years. This CD presents 23 beautifully remastered songs recorded from 1935 to 1941, including (my favorites)\\"Whoa Babe,\\" \\"The Goblin Band,\\" \\"Casa Loma Stomp,\\" \\"Song of India,\\" \\"No Name Jive,\\" and \\"Swingtonic.\\" Hoagy Carmichael himself sings some of his own compositions, best on \\"Little Old Lady,\\" and not so well on \\"Stardust.\\" Featured musicians include Glen Gray, Louis Armstrong, and PeeWee Hunt. There are many pleasant surprises on this gem of a CD: great lesser-known performers, unique arrangements of swing hits, and beautiful, driving melodies. It shattered my stereotype of the Casa Loma Orchestra as a stodgy resort band."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crap!","review":"I've used these batteries before.

To those of us who sometimes feel our prayers are same old, same old, reading about this group of women who actively participate in a fervent, Spirit led prayer life has changed mine. In Book 3, The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Real, these women have grown closer to each other, and the true-to-life situations, though sometimes seeming to be hopeless, get prayed over bigtime, and with the thanksgivings typical of the group. The women don't forget the practical gifts of love either, such as spending time with Adele's mother who is suffering from dementia.God's answers to their prayers are delivered in His perfect time and way, often bringing surprises as He does for us all.The books are great, and improve with re-reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yada Yada Prayer book series","review":"I have read the first 4 books of the Yada Yada prayer group and I love the series.

Since I've already paid for the 4th book and it's waiting on me to finally get through this 3rd one, I sincerely hope it's better. I was really excited to find this series, and recommended it to everyone, but had I read this third book first I wouldn't have been at all impressed nor recommended it - while it's not a BAD story, it simply does not stand out nor does it hold my interest or touch my heart as the first 2 books did.So...here's hoping to a better experience with the 4th Yada Yada book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Never received, it's been a little over a month, have been in contact w/shipper, said they would send re-fund... have received that yet either.

As always, the legal nightmare of music and performance clearances has resulted in these shows being heavily edited. All the great musical guests have been removed, leaving each show with an average running time of 24 minutes (from the original 51 minutes).Timeless Media does get credit for even considering the release of such an obscure item from television's past, but the removal of such critical content makes it hardly worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A soothing journey...","review":"The layers of this title are too far to imagine and yet the artists have produced something that is so fluid and serene that it is more like a journey than a CD.

We've seen all the BBC Dickens films and virtually anything else we can find in that vein. This one definitely ranks up there with the best. The story is gently acerbic and the character development is truly fine. Wendy Hiller gives a terrific performance, portraying the dowager with a light but very firm hand on the helm of her life. once her public/familial duty is done, her duty is to herself, despite the arrogance and assumptions of her children and their spouses.

The acting, period settings and plot were well developed, understandable, and flowed in a very smooth fashion. My only regret was that the film ended and I was anxious for the story to continue. I hope there is some sort of follow up. Watching the film sparked an interest in Vita Sackville-West, the period, and her family. It was a wonderful social history of the period and the story could have gone in any direction. Each of the characters in the film was a story in itself. I was lucky to have found this.

Varenne's book will NOT TEACH YOGA, rather it TEACHES ABOUT YOGA.It's a fascinating review and clearly presented, if a bit academic. The reader learns how yoga relates to Hindu society and religious belief, and how yoga's teachings are essentially theological in nature.Putting yoga in a social context will give it character and deepen one's appreciation for this practice. It will, however, be a bit disturbing for some Americans, and will threaten some of their deeply-held new age assumptions.If you're serious about yoga, read this, then read the Bhagvad-gita."},{"rating":"2","title":"moving and relaxing Sufi music","review":"Beautiful, spiritually moving and extremely relaxing Persian music CD.

Also, Chuck Wright's bluesy bass lines seem out of place here with the Ratt tunes and some of these songs don't really sound much like the originals. I'm all for changing things up a bit when performing live but the way that some of these Ratt songs are arranged here is a real stretch.

Unless you have a firm grasp of the concepts being presented you may find yourself easily lost in this very biased, \\" Physics for Nonscientists. \\" I give this one star for those poor flatlanders who may never understand the pyramid, as being more than triangle or a square respectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worked 5 months","review":"Ordered it April 15th and it quit making coffee on August 6.

There is nothing in the book about a warranty so guess it does not have one.

I always enjoy his music and have most of his albums over the past 20+ years.

While it is true that some of the video is a little ugly it is clear that this was taken from analog video and for the most part a good job was done. I have not watched the whole thing because there were some performers I was not interested in (shame on me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"technical accurate .. wasn't so useful to me","review":"Pocket streets is great for locating an address but doesn't help you find it, ie get there. It puts a star on the map but doesn't label all the surrounding streets. All streets are drwan as lines whether they are an alley or a freeway which makes it difficult to understand the geographic context of the address. You can highlight the subway stations but the names are not labelled. I use mapquest.com when using my PC so I really bought this (full price) for my Windows CE Pocket PC. The problem there is that the city databases are memory consuming and handle a limited area. I ended up scanning a few pages of a real map, that is more useful in navigating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough oomph","review":"You'd figure that Microsoft products, though not always greater than the competition's, would at least be on par.Hardily the case with S&T 2002.From reviews here, it's not a good product for camping and traveling. Well, it's not good for the city either. I live in a major metropolitan area. There's a major freeway in my city that's been here for 3 years, and still, it doesn't show up on the map.The big problem I have with this product is the lack of updating information. MS has the ability to check freeway condition and improvements. But instead of that feature, why not update finished freeways, new streets and past closuresI give it some credit. The mapping of several addresses at once was very on key. However, without the correct addresses, often times I've gone the wrong way for over 30 minutes. Planning a route is pretty easy, and it's nice to be able to save the routes seperately from within the program. But I'll have to take my chances with Rand McNally's this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Mapping Product","review":"I doubt the above 2 reviewers are the actual users of MS S&T 2002 because none of them revealed the 15-second delay in updating the GPS position, the same unacceptable defect also found in S&T 2001. Driving 70 miles an hour on the interstate highway, you'll ALWAYS miss your exit with the belated 15-second GPS update. As a matter fact, there's very little difference in terms of features and performance between S&T 2001 and 2020. Contrary to Michael's cliam, S&T 2002's support for most GPS receivers (including Garmin and Magellan) is hopelessly zero. While all mapping software products contains errors, DeLorme Street Atlas USA is the best for your money. BTW, comparisoin with Rand McNally is unfair because its map was based an obsolete version supplied by ETAK. Nonetheless, Rand McNally StreetFinder and TripMaker are very friendly with all GPS receivers on the market."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],M={key:0},O={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",O,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(x,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-4a3e5d21"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/58.md","filePath":"quotes/58.md"}'),R={name:"quotes/58.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
