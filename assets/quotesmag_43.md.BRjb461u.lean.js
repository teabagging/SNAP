Clearly the people who wrote this book hate children and get some sick sense of joy out of promoting the abuse of children. In my opinion, social services ought to ensure that these two people NEVER be allowed around children again. This book is not about teaching children discipline at all.

They also recommend putting objects the child shouldn't touch within easy reach so that you can spank the child for touching them. They write about whipping their 4 month old (yes, 4 MONTHS) with a switch for crawling upstairs (though they do say that the whipping was for training rather than for the child's intentional disobedience). They recommend yanking the hair of nursing infants who bite. They praise a man who spanked his toddler 15 (yes, FIFTEEN) times ovr the course of 45 minutes.

The author believes that babies and children should be whipped, starting the first day they do something the parent doesn't like - such as crying or fighting a diaper change. His view of children is that they are all little brats out to manipulate you as much as possible.

I cannot believe that someone would recommend whipping a four month old baby! On pg 60 of this book the authour recommends whipping your baby who is crying because she/he cannot sleep!!

I am a devout Christian and am extremely angry that a few ignorant people have taken words from the bible COMPLETELY out of context and twisted them into their own disturbed meaning to justify the abuse of their children. I hope that anyone out there who reads this realizes that this is in no way an example of Christianity. We promote love and forgiveness, not abuse and terrorizing helpless infants and children. Yes, discipline is reccommended in the bible but no where does it tell you to treat your children like this. There is not one example anywhere of Jesus Christ spanking or hitting a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a better book","review":"There is no question that this book advocates abuse.

Caring parents raise respectful and well-behaved children without resorting to corporeal punishment all the time. You can do it, too. Do not give into the temptation to beat your children rather than guide them.

Without a doubt, not disciplining your children is one of the most unloving things parents can do, and they often choose not to discipline because it requires a lot more dedication and time than just giving in. We see children on our hockey teams who have not been disciplined consistently, and they are nervous, immature and insecure.

I am happy to say my son, who just turned two last week, used to be willfully disobedient, rebellious, and violent. Now he is immediately obedient, happy, and enjoys the fellowship he, his papi and I have together. He feels valuable and confident knowing that we can control him and that he can learn to control himself. He turned from a monster child into a sweet, spunky, energetic, but still obedient child. In addition to the suggestions, we use only 3 rules in the house. 1-Be Respectful 2-Don't touch things that don't belong to you 3-Obey right away.

Our home is peaceful, orderly and our children are happy. The training Michael Pearl teaches in this book makes sense.

Even my brother who doesn't like to be around a lot of loud, bratty kids, likes to be around ours. I have read many child-training books and believe this one to be the most practical and biblically based.

And I grieve for any world where striking an infant, who is so wholly helpless and dependant on their caregivers, is ever ok. Some people read the book and overlook those most offensive bits, and others see nothing but those words.

To physically abuse a child causes them to shut down emotionally, intellectually and trust becomes confusing or impossible. This vulnerable, assaulted child learns to comply to avoid injury and physical conflict.In my experience parenting is a family's journey. Adults and children learn and love and grow together.

Many studies document that spanking causes an increase in aggressiveness in adults. The more spanking a child receives, the higher the level of antisocial behavior the exhibit later. Many researchers have found a direct correlation between spanking and lying, cheating, disobedience, breaking things on purpose, not feeling bad about misbehaviors, and not getting along with authority figures.

I would have never thought about having my children help me around the home, or involving them in what I was doing on a regular basis.

I pray these children will grow up knowing that what is happening is WRONG and that You are not the one inspiring their parents to do these things to them.

To treat children worse than a dog in the street, as if they have no feelings, no minds of their own, no worthiness of respect, well... that is just the tip of the iceberg in this piece of madness. What cut my heart so deeply was that the tenets of this book are a PERVERSION of the scriptures. Christ would NEVER have advocated harming children the way these evil monsters describe. I think he would be absolutely livid with rage, in fact. They have taken the scriptures all out of context, and clearly have not looked into what the word 'the rod' really is - a metaphor for discipline and GUIDANCE not beating, baiting, humiliation and the abuse of BABIES.

If you want a relationship with your child based on love and true respect, you're not going to get it by hurting them.Wife-beating for disobediance is not very far away from this, folks.

No child should have to live with this kind of terror. This is appalling. I'm a Christian. This is not. When Christ said to let the little children come to Him, it wasn't to beat them into submission; it was to love them.

I've heard of blanket training for infants, which I do not approve of, but beating your child until their crying turns into submissive whimpers? Yes, that's actually suggested in this book.I am certainly not someone who disapproves of physical discipline for your own children, but I do disapprove of child abuse.

I AM a christian, a conservative, and NOT someone with an agenda. I have observed that the reviews seem to be polar opposites, so here is my two cents. BELIEVE IT OR NOT... HITTING CHILDREN AND BABIES is wrong...! Children do crave discipline and structure, but since when does that translate to hitting them? I'm sorry if it requires a little more *effort* to make your child realize precisely what they did wrong and how it hurt others and potentially themselves, etc., but as a kid who grew up with fantastic parents and yes, the occasional spanking, I always felt much worse when i realized WHY what I did was wrong than when I was in pain and confused.

I would truly be interested to know if you know anyone who has used the Pearls' method and gotten bad results.Additionally, please don't think this method is truly for 'lazy parents.'

Several parents with a common interest were filming themselves spanking and punishing their kids in various ways and exchanging the tapes with each other. It seems they were viewing the tapes for the purpose of, how can I put it delicately, becoming excited (and I don't mean a trip to Disneyland kind of excited). I think Pearl and his wife have created the same thing here except in print instead of on VHS tapes. No doubt they exchange many exciting! stories with their approving readers about how they dominated, punished and whipped their kids. The really awful part though, is that they use the Bible to justify their sick fetish. These people are using God's name in vain.

Unfortunately, there are also such poisonous and dangerously misguided ones that will appeal to peoples baser natures under the guise of 'guidance' and 'discipline'. Let me ask you, as a parent -- do you feel in your heart that God wants you to beat your children if they misbehave (according to your standards)? Leave the misappropriated segments of the Bible out of the discussion. Leave out the part where the Old Testament is used to shore up ideas that Jesus told us were unworkable in the New Testament. Leave out that these people who pretend to preach are in fact using your belief as a money-making vehicle for themselves. Ask yourself -- is hitting your child in your best interest? Is it in his or hers? Is command and control the only way you can 'train' your child, or could you possibly have been snookered into thinking violence is love? There are good ideas in this book. There are many, many bad ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon please remove this book from sale","review":"This book promotes child abuse of the tiniest children. It is a disgusting book.

The child gets the point fast. If the bad behavior persists then you go to a different level because the child has already shown that spanking isn't going to work. Spanking harder and longer is most likely going to cause lasting resentment and defiance.

That is my personal experience, not an opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"The author of this book and his wife are dangerous people. They use Bible verses (taken out of context) to disguise their theories on the pyschology of negative reinforcement. The bit about pulling a breastfeeding infant's hair when he bites is enough to put a tear in anyone's eye. These are truly horrible people, the kind of fanatical, cruel, control-freaks you see on 20/20 and the like. But they would make excellent cult/commune leaders.I never like to give a negative review about a book without giving alternatives, so here are a few on this subject I recommend:Hints on Child Training...The Ministry of Motherhood...The Mommy Manual (by B. Curtis)...The Mother at Home..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"A friend gave me this book. I read it and promptly threw it away. It is complete trash.

She left a 3 or 4 month old baby in her care crying for food for so long, without even checking on him, that we other moms finally picked him up and fed him behind her back.

I truly wish child protective services would track down those raving about beating their children into submission by beating them with rods and take them away. I have a 4 month old, and in this book they advocate beating them on the back of the legs with a switch at 4 months old. I began crying once I read that for that poor defenseless newborn baby who was being beaten. This book is pure evil. It is not the word of the God I know or any God I would ever pray to.

We are constantly getting compliments on his behavior everywhere that we go. He is a joy & a delight to us, and we take him everywhere that we go. Any discipline method used must be done in LOVE. First, we mete out discipline, then we accept apology, hug, dry tears, and go back about our day. I pity the parents who think that children can't or shouldn't be trained.

We now have four children, the eldest at 13 yrs old. It has helped us produce four lovely, joyful, obedient, mannerful and contented children. So far so good. You must read all of what is said fully and completely in the book to obtain the author's full view and reap of the wisdom that is presented. Sure, I didn't care at first for the level of sarcasm and \\"roughness\\" in which the author presents his material, but be wise to separate the wisdom in the content from any stylistic preference you have.

This is the 20th century not the stone age, I thought this sort of child abuse had gone out the window decades and decades a go.

Would Amazon sell a book about the best way to beat housewives? Or disabled people? Because they might defy you in some way? Of course not. Then why on earth are they selling a book about how to best beat up and mentally scar children, who are far more vulnerable and need the voices of adults far more than women or disabled people.Absolutely horrifying and sickening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three children have died by parents following these methods","review":"Please read one of the many online news articles about this advocate of what I consider to be child abuse. The Pearls provide instructions on using a switch on infants as young as six months. One article in the New York Times is titled \\"Preaching Virtue of Spanking, Even as Deaths Fuel Debate\\".

Nowhere do they promote child abuse. The \\"quotes\\" shared by the media are miscontrued, at best, and completely out of context.A reader does not have to agree 100% with Michael Pearl or his book, but to accuse the man of advocating child abuse is absurd.If you have not read To Train Up a Child, then you have no business submitting a review; and Amazon has no business publishing your unsubstantiated opinion.The public market place is not the arena to parot the media."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written like a true story","review":"I thought the book was fantastic and I could not put the book down. The story was definitely unpredictable with it's many twists and turns. I recommended the book highly to others to read. The book was not only written well, the author used his knowledge on the law to make the book even more realistic. I felt like the story was told through the eyes of the lawyer. How often does one experience the emotions of a lawyer? The book let one view the inner thoughts and emotions of a lawyer as he is thinking quickly on his feet with the knowledge of so much at stake. I found it easy to compare this story to a real life situation. One could relate to how the world responds emotionally or to the power of money... I recommend you read the book and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic characters, crass dialogue, good court drama","review":"I only finished this book because it was for a book club--otherwise I would have set it aside for good during the first 10 pages! The character development is extremely weak in the book. The characters are either too good to be true or the scum of the earth--absolutely no subtlety here. Also, the author seems to have an adolescent male view of women's sexuality--in other words, he is totally unrealistic and it reads like a cheap, sleazy romance novel at times! Our book club was uniformily unimpressed by the book and agreed we wouldn't read any more of his works. The second half of the book improves as the author enters his element--the justice system. But, overall, the book is unrealistic and very predictable. Thumbs down here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K.","review":"This isn't a horrible book. It's not William W. Johnstone or Ruby Jean Jensen.

I finished it wondering what happened to that author. Although shelved with the adult fiction, this book had a vocabulary and reading style perfect for the juvenile shelves. In fact, with the number of times the author kept repeating himself, the reader wonders if he had an ADD juvenile reader in mind.Beyond that, the book is extremely predictable and the foreshadowing is bluntly obvious. There was nothing especially spooky or horrific in it, and what little might have been there, was so foreshadowed by the author that nothing came as a surprise.If this author was ever worthy of any literary award, it was not for this book.

This would mean that EVERYONE has got it wrong for the past 2000 years except the author of this book who has figured out what the rest of the civilized world of scholars and historians have missed about the central figure of Western Civilization - Jesus Christ.Imagine that!

While he agrees with commentators who note this letter's pastoral aims and character, he is more convinced than some that it also exhibits a rich and coherent theological point of view. He interprets 2 Thessalonians as the work of an anonymous Paulinist writing several decades after the apostle's death. He regards this letter, too, as historically and theologically valuable, although less for what it discloses about Paul's ministry and thought than for what it shows about the reception and interpretation of Paul in the late first-century church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of holes and contradictions","review":"Tainted Legacy is an unmemorable book with many glaring problems. He makes absurd, unsubstantiated statements like, \\"Puritan society contained at its heart contradictions that were to roil American history in one form or another for 350 years.\\" Also, \\"Contrary to ill-informed right-wing opinion in the United States, the vast majority of Muslims did not applaud when the planes hit their targets on 9/11.\\" I'm sorry, but I know no right-winger who thinks that way. He also refers to the \\"discriminatory practices against Muslims in the United States...\\" but must have forgotten to back his statement up with facts.

To judge by the endnotes, Rosenblum interviewed every player in the strike -- from Phelps Dodge executives and union leaders to ex-Governor Babbitt and undercover cops -- and the result is a vivid narative that weaves together labor history and political and legal analysis. The sections on pro-management bias at the NLRB and the use of undercover police to spy on strikers are gems of investigative reporting. Rosenblum is pro-union but he presents management's case at length and doesn't hold back from sharp criticism of the United Steelworkers leadership. If you're interested in labor history or labor/management relations in the US, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An work of fiction.","review":"In Copper Crucible, Jonathan D. Rosenblum sets out to grind his ax and bash the evil \\"big business & Corporate giants\\". Too bad he didn't tell the rest of the story,... As he fell all over himself demonizing Phelps Dodge and raising Union organizers to sainthood, he conveniently omits the fact that a fully loaded beer truck was the drawing card the union used for its strike meetings. Alcohol just set the stage for the violence to come. And beleive me there was plenty & encouraged by the union. \\"Lets get the miners drunk & they will vote how we say\\" after all,... its all about power & money -on the union side as well.

Some of the fringe stations over 25 miles away fade in and out occasionally mostly due to weather conditions. (Rain, fog and windy conditions.) My antenna is mounted on a 21' length of 1+1/2 pipe extending about 6 feet above my mobil home roof. I believe the reception would be even better in extended a bit higher, and should be guy wired to reduce the wind effect. Although the antenna is \\"omnidirectional\\", I have found a minor rotation of just a few degrees can improve a weak station. Over all I am very pleased with the performance. I am about 20 miles south of Tampa, Fl and receive some 28 watchable stations not counting the spanish stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work For Me","review":"I ordered this product online after doing the AntennaWeb scan for stations and antenna types in my area (Charleston, SC). The scan showed that all my stations require red, blue or violet antennas but this antenna is designed for the yellow zone. I tried a quick hookup but it did not receive any of the 14 available stations. It would be very helpful if your discriptions of the antennas available included information about the antenna type color zones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I don't know if I got a defective antenna or what but I was getting less channels (about 8) with it than I got with a little indoor antenna so I returned the channel master. I would have accepted another one from the seller Black River Distributing but I had to pay return shipping for the one I returned (not refunded). I didn't know if the new one I'd receive would be any better. I was not going to keep on paying unrefunded return shippings. So would I buy this antenna again? Not through Amazon, that's for sure. I still don't know if mine was defective or not. I'd buy it local in a store where it would be possible to return it without having to pay return shipping. Hate paying for NOTHING. This was my first and last experience on Amazon. Going back to ebay.

When I tried to order it two weeks later, however, I could not see this item in the same website. I sent email to Channel Master for inquiry, but there was no reply. On Jan 21, 2011 I called Channel Master's client/distributor supp department, and they told me that model 3037 was not available but they would contact me should it become available.

But because of Gleason's show, we get to see the Coltrane quartet at one of its peaks-particularly the mezmorizing \\"Afro Blues\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the historical value alone","review":"I found this worth the cost to me but mostly for the historical view. The music can be heard on a CD much better and quite honestly I didn't hear a lot being said by Basie or Gillespie (Coltrane declined to be interviewed).But what a treat to see the footage of a Public TV Broadcast of the 60's. Gleason's questions and attempt at dialog sounds very dated. Of course it was not atypical of the era but by today's standards he sounds amaturish and unprepared. But thankfully he did do these shows and we now get to see things in the exact setting of the era when they were done. I probably won't watch this all that often but I will pull it out now and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S THE MUSIC?","review":"What a tease! This is a limited performance disc so don't expect much music. Here are three of the premier Jazz musicians of our day (or anyone else's) and their already limited playing time is constantly chopped short and interrupted by the irritating host, Ralph Gleason, who interviews poorly and should have stuck to writing liner notes. Even the musicians were, obviously, put off by him...with Basie never looking directly at him and 'Trane refusing to even have dialog! Diz proved to be the most patient of the three. What music is permitted has marginal sound quality at best and just when you begin to groove a little, up pops Gleason, again!Hey guys...let's try it \\"one more once\\".

I think that even with talented interviewer the musical DVD should have the option to skip the dialogs and to choose to play the music only. It is also strange that the sound recording not as good as it supposed to be and the video picture is sometimes very dirty. Don't buy this DVD.Somebody needs to remake this DVD and make some cleaning of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightsaber Battle Game","review":"My son is 8 and he really enjoys this as does his father. We don't believe in video games in general but I talked myself into this one because you move around a lot while you use it. Both my son and my husband actually get sweaty doing it. It is a little touchy to use, i.e. you have to be just the right distance from the television to make it respond to you. All in all I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"physically fun!!","review":"this game is fun. you juke, you move, you swing, you sweat... your arms hurt. if the sensor was a little move accurate to pick up all your moves and the graphics were better this would be an all time fave, but whaddya expect for 30 bucks. its easy to travel with and easy to hook up. plus you can set the kids free on it, knowing that thier not just sittin there like big american potatoes... makes me wanna get a wii"},{"rating":"2","title":"As close as it gets to the real thing!","review":"Okay, maybe no one has created a real light saber yet, but this has to be as close as it gets so far! The game action is great, the sound quality is excellent. Overall a blast to play. The only part I would change is that I would like to be able to save it at the exact spot each time, not just the level. Some tips: Make sure you calibrate it each time (it only takes a second, so if you have a younger child, do it for him). On a last note, you could cheat and not really slash hard, but if you are like me and like to do just that, be prepared for a work out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Difficult and Kind of Frustrating","review":"My son got this game with very high hopes, and diligently worked with it for hours, until I noticed that he really wasn't having any fun. After investigating, I discovered that there are some \\"moves\\" that are almost impossible to pull off, and with the touchiness of the hardware and crummy graphics, success boils down more to random chance than to any kind of skill. In particular, experimentation with the game reveals that accomplishing anything on the left half of the screen is nearly impossible, as the sensor that sits on top of the TV isn't able to detect the light saber when the player moves to the leftmost 30% of its field of view. After reading some of the positive reviews, I can only conclude that either they're cooked up by Hasbro employees or there's something wrong with the unit we bought... If I'd known how frustrating this was going to be for my kid, it would've stayed in the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"rent the movie instead","review":"We spent an hour just trying to calibrate this thing. What a waste of money! My 7 year old couldn't get it. My 10 year old couldn't get it; and I could not get it. The directions were of little help as well. It was more fun renting the movie, or better yet buy the Game boy game for Reveng of the Sith. This game stinks. Back to the store it goes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"Well, it was pretty cool at first, like, blocking all the blasters, and other lightsabers, BUT the graphics are horrible and it is nothing like the real thing.

Furthermore, it broke after I dropped the lightsaber.:-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"This seemed like a great thing to keep my son moving around instead of sitting on the couch playing video games but it did not last very long. After being moved from one t.v. to another it quit working and now after only a month we have only the sound and no picture. In my opinion it was a big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big flop","review":"One of the reasons I purchased this toy was because of the rave reviews I read here on Amazon. However this has been a huge disappointment. I agree with the other reviewer about the calibration problems and my 9 yr old son becomes very frustrated to the point where he wants to throw the whole thing out the window!! This toy simply does not work. It is similar to when you are working your mouse on the computer but the mouse does not respond....awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"As other rviewers have metnioned this is a ridiculously difficult game for kids to master. The calibration of the lightsaber to the sensor is finicky and frustrating. Two adults, a teenager and a 5 yr old, whose present it was, couldn't make the thing work properly and the frustration levels only increase as the onscreen sensor acts independently, sending you backwards to previous screens without prompting. Then the 'combo' moves have to be exact in a completely inexact system, and it's imposible to advance until they are mastered. Obviously a five year old having to send back a Star Wars toy is a bitter disappointment. I see other reviewers have made it work and enjoyed it, but we're pretty game-savvy in our house and this one was just too annoying. Back to the shop it goes to get traded for something we can actually enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing/high, high frustration, impossible for 10 year old","review":"I am SHOCKED at the high reviews here. I had expected to find LOW, LOW ratings. This toy says: for 8+. My son is 10 & he cannot do it. My husband cannot do it. My 12 yr old cannot do it. Yeah, after 1/2 hour one of them will FINALLY master something. That is not my idea of fun OR theirs! This toy has caused a HIGH level of frustration & unhappiness while it is being played in our home.I can't imagine children succeeding with this. I can't imagine why ANYONE would like it-my husband can't do it, either. Bringing this toy into our house has been a bad move--it's no fun for my 10 yr old-but it causes the opposite: HIGH STRESS, FRUSTRATION, DEFEAT-my competitive son is miserable with this.It's almost impossible to do the moves with the light saber device to match the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great option to couch potato video games!","review":"Purchased for my then 13 year old son - the game itself it is a tad tricky (some of the moves can be frustrating), but good for someone who likes a challenge and definitely gave a great workout! I was thrilled to see him actively slashing the light saber around while defeating the levels rather than working on some tiny controller which only required quick finger movements. A negative was having to set the \\"camera\\" ball just so - the top of the tv was too high in our entertainment center, so you might end up experimenting with the best place to position it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome interactive game!","review":"I am VERY happy with this game. We had no idea what we were getting for our $50 but this has been money well spent. The remote hooks up easily and the light saber is a good size for kids and adults alike. Our boys (ages 4 and 6) have been having a blast playing this game and dueling against all the major Star Wars characters - good and bad. And they love the additional training exercises - against the remote droids, etc. The only thing I would change about this game is that it doesn't seem to keep the calibration of the light saber. When you turn it back on, you have to re-calibrate. It's a nuisance but not a big deal. And we (the parents) have loved playing as well. It's also teaching the kids different types of moves with the light saber and it's teaching them about patience and focus. Without it, you die quicker in the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this for my boys (ages 10,8 and 5) who are HUGE Star Wars fans...very disappointed. This game is nearly impossible for my ten year old...I even had a hard time mastering the moves. Too frustrating for kids AND adults, thus it sits in the game drawer untouched. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work very well.","review":"I bought this as a gift for my son. He is a Star Wars fanatic. But it was not really worth the buy. The \\"eye\\" does not pick up very well. He would be playing and his \\"saber\\" wouldn't work. I moved the \\"eye\\" every which way, but was unable to get it to constantly pick up my son's movement. If it wasn't for that, this would be a fun toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works, but get's a bit too hard quickly","review":"I got this for my 4 year old nephew who happens to LOVE swords. First off, this game actually works well enough once it's set up properly. The graphics are about in-between the original Nintendo and Sega Genesis and are smooth enough.However, even I (an avid gamer) was finding myself frustrated when trying to beat certain characters or levels just a few levels into the game.Expect your child to have hours of fun with this system, but do not expect him to be able to beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GAME for Grown up StarWars Geeks, Too.","review":"I got it for free with the SW Trivial Pursuit purchase, and am amazed that i love it more than that game!It is very exciting, fun, responsive, and entertaining.I am somewhat of a game console addict lately, but have been hooked on this game for a week now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy, blah!","review":"3 Good songs, Overstand, Building, Outlives the Man.

Damn PC endings. Batman is one of the more primal forces in the DC Universe, an unstoppable engine for justice. Given access to Kryptonian powers? Makes for pretty chilling stuff. But vital stuff too. This story isn't Superman's, despite his name on the cover. The first half of the book is one of the most intriguing set ups I've seen, and then they totally fumble the ball with this Lois Lane as Luke Skywalker and Batman as Vader. In a sensible story, Batman would have toned down his senseless beatings, relied more on the psychology of fear as he does in the \\"normal\\" Gotham City. What's more terrifying: a Batman that can juggle tanks or one who can see and hear everything in Gotham? Yeah, so this book is only for those with rose-colored glasses. For the rest, avoid.

The PC ending of this was so smarmy and smug I threw my copy towards the nearest convienient wall. I'm not a guy who likes peoples faces burned off or arms broken, but you have to realize that Kal-El isn't Clark Kent: he's Bruce Wayne. I don't care about any of that incidental crap.

The storyline was pretty standard romance fare, and the writing decent.

I didn't really connect with the characters and the story was a little slow and convoluted. And I didn't buy the ending at all. It's really hit or miss with romance novels, and I'd give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"disjointed and short on romance","review":"Started off well with the twin switch, then spent way too many pages explaining why.

The prepaid plans are a mess, they charge you $0.25 per minute for the first 10 minutes a day, or else you can choose to pay them $0.35 a day so you can talk for $0.10 a minute, but that sucks when I can't call anyone anyway, so I'm paying them $0.35 a day to just hold the cell phone.

The height is simply based on how many you stack on top of each other. The square design is more stable that the circle design and interlocks as more are stacked together. The rubber insert on the bottom prevents the raisers from slipping but I'm not sure if it would completely prevent scratching on a wood floor (ours are on carpet) since it doesn't cover the entire bottom. The clear color is inconspicuous. On the top are universal grooves so that they work well under small or large wheeled bed frames and the round bottoms of sofas and bed frames. We have the cirle ones, too, but can only use them with round bed frame supports because the wheeled supports keep slipping off. The product is made of solid, clear plastic and has held up well so far. Each raiser is good for about a 1-1/4\\" raise. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 Risers, 4 non-slip Pads","review":"I purchased this product through Amazon and chose it rather than another type of riser since it has 8 one inch risers per box. I determined that by raising our bed just 1 inch, it would be high enough for \\"under bed\\" storage containers. Then I could use the other four to raise our futon an inch and be able to store another container under it. The only flaw in my plan was that there are only 4 of the non-slip inserts in each box.

However, the advertised non-slip inserts were included on only 4 or the risers, leaving 4 of the 8 bed legs free to slide around and scratch the floor to their heart's content. Nowhere in their advertising or on their packaging does the company say that only 4 risers have non-slip inserts, making the product suitable for only one bed. In fact, the box of risers clearly shows a photo of a riser (insert included) along with a bullet point stating that, \\"Non-slip inserts prevent sliding on wood or tile.\\"I emailed the company asking them to send me the 4 inserts that had been left out.

Not too many people have stuck with it. So...ask yourself can you do this for the rest of your life? Cause as soon as you go off a little here comes the pounds! I tried the Atkin's and there's NO WAY a person could live like that unless you're a caveman! The whole thing sounds like a let down in the long run.

There is over 20 years of research backing this up. Ask youself one question you've been told fat is bad for the last 20 years, does it make ANY sense at all that out of the blue it's ok? What happened to all the studies that said it was bad for your health? Doctors are still subscribing medicine that reduces cholestrol in your blood stream. This is a deadly disease and these guy's are telling us to eat fat? DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE? The reason the diet works is that in total you have reduced your calorie intake.

Oh, and not only can you eat anything you want for your reward meal you can go back for seconds, provided you again divide it into thirds. Again, I say PLEASE! I've been fighting the battle of the bulge all my life, but one thing I know for certain is that in order to lose weight you cannot magically make calories disappear by eating foods in correct proportions.

Well to make a long story short I was afraid to go back onto the Dr.Atkins Diet but have tried oh sooooo many other diets with zero effects. So six weeks ago I went back on Dr.Atkins Diet and am finally loosing a lot of weight while of course staying on Lipitor. It is so very easy when everyone is on the same diet (although we do not consider this to actually be a DIET but a new way to eat and enjoy some of our favorite foods).

The negative reviews of this book sound like many of these people haven't even read the book.

This book literally saved my life. I now eat completely healthy ,balanced meals every day using the Hellers plan.

This is not a diet I can live on. I gained the weight back. Maybe it works for some. I've had much better success exercising more and changing the way I think. Two books I read recently really changed the way I felt about myself and helped me to lose more weight than any diet I've ever been on. Man's Search for Meaning was one of the best books I've ever read. It teaches you what is important in life. It is an account of a survivor of the Holocaust. The other book is the Mass Market Woman.

My breath was bad and I had no energy. I felt that eating so much at the reward meal encouraged the binge type of cycle referred to as \\"the last supper\\" in dieting lingo. Also, I felt self-conscious at the grocery store buying so much protein. I thought of all the animals that had to die to support this diet.

Then I started thinking about the way my thin husband eats and everything just started falling into place. My first day on this program was the best. Since Im not a breakfast eater I was thrilled that I didnt have to worry about that. After I had my carb free lunch I found that I was very full, right up to dinner time. The only time I had a little (very little) difficulty was in the evening, I dont really think I was craving carbs I think that just out of habit (and a very bad one at that) I felt like I should be munching on something.

I will never have to worry about my weight again! I am a new person!! And I feel better than I have in YEARS!This way of eating was hard to adjust to for the first few months but now I could not even imagine going back to the way I used to eat (lots of pasta, etc).

First, I only need to lose about 10 pounds, so do I need to do anything differently, like watching my fats or calories more closely? I have heard that it is almost impossible to lose those last 10 pounds on this diet. I hope not! Also, I do want to be a part of the on-line support group...how do I become a part?

Then a person's cells do not repond to insulin in a normal way so blood sugar may remain elevated or suddenly drop and result in hypoglycemia. The body yoyos up and down in energy, concentraion and mental acuity. The real problem is creating balance and health not just stopping sweet cravings. This book offers no answer at all for serious ill-health and depression resulting from carbohydrates. Health comes from strong digestion. Strong digestion is the basis of physical and mental balance.

The book did get the point across to me that carbohydrates have been overlooked as one of the main problems in the battle of the bulge. If anything, the Hellers' diet book got me to cut my carbs by two-thirds, and I am grateful for that. But as for following their diet \\"prescription\\" - no way. I still believe that all these books have an element of frontier hucksterism about them:you know, the promise of \\"miracles in a bottle.\\" Only the miracles promised are between the pages of their glossy-covered books.

The authors make the statement that \\"needing a good breakfast is an old wive's tale.\\" Says who? If I followed this diet, I would eat eggs and cheese every single morning and end up with cholestorol readings through the roof. I honestly believe that a common sense approach to eating combined with a regular exercise program is the way to maintain your ideal weight. I can say one good thing about this weight loss program: a cup of coffee in the morning is still allowed!

I have not even been able to read through the whole book--too much garbage and not enough of getting down to what you should be doing to loose weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unhealthy Food Plan","review":"I'm really surprised that Oprah is promoting this food plan. Not only does it not allow fruits but milk as well(which all women need).In this food plan milk is considered a carbohydrate. You basically consume protein and veggies at 2 out of your 3 meals per day. Your \\"reward\\" meal is once again protein, veggies and one high carb food. This can be anything from candy , fruit or milk,etc. However if you want a fruit and milk you need to eat another serving of protein and veggies! Oprah, women need more than one serving of milk per day and it shouldn't all be consumed in cheese which is allowed on this food plan. I'm really disappointed. If you're interested in this book save it for the library. If you feel like a carb addict try Kay Sheppard's \\"Food Addiction: The Body Knows\\". This allows fruit, milk and natural grains but cuts out refined sugars.

Needless to say, when the fen-phen stopped so did my weight loss and I have since gained all the weight back plus 15 lbs! I read the Hellers book, took the test and found out my problem could very well be an addiction to carbs. I really must comment on the reviews by others who are promoting the Zone diet and the nutrition bars...a 2.6 oz bar contains 17g of carbs and 13g of sugar...no wonder that with my addiction to carbs that I ended up bingeing on the bars and gaining weight...the Zone diet may work for some but not those of us addicted to carbs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very livable weight control program for people of any age","review":"This book is a follow-on to the Hellers' earlier Carbohydrate Addicts Diet.

What the Hellers outline is less a diet than a treatment plan for people who feel like they have no willpower or find themselves constantly snacking or heading back to the fridge an hour or two after a full meal. Guess what, folks? It ain't willpower, it's your body's inability to properly handle a steady diet of starches and sweets. The Hellers are swimming in the same pond as Atkins, Barry Sears and the Eades, but their program is far more livable than any of the other low-carb diets.

This only needs to be stated once or twice. They continued to belabor the point that high carbohydrate diets will result in the body's converting the sugars into fats, which causes heart disease and adult onset diabetes.

In this book Rorty is depicted as a philosopher that cannot understand true friendship. I disagree. Rorty's ironist liberal is quite capable of friendship (and yes, even in the Aristotelian way). Most of the book is almost ad hominem, referring to Rorty's childhood and attempting to show Rorty's philosophy as a vehicle of his psychoanalysis...oy vey.

When will anyone write a book on Rorty that reads him correctly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not helpful","review":"It is rare that I write a book review, but this book is such a poor value based on price and content that I feel a moral imperative.This book is based on the Maharishi approach to yoga and meditation (TM).It is not a \\"how to\\" book. It is not a self help book.Rather, it provides \\"scientific\\" backing for why you should practice.It seems like it was an academic paper turned into a book.It provides lists of things you should do, but no explanation of how.I understand that TM is copyrighted and must be taught in person, but the author misses the boat by not providing some basic meditation instruction that could prepare someone for additional training.Essentially, this book is an extended marketing brochure for TM meditation and other Maharishi programs."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"expected it to wrapped or something for such a big and expensive book.

Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish a book overburdened with purple prose, a predictable plot, sudden and often inexplicably-timed explicit sex, and one-dimensional characters who live only for their Eternal Love (or in the case of the villain, for his Eternal Hatred). I wanted to scream at all of them to get a life! To make matters worse, the blurb on the back cover gives away 2/3 of the book's plot. I can say as a positive point that the book did have a solid starting point for its plot with the concept of the immortal witches and how they get to be so.I hope that the author's other books feature well-rounded characters and plot twists, because this book certainly didn't. It will be quite some time before I try another Maggie Shayne book; there are too many other interesting-sounding ones to browse through here on Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was all right, but rather angst-ridden","review":"I've read better Maggie Shayne books. This one was nice, but I was looking forward to reaching the end. The plot was predictable, but then they give it away on the back blurb anyway. That which wasn't given away was fairly easy to figure out (given there's one evil guy, one bad guy and it's a romance) but I was all right with that. Don't go into this book expecting surprises.The writing style was difficult to get into. 1st person for the heroine, 3rd person for everyone else. It was jarring. Cool ending though. It almost alleviated the depressing tone that weighed over the rest of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I love discovering new authors and Maggie Shayne is quite a find.

Anyone who says this book isnt informative enough either (1) hasnt read it thouroughly (2) doesnt have good comprehension skills (3) didnt like what they read because they were finally told the truth about their obesity and they dont want to give up donuts and spaghetti. This diet isnt for the weak. You must give up bread, pasta, sugar, starchy veggies and yes, you must give up donuts. But the results are phenominal. The sacrifices seem harsh in the beginning, but if you stick with it, soon your food cravings for flour and sugar disappear along with a large percentage of your out of control appetite.

Shipping was quick and the book is in excellent condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very incomplete and hard to follow","review":"While I cannot comment on the diet itself, the book leaves much to be desired with respect to how it is presented. It is incomplete. Such an example is that there is no listing for the grams of carbohydrates in pasta, which is one of the most widely celebrated carbohydrate foods. Yet there is a listing of the carbohydrates in Dandelions. It is hard to really get to an understanding of what the no no's are...just a few examples. The charts and diagrams are not presented in a clear way, and speak more of the philosophy of the diet, rather than the instruction on how to run it. It also failed to address the common person. There are many exotic foods listed; but not even a mention of whether a glass of wine is acceptable and if so, under what terms. I'm sure that the diet has good merit, but somebody else should have written it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a small subset of the available information.","review":"Dr. Atkins' carbohydrate counter is a very small subset of the available carbohydrate information available, somewhat similar to a quick reference guide in other fields: Some information, but maybe not quite what is being sought. The organization of the book, into lists of beverages, or grains and breads, or nuts and seeds, milk and dairy, etc., makes it a bit more difficult to look up items -- why not just use the alphabet? I looked up wine -- not an umpopular item in this age -- and it was not listed. The most positive thing I can say about this book is that its small size (less that a quarter inch thick and somewhat smaller than a typical paperback) makes it a good purse or pocket book; just don't expect encyclopedic information from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the best they can do?","review":"Very disappointing little book - almost a pamphlet. I would have expected this to be the \\"definitive\\" book on net carb values, but it looks to be little more than you can find in the Atkins book.

I ended up buying another book that didn't show net carbs, but included many more entries and included fiber grams, making it easy to calculate net carbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time.","review":"This should only be sold in the supermarket check-out lanes for 99, like other mini-books. You can tell just as much from reading the nutrition labels on the products that you buy. Some of the information doesn't seem to agree with that on the packages themselves. Which should I believe? Just using it is a \\"guide\\" I guess, then it's useful, but I wouldn't know if I'd feel 100% confident in it's usage for a complete detailed factual information.

Dr Atkins reprises an error from his New Diet Revolution: he measures solids as liquids. For example, during the Induction phase, he recommends three cups (\\"loosely packed\\") of salad or two cups salad and 2/3 cup cooked vegetable. Doc: \\"cups\\" are for liquids! Tell me how many ounces!! This really rings true when he listes cooked items.This tiny guide repeats the error. I don't want to try stuffing my cooked carrots in a cup measure: tell me how many ounces! Most of us have a scale with a tare feature. Don't make me try to \\"loosely\\" pack a measuring cup with the endive leaves I want to leave whole to accept a stuffing. Sheesh.Don't get me wrong: I LOVE the diet. It works.

The serious consequences of our 10-year carbohydrate orgy (epidemics of obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes), make this book a necessary resource. A great life, however, requires more than a gram counter. We need FLAVOR as well as information-- and that's where \\"The Gourmet Prescription\\" comes in. All of the recipes are about intensifying flavor as well as lowering carbohydrates. It's a food lover's antidote to our carbohydrate binge and a great companion to any lower carbohydrate diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"It lacks other desired nutritional values.","review":"I was expecting to find the values for saturated fats and sodium for items listed, but was disappointed to see this relatively important nutritional information missing. Instead, it wasted space by listing the net carbs (which seem to be the carbs less the fiber, which are both included). I have been following the \\"Body For Life\\" program, rather than the \\"Atkin's diet plan\\", so I don't know what is important to you Atkins' followers. The Body for Life program encourages well balanced, nutritional meals, and NOT simply the reduction of net carbs. I was hoping this small, handy guide would help me plan a lower sodium, nutritionally balanced meal while I was on the road. Without listing sodium or saturated fats, I find the listings incomplete and the guide almost useless.

The analog sticks work okay, but the unforgivable part is the d-pad. You can press up and down or left and right at the same time. (actually, up/down/left/right can all be pressed at once, just by pressing down in the middle of the d-pad). This makes the controller completely useless for emulated games, platformers, side-scrolling shooters, or any game for which the d-pad is the primary input. When both up and down are pressed at the same time, most games have no idea what to do, and your character will just not move, or will do something totally unexpected.If you're going to use this stick for Quake type first person shooters or a flight sim or some game that uses the analog sticks, it will be okay. Not great, but okay. But for old school gaming, this is not the controller for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to watch, genuinely experimental film","review":"Burroughs and Gysin in a cut-up series of film pieces. Definitely not a good introduction to William S., but seriously impressive for the dedicated fan. Yeah, it'll take a couple of tries to watch it all the way through, but that is part of the point. DVD players don't come with \\"random\\" buttons alas (unlike CD players), but that might be a good way of viewing it. Rent, don't buy unless you're sure you want what's on here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie feels like an acid trip","review":"This is very strange, I would only recomend this to fans of Burrough's more cut up experimental books. This reminds me of an acid trip it is very bizarre. One short film just has a bizarre picture of some sort of skulls on the screen and it has Burroughs repeating one short sentence over and over again. Bill and Tony is extremely bizarre it involves Burroughs and another person stood next to each other one saying \\"I am Bill\\" and one saying \\"I am Tony\\" Then Tony will tell a story then the same sequence will start again with Bill telling the story, then Tony will become Bill etc and the story is told around 8 times in different ways. This dvd is basically unwatchable but it is great to have in your collection if your a true fan of Burroughs. Also if you dabble with music the Bill and Tony film would be amazing to sample."},{"rating":"1","title":"You might think the 2nd book would improve the story","review":"If the first book was a struggle then this one was pure torture. Once again we are subjected to mountains of macabre deaths while the protagonist consistently regresses each time you THINK he will grow from the events around him. The female counterpoint is pure stereotype and if you can't guess the ending by the fourth chapter then you might have a chance at enjoying this author's work. McIntosh has managed to make the second book move the story backwards, a trick I have not seen done before. The glaring question is WHY?"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's done it again!","review":"Another great book by the master of entertaining books about Marine Biology.

Bourne must have been through some kind of profoundly healing period in his life as he wrote these at times cryptic, hopeful lyrics.I sometimes turn off track 3, which is out of keeping with the rest of the album.It amazes me that this album isn't better known.

Soul Brother #1 Pete Rock returns to the old school masters, digging up phat beats and clever horn loops that make this an essential for any true hip hop lover. Highlights include his duel with Method Man on \\"Half Man Half Amazin\`\\", the laid back beats of \\"One Life To Live\\" and the title track. Like all classics this album just gets better and better. It makes all the millionaire pretenders even more cringe worthy. Other PR classics worth checking out are his Japan release mix of Blue Note classics and the recently re-released INI \\"Center Of Attention\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pete Rock's Brilliance Once Again is Captured","review":"On this solo album, Pete Rock manages to sustain his old school admirers with creative jazzy loops, and his appeal will indubitably run the gamut as far as contemporary listeners are concerned. PR hones his mastery on cuts like \\"Tru Master\\", which utilizes a minimal jazz ensemble (reminiscent of Holdin it down on Big L's album), to the downright macabre track \\"Strange Fruit\\", which prodigiously employs the Billie Holiday classic of the same name. Her displaced voice is chillingly effective as it weaves in and out of the track. the guest list on this album curiously combines major figures from both coasts of the U.S., both underground and popular. While \\"Da Two\\" makes me crave for another PR and CL effort, I have to be satisfied with \\"soul survivor\\", since this reality may not be manifested anytime soon. Do yourself a favour and discover this album, along with PR and CL's older offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Brother #1","review":"Is it me, or does it seem that Pete Rock never gets his props. He has produced many classic joints for various artist and two critically acclaimmed classics with C.L. Smooth. With this one, P.R. decides to rock it solo (well, not really). Pete is not exactly the greatest rapper, but his flow holds well with his amazing beats (Kanye West too). With a slew of guest appearances, this CD hits a homerun. Of course, some tracks are better than others, but there are no wack tracks on the album. It's a must have for hip-hop purists. Also, Soul Survivor 2 is on the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"before there was kanye west","review":"Classic, only word to describe this album. From begining to end. All the guest spots, all the beats. Everything was tight. Anyone who is feeling Kanye West needs to do thier homework, this man has been putting it down for years. Yo, I still think Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz shined on thier track. I believe they're the most talented one hit wonders ever to drop in hip hop. This album was just off the hook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"As a HUGE fan of the Pete Rock and CL Smooth duo, I was hoping for more of the same from Pete Rock's solo debut. Unfortunately, he disappears from the album early on and provides only an occasional verse here and there. This album might be better titled as a hip-hop compilation produced by Pete Rock since about 3/4 of the rhyming is done by guest rappers.In any case, I'm sure my expectations were much too high for this album which is why I was pretty disappointed. All in all, it isn't bad, but doesn't contain any of the infectious beats and intelligent lyrics that were the trademark of his past work with CL."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an update of my previous glowing review","review":"I purchased my first brewstation and was very pleased and wrote a glowing review. Well 2 months to the day of the purchase, it stopped working. After emailing Amazon, they told me they were sending me a return label to send it back. Three weeks later I finally received it and sent it back. I saw that they had reduced the price, so thinking I just had bad luck I ordered another and received it today. Cleaned it and ran a full pot through to clean, and my shower head leaks less. I have had tremendous luck with refurbished products in the past, but, I would not waste your time on this one. My mother bought a new one around Christmas and hers works great still. I guess I will go that route. I really like the concept of this brewstation, I just suggest you purchase it elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brewstation","review":"This was a replacement for one we had before.

In the space of 2 years, Brewstation number 3 has just quit working (doing what the other reviewer stated-just blinking on and off and you have to unplug it to reset it). The first one was purchased new and lasted 13 months-1 month after the extended warranty I bought. I figured it was just a fluke, and liked the design, so went out and bought another new one. It lasted about 7 months before it checked out into that big coffeemaker station in the sky. I wrote Hamilton Beach and was happy that they responded, and they had me cut off the plug and send it to them, and they sent me number 3. That was about 7 months ago and now this one has percolated it's last. So, instead of constantly replacing $10.00 broken decanters, I'm spending $50.00 to replace Brewstations. Great idea, Hamilton Beach, cheap product.

And Natalie Portman was incredible, as she always is in everything she does. As I mentioned, I never do comedy. But I have a weak spot for Natalie, and had some time to kill. And I am so happy I watched this film. Although the screen play is fairly predictable, the actors shine and really bring a smile to your face. The movie was sad, and ridiculously funny. I wrote down some of the one-liners! But in the end, the under-dog wins the girl, even with stiff competition. The movie is uplifting, and leaves you happy and ready to take a chance yourself. Check it out. I liked it, a LOT, and I don't do comedy! I'm a horror fanatic = ) Well....I was. ~Wolf"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but a little dark","review":"I really liked this movie and found it very entertaining. However, there is a dark undercurrent to it with Natalie Portman's character's trust issues so it's kind of hard to watch if you are in a bad mood, but I at least think they do a great job of acting in it, and it is a very entertaining movie if you are just looking for something fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Making Formula","review":"Outside of a few funny lines and outside of a good money making day for all studio staff involved this flick is a two-weeks-from-now forgettable 90 minutes. It's actually a bit sad to see Kutcher's talent wasted on formula romantic comedies, but again it's good pay for a day's work which is about how long it takes to make these. The important criticism is that the storyline is a quilt of ideas borrowed (meaning: many times recycled) from other rom-com flicks e.g. detached, insecure chick, whose a bit smarter than the lowly gardener (usually a gardener or some manual trade that allows physiques to be shown); dumb romantic enticements such as fast food restaurants and veggies for flowers; friends to act as either rational or provocateur foils - all done before.

I suppose that as fluff it could be worse, but I would rather waste my time on fluff that's not quite so sugary. The attempts to develop the characters, even the main ones, are slimy thin.

Ashton Kutcher managed to bring all of the talent to this that he demonstrated on That 70s Show, which is to say none. Outside of a few funny lines this movie adds nothing to the entertainment industry other than being a giant rotting cabbage that is the garbage heap that Hollywood has become. If you're a fan of Family Guy or Keeping up with the Kardashians than maybe this will be dumbed down enough for you to enjoy, otherwise spend your time doing something more entertaining, like maybe scrubbing a floor with a tooth brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Stinker!","review":"Not even worth the one star but I couldn't figure out how to leave none. I am a fan of foulmouthed humor but humor has to be the main ingredient. I hung in for about 20 minutes and had to give up.

For god's sake, I am 57 and know well what a f*** buddy is! My generation may have even invented the term. I would love to be able to watch a comedy that does not mention fingering or eating someone out in the first 12 minutes. I thought that was reserved for trash like \\"Porky's Revenge\\". The tradition and appeal of a good romantic comedy is its innocence, which happens with great infrequency in this film as a result of the occasional vulgarity which has sadly become part of our mainstream culture. \\"That hole is my b****\\", bellows Portman in a miniature golf scene. How sad to see what we have become. A show like \\"Sex in the City\\" would have dealt with this topic, which is a great premise, with far more class and humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funnier than expected","review":"The acting was decent and story predicable but funny nonetheless.

When things get close, girl rejects boy. Boy starts dating others. Girl realizes she actually loves him and has to be his one and only.The premise makes a sideways glance at the idea of friends with benefits -- relationships that say a couple can have sex without all the traditional levels of commitment, but does nothing to explore the idea.Likewise, the story does little to add any depth to the old fashioned romance story it actually is.Low marks for innovation, low marks for elegance in retelling a timeworn stereotype.Add to that, the male lead has no charisma and his character has few elements to make him interesting. A little character depth for both the boy and the girl character would have added a lot.Oh well.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natalie Portman romance.","review":"I'm a hugh fan of Natalie Portman.

Even if your not a Natalie Portman fan, and they grow ever fewer,the younger crowd of twenty-somethings will probably enjoy this one.

She is so natural that sometimes you can think that you are watching a real life soft drama as if you were there and things were actually happening in front of your eyes instead of looking through a screen.Kutcher does not disappoint in any sense.

I wish I could say at least that it was funny; alas, so much of the dialogue was cliché and generally predictable.I had this playing in the background on my iPad while I was looking for a book.

Put another way, this film is vulgar nonsense. Nothing wrong with that if it is also entertaining, but really, this film is a clean miss. Fortunately I watched it via my Amazon Prime membership and did not pay a penny to see it.

The only argument one can make about this book is its lack of historical evidence along with Harrison Salibury's Three Emperiors.

However Mao's weaknesses - vanity, covetousness, adultery (in the extreme), heck just paste in all the seven sins - also become tiresome after the first exhilaration of meeting this gangster turned dictator. In fact Mao becomes a bit like Tony Soprano - you stop rooting for him after you realise that this kind of life is what it is - unhealthy and harmful to others.

I have read many books written by people who lived through the years when Mao was in power (Wild Swans, A Leaf in the Bitter Wind, Red Chine Blues, etc.) and they were all great. But this one really got under my skin. Perhaps it is because I am a physician and can relate so much to Dr. Li's just wanting to just practice medicine and not get involved in politics, and trying to do what's best for the patient at all times. I cannot imagine what it was like to try and be Mao's physician during these times. I would have cracked early on. But I am so glad Dr. Li had the courage to write this great book.

Mao's bodygaurds and others have, in Chinese, denounced the author and directly refuted the book's sensationalist and orientalist pandering to reactionary Sinologists and ideologues. I wish I hadnt bought it, as it has little value as a meoir or history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouy Vey (As Carl Marx would Say)","review":"This book misses out on the real Mao Se Tung. The man with the big smile, the man who loved little doggies, the man with a song in his heart, and the fact that he was a great dancer.I'll still give the book two stars because it is about my dear friend but otherwise I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I strongly doubt this book","review":"This book is said to be a translation from Chinese which was written by Dr. Li. However, after one reads the Chinese version, he will find that Chinese version is a direct translation of this English book and it is certainly not a book that a Chinese writer would write (style, terms, grammer, ..., in a short, all). So, I would say that I simply will not believe this book before I can read a true original Chinese version of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Emperor","review":"The author vividly describes the life of Mao, which has been masterfully covered up or hidden by the successive Chinese authorities. It is astonishing that his personal doctor was willing to disclose the secret behind the disguise of Mao being the great revolutionary and liberator of the Chinese people. It appears that Mao was a power-hungry and self-fulfilling killer who actually killed hundreds and thousands of communist party colleagues and millions of Chinese people. No wonder the author ended up losing his life due to unknown reasons. His death reminds me of the way Iris Chang, who authored a book entitled \\"The Rape of Nanking,\\" departed the world after expressing her regrets of being fooled by some unknown parties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging reading","review":"I enjoy the book very much. It is a very engaging book. Some people claim that there are mistakes in the book. And one of the reviewers also mentioned that there is another Chinese language book out there specifically to contradict Dr. Li's accounts. However, I have also read that Chinese book. And I found that most of the \\"alleged\\" mistakes are trivial and minor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, approachable voice in style, horrifying content","review":"The author paints the most thorough inside picture of totalitarian, communist politics than I have ever read before. Which of course makes the read incredibly nerve wracking. I can't imagine how he survived all those years of threat and uncertainty without going mad. We are so very fortunate to have this account preserved for posterity. I hope it is available in Chinese. Surely Taiwan keeps this stocked on its shelves...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Management Skill of Mao Tze Tung","review":"Athough this book had highlighted many shortcomings of Mao Tze Tung. However, there were many things that modern CEOs need to learn from him.e.g His way of interviewing people, he was skillful enough to ease the tension for people whom met at the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"complex & revealing portrait of Mao","review":"The Private Life of Cahirman Mao is a fascinating, detailed portrait of this towering figure in world history.It's the good, the bad and the ugly, so come with an open mind.Recommend the Soong Dynasty (Sterling Seagrave, 1986) as a historical counterpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true history","review":"Dr. Li has devoted his life to be with the man who has change the outlook of China to be a more respected country. He has also proven to the world that an Asian too can become an extra ordinary leader. This is a book for us to read, because it really show us about the real life of Chairman Mao which could not be heard or seen or read in other historical book available in the market today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoko Yow Ono","review":"You must buy this.

Like thin ice!It is magnificent in its power to hunch up the shoulders, and cause squinting, perspiration, and eventual palsey.

It's less then 30 minutes long and 7 minutes of that is an introduction and warm up excercises. I learned 3 moves from this DVD, which only shows you about 8 moves! I am a plus sized woman and I can figure out how to walk around the walk by myself (walk around the pole is one of the moves that they teach!?!) It is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this dvd then immediately sold it on eBay the next day. It teaches a very small number of moves, which was very disappointing. Not to mention it spends more time showing someone who does not know how to do the moves correctly rather than the instructor. Even if you have never tried pole dancing before, this video is really only good for one viewing. I recommend getting something like PoleKatz that will at least continue to provide new moves for you to learn as you progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST POLE DANCING DVD","review":"I love this DVD.

(3/8 x 10 x 11) Could also be an eye-catching coffee table book. But the herb details are inspirational - you can't wait to grow your own. The book is divided into two parts: Growing Herbs and Enjoying Herbs in the Home. I especially enjoyed the chapters on Jellies and Preserves, Making Herb Oils and Butters, and Making Herb Teas and Herbal Drinks. Feast your eyes on Page 10 and go from there!."},{"rating":"1","title":"victor marchese: the undiscovered tenor","review":"The CD is quite acceptable up to track 13. The man obviously had a very pleasant voice but just happened to be in the right place at the wrong time. The tracks on the CD after track 13 are very average and maybe Mr Marchese should have retired a lot earlier than he did.As far as the DVD goes i have only played part of it and if the rest is as bad as what I played it is not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required for History Exam","review":"This book is what the Georgia History exam is based on. All Georgia college students must take the class or pass the test. Study this book and pass the test and save money on tuition and save time.

Actually, I had hoped that her sophmore attempt would have been much more appealing as well. After such an amazing fresh debut album, it seems India is only capable of pumping barn fodder. She just wallows in a boring repetative, same music-different words slump. This as well as the second album are best adminastered as slipping pills just before bedtime.

She didn't disappoint me with her latest release. \\"I am not my hair', is my favorite. I wonder, if she is singing about herself or someone else. [...]? Anyway this was a beautiful CD. If I could recommend anything I would say get ALL of her CD's, also get The Evolution of Robin Thicke,you will love that CD too. While your listening to them sing.

India, keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"India uses her succes to go non-commercial and it grows one me every listen.","review":"On my first listen I liked this album. It has some funky beats but overall it is a low key, listener's album. This one is the kind that you have to stop and pay attention to. As you do, it gets better!Rather than go into each song (though my personal favorites are the hauntingly beautiful \\"Good Morning and the uplifting \\"I Choose\\"), they all have their own feel and message, I'll just state that it is a solid album from a lady who will be around a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"personal views","review":"The thrill of the new has gone from India, yet this remains an important CD. It is bright, yet still deep. I guess if one is looking for compariisons then \\"I Am Not My Hair\\" is this CD's \\"Brown Skin\\" but tunes like \\"Better People\\", \\"Private Party\\" and \\"Summer\\" show humour that had been previously lacking in India's work.

India's acoustic style shows shes the real thing, the voice, the words, the sentiment, the presentation are all real.

This is such great music. The melodies flow, the lyrics move, and it all works together in such a way that leaves you feeling relaxed and smiling. I've read many reviews both on this site and others, and I must admit that I am confused by some feeling that it is too \\"preachy\\" or she's too optimistic. I guess if she just wrote more along the lines of Beyonce's \\"Check on it\\" critics would be happy. I appreciate the Amazon critics giving a \\"real\\" critique.The intro sets the stage for what is to come. My favorites are These Eyes, There's Hope, Summer, I am not my Hair, I Choose, and the bonus track This Too Shall Pass (that is the absolute bomb!)Get this CD, sit back and relax.

Apply a little at a time if you’re unsure of the amount. If you put too much in, you’ll get that oily, too-much product look and then you’re better off just showering again.I use a curling wand on my hair and I was very pleased that Citre Shine protected my hair from the damaging heat. If you touch my hair, you wouldn’t know that I ever styled it. It feels healthy, soft, and strong.

The film, and the accompanying bits and pieces, are still interesting in spite of this, but one was constantly aware of how very much better the whole treatment could have been.

What are you people listening to? Take REM on a very bad day (and that is baaaaad) mix in The Waterboys minus the songwriting ability and sprinkle with a little Nickelback (and that is not a good thing) and voila you have this band. Yes that bad. The singer sounds like he's going to have a stroke in the choruses. Weak weak weak.

It is like looking back at my life and watching myself grow and evolve as I followed them through their career (which better not be nearing an end). The songs and the videos are great, especially as I hadn't seen most of them before due to my lack of MTV as I was growing up. For me what makes this collection special is the interview with Ed. It is enlightening to know that he views his music in much the same way I do and gets the same energy from it as his fans. I recommend watching the interview before you watch the video, it makes you feel like you can be a part of the songs from Ed's point of view.

Plus, I was surprised to see \\"Pillar of Davidson\\" on here considering that there are at least three other songs that were not released from the \\"Throwing Copper\\" album that are much better.

Should've heard her on this years World Music Awards...... { S H U D D E R }.This single should have 1 or 2 more songs on it other than remixes. 1 \\"b-side\\" isn't enough. She is good on \\"Sometimes\\". It really makes you think about the lyrics. And at least she (co-)wrote an actuall song \\"I'm So Curious\\". That isn't bad. Better than some of her other stuff.Not much else to say about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really like Britneys Pears","review":"Her music is absolute garbage and shallow, good for teeny boppers and people with no interest in real music. But she's a good strong lass with a lot going for her.When she jumps about mimeing her songs on stage you see a really fit, finely honed athelete with everything in the write place. Yes maybe there aint much between her ears, but she's a real visual treat to my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Britneys new song is awesome!","review":"Britney Spears is a great singer for her age.

I'd recommend spending an extra $10-$20 and getting a better model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last...","review":"CD player stopped working after two months of ownership, it was playing a cd and puff, that was her last one.

Big mistake! My experience with this product has been what many others here are reporting: It breaks quickly (mine broke the 2nd day!) and starts skipping or stops playing music altogether (sometimes, if I don't turn it off when it does this, it will resume playing later, at some random time). Basically, it doesn't work.

However, it was not properly packaged and the plastic dust cover was broken when it was received. It still works and since I live 50 miles from the nearest town and have no mail service, I go into town about twice a month, and returning the item would have resulted in my waiting about another month for a replacemnt. So I decided to live with the broken cover since all the features are working."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy another.","review":"I had trouble with two of these.

It was attractive and worked well. Unfortunately it is not available any more. The closest model I found was this one. The tuner wouldn't hold and the cassette deck wouldn't turn off at the end of the tape. The tape was set up to insert backwards and it was hard to insert as well, plus the buttons were set up in an odd way. I really debated whether to just put up with it because of the hassle of returning it, but when I couldn't tune in the biggest station in town, I returned it and I'm glad I did. I got a full refund, and I bought the Emerson PD6548SL instead. So far it seems to work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"boombox","review":"The stupid thing broke on me the second day..

I copied about 1.5TB of files over to it first thing with no problems. That is the only positive.Here are my negatives:- You can't swap harddrives in and out quickly, you need a screwdriver and to mess with 6 screws.- It relies on a big power brick and is very plasticy / cheap feeling.- I would be easily willing to overlook those faults if it didn't SHUT OFF randomly. The thing works until I do heavy editing in Final Cut Pro, then at completely random times, it decides to just shut off. It's good for transferring files that you won't access often, but other than that, it's completely useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm... didn't stand the test of time","review":"Previous review changed. This died before reaching age 1 year. Icy Dock have proved simple to use (have owned several different docks) but unfortunately the quality of build seems generally to be low.

I found it very very disappointing, I thought it was full of ways to play mind games. For those who don't just want to \\"get laid\\", I highly recommend \\"My Guy\\", by Martin Kantor, and \\"Ten Smart Things Gay Men Can Do to Improve Their Lives\\", by Joe Kort, instead. They are much much more mature and was very helpful to me. They both were as fun to read as well. I would never waste my money on Mandates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun AND Functional","review":"I was surprised at how excellent this book is. After having perused the run of dating \\"how to\\" books, I had admittedly low expectations - but Dave Singleton gives advice, perspectives, and thought-provoking stories in a way that's entertaining, engaging, and - most importantly - respectful of the reader.I was most impressed by the book's approach, that dating is a process toward whatever goal the reader might have - monogamy, dating a couple of guys, whatever. That and the positive, encouraging, but never condescending or \\"talking down\\" tone of the book made it a lot of fun to read - and a functional tool in the world of gay male dating.I just bought a dozen copies of this for all my dating gay male friends. Thanks, Dave!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty lame, with a few chuckles","review":"This book offers very little in the way of real dating advice. If you did follow all of this advice, you would basically be a flaky queen. (Perhaps this is the goal?) The author's dishy style can be funny at times, but overall this book is pretty lame. If this is meant to be serious, it does not succeed and is very similar to \\"The Principles\\" book by Orland Outland a few years ago, which is a better book. If it is meant to be satirical or amusing, \\"Husband Hunting Made Easy\\" is much, much funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work like new","review":"This battery works ok but it doesn't fit in my camera quite right.

You feel as though you are getting a rare glimpse into the lives of the people who both built these magnificent \\"cottages\\" and the families who lived in them.

This is a charming book full of wonderful photographs and I highly recommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy Acanthus Press edition","review":"I agree with Shannon Deason's review.I own many of the Acanthus Press series on estates and mansions ( as well as those by other publishers) and this one is on the higher end of my Acanthus favorites. Not at the top end like 'Houses of Los Angeles' ( 2 vols) of 'Great Houses of New York' but still very good. The main problem, totally out of the control of Acanthus or the author, is that the Berkshires did not have the consistently grandest of the grand mansions. Nor was it intended to. It's not Newport. So this book's quality lies in its solid research and rare period photos of the lesser photographed estates. Still beyond the budget of mortal man mind you, but just not the stratosphere like The Breakers or Biltmore or San Simeon. So because this book covers the lesser known Berkshires makes it a required edition to a serious collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference Book","review":"I first read this book in community college as a student pilot, then later at San Jose State University studying aerodynamics. It's the only book I've found that effectivly communicates the complexities of aerodynamics without becoming overly scientific or simplistic. The age of the book shows in it's graphics, but the line drawings used to illustrate the important points I find to be less distracting and more informative than the more complex graphics found in later works. Overall, this is an excellent addition to the library of anyone seriously interested in the science of flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for any pilot","review":"Trying to get my pilots license and wanted to be more than the average pilot.

Best of all, the sharpener is very portable, weighs less than nothing, and fits into backpacks, fishing tackle boxes, hunting fanny pack, etc. with no added weight or bulk.The edge that this sharpener puts on a blade is a great starting point for further honing of the blade to razor sharpness if desired.I have several of these sharpeners. The only drawback is that the sharpening stones wear out after perhaps 6 - 10 sharpenings. But under 10 bucks a unit, this is a bargain.Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product, the handle is easy to hold on to","review":"The quality is good, the handle has a cushion grip and it is easy to use and does a great job sharpening"},{"rating":"1","title":"sort of works","review":"this worked very well to sharpen my scissors, but it is terrible at sharpening knives.

She can read almost all the words all by herself, and loves the pictures. My sister says it's the one Christmas gift that has actually gotten used almost daily. There is just the right amount of text per page, with a paragraph for each smaller picture. I teach elementary students and I believe this book would be just right for first through maybe fourth grades if kids are reading alone, suitable for preschool if books are read aloud.

The misguided attempt to glorify this miserable, murdering wretch isn't criminal but ought to be. No, I don't blame the actor (who apparently thought there would be more accuracy in the portrayal of the protagonist but no doubt was powerless to keep those scenes in - so he was misled and played the fool); I blame those who wrote and produced this atrocity.History shows many appalling instances of unwarranted genocide, many related to tyrants' desires to force religious choices, and Oliver Cromwell and Adolph Hitler lead the pack.

The script is literate without being rhetorical. But Guinness steals the show as the fateful King Charles--watch this performance carefully and see great acting at its greatest! The sets and (Oscar-winning) costumes are flawless. This movie is visually impressive and emotionally involving. For some reason certain reviewers in the past and present have dismissed the movie as less than what it is. That's just plain (1970s) snobbery by critics who just want to impress other critics with their limited wit and abundant sarcasm. Forget about the so-called inaccuracies. History in general is one inaccuracy after another. This is a movie, and as a movie it works beautifully! Highly recommended for adults, although I find nothing offensive for mature youngsters.

This is a well made film, but its near-total disregard of Cromwell's genocidal Irish campaign, (and of the heroic opposition to that butchery by elements of his New Model Army, Levellers and Diggers among them), renders the film a profound disappointment. Shame on Richard Harris (RIP) for not insisisting that the Rape of Ireland be at least prominently mentioned in this biopic.In songwriter Terry Woods' words, \\"A curse upon you, Oliver Cromwell, you who raped our Motherland!

It's more of an action film than the original.Sean Bean and Sophia Bush were both excellent.It's amazing how Sean Bean can go from somewhat trustworthy looking (it's the smile) to complete psycho.I recommend this to anyone who doesn't have hang-ups over their favorite movie getting remade and people who just like a suspenseful action flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"hitcher","review":"This film shows why it is bad to pick up strangers.. and it's bad for me cause how am i suppose to get a lift home now???Anyway, it's scary stuff with some jumps along the way..

I guess they were trying be like Joy Ride It worked for that movie Hitcher is way different. Oh the girl survives there isn't much different. I want to say hey this movie is an ok way to pass 2 hours but I don't really care for this movie. So just being a exact copy just makes this pointless to make & a waste of money. If it was made for money it didn't make a whole lot it flopped & left theaters quickly. I didn't like Bean's John Ryder he is a very good actor but it's not a great performance.

Its just when the characters do STUPID, STUPID things, over and over, there is only so much you can accept as being \\"under duress\\".

Sean Bean is just creepy as hell in this.. he will really scare the hell outta you. Sophia Bush shows that she can do more than One Tree Hill and teen drama's.. she is a good actress in this.Have fun with the movie. Don't expect a masterpiece, but it certainly is good.

I have to confess: I'm a big fan of the original HITCHER, it was scary, breathlessly suspenseful, and even made you think. This pointless remake has none of those attributes. For one thing, changing the lone driver in the original to a cloyingly cute young couple in the remake is a disastrous decision. The original, with its lone protagonist driving cross-country across dark and rainy wide open spaces, was very likable and more to the point, terribly vulnerable. By changing the story to a couple going somewhere for spring break, you automatically undercut the tension greatly because you have TWO people who can turn to each other. This is the first in a series of bad choices made by the filmmakers. Please buy the original...it's just that: ORIGINAL.

They do help reduce the dander and other bad stuff exiting the exhaust of the vacuum but it's not 100% \\"clean air\\". I used to think that HEPA meant the air coming out the back of the vacuum would be like \\"purified air\\" but that's not the case. Like a good furnace filter it just catches more of the bad stuff; enough that you'll notice a difference.The main thing is to change your bag (maybe use HEPA bags too) often enough that you don't have to worry about the filter. They say you should change it once I year I believe, and that's probably reasonable if you've got a couple pets. For those without, I wager these things easily last 18 months unless you live in a really dusty home / very high pollen / mold count type area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price, fast shipping","review":"Good filters for my Kenmore vacuum.

HOW?!?!","review":"My daughter has a ton of the peek-a-blocks, and she just LOVES them! When I read the review saying they are dangerous, I had to add my two cents :) First of all, I don't know what the person means by saying the blocks have sharp edges, I have never noticed anything sharp on the blocks, EVER. And as for their child getting hurt by falling on the blocks, that could happen with anything,doesnt mean it's the blocks fault. My daughter fell the other day and smacked her mouth on the floor, causing her teeth to go through her lip. There were no toys around, so should be call floors dangerous too? Just seems a ridiculous claim really. Children fall and get hurt all the time, its part of childhood. After 5 kids, I've learned that lesson well! :) All in all I have to say that I think the Peek-a-blocks are the greatest! I don't see them as a danger in any kind of way! In fact I am buying her even more of them for christmas this year :) Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor container for blocks","review":"Please be careful when buying this toy. The yellow handle and red box to store the blocks in is not designed very well and little children (and adults) can pinch their fingers when pushing the handle upright.

Only flaw is that it took forever to get! It was going on two months but after talking to Amazon they ended up pushing it up to a faster shipping and I ended up getting it. Another thing is that in the English dub version you don't hear Shion's mom talking to him in the first episode when he is talking to her threw the intercom. But I watch it more in Japanese so that was fine with me. ^^This is really an amazing anime and after watching this I ended up getting the books that it was all based on.In the end I was so glad I ended up buying this threw Amazon and not somewhere else.

The dub is poorly done, It's not that the voice actors that are bad, it's just that there where multiple times that the voice wouldn't align with the mouth movements (voices would be heard and the character's mouth was either not moving yet or had already stopped moving) It's not even just this, the DVD menu is boring with no sound, it's a still picture, and has no notable special features. With the amount you pay for a Sentai anime it's unacceptable to receive a product that seems like little to no effort was put into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing series, and a great dub","review":"As a long-time fan of the series, I'd say it's entirely worth the money. The anime has its weak points, trying to cover 9 volumes in only 11 episodes, but it is still a great series. The dub is well done, and I certainly will make good use of my DVDs, watching the series over and over again. It has a pretty powerful message to it, too.Especially at the marked down price, I would buy this as soon as possible.

A mixed-blessing is that the roomaji (roman alphabet) for the Japanese is included, meaning you aren't forced to read the actual Japanese kana if you want to read it in Japanese. This is helpful to my wife, as a beginner to the language, but I would love it if it wasn't there and she was forced to use what she has been learning in her class.The story is great, and both my 2 and 5 year old love to have us read it to them (my 2 year old prefers it in Japanese - success!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip the book in my opinion","review":"The best bet you have is to read Neile McQueen's book My Husband My Friend.

They spend less than 30 seconds on each film, and a good portion of that time is spent on the numbers between the screen. The commentator has no special insight and mostly recites well-known facts about each film.As for the films themselves, the selection is good. The list mirrors AFI closely, except they completely ignore \\"Schindler's List\\" (AFI #9). In its place in the top 10 is \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", which I loved but am a little wary about putting it that high. They also bypass \\"The Third Man\\" and put in \\"The Matrix\\" around its position. I am very doubtful that this is by critics' consensus.There are a good number of trailers, which stops this DVD from being a complete waste.

It took so long for Lenny Bruce to get a pardon from New York, where he was convicted of obscenity for a performance at the Cafe Au Go Go in Greenwich Village, that it must have been December 2003 before sufficient hypocrisy had built up so a New York governor could announce a pardon based on \\"the precious freedoms we are fighting for as we continue to wage the war on terrorism.\\" (p. 111).

But after reading it cover to cover, I was appalled at the number of inaccurate definitions of commonly used slang terms. Did no one fact check this book? Some of the definitions aren't even from the US, they are from other countries - and the meanings are very different. The way the book was organized wasn't very logical either, it appeared to jump all over the place, making finding a particular term difficult. I can't recommend this book for someone wanting to learn about American slang."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accessible reference book that is fun to read","review":"The new and completely updated edition of Paul Dickson's Slang dictionary is a detailed research work that is totally accessible for general audiences.

The book also contains many useful and amusing sidebars, such as a listing of the cryptic emoticons that many people put into email messages (such as :-! for \\"foot in mouth\\") and the code that people use in personal ads. Along with authors such as John Ciardi and Hugh Rawson, Paul Dickson has produced the rare example of a book for your reference shelf that is a lot of fun to read from cover-to-cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good scanner","review":"I bought this scanner at a wholesale club-- I've got no complaints with it.

The book contains only themelody line, chords, and the first verse and/or refrain for the songs.

Colorful, yes, and initially fun, but leaving no lasting impressions. I liked the paperback book covers, the hip records, the naughty napkins, but the book falls short on exploring drinks and music--which should've been the focus of the piece. Instead, we get a tiki section (with grass skirt ads!) and a chapter on the Beatnik movement. Bachelors in the 1960's were self-appointed suburban kings, not pot-smoking guys in berets who listened to Lenny Bruce (those were KIDS, not bachelor men). Therefore, the bongos and the hippies are just wasted space in what should've been a much more precise and engaging look at a specific genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste Filling Less Great","review":"This book looks great and has tons of photos- it is an enjoyable collection of eye candy.

Since he is only 5 years old, I planned to prepare the toy for him and let him squeeze the trigger. I'm quite able to handle most gadgets but after reading the instructions and figuring out what fluids go where and when to press which switches, we ended up with a big mess rather than any decent vapor bubbles. The cap of the vapor fluid would leak (alot) every time I attemped to fill the vapor chamber. And then you have to dip the blower in the bubbles each time. It was far too complicated, time-consuming and messy, unless you have older children who can handle the set-up by themselves, and consider it worth their time,I would not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"What a disappointment this product was.

The first-time novelist spoonfeeds you nothing, dropping you squarely in the midst of a complexly structured and intriguing world. The story, as it unfurls, is captivating, and the ride all the more intoxicating for the sheer quality of the writing. But it's the richness and reality of the characters that will ultimately hold you glued and hoping (as I am) for a second book to follow the journeys of Swan, Ula, and Aryn. This is thinking readers' sci-fi."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing book.....","review":"This is a story that takes you to a complex world, full of strange jungle like flora.

The bear who wants to go over the mountain is terribly cute, especially as he says goodbye to his mama before departing. However, the book is so simple that it didn't engage my 2-year-old, who loves the many other Wells books we have. The repetitive song essentially has just three lines. And, unlike other Wells books, the illustrations don't vary that much from page to page.

He likes for you to sing it to him & he likes to sit & \\"sing\\" it to himself. As always, Ms. Wells' illustrations are perfect. It's a nice way to start reading with a squirmy child because the song is already familiar. I would recommend the whole series of Bunny Reads Back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only if you like singing the same song all day every day","review":"We had to buy this after my toddler went crazy for it as a library book.

The author lets you get into the story and get into the minds of the characters. I was sceptical at first when I started to read the book, only because I used to work with the author, I didn't think it was going to be as good as it is. This is one mystery book I would read again and again. Anyone who hasn't read it yet, please do so. And if you love a mystery where you try and guess who done it, well this is the book for you. This is one book that gets your attention from the first chapter to the last. You won't want to skip any pages while reading this book.

It's grittier than the others and there are even more great characters -many old ones but several new ones too- than in the other two books combined, which I was not expecting.There is high humor and fairly gruesome tragedy, as well as some almost epically poetic moments.Something of the ancient Greeks and Romans here, or perhaps closer to a Viking bard?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tripp Lite PS2408- Multi Strip 15-amp.","review":"A quality multi-outlet strip and I did enjoy the brushed aluminum cover. However, as another customer commented, the power cord comes out from the FRONT panel rather than one of the ends.

In this opus, Nick Craven finds himself accused of murdering his dear old Mom. Add to this a crazed killer who is targeting the good old Mounties themselves. As with all Slade books, expect lots of background on the Canadian mounties and in this book, the Zulu war. Additionally, expect the usual shocks and twists, as no one (not even our favorite recurring characters) is safe in a Slade book. Poor Nick Craven----from this book on, he certainly does have a lot going against him! The identity of this killer is resolved only on the last two pages, and it is a definite shocker. Slade's style is still mesmerizing; you get used to all his background research because eventually it does tie in to the plot of the book. Once again, a skillful entry in the Special X series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book is hard to follow, as it jumps around a lot in time - starting in Africa in 1879 and jumping forward to the 1990s in Vancouver, Canada. There are too many plot twists. I finished the book because I was bored and had nothing else to read, otherwise I'd have stopped about a third of the way through. By the end I didn't really care who the killer was, I was just glad the book was done.

In this book, nearly everything said is repeated 2 or 3 times. From the prologue describing the gunfight at OK Corral to the first chapter where the protagonist retells the story of the gunfight at OK corral to his gay lover (who dresses like a sailor), it is full of text or characters saying the same thing over and over again.I am going to burn my copy of the book so no one has to be subjected to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Squash/Volleyball Shoe","review":"I've worn this shoe for almost a year and I couldn't be more happier with it.

I play squash and volleyball about 5 hours a week total so the shoe has held up well. A few guys I know are also on their second pair of these and they are more than satisfied with Asics quality.

The only thing I could conclude is that liver and kidneys were not able to clean that artificial flavors. I bought two tubs after reading all the rave reviews it got, but man it tastes so bad and my mouth has that sweet (artificial chemical) taste until I wake up in the morning (I workout in the evening at around 6pm). The reason I switched to fast twitch from NO Xplode 2.0 was because NO Xplode got some reviews which mentioned hyper liver enzymes (which I never experienced myself personally, maybe because I took only one scoop per day) but I didn't want to take risk with that product.

Ever done that with a caffeinated supplement and laid in bed staring at the ceiling, with a totally drop-dead tired body but alert brain? sucks doesnt it? This is the only supplement I keep coming back to for that reason. It gives you some energy and definitely increases stamina. It also has kre-alkalyn creatine which is awesome because you need very little and none of it turns into creatinine. It doesnt mess with my stomach one bit and it tastes great.

There is quite a bit of distortion (barreling) which I guess is to be expected considering it is a cheap lens (nice wide angle lenses can cost [much, much more]). The barreling I can live with considering the price and what I use it for, but the chromatic aberrations are really really bad. If you want to see rainbows then this camera is great--taking a picture of the stars reveals them to be giant rainbows... Yeah, not nice. Under normal uses (i.e. non point light sources like the stars), this will usually manifest itself in blue and red outlines around objects. If I take off this lens and just use the camera's internal lens I don't have these problems, so it is definitly the wide angle lens causing the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"One day of fun then nothing!!!!","review":"My son received this item for Christmas, We played with it for about 30 minutes on Christmas and then put it away.

Was washing dishes near the sink and I had placed my new skillet there to be washed. I was loading the dishwasher and bumped a glass cup against the end of the handle and it chipped off. Since then it doesn't take anything to chip the enamel. I spoke with lodge mfg and they said that this was under the warranty for abuse and was not covered. A lot of money was put out and it doesn't seem worth it to have to baby a skillet. I will stick with plan cast iron or stainless steel from now on. You have to also be very careful how you was the outside enamel. Just not worth it.

No need to say more than that.If you like using cast iron cookware you will be well served with this line of Lodge Enamel which however, unlike the original made in USA products, are now made in China. Though I prefer to buy American, I am so satisfied that I went ahead and ordered the Lodge Enamel 10 inch Grill Pan as well. These products have an enamel coating on both the outside and the inside surfaces and, unlike the original Lodge products, require no seasoning.Cast iron cookware works extremely well on induction plates as the temperature can be adjusted in very fine increments and the entire pan heats evenly through magnetic induction without any hot spots. The combination of cast iron and induction yields great results.Four stars instead of five as the inside enameling should be applied in a thicker coat to better hide the casting grain."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned -- not as promised","review":"Thank goodness for amazon's easy return policy. This item was described as \\"The porcelain surface eliminates the need to season cast iron\\" but the interior of the pan does not have a porcelain surface but rather is a course flat black iron like surface that is sticky. I used this pan once, and decided it was not for me. The outside of the pan is nice and slippery like my cast iron enameled dutch oven. I guess it pays to buy the twice expensive french cast iron skillets instead of this less expensive stuff made in china. Lesson learned.....for now :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot spots and Sticky!","review":"I bought this skillet hoping to find an alternative to Teflon covered non-stick skillets. Unfortunately, this skillet is not it. The heat distribution is very very poor. Food will burn in the middle and barely cook on the sides.

I also don't have to worry about cooking with tomatoes or vinegar. I bought this pan to \\"replace\\" my cast iron ones, but the inside surface of the pan isn't smooth like the inside of the dutch ovens. It's a little bumpy and rough. Not really sure why - maybe it's trying to mimic cast iron? Because of this, it's not as easy to clean and it's not as non-stick as I'd like. If I add a thin layer of oil to it before heating, it does perform wonderfully, though.Overall, it's a good pan and I use it frequently, but you should know that the inside surface is quite different from typical enameled cast iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I had bought Le Creuset","review":"I purchased this pan in Feb. for my daughter hoping it would be almost as good a Le Creuset, which is a lot more expensive.

It hold a lot of food and cooks very evenly, but is so heavy that she can't lift it with one hand. If you're a weightlifter or need to cook a lot of food, this is the ticket. Otherwise, get a smaller skillet that's lighter so you can lift it with one hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for an Alternative to Teflon? Keep Looking.","review":"In order to achieve any sort of non-stick quality, it's necessary to use a lot of oil. Even when using a lot of oil, though, I often wound up with half of my food (e.g. hashbrowns or eggs) stuck to the pan. This pan made me dread cooking.If you're looking for an alternative to teflon coated or infused pans, I highly recommend Martha Stewart's GreenPans. I had previously used Calphalon for many years, and I'm finding that GreenPans perform as well or better.If you really want to cook with cast-iron, though... If you're having trouble flipping something, stop and wait. When the part of the food touching the pan has cooked thoroughly, it is more likely to \\"release\\" better. (It's similar to cooking on a hard-anodized surface.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Bit of Pop and Blues","review":"A splendid C.D.

This book actually makes me mad because how can they call it \\"Learn 101 Spanish verbs in 1 day\\"??? HOW???? The pictures are weird. Some very basic verbs (that I already know) and the pictures just do not make sense to me. Do not buy this book, it will only make you mad and confused.

There are just a few poor quality recordings of sessions with Spears on a radio show pretending to be a rap star and tricking callers into auditioning their music and a couple of recordings where Spears calls into a radio show pretending to be a rap star.This release would be tolerable as a bonus track for a comedy CD but is totally unacceptable as a stand alone release.

However, I too received only one chair in a huge box big enough for four. It was a pain getting it to the post office to return it because the box barely fit in my car. But at least Amazon refunded me and paid for the return shipping (I have Amazon Prime so I didn't pay anything to have it shipped to me...they probably paid more for shipping than the chair was worth!). The only thing I lost was my time, and I ended up wasting more of it going to Ikea for four $15 chairs. I am disappointed that they have such a misleading title, and have not yet corrected it.

After 10 minutes, I was so utterly bored and annoyed with the trainer yelling \\"stick with it\\" every 10 seconds that I stopped the video and put in an old reliable Jillian Michaels DVD.If you're looking for a tough workout that will make you drip sweat, my advice is to stick with Jillian. Sorry ELLE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Two Cents","review":"Hmmm I burned a good 500 calories (doing workout one and two) this will be keeper for me. If you can do Jillian Michaels you can do this it is similar but not exactly the same. If your the type of person that needs to have a super fun workout and lose motivation doing repetive moves then go to something like zumba, this workout is not the place. This is a workout for people who want to sweat, have genuine workout and does not care about the extra stuff and motivated by plan old working out, not by the music, the trainer, and different types of exercise moves. The music is not great, the trainer is kind of annoying and doesn't focus on the audience, your jumping most of both workouts and but its a really good cardio WORKOUT. You will sweat, burn calories with basic interval training moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elle cardio workout","review":"Super work out. Fun to do, and easy to modify and do in a small space.

If only they would have included the opera music from Madama Butterfly, it would have been perfect. It contains the piano version of the Madama Butterfly Fatal Attraction, but not the vocal opera singing heard during the dinner scene. The music is intense and scary. It literally takes you on a heartpounding journey into Michael Douglas's terrifying situation with the borderline psycho woman played by Glenn Close. Contains the music from every scene, including the violent kitchen scene where she cuts herself and tries to stab Douglas with the butcher knife, the boiling pot scene, the rollercoaster scene, the brutal bathroom scene where she terrorizes and tortures Douglas's wife, and many more... Great for Halloween/scary music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase I've made on Amazon so far.","review":"The book looked as though it'd been a dog's toy for quite some time.

I would recommend this documentary for every one, it has allot of footage of the September 11 attack which makes it a collectable item for those who want to capture all the moments they can."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Retrospect, Still Good","review":"This is an excellent presentation of just what was going on structurally inside these two great buildings when exposed to incredible stresses. While each tower was designed and constructed to physically withstand a direct impact by contemporary large aircraft (based on previous experience with the Empire State Building), the architects weren't visionary enough to plan for even larger planes in the future, Fully Fueled, crashing and Burning with all of that fuel inside these structures. Simple thermodynamics in 20/20 hindsight. But the world wasn't so f---ed up when these were designed. This program puts forth the investigative facts (FEMA Report), as officially gathered, and presents them to the viewer without bias (or emotion, which is a little eerie). I recommend this for the sober-minded. If you want Conspiracy, look elsewhere. Highly recommended, even today. -MH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet reason to buy this DVD","review":"I saw this program originally on my local PBS station when it aired. It technically shows how and why the towers fell. Why the second tower that was hit by a plane fell first, how the towers stood strong then, without warning collapse, and the heartache the building's architech felt watching the towers get attacked and then collapse from his office a couple of blocks away from Ground Zero. Very well done 60mins. of TV that answers alot of questions people might have or rumors that people might have heard.

This project does nothing to add to either of their legacies. Mr. King is known for his slow to mid-tempo blues, and as much as he may admire Mr. Jordan, King cannot deliver the energy that is required for Jordan's brand of up-tempo jump music. His standard single note guitar solos don't really fit stylistically, and his delivery of the lyrics sound tired and out of pocket. After all, at the time of this recording King was 74 years old, and he's trying to reproduce music that Jordan did as a 30/40 year old! For Jordan fans, you're better off sticking to the original material.

I am halfway through O JERUSALEM and doubt that I will finish it either. I understand that Laurie King is a biblical scholar interested in the Holy Land. She used this knowledge to advantage in A LETTER TO MARY. However, if this is where her heart is, she needs to turn to non-fiction writing. O JERUSALEM is an endless travelogue of the Holy Land in the early 20th century. The mystery is so thin as to be non-existent. While I find the descriptions somewhat interesting, I did not buy a history and/or travel guide to the Holy Land. I purchased the book thinking I was buying a Sherlock Holmes/Mary Russell MYSTERY. I am afraid I have bought my last Laurie R. King hardcover book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful trek over Sacred Ground!","review":"Sherlockian purists tend to get rather red around the ears when the name Laurie King is mentioned. That is a shame. King is making a whole new generation aware of the great detective through her imaginative series.In this latest offering, King not only takes us on a trip with the sacred Holmes, but takes us to the most sacred spot on earth, Temple Mount in Jerusalem. She is able to combine travel, history, comedy and mystery all in a menage of both reverence and iconclasm.Like fine truffles, Laurie King is not for all palates. If you prefer your Holmes simple and unadulterated, you won't like King. If you are game for adventure, you will be rewarded. This winning woman of the cloth is looking forward to more adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not live up to king's previous efforts","review":"o jerusalem fails to live up the high standards of king's previous works.the book actually doesn't start until page 180 or so.it seems that king has difficulty in arriving at a conclusion, and the one she did decide on was without flair. dullis how i judge o'jerusalem--but i will continue to be a king fan and look forward to her next book. hopefully it will be up to her standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Jewelrusalam!","review":"Oh Jerusalem is a true jewel in young adult literature. I thouroughly enjoyed reading this book. King entwines theology, religion, history, and a thrilling plot in this facinating mystery. The characters come alive in King's story. This book expands on the established storyline of King's previous The Beekeeper's Apprentice. Sherlock Holmes has \\"apprenticed\\" Miss Mary Russel. Their relationship continues to deepen as both Holmes and Russel try to determine their relationship with each other while solving a mystery in war ridden Isreal. They must help this land sacred to three of the worlds great religions for Queen and country. They meet new characters which return in other books. I would really recomend this jewel for your reading. It is a thrilling mystery which wraps around you like a hurricane, flying and spinning, never knowing where or what will happen next. I hope you will read this book and that you will enjoy it as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holmes is where the heart is!","review":"Laurie King has hit upon a good idea in her continuing series! Resurrect Sherlock Holmes! And certainly King does-- as the Master Detective, along with his apprentice Mary Russell (What? New readers may ask: Sherlock deigns to work with a female?), is off to Palestine in this episode, indeed continuing to be one of the world's hot spots! The game, forsooth, is afoot, as the pair discover a plot to blow up Jerusalem and send it to kingdom come! No small time villains, here! Will Sherlock head off what is surely to be a holy war? Well, don't be surprised if Holmes doesn't solve the puzzle (duh!) and \\"all's well that ends well\\" (some OTHER Englishman once wrote!). King's story is a delight to read--perhaps not so for dyed-in-the-wool Holmes minimalists--but if you've an open mind about Holmes, this one's worth a gambol, although probably not as sparkling as earlier episodes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rewarding Blend Of Fiction And Fact","review":"I have now read all of her books (that I know of), this and her other series, and she is an extremely perceptive author.

Frankly, none of the books that King has written since \\"The Beekeeper's Apprentice\\" has come close to the high level of quality that she achieved with that book. The characters and the plot in \\"O Jerusalem\\" are dull and the relationship between Russell and Holmes is extremely underwritten. Gone is the wit and the humor that I loved in the first book of the series. I finished the whole book, but it was a struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep this series comming!","review":"I truly love this series, after searching desperately for intellectual, character driven, well written mysteries. I found this book to be well thought out, typical of her series. The mystery is definitly not hard boiled, but King has the wonderful ability to draw one into a story, and not feel that one is being stupified by a simple plot with predictable writing. I truly feel that I am learning as I follow her \\"Russel\\" stories, much in the same way as with Sayers, Allingham, Cross, and Cauldwell. I thought that \\"O Jeruselem\\" was clever, interesting, and atypical for a \\"travel piece.\\" I hope that this author continues to produce this series, and never loses the bluestocking tone of the first five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beach Reading without shame!","review":"The fifth in the Mary Russell series - out of sequence in the time line of the books, but it's a necessary \`prequel' for the sixth book. As some of the other reviewers stated, it takes a long time for the plot to reveal exactly what Holmes and Russell are looking for on this journey. However, as it's a \`prequel' to book six, the development of how Holmes and Russell interact with their Arab guides is necessary - and (prequel or no) I thought, interesting. It's a great series - the books are generally a quick read, and usually touch on some topic in enough detail that your interest is sparked into finding a little more about what you're reading about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sherlock holmes adventures from a woman's point of view","review":"O'Jerusalem by LAUIRE R.King Is a personal accounts of Sherlock Homels case written by his young partner Mary Russell.The plot is interging,devloping over the course of the noverl.This as a result can be a little tiresome.

In fact, to me, this book is as good or BETTER than Beekeeper's Apprentice, simply due to the very details that some said would better fit in a travel guide. The way to snare a reader is to make them feel they are really there. I could almost feel the sand between my teeth and smell the smoke from the campfires. I'm sorry, but I love that kind of detail. Why read if all you want is taut dialogue? Might as well listen to the radio or something . . . Give me the descriptions anytime. All in all, I have found King to be a lovely read, and all too often, I find that I have over-stayed my time on lunch breaks because I've detoured through the Holy Land with Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes."},{"rating":"2","title":"More?","review":"I was bored, looking for some summer reading, and I am GLAD I found O Jerusalem.

While the descriptions of the situation in Palestine right after the transition from Turkish to British rule were interesting, and the characters were fairly well drawn, it was NOT a mystery as that term is traditionally used. Apparently Ms. King's newest Mary Russell novel answers a few of the questions left hanging in this one, but that is only a device to sell books and not appropriate for a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Filler","review":"This book was written as if the author was being paid by the word.

I love the whole Mary Russell series, but didn't expect to like this one as much. An Anglophile, I enjoy stories that take place in London or other parts of England, as much of this series does. What a surprise! I was engrossed immediately and the pace never lagged. Laurie King is an excellent writer, a skilled storyteller.

Forget it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"O, Jerusalem","review":"Laurie King keeps the reader guessing until the last page with this intelligent, highly suspenseful fifth mystery in her series involving Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell. The reader gets an education along the way, dipping into history, archaeology, Arab customs and criminology. Who would have thought anyone could reinvent Holmes and give him a female companion while remaining so true to Conan Doyle's original man? I will give this book as gifts to many friends, then await their excited reviews.

Both were famous for scores for other things (Kaplan for \\"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold\\" and Fried for \\"Gilligan's Island\\"), but showed that they could create music for a then new project: Star Trek.Kaplan's score for \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" emphasized what was going on in each scene, underscoring how tension packed the episode was when it was made in 1967. (With the Special Effects that are available now, if they ever redo Star Trek, this is one episode that would seriously \\"amp up\\" the tension!!)Fried, on the other hand, used his impressive Jazz training to show Mr. Spock in his \\"pon farr\\" state, and also to give the previously never seen before Planet Vulcan an alien atmosphere. Of course, the famous music for the fight scene between Spock and Kirk has been imitated often, but never topped.An excellent CD for music and Classic TV fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before \\"Jaws\\" there was the \\"Doomsday Machine\\"...","review":"Steven Spielberg's Jaws has one of the most recognizable movie themes ever..the shark theme. But the \\"da-dum da-dum\\" music that made John Williams's career was already done ten years earlier...and is on this soundtrack.The Star Trek episode The Doomsday Machine featured an ominous machine was the sci fi equivalent of a giant shark: a silent, big, grey behemoth that swallowed spaceships whole. The tension was established via the soundtrack by a simple \\"da-dum\\" theme. Like \\"Jaws\\", it would start slowly and softly and gradually turn up the tempo and the volume.I think \\"Doomsday Machine\\" is a great soundtrack by itself. \\"Amok Time\\" is a terrific companion...its a completely different sound with a sixties pseudo-spiritual approach.

With included mounts, it attaches to the seat post or to a thin rear frame. Unlike the front light, the rear acts as a reflector when turned off. When you want to remove it for security, it's just a click and a slide, and it turns into a clip light, similar to a belt clip.For some reason, one click on the front light sets it to blink, and two clicks is a steady light.

The front light is bright, but not as bright as some more expensive models. The rear light works well. They both have 3 \\"modes\\" that can be cycled by pressing the button; On, off, and blinking. I like to use the front light on solid so I can see well, and the rear light blinking to alert motorists.The rear light has a mount to fit on the seat post, but I have a seat bag that it can clip to nicely. The front light is the larger problem; the mount strap is nearly too small, so it take quite a bit of effort to get it on to my Specialized handlebar. The light does clip on and off the mount, so I can take it off for daytime use while leaving the mount on, but I would prefer to take the whole thing off for day riding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.

The bracket for the tail light was strange, I never did figure out how it was supposed to work, but I just skipped the bracket entirely and used the clip that was attached to the light.

The 3 LED blinker is much brighter than others I see on the road, it really makes you stand out. The same is true of the \\"beamer\\".However, the mounting mechanisms for both these products are a disaster. The clip on the 3 LED blinker is incredibly weak, I can't even get it to stay attached to a backpack strap and it is much too small to clip onto any part of my bike's frame. The lamp's mechanism is an even greater nightmare. It's unreasonably difficult to open the clasping mechanism and once you do open it, you realize that it is also way too small to attach to any useful part of your bike.Really, really poor design using good off the shelf electronics.

First, it didn't fit the handlebars on either of my two bikes. Either it was too tight or too loose. I had to build up the handlebars to the perfect diameter with some gaff tape before the headlight would snap on and stay put. Second, who thought that the default headlight mode should be a low-frequency strobe? I can't ride with a blinky headlight. You will find yourself clicking through the modes to the always-on mode. This is crazy. Regular headlight mode (continuous light) should be the default, and seizure-inducing strobe mode should be the second option.After I dialed it into the right node, the headlight optics proved bright and surprisingly tight. It makes a nice, even white spot on the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for visibility","review":"Both the front and rear lights blink brightly for visibility purposes.

It is so inconvinient to use. I returned it back to the store"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate at Best","review":"My husband and I are expecting our first child in about a week. We wanted to make sure we found a trustworthy thermometer that was, well, less invasive than the traditional thermometer. After hearing that the ear thermometers don't always work for young children, this seemed to be the perfect solution. Unfortunately, this one doesn't work either. After reading all the directions over and over again, we were unable to get a constant reading twice in a row when we tried to read our own temperatures. The temps would vary a couple of degrees between readings. Those 2 degrees can make a big difference when a child is sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I loved the idea of this themometer but it just doesn't work. I can take my temp with it several times in one sitting and get results varing by as much as 3 degrees! It takes too many tries to get an acurate temp... and yes I have read the directions in detail many times. Its not a hard concept... it just doesn't work well. I have just used a normal digital thermometer under my son's arm (currently 16mo)and that by far works the best for us. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I love my Exergen Temporal Scanner! I got sick of taking my baby's temperature with my unreliable rectal thermometer. The Exergen Temporal Scanner is accurate and very easy to use. I found mine at Walmart for $29. It did not come with the demonstration video, but you can watch that for free at www.exergen.com. You can also print out a $5 rebate at their website. Great Buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer","review":"LOVE it! Great Product. It works well and my 6 year old son can use it by himself. I even took the temp under the arm pit and it showed the same temp or very close to it. It is fast and accurate and a wonderful buy! No troubles with it. I had to let it warm up from the outside cold when we got it and I put the battery in it. It was way below zero out. Once it warmed up to our indoor temp it worked great. Make sure to save the cap. It is easy to snap on and off and keep the cap to protect the sensor end. Make sure the cap is off before taking temp. My son even scanned it the opposite direction and it still gave very close readings. GREAT product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, better than digital mouth or ear","review":"very fast and non invasive- perfect for a cranky baby. the only problem we have is it comes up error a lot instead of the temp but i think it's low on batteries- wish it would tell you when it needs them. make sure you follow the directions on the thermometer exactly or you will get different readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very inaccurate","review":"We never get the same reading twice when we use this on our son. I'll take his temperature three times in a row and the reading varies by up to one degree with each reading. And it's always 2 or 3 degrees off in general(we usually read in the 96 range when we're \\"normal\\"). I've just learned to add a couple of degrees to whatever it says. Very disappointing; wish we'd gotten the Braun ear thermometer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Buy!","review":"A nurse at our local clinic recommended this device and I found it to be extremely accurate, easy to use, reliable and I couldn't be happier with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tricky, but convenient","review":"This thermometer takes practice to be accurate, but is quick and convenient to use on a fussy or sleepy baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Causes more worry than anything else!","review":"We saw all the great reviews of this on Amazon and had to get it - happy to get away from rectal temperatures. What a mistake! This thermometer has never given an accurate reading. Our 2 year old daughter has a fever of (rectally) 102, but the temporal thermometer says it's 89! It has never reliably given an accurate reading, let alone a repeatable warning. We've had this problem with our 1 year old son as well, as well as both my wife and I. I wish we could return this piece of junk!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I thought this was the thermometer to get since we have an infant. Taking temperature at the ear is inaccurate the first three months. When trying this temporal thermometer it read the room temperature accurately(it matched our programmable thermostat). When taking temperature of people it indicated 95.7 or 96.0 degrees F. Never any higher. Read through the instructions and they mentioned sweating being an issue. We weren't sweating but it was 75 degrees in the room. Whether humidity was an issue we don't know. Not being able to take your temperature because you're sweating was good enough reason to send it back. If someone in my house is sweating due to illness and not because of ambient temperature, I'll use the rectal method for the baby's first three months then use the ear canal digital type thereafter."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAVE IT AT THE STORE!!!!!!","review":"We bought this thermometer for my 11 month old thinking it would be great. We were fooled by the claims on the package. We were gettin temps of 99.1, 98.9 or 99.5. We decided to take our son to the doc anyway and found out he was close to 103. That could be dangerous. We returned it the same day. Stick to the rectal thermometers. Unfortunately it's still the most accurate way to get a temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"After reading the reviews here I bought one of these units for my son hopeful it was the best thing on the market. Wrong! The temperature reads were inconsistent. I got a different read every time I scanned! When I returned it to my local babies r' us store the sales person at the return desk said this used to be a good item, but they had received a lot of returns - there must be a bad batch out there. Buyer be warned! I picked up a Braun digital ear thermometer and I'm completely happy with its accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought twice, broke almost immediately each time","review":"We bought this thermometer twice. Each time it broke - the first time after about a month and the second time after only ONE DAY of use. Each time it was the same thing: the metal pieces that rest up against the battery came loose. Do not buy this thermometer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just grand","review":"I have owned this product for a while now and it has made temperature taking so much easier. I find it to be accurate when used correctly. Luckily that's easy to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy","review":"So far I am not thrilled with this product. Each time I take a reading it comes back different than the last one with large jumps in tempatures. It does not seem dependable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"It is impossible to get a temperature reading from either of my children, ages 1 and 3, because they won't hold still. Also, even on me or my husband, two readings, taken back to back, can vary as much as 1 degree. Why even bother? I bought aBraun Thermoscan Ear Thermometer - IRT4520, which you put in the ear like the nurse does at the Pediatrician's office, and I love it. It is worth the extra $25 to be sure you are getting an accurate reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this to replace the ear thermometer because it was supposed to be more accurate. It's inaccurate, gives random temperatures, but also doesn't have a lighted LCD screen like the ear thermometer did, so you need a decent light source to see the temp in the middle of the night.My first one lasted only about 3-4 years. I bought a new one hoping they've improved, but it's the same, inaccurate piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very accurate","review":"This device is easy to use and non-invasive but it is extremely difficult to get an accurate reading. Using it several times on the same patient can give a wildly different range of temperatures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all accurate","review":"The readings from this thermometer are so varied that it's pretty useless. You can get variations from 98.6 to 101 on the same person over just a few swipes. I thought temporal thermometers were the best but this one is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really inconsistent","review":"I have never written a review in my life, but I had to because this product was pretty awful. I have to say this was a really dumb purchase. It is super inconsistent, even when I am using it on my own head. When you have a newborn or an infant, you want the thermometer to be as accurate as possible, because a reading of 100.4 could have you going to the doctor or emergency room. This product is woefully inaccurate and I wouldn't take my chances. Even though a rectal thermometer is not my idea of a good time, I'd rather know that the reading is as accurate as it can be. Save your money and do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent at best","review":"I liked the idea of being able to just swipe this across the forehead and be done. The problem is that unless you go perfectly across the forehead at just the right speed and angle, you get an error. I have had slightly better results doing it behind the ear or on the neck. When I can get a reading, it is in credibly inconsistent, and I can have three different readings separated by as much as two degrees. Not helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thermometer for a toddler","review":"The shippers were great....willing to consider speedier shipping options, but in the end the standard shipping arrived quickly enough. The thermometer is fun and easy to use, but with an inquisitive toddler, it would be nice to have the plastic cap attached to the body so that it doesn't disappear.Would buy it again from these sellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Fast!! (New Mom)","review":"This is a live saver! It works great to get a quick read on my baby's temp and also works great for that fussy Husband when he is not feeling well too.. So easy even my Mom figured it out with one try, and also loves it. I plan on getting her one to keep at her house next, since she made the comment that they did not have stuff like that when she had me as a baby to make it easy on her and I. Plus I think it would be a great thing for her to have around the house when my kid is over visiting, or if they are ever sick.Just hold the button, lightly move it accost the forehead and for an extra check hold for 3-seconds behind the ear for a perfect reading every time. It only took me 2 times to get the motion down, and to get the same reading each time. A GREAT BUY! AND A MUST HAVE FOR PEOPLE WITH KIDS OF ALL AGES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not give consistent readings.","review":"I put this on my baby registry after reading all the great reviews here. However, I have never been able to get consistent readings. I can scan 20 times in a row and get a different reading every time. I agree that it seems much easier than a rectal on my baby or even under the arm, but I just don't feel like I can rely on it to give me an accurate temperature reading. I am surprised by the number of people who said they are getting consistent readings. Maybe as a new mom, I am just not as experienced at it. But I guess that is something to take into consideration before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy","review":"I use this thermometer at work for infants and hate it. You have to go perfectly around the head to the back of the ear or get an error sign. If your child has an extremely high temp it can be off which can be dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"What we use in my clinic!","review":"I'm a pediatrician, and we after extensive research we chose this thermometer to use ourselves. Many others (eg- the other temporal artery thermometers, ear thermometers) are very dependent upon technique. This thermometer works great by just swiping it across the forehead. Quick, easy and accurate. It is the only one to use other than a rectal thermometer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exergen Temporal Scanner-Temporal Artery Thermometer","review":"My family really loves this product. I have 3 children varying in age from 9 yrs to 4 months and this thermometer works great for everyone. I especially like that once you've purchased this product there isn't anything else to keep purchasing (i.e. the plastic lens covers for in the ear themometers). I have used it on my infant while he slept and didn't have to worry about him waking up. So far we've found that the temperatures were right on track. This is a superior product and well worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised by all of the 5 stars..","review":"I bought this when my husband got sick and figured it would be great for whole family, including my infant son. After I took the temp three times in a row, it would read differently each time. I kept it and tried it on my 7 month old a couple of days later, and the same thing happened. Even if it did take an accurate temp, the booklet that it comes with says that a normal reading for adults on this is less than 100.3 and on children 100.7. That alone is confusing. I am disappointed b/c I did want this to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I received this thermometer at my baby shower and I thought it would be so easy to use. It is easy to use, but the results are worthless. I was told by the doctor that this thermometer doesn't work. He recommends taking it under the arm with a digital, which works much better. I just get my husband to distract my son while I'm doing it. I use the thermometer the hospital gave us when we were discharged. What a disappointment and a waste of money for something I thought would be easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very reliable and very erratic.","review":"I purchased this item to monitor fevers for my baby instead of using a rectal thermometer which I didn't feel comfortable using. The readings I got from it were erratic and I didn't really feel it was worth the money. Though it looks like the maker Exergen has a lot of back up and patents and whatnot I would scan several times and never come up with a reading within a few degrees of another taken a few seconds before! I eventually figured with another thermometer that it was scanning low too which meant it wasn't worth much for me to catch a fever. I got a First Years thermometer for $10 and wish I had bought it before rather than paying $50 for this thing. It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Centerfold","review":"This is the sort of film that has you wishing you could time-travel back to the heyday of the drive-ins to catch it in its ideal environment. Scary, tight lipped Andrew Prine plays a murderous psychopath working his way through a bunch of pretty girls, whose only 'sin' is to have modelled for a sexy calendar. Well-shot, well-acted, but it's the doom-laden mood and oddball structure that makes Centerfold Girls stand out - three stories about three girls linked only through their encounters with the killer, sort of like Pulp Fiction without the self-congratulation. Should be sought after by anyone who likes the darker, stranger drive-in fare of the 70s."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CENTERFOLD GIRLS","review":"A GREAT MOVIE WITH AN INTERESTING STORY.

The only thing that you could think: it's a great album. But that's not enough. This new Live album is like a new world of peace, like a shining star, like a beautiful morning. The best sound of music that you can ever hear, poetry in their lyrics, the most special, sweet like-and-angel-but-powerful voice, and the best arrangements. That's TDTH. You've to do this: buy the album, play it and relax. After hour and a half, you'll be another. Follow my advice: listen \\"Run to the water\\" and \\"Dance with you\\": you'll find the sweetness of \\"Lightning crashes\\" and the power of \\"The beauty of gray\\", plus the beauty of \\"Turn my head\\".

I can honestly say that everyone I talk to loves different songs on the CD. There's something for everyone, and I think this is escpecially admirable. I love them all!!!

I especially love The Dolphin's Cry. (The Australian video rules!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong effort!","review":"I was extremely happy to hear this album. It has a good variety of songs; slow and moody, upbeat, and even a few reminiscent of Mental Jewlery. Even though some of Ed's lyrics are pretty forced, that's not really any change. I used to live in Lancaster PA and saw them often before they were well known. This album displays a lot of the originality thay had back then and that seemed to get lost on Secret Samhadi (sp?). This is one of the better albums I've bought this year. Take a listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live watered-down their creativity to sell","review":"After the unfairly harsh criticism that Live's last album-Secret Samadhi received, it's no surprise that The Distance To Here sounds watered-down. There are some good tracks, most notably Run to the Water, Sun, Where Fishes Go, They Stood Up For Love, and Dance With You, but they still sound like the band was forced to the standard what-sells formula.Overall, the album scores a 4, based on it's tasteful melding of Metal Jewelry's soulfulness, Throwing Copper's popularity, and Secret Samadhi's edge. The album somewhat lacks originality, which has kept it from scoring a perfect 5 with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding!! haven't quite listening to it yet.","review":"don't usually buy cd's until a few songs have come out so i can judge if it's worth my money, but dolphin's cry sold me and the rest of the cd is excellent. ed's voice, the lyrics, and the band mesh so well that i'm going to go and get the other cd's (this is my first Live cd). thanks guys!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Distance Between Here and Mental Jewelry","review":"this disc is a vast improvement over their previous release. unfortunately, the band is still obsessed with covering up their melodic material with distorted guitars and thrashing drums. the second half of the disc salvages a \\"rocky\\" beginning but it's a shame that this talented band has abandoned the funk and folky elements of their unique debut album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a great album","review":"Live delivers an electric album again. It's passionate, likable, and all around groovy. \\"The Dolphin's Cry\\" is such a great song, and the rest are solid as well.

Wow! that was a good cd. it really is. if you like r.e.m. then you'll love this. come to think of it- if you like anything good, you'll love this. it is that good. the lyrics are great, the tunes are great- everything is great. the only problem is, besides dolphin's cry and run to the water, there isn't a song that will be played on the radio. but, the songs are good. dolphin's cry is in a league of it's own, run to the water is close behind. the whole cd is great. i suggest you pick it up today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live's back at it with their best CD since Throwing Copper","review":"This CD rules! They put together a killer collection of hard rock, the way it was meant to sound, and great ballads."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressive, even sounds good live!","review":"I think that Live has another solid CD on their hands. Fans everwhere should enjoy the hell out of it and if you get a chance to see Live live run don't walk!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live did it again!","review":"The new album from Live is as excellent as could be expected. The three earlier albums have been some of the best rock-albums ever to be released in their own different way. And The Distance To Here is no exception. You have classic Live-rockers, beautiful ballads, and experimenting with new instruments. They renew themselves without losing their identity. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but still not classic Live","review":"The Distance to here is by far a better album then The Secret Samadhi. Still, my only concern that Live's message in some of the songs tends to be too positive in comparison to their more critical views in Mental Jewerly (classic, Live at its best). I feel Live has strayed from its critical, meaningful view of the world remininiscent from Mental Jewerly or Throwing Copper. My main concern is that The Distance To Here has a little bit of that classic sell out about love and relationships that so many artists perform to death today. Still, the rhythym and sound are excellent. I would recommend buying the CD for a nice listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Throwing Copper but Great Nonetheless","review":"This isn't Live's best album and didn't have as great an impact as it should have but it is a good CD worth checking out. Not one song is bad although some do stand out more than others (the dolphin's cry, they stood up for love). Don't expect something revolutionary but just another solid album from this great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"suprisingly good","review":"I have liked Live for quite sometime, but the album The Distance To Here is suprisingly good, a cut above the previous album Secret Samadhi. TDTH is a thoughtful album, though not producing the radio singles that it could. \\"Run to the Water\\" \\"They Stood Up For Love\\" and \\"Dance With You\\" are, in my opinion, better songs than the current single \\"Dolphin's Cry\\". Ed has done marvelously with this new effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live = Dead","review":"I figured Secret Samahdi was an aberration but it turns out that's not the case. This is a dissapointing CD at best. No catchy tunes and although Throwing Copper and Mental Jewelry are fixtures in my CD player, this might lead me to be apprehensive when it comes to buying a Live CD in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dolphins Don't Cry","review":"Among other things. Ed K. is perhaps the single most annoying lyricist (aside from Alanis)in music today. Too bad, because the music here isn't exactly horrible. It's just hard to overlook the lyrics, which are hokey at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"great music but those lyrics.....","review":"I recently realized that if someone could just break Ed's fingers so he can't pick up a pen and then give the pen to anybody else to jot down some lyrics, Live wouldn't be a bad band. They write some tremendous melodies and Ed is actually a decent singer other than when he goes over the top and yes, he does that a lot. But damn, who else would have the bad sense to use the word \\"placenta\\" in a song or wail in a non-fashionable sense about dolphins? Shut up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I actually have to give it a star?","review":"Live? More like....\\"Who can we copy so we can Millions\\"? This band just needs to go away....and it looks like they will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I never get tired of this cd. I find myself playing it over and over again. This is a wonderful album, especially the songs vodoo lady, where fishes go and feel the quiet river rage. Ed has got the most beautiful voice. The only negative about this cd is that Live's music has become more soft I think. Being a live-fan I find Secret Samadhi and Mental Jewlery even more great. However I strongly recomend this album and I also think you should spend some time listening to Live's other albums, including their first Mental Jewlery which is almost never mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"This long awaited followup disappointed me greatly. Admittedly I have only had a couple of listens, but none of the tracks jump out at me. Even Samadhi had a few diamonds in the rough. And what's up with the endless water metaphors? Enough already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live's best album yet","review":"I bought The Distance to Here the day it came out and have not stopped listening to the CD since. The way the instruments move you to the music and the way the words flow is almost hypnotic. If you have been a Live fan for a long time (as I have) you have to agree that this album proves that bands can come back from the dead (although I didn't think SS was all that bad) My favorites: Run to the Water, Childrens' Song, and Distance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rock","review":"I would definitely reccomend this album to fans of the \\"Throwing Copper\\" Live sound, and those who enjoy a good dosage of alternative rock. The lyrics are very inpsiring and uplifting (as to be expected, Ed Kowalczyk seems like a very spiritual performer). The guitars are aggressive, and there are a couple of very good drum parts (Sparkle, Sun) - I think Chad Gracey could easily go head to head with Tool's Danny Carey.You would probably not like this ablum if you were a fan of their 3 album, \\"Secret Samadhi\\". This one is much faster and, for lack of a better word, \\"happier\\". It's been making me feel good for the past 7 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as it gets...","review":"LIVE is a band who's songs have such a depth and meaning like no other in the whole rock music history...that's what makes them so much UNIQUE.They again confirm this in their 4th masterpiece. When i FIRST listened to TDTH , i just hated it....but after giving it a try for 2-3 times ,i'm totally hooked on to this album...,i keep listening to it everyday and night....like thier last 3 works.TSUFL and Face & Ghost(esp.chorus)can rival any other LIVE song for being the most heart touching and soul stirring songs... Do urself a big favor and get this amazing CD. LONG LIVE +LIVE+.....!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - On it's own. Don't compare","review":"I liked one particular customer review that told us not to compare this LIVE CD with the others. they were harder, rougher, and great on their own. Different. I liked Throwing copper first, and Secret Samadhi too, and The Distance is softer. But it's a great CD! Still I think Dolphins Cry is one of the best songs on the album. And Lightning Crashes being their best ever. Listen to this CD, buy it, and i'm damn sure you're gonna like it. Personally, I don't think LIVE needs to become some sort of hardrock or metal band. This is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only on Song 5 and I already love it.","review":"This is really great. The Dolphin's Cry, in my opinion, is the best. Other good ones are Sun, The Distance, Where Fishes Go, aww heck, it's all good. Really good, here's my plug for the band, buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the Soul","review":"The first time I heard Dolphin's Cry I knew I had to get the album. I listened to it and every song is like the part of one whole universal theme. Run To The Water is my anthem, definitely will reach into you and pluck you out of whatever darkness you may have found yourself in. Definitely the best for Live, and Ed's voice certainly makes it all the more soul-ful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed","review":"Judging by most of the reviews here, Secret Samadhi s#@ked; however I loved its dark, brooding, twitchy feel (\\"...this puke stinks like beer...\\"). It was the first Live CD I ever listened to, given to me by my younger brother (\\"listen to this - it's cool\\").TDTH starts off with the powerful Dolphin's Cry and nothing comes close after that. Sure, there are some good tunes here, Run To The Water and Sparkle come to mind. Honestly, after a dozen times listening to it, I can't remember the names or melodies of the other songs without looking at the liner notes on the CD.Non Live fans who buy this CD on the strength of Dolphin's Cry may be disappointed. For me, Live are capable of much better.2 stars for the music. 5 stars for the CD artwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME AWESOME STUFF FROM LIVE","review":"I LIKED LIVE'S MUSIC BUT I WAS NEVER BEEN A TRUE FAN OF THEM. BUT THIS ALBUM HAS INSPIRED ME A LOT. THIS IS TO ME, THE BEST MUSIC LIVE HAS EVER PRODUCED. WONDERFUL MUSIC, GREAT LYRICS. SONGS LIKE \\"DOLPHIN'S CRY\\" \\"RUN TO THE WATER\\" MAKES THIS ALBUM A TREAT TO LISTEN. WHILE \\" DANCE WITH U\\" \\"SUN\\" AND \\" WHERE FISHES GO\\" ARE ALSO WONDERFUL. THE ALBUM REVEALS THE TRUE EMOTIONS OF THE BAND. THE REASON I'M NOT GIVING IT 5 STARS IS THAT THE ALBUM LACKS SOME SLOW TEMPO SOOTHING TRACKS LIKE \\"DANCE WITH U\\". I WISH I COULD HAVE HEARD ON OR TWO MORE SONGS LIKE THIS IN THE ALBUM BUT I COULD NOT FIND.NEVERTHELESS IT'S A GREAT ALBUM, AND A MUST BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bit of a let down","review":"Live was one of my first CDs...throwing copper...and I was a fan thru Secret Sambadi...but now, I'm not so sure they're living up to their potentials. Perhaps stardom has gotten in the way of their emotions, but I feel that there are no emotions coming with this CD...whereas their earlier stuff was wonderfully charged with real insight. A still decent album though."},{"rating":"1","title":"only one song really worth it.","review":"I was very excited to buy the new Live CD, and soon that all evaporated after I played the CD. Their hit-single is the best song on the whole album, and you'd expect that after the long break they've been on, they could come up something a bit stronger than this album. If you're a rock fan, this might not be your picnic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Yet","review":"The Distance To Here is perhaps the greatest CD I have purchased, the songs are very catchy and many are full of emotion. This is Live's best CD yet, and is a must-have, regardless of if you're a big fan of Live or not, its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"No CD is perfect, but this is close!","review":"Live's fourth album is softer than their previous three. Live incorporates more ballads and melodies, which display that they are a magnificent diverse rock n roll band! The album has some old school type songs with new stuff too. In my opinion there are 5 hit songs on this album: Dophin's Cry, Run To The Water, Face And Ghost, They Stood Up For Love, Dance With You! The other songs are average. My recommendation buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is one of the best CD's I've listened to in quite a while. This CD has the same passion, energy and brash sound as the Mental Jewelery album which was the whole reason for becoming a fan in the first place. The Dolphins cry and Run to the Water are absolute masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's hard to beat \\"Throwing Copper\\", but this comes close!","review":"I respect the fact that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I have a hard time figuring out how one can NOT like this album! While \\"Secret Samadhi\\" was good, it wasn't great, which in itself might help to make this album that much better. Regardless, this effort has definitely paid off for Ed and the boys of Live. CDs with every song being good are hard to come by, but this pulls it off, in my opinion! Every time I hear \\"The Dolphins Cry\\" and \\"Run To The Water\\", I think back to my senior year in college and that time in my life, in general. Full of excitement but also uncertainty. Anyways, enough of the nostalgia trip, go out and get this disc if you are a new fan of life. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review from Argentina","review":"This album...wow, I can't explain with words. I've been listening Live since \\"Death of a dictionary\\" (their first, as Public Affection, album). And I can't believe their music. It's just...great :) I've been waiting this album two long years...and it's better than you can imagine. Buy it, listen it, enjoy it! Don't miss it!!! Thanxs. Scar"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ONE YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"If your a LIVE fan you will love this cd! It inspires your life! The cd to me is about LOVE and HOPE for your fellow MAN!! It is there BEST ONE yet.. Alot of real emotion and strenth!!!DEEP!!!! PEACE & LOVE FOR EVEY ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"In my humble opinion, \\"The Distance to Here\\" is Live's best cd yet. The songs are lyrically deep and inspiring, musically complex and satisfying. It's one of those rare albums that doesn't have a bad song on it. I listened to it over and over in the car this summer and never tired of it. I've been a Live fan since \\"Throwing Copper,\\" and I think they are one of the best bands out there, alternative or otherwise. Unfortunately, they get little air play. I have not heard a single cut from \\"Distance..\\" on the radio in the city where I live, though it's a major metropolitan area. That's a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is truly 'living' out music","review":"Live has always been a pinnacle of music. Their original sound and emotional lyrics have broke through the many aggresive bands of the 90s. With 'The Distance To Here', Live has truly outdone themselves in terms of music capability and lyrical one as well. This album is a truly moving masterpiece, it never fails to deliver and shows strength in every single song. 'The Dolphin's Cry, Run To The Water, and They Stood Up For Love' are surely the finest moments of the CD, and the rest of the songs are just as good. Live is a strong band with a great sound and this CD is a pure indication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...I love it!","review":"I never really cared for Live until I heard the Dolphin's Cry on the radio. I loved it so much that I had to run out right away and buy the cd. Amazingly, all the other songs on it are just as good. I love their rythm and lyrics. The songs Run to the Water and They Stood Up for Love are expecially my favorite. This cd is getting better and better the more I listen to it and even want to go out and get Live's first cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as amazing as their other albums","review":"It seems that there are more \\"one hit wonders\\" today then there were a few years back. Live is the difference. This album just proves that they are as great as they were when Mental Jewlery was released. Run to the water and where fishes go are two of the best songs I have heard on the radio in a long time. Fans of the band will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Distance To Here","review":"Far and away the best album \\"Live\\" has released. This is one of the best end-to-end albums in my collection of over 200 CDs. \\"Live\\" has, in my mind, once again secured the throne of the best under-appreciated band around. A must-have for anyone who enjoys good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid live release","review":"I know in this day and age, or probably on any day and age one would hardly buy a whole album if only one song was worth the while.Distance to here is a solid Live album, just as every Live album, solid as in good as we have come to expect and solid as in \\"yes it sounds like their previous or even their newest albums\\" that is not a bad thing is you are a Live fan.Sometimes a band can re-invent themselves without alienating some of their fans, most of the time they can't, so it is reasonable to see how some bands just decide to stick to their guns and give their followers what the have come to expect.There are two really outstanding songs in this album, in my opinion.Dolphins cry and Meltdown, the second being probably one of the best Live songs ever, this song, by itself, makes buying the album a good purchase.Cheers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this Rock?","review":"Well, all in all it's a great CD. Live just keeps getting softer and softer and soon I wonder if they will be strictly a pop band. I loved their old work and most of the new CD, but I don't care for their \\"growing and development.\\" I wish there were more songs like \\"Iris\\" and \\"I Alone\\", but I guess TDC will have to do for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upbeat But Quite Not Deep Enough","review":"Live pretends that Secret Samadhi never existed and now they come back with a more commercially friendly album. However, there isn't much substance to these songs and the band seems more interested in spreading the message of peace and love rather than actually making good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live are not what they used to be","review":"I believe that every band is capable of putting out at least one good album in their career. Some bands are talented enough to put out several, but the y're in the minority (i.e. Beatles, Rolling Stones). Live falls squarely in the former category. Take half of Mental Jewelry and half of Throwing Copper and you've got one great album.The Distance To Here is barely better than tripe in my opinion. I was so disappointed at Secret Samadhi -- the songwriting, the music, the pretentiousness of the \\"message\\" and plain old Ed Kowalczyk. I had high hopes for The Distance to Here as some sort of return to form. No such luck. The lyrics are just as bad and the music hasn't progressed either. Live used to write good songs. They used to be a good live band. I used to care about them. Now they're just noise on the modern rock scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, 2 and a half","review":"All throughout the album, I was thinking to myself: \\"God, he sounds like he's too close to the mic.\\" The Christian undertones can get a bit weepy at times as well, and often the words don't make much sense. But turn down his voice and up the music, and you have a decent album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Combo...","review":"The worst combination you can have in music is self-importance and pretention and Live have both in spades. Listening to this album feels like ol' Ed and the Gang are trying to make some grand statement with each song. Ed feels really strongly about what he's saying while the band decides to back him up with some ! behind every statement. This kind of thing gets really old and tedious after a while. With song titles like \\"Feel the Quiet River Rage\\" and \\"They Stood Up for Love\\" you can't expect a downplay. Bands like Live and Dave Matthews are for people who like to sit in coffee shops and discuss, like, really important stuff over a double mocha half-caf with a twist while real people drinking black can't help but laugh at these goons quietly to themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uugggghhhh...","review":"that's better. Live hit their nadir on this horribly pretentious, over-zealous album. Kowalczyk (or whatever his bloody name is) is a great vocalist but he needs to come down off his spiritual stool in the sky and get back to the consistency of Throwing Copper again. The Distance From Here is passable for the first four or five tracks. The Dolphin's Cry is heard-it-all-before, but at least carries some resonance, while The Distance and Sparkle begin to show some promise, but it all goes very quickly downhill after the anthemic Run To The Water, with not one redeeming feature. The lyrics are awful, the music is plodding and predictable, and one of the most likeable post-grunge bands sink into unavoidable oblivion. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I brought this cd after a freind of mine told me that it was \\"awesome\\". Well, he was wrong, i got the cd and listened to it a there are only two good songs, one of them being the single Dolphin's Cry. I was dissapointed to spend my money on this, oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone is GARBAGE","review":"This phone is pure junk. It doesn't work.

We all know by now that good movies do not make good computer games (some would say though that Blade Runner and X-Files are the exception). But what about turning them into board games ? I ordered this title more than a year ago already. The games consists of a game board, 2 puzzles, landmark cards and playing pieces. The aim of the game is for each player (or teams) to try and complete their puzzle map of Myst Island before the other does. Once complete, players then explore the Island to reach landmarks and thus earn points. One very nice advantage though, is that each time you play, the challenge unfolds differently ! If you are a MYST fan, and are able to get hold of this game - do. You will certainly NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Glimpse of History","review":"This is a cookbook that anyone could enjoy reading even if they never choose to make any of the recipes.

I was looking for a nourishing, anti-aging moisturizer for my 40-ish face but I see no visible effects from using it for nearly 2 months--no wrinkle reduction or skin firming benefits. It's a decent night cream, but I will keep looking for one that is more aggressive in its anti-aging benefits. P.s. it does have kind of a strong fragrance, so \\"scent\\"-sitive types may want to steer clear! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably good -- not for me.","review":"I was disappointed when I found an article that said the form of retinol found in this product (retinyl palmitate, I believe) works well for acne, not for photo-damage/aging. But I also have breakouts, so I thought this would still be helpful. When applied the product felt lightweight and non-greasy, had a light, sweet, vanilla kind of scent, and my skin felt immediately smooth. However, I assumed that little \\"tingle\\" was an effect for the retinoids, but turned out to be an allergic response. I had hives on my lower face and neck by morning.

My preference was hard rock, and at 45 years old, it still is. I have looked at (and purchased) many hundreds of dollars worth of instructional books, audio tapes, CD's and videos.

I would be happy to pay twice the price for this information. It would be worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a great book for speed and dexterity and just plain cool licks. It's starts you off with a basic chromatic walk down and works you up to killer licks and songs like \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\". It also teaches you how to keep time properly by giving you basic excercises to practice with a metronome. I highly recommend this book I haven't even gotten half way through it and it's helped me a considerable amount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem from Troy Stetina","review":"Troy continues in his fashion of showing guitar players the hurdles they need to leap before they can be the guitar player they want to be. The combination of audio and text compliment each other very well.Exercises are laid out in logical order and each builds on techniques and tricks that were introduced in previous exercises. The only thing the student needs to bring to this \\"class\\" is patience. Even people who have been playing for years can benefit from taking this book one step at a timeWhere most lead guitar exercise books are straightforward and rather boring, this book does make an attempt to solve this problem with reasonable success. Troy includes his version of actual musical pieces with full tablature that he feels will be fun and beneficial to any student. This title makes a worthy addition to a guitarist's library"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Useful book, but not fun","review":"This is more of an intermediate to advanced book that teaches speed guitar soloing. This is NOT a fun book, but one that's designed for the guitarist who wants to invest some serious time in learning how to play guitar solos fast. It's basically just drill after drill.

You will get faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun and challenging.","review":"Pros- Helps focus development of technique- breaks down a method that can be applied for learning to use many different scales and modes- has a great systematic approach for identifying troubling passages and correcting themCons- can be a little overwhelming when the CD blazes through some of the drills at 250 beats per minute- while playing chromatic phrases builds finger independence, it is just not very interesting to listen to (this is only part of the book)I'm have worked with this book for a couple weeks and I have noticed that already my fingers are quicker and my timing is more spot on.

His unique delivery sells every song - his way.The standouts for me are \\"How Do You Fight Fire\\", \\"Meet Me at the Crux\\", \\"Billboard on the Moon\\", Mouth Full of Suck, and the beautiful \\"Every Inch a Moon\\". The deluxe addition of this CD includes several tracks that were not included in the original release.

This story is a good one for Hollywood to pick up and re-do using a bigger budget. It certainly is a worthwhile classic to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"de gustibus non disputandum est","review":"Phrases like 'cult classic' and 'sci-fi classic' inevitably lead to purchases and then to questions: why is this movie a classic, what am I missing. Sadly, the answers to these two questions are no and nothing. The premise of the movie is what happens when dreams come true -- as might be expected, little good although everything turns out pretty well for our hero in the end. My problems with the movie are several: the story-line is lame and there is no real narrative drive -- if the movie had simply been on tv, I am sure I would have bailed-out during a commercial; the acting is poor -- some of the major players would have difficulty winning parts at good drama schools; and, finally, the film is obviously a low-budget, made-for-tv film that is poorly produced. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth Checking Out...From The Library","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin is one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time, and her book \\"Lathe of Heaven\\" ranks as one of her greatest achievements. Unfortunately, the TV movie \\"Lathe of Heaven\\" not only features cheesy effects and music (even for the time this film was made, which really wasn't so long ago), but also terrible direction and acting. It is, however, worth checking out from your local library, especially for the fascinating interview with Le Guin included on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overrated","review":"I have to go against the grain here and give this movie the thumbs down. The special effects were cheesy even for the time, especially the ones that looked like they came from an even lower-budget version of the 60s sci-fi TV series, \\"The Time Tunnel.\\" The science-fictional plot of someone with effective dreams is truly absurd. Even as a fantasy theme it just doesn't get off the ground. The movie isn't helped by some weak dialog writing although the backdrop of an overpopulated world suffering from unpredictable and severe weather changes makes for a somewhat interesting and appropriately bleak and dark future.I give the film 3 stars, although it really deserves 2, just because I hate giving anything connected with Le Guin such a low rating.On a personal note, I knew Le Guin's brother, Ted Kroeber, who was my statistics prof in college, and Ted was really a pretty cool prof. (I had to throw that in--since I'm dissing his famous sister's book/movie). :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great plot, nice interview, a must for SF fans.","review":"Years ago when I hung out at the CompuServe SciFi forum in it's heyday, I left a message commenting on this movie (going back a decade or so here) - Ursula Le Guin actually mailed me her copy of the movie to copy for myself (this was back when VCR's were still $500+ items) - I made my copy...to Betamax. When the old Beta unit bit the dust, so did my tape collection.When I saw that The Lathe of Heaven was out on DVD, I grabbed it ASAP. Sure the special effects are low-tech - remember this was a local PBS production. But the plot is great, the story is true to the book, and a name that sounds like (JorJor - no, not JarJar) is memorable.What makes this movie stand out - the PLOT carries it - the special effects are secondary - so what if they are low budget and cheesy by today's CG standards. If you never read the book, you'll be nailed by the ending.FAR SUPERIOR to the remake from a couple years ago!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"I had high hopes that this movie would supplement and enhance my experience and memories of reading the story in Leguin's book. I'm sorry to say this, but it detracted instead. Cardboard acting, little rendition of interior state, important elements glossed. I *love* PBS, but I can't understand the reverence people feel for this, well, dog of a movie. If you can read, read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lathe of Heaven","review":"I saw this in 1980 when it first came out in San Francisco. KQED played it 5 nights in a row (something they were doing at the time during the week), and I saw it all 5 times. The title comes from a passage in the Taoist Chung Tzu's writings, and I finally found it in a James Legge translation. The movie is a perfect illustration of the passage. The movie is great; see it.Oh, the passage? You'll need to read Chung Tzu for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic SF!","review":"A fine and faithful telling of Ursula K. LeGuin's beautiful story of a man whose dreams have more power than he wants, and what happens when he meets a man who wants more power than he has. This low-key production was perfect for its believability and quiet, dreamlike mood. Probably far superior to the current remake being done by A&E, which looks (from the \\"Making Of...\\" feature I caught the other night) like it's going to be full of unnecessary razzle-dazzle and obnoxious story changes. Do yourself a favor, buy this video for the real story of George Orr and his dreams. Leave A&E to follow Dr. Haber in his lust to remake the world in his own image, soullessly. Stick with PBS, and watch this fine video instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Control the Future","review":"The Lathe of Heaven is a complex story delving into issues of race, war, control, and love in a unique way. We all dream, but our main character's dreams actually change reality, past and future. When other well meaning people try to help him control is dreams for good, things just get messed up even worse. We learn through the film that for every act, there are unforseen consequences. There are many unexpected twists as the character's dreams defy manipulation.This made for Public Television movie is long overdue for video release. It must be seen several times to fully understand the complex chain of events."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lathe of Heaven","review":"I happened to see this movie on PBS shortly after moving to Dallas in 1979. At that time, absolutely nothing was opened in the downtown area on the weekends. Especially on Sundays, walking around the downtown area was very \\"Twilight Zone.\\" It was like you were in a world where 1/3 of the population had died over night.

Nevertheless, it is still passable entertainment.The disappointing aspect of this release is the quality of the transfer.

The book is quite slim (so it travels well), there's 500 puzzles from actual games. The puzzles are not divided into any category, which is perfectly OK, because when playing your own games you have to know your tactical stuff well beforehand, you never know what lies within the position. Diagrams are big enough to pleasure your eyes. My only complaint is that there could be more (verbal) analysis with the solutions. But nevertheless, it does its job well.Being 1500 player myself I feel they are perfectly challenging for me. Of course you should get your basic tactics skills honed, and for that job I like Winning chess tactics by Yasser Seirawan, and better yet, CT-ART 3.0 by Blokh (sorry if I remember wrong), Convekta software.500 puzzles are great number of exercises, it's nice to try to solve these with board, but when travelling, for example, it's a nice companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiator Fan Review","review":"This product arrived in the OEM box.

No annotation, no recording information, only 14 tracks per disc for a total of around 112 minutes - could have easily fitted onto two cds rather than three. Overall I find the transfer quality to be unsatisfactory, although this is hard to assess as this seems to vary from track to track, and there are also several tracks which are obviously derived from radio broadacats. Many tracks, to my ear at least, seem to have a hollow abrasive sound to them, and where these tracks are duplicated on other cheaper public domain cds in my collection, they sound better than they do here. Other tracks do however sound okay. At the price currently being charged by Amazon, only worth getting if you are desperate for tracks you can't get elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of pizzaz but the reciever hated it.","review":"We bought this as a gift for a Techy type and he hated it.

You have to set the temperature regardless of heat or fan only. (We purchased this heater to help dry the dog after her bath.)

They left a lot of holes and gaps, hence the frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwhelming Rules","review":"We bought this for my 15 year old son's birthday. I mean, what says happy birthday to a 15 year old more than a game called \\"Killer Bunnies\\". We're a family who loves Settlers of Catan, Scategories, Risk as well as regular Hearts. I was excited to try this out. However, the rules were very complicated and vague. We played one game, and have not touched it for a month. I'm sure we'll give it another go, but we were so disappointed. If you buy this game, be prepared to thoroughly understand the rules and you'll probably need to play a few games before you will really understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer fun - learn to play from someone else","review":"This is a really fun game, but I don't see how you could learn it from the instructions, as they are too vague. If you get someone to teach it to you, and just start playing you'll pick it up quickly.(...)I suspect the low review stems from someone trying to learn from the boxed instructions, which are well below par.Good luck with this game - I'm looking forward to buying the first expansion soon, even at the higher prices we pay for games here in Australia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure fun","review":"I was recently deployed to Afghanistan. One of my colleagues purchased Killer Bunnies. We played it religiously, every week, for six months. No one ever got tired of it, we always looked forward to the next game, and I believe it kept moral higher and stress lower. A must have, if you are any type of game player. If there are bad reviews, it's because the people the individual played with does not know what fun is. Don't hesitate to buy it.

It is only for the true cut-throat. We just don't enjoy wiping out all of an opponent's bunnies with a single card. The way the winner is determined is little more than luck, so it matters little how you play the game. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"We hated it - makes no sense.","review":"We bought this, thinking it would be a quirky/cool card game to play. But because of the terrible, terrible instructions, we never got around to actually playing it. The instructions are poorly written, and make no sense. We literally could NOT get a game started - I forget exactly why - all I know is the instructions made no sense. I was mad too, because I bought an expansion pack as well.

Pathetically boring, complicated (talk about having to know hundreds of different rules) and it all comes down to a random carrot card. Ridiculous concept. I'm sorry I wasted $$$ on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A video game in board game form--too complicated and boring","review":"I'd heard great things about this game from my son, so we finally ordered it. After plowing through countless rules and instructions and trying several times to play the game, I finally got the hang of it. Unfortunately, all that work wasn't worth it--this is fundamentally a boring game, and the fact that a random carrot determines the winner at the end makes things even worse. I found all the cards and rules needlessly complex and irritating--the game is very much like a video game (with endless rules, twists, flukes, etc.) in board form. My husband tried playing too and gave up. Not worth it, especially considering all the extra sets the company wants you to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this game! Too complicated; instructions are terrible!","review":"This game is way too complicated to learn. The instructions are good as far as getting to the first round, but it doesn't actually tell you how to PLAY the game. And in reading the instructions and the reviews of others, it sounds like play doesn't really matter because the winner is determined randomly at the end of the game by the draw of a card (??). I am very unhappy with my purchase and, even though I opened it, I am going to try to return it. In my opinion, it is a defective item (game without proper instructions)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, silly game.","review":"This is a fun game that incorporates some silly cards. At the end of the game, though, it doesn't matter how much strategy you had, the winner comes down to pure chance. The goal throughout the game is merely to increase that chance in your favor. Regardless, it's a fun game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bunnies are Addicting!","review":"Love this game, I played it before with friends and now introduced it to new friends and now they are addicted!

I was shocked when, after playing our first game of KB, he announced \\"This is my very favorite birthday present.\\" I knew that he enjoyed it, but for an 11-year-old boy to position a board game ahead of video games (he has a wii, DS, PS2 and GameCube)and many other cool gifts and gadgets is pretty amazing. I contend that the game must have been developed by a 5th grade boy FOR the \\"5th grade boy\\" in all of us (including moms like me). But, as the packaging says, \\"no bunnies were hurt in the making or playing of this game.\\" I can't wait to play it a few more times and then start buying expansion packs for future gifts for my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"my wife wants it NOW","review":"be warned that this game is not for those who desire an intellectually stimulating experience. it is to be enjoyed by a large rowdy group. the larger and rowdier, the better. if you want a complete understanding of the mechanics of the game before you begin, you will be put off; the way to do it is to learn the basic game structure, and then learn the nuances as you play.that said, the pace may not be as fast as advertised, because a large part of the game is quibbling over the rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The instructions took us 30 minutes to read and we still could not figure them out with two MDs and a PhD in attendance.

I can be super-competitive, and she tends to just like to have fun. Somehow this game satisfies both of us. It's hilarious, it allows for some competitiveness, and it has enough randomness to please her as well. The best part is that the action keeps going even if you're in last place. Also, you almost always have a chance to win at the end even if you've been brutally picked on the entire game. Highly recommended for adults that like board/card games!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic game","review":"When I heard the title of \\"Killer Bunnies\\", I was skeptical; then I played and I've been hooked ever since. \\"Bunnies\\" is well disigned with a lot of depth and is full of pop cultural references and farcical weapons. Any violence is low key and unintrusive. Game play is dynamic and unpridictable. The game flow can change significantly with only one card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our new favorite game","review":"I bought this game for my Sister-In-Law - the \\"queen\\" of games for Christmas. Little did I know (although I suspected) how much fun it was going to be. We are a family that LOVES to play games. Not a gathering goes by where we don't play something fun. Over the past years we have been hooked on Apples to Apples, and Cranium games but I think they will play second fiddle for a while.The game was little tough to get started (since none of us have played it before), but once we got the hang of it - we couldn't stop playing. It has just the right combination of skill and luck that makes it anybody's game to win or lose."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAGGHH! Junk!","review":"I work in a small construction office and have used several different types of faxes, printers, computers etc. One thing I have noticed is... HP is putting out more junk. What happened to durability? This fax is an absolute pain. We have had it about 6 mos. and it jams up all the time. We clean it constantly just to get a few pages to go through when it jams up again. The paper feeder is flimsy, taking it in and out to clear jams is hard on it. After recieving 7 of a 10 page fax, it jams, you clear it then it starts all over again with page one! My office mate is over there right now trying to recieve a 12 page fax for the fourth time. Not happy.... Update, we returned it to HP and got another, one that had been used and for good reason dumped back on HP, same problems as first. Very poor design, check out Brother Intellifax 4100"},{"rating":"2","title":"An HP Fan","review":"This machine produced beautiful transmissions. The quality lived up to HP standards. It worked wonderfully and three weeks into our use, it was time to purchase a new printer cartridge. Perhaps we received more faxes than the average user. Cartridges were expensive.

So, when our fax machine took a dive, we ordered the 920. We were impressed with the ammount of pages you could send at once, since we send on average of 3-10 pages at a time. When we received our FIRST 920 it started taking 4-5 pages in the feeder at once. We returned it for the SECOND 920 when it started doing the same thing, the whole fax would go through all at once instead of one page at a time. At this point we called HP direct and received number THREE. Well to make a long story short, number THREE is going back and HP has struck out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last Long","review":"I had my 920 fax for about a year, and it seemed to work just fine. However, for some reason, the rollers started \\"clacking\\" real bad, and, I got error messages when trying to replace the cartridge (message said it's the wrong cartridge). So all in all, it's ultimately just a pile of plastic junk destined for the trash can. I have taken the unit in to see if it can be fixed, but won't spend over $80 to do so. There's probably a more dependable unit out there than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst customer service on the planet","review":"The machine was great until it took a power surge. HP refused to help and kept sending me to the toll line for customer service. They sent me a photocopy of the user manual as if I could not (and had not) read the one that accompanied the fax. I eventually had to call my credit card and contest the charge because I could not get HP to even listen. HP refused to let me return it past 30 days despite the alleged 1 year warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP 920 Fax Machine","review":"Have had this fax machine for 3 years, been used moderately in a home business environment.

Only problems I have had is in sending faxes. If you try to send documents longer than 10 pages and the papers aren't crisp and new it will sometimes take two pages instead of one, it won't jam but it just doesn't send the extra page. Doesn't do this every time but often enough that you can't trust it to do it unattended.I rarely ever send documents longer than three pages and in this set-up it works perfectly.

While the author does cover a wide spectrum of psychedelic artists, he gives very little respect to the classic artists of this genre. And he barely mentions artists like The Chocolate Watchband, The Litter, Electric Prunes, etc. He gives no mention of the dozens of great U.K. 60's and 70's psychedelic bands. It is obvious that the author knows little about mid 60's to mid 70's psychedelic music (psychedelic music's clasic period) outside of the obvious radio bands like Jefferson Airplane, Beatles, etc. The 80's and 90's artists he covers are not psychedelic bands at all (The Orb, etc.) but are groups playing an offshoot of true psychedelic music. The author's style and writing technique are very good. But his overall lack of knowledge and history of the subject make this a sub par effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak And Unfocused","review":"The main problem here is that Jim Derogatis tries to be too inclusive when it comes to what artists are psychedelic, leaving the less informed reader totally confused about a clear definition of the genre. The inclusion of fairly traditional progressive rock, like Genesis and Yes, which is really sort of \\"post psychedelic\\" is inappropriate, as are the hip hop and techno artists which he spends way too much time on. Some important indie and underground \\"real\\" psych artists like The Bevis Frond, are given just a token mention and passed off as trivial, or not included at all (example :The Groundhogs,May Blitz, George Brigman, Ronald Warren Ganderton).

He sees a patient who claims he was injured while being mugged but he doesn't want to talk about the details. He visits an elderly patient, but he has to deal with her angry son. He finds competition for Louisa because her ex-boyfriend has come back home.I bought this season because I really liked season one when I watched it for free as an Amazon Prime member. I loved season one and I figured that season two will be just as good. I wasn't wrong. I love how stubburn Doc Martin can be when it comes to loving Louisa. He can't show his true feelings and it really shows when her old boyfriend comes back to town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful show!!!","review":"I can't say enough about this series. The cast is perfect, but I'm sorry that PC Mark Mylow was replaced. You have to start from the beginning of the series to really appreciate Doc Martin and it's difficult to stick with it because the Doc is so rude. The best individual show by far is in Season 6, \\"Erotomania\\". It's a laugh-out loud, silly, sweet, touching episode. Bravo to the writers and the actors. Don't miss out on even one hour of this great show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky!","review":"I caught part of the first season on PBS and fell in love with Caroline Catz.

Martin Clunes is supported by a brilliant cast including Stephanie Cole, Caroline Catz (the romantic interest) and Robert McNeice with several guest appearances by well known British actors.

Often these types are hard to capture on CD. Perhaps because this is a live recording, or perhaps because of the excellent material, this album really works for me both as a \\"Story Hour\\" - a CD full of charming bedtime stories for adults - and also an intimate look at a cabaret artist doing what she does best - singing and emoting.Two songs here are utter gems - Christine Lavin's wonderful \\"Shopping Cart of Love,\\" and the brilliant, Sonheimesque \\"Painting My Kitchen\\" by the deliciously talented John Buccino.

When I found this recording, I snatched it up immediately, and was pleased to hear that her return to music was well worth the wait. Each song is beautifully performed in front of a deservedly appreciative live audience, yet the album merits re-listening more than most live albums. Mayes' voice is a lush, soulful instrument which is equally at home with jazz, pop, ballads, or Broadway. She puts a delightful new spin on Christine Lavin's hilarious \\"Shopping Cart of Love: The Play,\\" and I can't get enough of \\"My Babysitter.\\" Fans of great singing won't be disappointed with this eclectic, tuneful recording. With bedtime stories like these, her son is a lucky boy indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blurry pictures.

You'll be singing along, at the top of your lungs, before you know it. Luckily, she does include the lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa becomes more of an artist","review":"This album, Breakdown, finally takes advantage of Melissa's great talent. The first song, \\"Breakdown,\\" gets the album off to a great start with its rolling guitar. That song, and \\"Enough Of Me\\" have those great Etheridgian choruses that we come to expect from her. I'm glad that she didn't clutter the verse parts - you can hear her voice more clearly. There is definitely tons of passion on the album, especially on the \\"Enough Of Me\\" song. \\"Into The Dark,\\" \\"Scarecrow,\\" \\"My Lover,\\" and \\"Mama I'm Strange\\" all chart new territory for Melissa, and she is ready for the challenge. \\"Angels Will Fall\\" is a bit of a generic blues rocker, and \\"How Would I Know\\" is a bit bland, but \\"Truth Of The Heart\\" is a gem.

When I first reviewed this back in January, I had just received it. I liked it then, now I LOVE it. With her last album disappointing me a bit, I wondered if I should buy this one. I was surprised that the old Melissa was back! HOORAY! Of course the title track is the best on the Cd, but \\"Angels Would Fall\\" and \\"Mama I'm Strange\\" are really good! I would recommend this to any ME fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell me it ain't so!","review":"Other than letting it play, this CD left me with the only option of hitting the \\"stop\\" button and replacing it with one of her past stellar performances. As an avid fan, \\"Complete disappointment\\" is the only way I can describe this album. Except for maybe two tracks, \\"Breakdown\\" contains none of her usual powerful, passionate lyrics and riffs that are the heart and soul of her other albums. My advice: stick with any of her past CDs and leave this one alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakdown","review":"She was going through alot in this album.

No real surprises. Even lyrically, I can guess what the next line is going to be. This album is not bad, but its just very unexciting. I was really looking forward to the Matthew Shepard song (Scarecrow), but I didn't even think that had too much insight. Its still kinda pretty to listen to, though, if that's what you're looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down with the Enhanced Version","review":"I sure would love to listen to this CD, but the way the Enhanced version is set up there is no way to just LISTEN and still be able to work on your PC!

I was so disappointed by this most recent effort - I find the music predictable, and as the summary suggests, her lyrics seem to be written with the Dr. Seuss guide to songwriting - if it rhymes, it's a go. The more predictable her songs began to sound, the less patience I had for the album as a whole - the only song that grabbed my attention was \\"Scarecrow,\\" but even that soon became repetetive and obvious. I miss the early Melissa: clever, passionate but not quite bitter, intensely sensual, and never predictable. The only solace for losing this side of her would be if - in return - her life is so satisfying now, she just doesn't have the material anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's awesome, the best Melissa album ever!","review":"I love Melissa and this album to me is her best one yet!

It started out in innocence as nursery rhymes for children (Mother Goose). The first book of limericks 'The History of Sixteen Wonderful Old Women' was published in 1821. Although the term 'limerick' was never used. Edward Lear is still the master of this form of writing, in my opinion and he as well did not use the term 'limerick'. After Lear the limerick became extremely popular and was used on every topic imaginable-there were no limits to its use.This book is a collection of more than 250 famous and infamous limericks in these categories: Old Classics, Current Favorites, Tricks and Puzzles, Simply Ridiculous, Lightly Amatory, and Rollicking and Rowdy (these sections were considered unprintable)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, they are good....","review":"They won't give you \\"THE BEST\\" sound quality you'll expect from brands like bose, pioneer, jbl, but good enough to listen to your favorite songs or news without distortion and keep your partner quiet, if you know what I mean...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.

Third Eye Blind's Semi-charmed life, for example, has a much different sound to it when compared with the studio version. The End Sessions songs really gave the artists a chance to prove that they could play both in the studio and live.This CD is a good mix of songs and is one of the best live albums I have ever heard.

The book is clear, easy to read, and surprisingly comprehensive for a single volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for Learning Java","review":"An excellent book for learning java, html, and javascript. The book focuses on java programming for the world wide web, but stand-alone programs are also covered. The only problem I found with the book was the index.

This book was not only easy to read while conveying the fundamentals of web programming, it was ENJOYABLE!HTML, forms processing, and CGI scripting are covered in detail. Anyone from novice to web expert will find these chapters an excellent learning tool and reference.Java makes up the majority of the book with many tested examples (which can be \\"borrowed\\") that illustrate practical uses of the covered topic. What was especially valuable were the sections on threading, sockets, double buffering, cgi parsing, and the AWT. All the classes in this book are well designed with reuse as a top priority. Not only do you learn important Java topics, you get a grounding in good programming practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, unfriendly","review":"I would be the first person to say that Marty Hall is a gifted writer. His books on Servlets and JSP are my favorite computer books, but this book is far from great. The style is cold, the material delivered too fast with too little explanations and all in all, the attempt to cover everything in one fell swoop fails. I was using the book in a class that tried to cover the material the book does, and as a learning resource it is way too shallow for thorough knowledge, more as an 'In a Nutshell' style instead.If you want a good Javascript book, get 'Practical JavaScript for the Usable Web'; if you want a good Java book, well, look someplace else.Spare yourself a book you will not enjoy reading (and get Marty Hall's 'Core Servlets' instead!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what expected","review":"A huge amount of paper!

The author was even kind enough to reply to my questions, which is rare among authors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superceded by better books","review":"Agreed that Marty Hall knows how to write and produces great books. Knowing this, I can heartily recommend his more recent \\"More Servlets and JSPs\\" as it provides more relevant up to date information. For the Java side of things, this offers the most bang for your buck.When this book first came out, it was attempting to cover the gamut of web development technology, and tried to go from CGI up through JSPs and the coverage was ultimately spotty. For a more focused approach to servlets and JSPs, read Hall's later books. For a better historical perspective on the evolution of web programming, look at \\"Web Application Architecture - Principles, Protocols and Practices\\" by Leon Shklar and Richard Rosen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but not their best","review":"This is an excellent progressive rock album, from one of today's best progressive rock bands, unfortunately the band forgot to take time to focus on the lyrics (which has always been one of the band's greatest strengths).

For several years I've covered a lot of groung in search of principles that explain how we relate to, or more specifically, create our reality. The essentials of our personal part in this are very well covered in this book. They are powerful, but they will not work in an intentional or self-directed way unless you as an individual are able to let go of the way you've probably always believed things work.

They have a great sound that definitely kept me listening.Then I started listening to the lyrics.I have never felt so retarded from listening to a song before. It felt like the absence of any intelligent lyrics was actually draining the brain cells from my head and making me stupid just by listening to it.They're either attempting to be funny and failing miserably, they're trying to be humorously ironic and also failing miserably, or whoever writes the lyrics is a complete moron. I'm guessing it's the moron one.I also don't know why they call themselves a Christian band. There's only one or two references to anything Christian, one of which is the hilariously bad \\"Wanna talk about God philosophy?\\"The horrible and immature lyrics ruin what was something that had so much potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless Noise","review":"This group seems to be quite popular in some circles. The reason for that is beyond my comprehension.The sound is kind of a heavy metal/rap combination. Although they are billed as a Christian band, one would be hard pressed to determine that by listening to the lyrics. Most are either nonsensical or superficial. One or two might contain some sort of vague spiritual element, but one would have to really be looking for that to have a chance to find it.There are maybe two songs on here that are not terrible sounding. I would certainly not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"CRANK EM' UP!","review":"Try this: put this CD in your car, and CRANK IT UP! This is the type of CD you actually want you non-Christian friends to hear. This music invites you to loosen up, and lose your mind in dancing. The beats and raps are nothing short of incredible. And these guys are not afraid to be different, just look at their names! Now, this music might stun you at first, but after a few listens you will be singing the praises to Krunk Rock.

You can't help but blast every song and dance in your seat while you are driving, which tends to cause strange looks from other motorists! If they owned this cd, they would be doing the same thing!

If I go from one building to another (which you have to do all the time), it takes about 4 minutes for the game to make the transition.Also, the server goes down ALL THE TIME and Sony doesn't even think they should make it up to you in any way. For instance, just this week the game went down for about 30 hours ON THE WEEKEND!!! And this is like the eleventh time something like this has happened to me and I've only been playing the game for 3 weeks! Oh, and you should know this: they bring the servers down EVERYDAY (even Saturday and Sunday) during PRIME PLAYING TIME (10:00 - 11:00 AM)Eastern time!

I didn't know what the heck those things were until calling sony tech support.However after playing this game now both in beta and upon opening on my desktop, I don't think I'm missing anything.

In my 5 years playing EQ, i have only seen Sony make bad decision after bad decision, release 5 ( or is it now 7 .. 8??!!) money grubbing expansions and consistantly ignore their absurdly loyal customer base. MMGs, even more than other games, require companies that pay attention and value their customer base, and also PLAY and LOVE these games themselves.

I have a good running system, and when I run through a populated city the lag is unbearable. The quests are pretty boring too. Run to this zone and deliver this. Run back to the other zone and talk to so and so. Most of the quests are spent running through different zones, so between the running and the loading time lag for each zone a 30 min quest turns into a hour and a half long.

There is nothing cool about the way this bs stuff works.When you read certain comments and changes from the devs youwonder if they even think your time is worth something.Adventuring is way cooler then crafting and adventuring is likewatching paint dry on the wall. :)So do yourself a wonderful favor, don't buy this game:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"EQ, but *NOT* EQ.","review":"First, the good side:) Nice graphics.Second, the bad side:) Nice graphics.

The sound of the alarm is very faint and wouldn't wake up a mouse. Also, there is no light on the face display so you are not able to tell the time in the dark.

I own the manual unit (which I bought several years ago) and the MD (electric unit). It has saved many cds that were otherwise unplayable. On occasion there have been cds that did not play and could not be fixed. I found that they were indeed label side damaged or deep scratches. Obviously the fellow that used it once did not give it a chance and in many cases I am sure that the directions were not followed. They are simple 1. spray cd at least 2 times 2. turn handle so cd rotates in first direction 3. open and spray again 4. flip switch and turn handle so cd rotates other direction 5. thoroughly dry the cd 6. thoroughly buff cd.

I even read the manual and tried the various techniques they recommend. In my most successful test, only the first 12 of 16 songs would play.

Basically, what it does is scratch the entire surface of the disc in a consistant patern. It has a grinding wheel, some spray lubricant, and an instruction manual for use. You place the disc on this little wheel, spray it with the little bottle, and crank away. I tried to fix one game with this thing, and threw them both away. Sure the surface was consistantly scratched, but the game wouldn't read. Rather than having a few little scratches, now it litteraly looks like you took sandpaper to the disc. Honestly, you'd have a much better chance of repairing your games and dvd's with a power buffer. IT works quite well. Don't waste your money on this garbage.

I followed all the instructions given, and I found that the results I had gotten sound similar to what is said on this page. The codec conversations didn't work before I used the Game Dr. but now the game doesn't work at all.

But sometimes it gets bad, and you need help. The Game Doctor has fixed every single one of my scratched discs except for 1, which upon closer inspection revealed the scratch went through the top. If your games are only scratched on the bottom, and not through the label side, Game Doctor will fix it! It only takes a few minutes but sometimes you may need to do the process a few times.

Many of the shapes are timeless from the start, including a-line skirts, simple jackets and coats, and shirt styles.It's a very bare-bones style of designing which can help someone achieve a more versatile wardrobe with simple steps and easy-to-follow instruction.

Make sure that when you slow down or stop cranking, you let go of the crank, otherwise the gears will stip and it will make an annoying click sound, and I can see it eventually not working at all.

The book does give a brief biography of the artists, but this information can be found in many other locations.But there is a simple charm about this book.

So far, so good. But the artists he posits as harbingers of hope are a curious bunch (Lucien Freud, Julie Heffernan, Odd Nerdrum) and his prose remains humorless throughout.

Reading it is like being back in college learning - and I am speaking as a longtime art professional, educator and fine artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject, bad write-up","review":"This book has something interesting to say: that postmodern art has removed itself so far from the aesthetic, the creative, the interesting, or anything artistic, that it can no longer be considered art. Kuspit coined the term post-art for this type of creations. He has a point: whereas modernists still had integrity, and were still able to create something exciting, postmodern artists are all about discourse and cutting corners, while their art is utterly banal.Unfortunately, Kuspit found it necessary to drench his message in tons of nonsense so mind-numbingly verbose, that the message is lost. It seems that Kuspit felt the need to emulate the meaningless discourse of the postmodern artists he criticizes. I'm sure that there is some postmodern irony in all of this, but I doubt that Kuspit meant it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"post-Kuspit","review":"This text is torturous! Kuspit writes in circles, issuing complaints towards modern and postmodern art and denouncing artistic interest in conceptualism, anti-aesthetics, the merge of art and life, and the social system that supports art.If you want to read about the \\"End of Art\\" discourse I would suggest going to Hegel's \\"Aesthetics\\" which serves as a primary source to the topic, and then read Eva Geulen's \\"The End of Art: Readings in a Rumor after Hegel\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's awful!

However, he eventually manages to avoid numerous attempts on his life.Accompanied by Isaac, a Class Five robot, and Hrsh-Hgn, a phnobe, he goes on a quest to find the legendary Jokers' World, supposedly situated on the dark side of the sun.This early novel (1976, seven year before the first Discworld book) struck me as extremely messy. Indeed, I found the plethora of characters, races, robots and planets very confusing. Furthermore, since I'm not a Sci-Fi reader, the book failed to ring any bells and I guess I missed the puns and allusions. And even though Pratchett's famous style is already well recognisable, and premises of many later Discworldisms such as Hogswatchnight, Soul Cake Friday or Small Gods, are mentioned, they're not enough for me to recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Side of the Sun","review":"Book was not in the best condition.Story was convoluted.

The lead character and his quest never become more than a reason to explore a reasonably inventive worlds that Pratchett created. The search for The Joker's World is nothing more than a Mcguffin and the ultimate reveal comes across as a Grand Finally, not a Grand Finale.Beneath the surface, you can see the emerging charm of Pratchett's writing, but mostly you're wading through disjointed and often confusing encounters with various alien races.Give it a pass,unless you're compelled to read everything Pratchett has written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic rack - cheap price!","review":"For less thirty bucks, I ordered one of these racks for my CCNA lab rig.

I like them mainly because they are made of BPA-free plastic. They are easily cleaned, but you MUST remember to put the bottoms on tightly or it will leak everywhere. The rubber ring must be inserted just so, also. I was using Playtex drop-ins, but found them to be a little annoying because it was just one more thing to remember when going out of the house--I have many times remembered the bottle, but not the drop-in. I also like these bottles better because you can fit a larger amount of formula/milk in them. ONE WORD OF CAUTION--I bought fast flow nipples, and they seem to be really too fast for my 8-month-old--he finishes a bottle in under 3 minutes and seems to gasp a little while drinking. I was using fast flow in the Playtex and did not have this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're good bottles, but DO NOT BOIL THEM","review":"We searched the entire country for bottles that aren't made of polycarbonate (PC) plastic, which contains bisphenol A, a compound known to be estrogenic. The only bottles in the US (besides glass, which isn't an option for us) that aren't made of PC were these, which are made of polypropylene (PP). They are good bottles and the nipples (silicone) work well for our son (age 3 mos). The only problem, and the reason I gave it four stars, is that the lid where you insert the nipple can warp if you boil it for sterilization, and then there can be major leakage around where the nipple should seal. This is a function of its being PP instead of the tougher PC plastic. So, soap and water on the lids! You can boil the silicone nipples."},{"rating":"2","title":"BPA free and works with Avent nipples","review":"I didn't give five stars because they do leak occasionally (although it is difficult to tell whether it is due to user error) and the system with the provided #2 nipples provided a slow/difficult nursing experience for my three month old. I tried sucking and had a hard time getting much out as well.The good news is that Avent nipples fit with this bottle, and given the outrageous prices for replacement nipples for the Mam system, this is a godsend. The Avent #3 nipples are easily found in stores and provide the perfect draw for my baby. These bottles are not perfect, but I think that they are the best of the BPA free options. I tried and researched the other BPA free bottles on the market and the others were either too expensive or inferior products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought these thinking they would be a good alternative to my more expensive set of Born Free bottles, and Adiri bottles.Nope, in fact they suck. The venting system is a total joke. It doesnt work, not if the vent is wet, or dry; if the vent is screwed on loose (dont it will leak EVERYWHERE) or tight. The nipple is very oddly shaped, and pressure buildup inside the bottle is ridiculous.I guess you pay for quality.The only thing good about them is that they are BPA free, but, there are plenty of better BPA-free alternatives out there.Take it from me, they suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"All the Littermaid products I have owned are cheaply made & break easily. This is no exception. I decided to give them another try- the item looked improved from the original big square version of their litter cover. The plastic is cheap and breaks easily. The material is flimsy. My cat peed on it and I washed it, but didn't dry it- it shrunk!!! and wouldn't fit in the frame anymore- I had to throw the whole thing out after MUCH MUCH frustration trying to get the thing back together. Definitely don't waste your money on ANY Littermaid products."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I didn't buy it","review":"This thing would have been 100% better if the top had a zipper to unzip it. As it is constructed, you have to take the entire box out to get to the back controls, manually scoop, or do any kind of cleaning. It made everything harder - I gave it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"not reccomended","review":"I got the kabana to control litter and odor, which it did do somewhat. However, in order to add litter or scoop the smaller bits of cat stuff, you have to pull the box out. The zipper only works from one side and should be a two way. very difficult to get the box in and out of the kabana for cleaning, negating any positives about the product. The plastic frame is flimsy and easily broke on one of the attempts to get to the box to add litter. also, my cats are big and did not seem to like climbing into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This thing would be nice if it wasn't made out of cheap material.It needs to be a little longer.

It is designed so that once assembled you slide the unit in. You have to remove the cabana to empty the litter holder and when you do the pegs fall out and whole things falls apart and has to be reassembled. If you unzip the bottom and use just the top, the structure is not sturdy enough to stand straight and I had to use a bungee cord to hold it square in the front. I don't recomment this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, Falls apart, Must take apart to clean litter box","review":"The tent completely surrounds the litter box, including going underneath it. You have to unzip the top from the bottom every time you clean the litter box. When you do, the cheap plastic frame falls apart at the connectors. Save your money, this isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"jim","review":"My cat is afraid of it I've had it for over a month now.

These keys allow youto connect the different tubes to construct the tent. Without the connector keys,the items included, the tent and tubes, are useless. Since some of the keys connect 3 tubes, oneat right angle to the other two, there is little you can do to replace the missing items.I can't be of much help, since I never got the item up and working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and hard to use","review":"I bought this because I have a minor problem of a dog who seems to like the cat food after it has been processed. I put this together and it was cheap and flimsy and would in not way keep my dog from tearing it apart. So I used it and put it on a shelf so It was out of my dogs reach. With that problem solved I thought I would be OK but then I discovered how hard it is to get the unit in and out of this for cleaning let alone just trying to empty it(my unit fit all the way in unlike some of the other reviewers). needless to say it found it's way into my trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality","review":"When I put it together the fabric was way to small and ripped to pieces. Could not access power button or plug with it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry I bought this","review":"I never even got the thing put together. It had a ton of parts and all of them poor quality. I guess I didn't realize that the tent had a cloth bottom either so that even if I did get it together, the box would have to be slid inside (which probably wouldn't have been an easy task) instead on placing it over the box. Just not a good design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"This is a horrible invention. Once tent is assembled and you slide the litter box inside you do not have any access to the controls. Refilling the litter box is going to be a huge hassle. You would have to keep sliding the whole litter box out and that is a huge pain to do. The tent is not tall so if you have a big cat they may not want to go inside because of the lack of head room. Don't bother trying to unzip the tent it is not easy to re-zip without the fear of damaging it. Honestly this product is not worth the trouble. I would recommend the tent that goes on top of the box rather than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars","review":"Not worth the money at all.This product will only have you frustrated in about two seconds into assembly - The direction are very poor. The quality is very poor. The construction is very poor, and doesn't allow for easy access to the controls in the back of the machine. It's also too small for cats to do their business. It also broke within the first day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kabana too hard to work with","review":"The Kabana is nice looking. It hides the box nicely; however, it makes cleaning of the box difficult and gets in the way because you have to push the box in and out of the kabana because the kabana has a bottom and does not simply set over the box. We used it for a few days then stopped using it because it was too hard to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"This item is cumbersome to put together for the first time and then each time you have to take the litter box out/in to clean or refill.It didn't help much with the smell and eventually my cat stopped using his litter box and relieved himself all over the house. I had to go buy a plastic pan and then he used that for a few days. This item is back in its box and the money spent on the item wasted.Eventually I got rid of the smell by changing to a wheat based litter. Doesn't clump the liquid waste as well (doesn't work that well with the automatic litter box) but the overpowering smells are gone. I don't have a problem scooping the stuff up at the end of the day and now my cat uses the plastic pan at night while in the garage and the automatic one during the day while in the house. I think that for some things simpler is better.For some people this item works but for me it was a disappointment. Maybe my kitty just was not happy with the closed-in feeling.

They just seem to throw formulas at you without clear mathematical derivation. They constantly refer to formulas in past chapters (only by reference number, 3.12) and expect you to remember the formula and follow along. Chapter 8 alone has 34 formulas, and those are just the ones deemed important enough for reference numbers, there are plenty more.I spend most of my time flipping through the book and trying to understand their math rather than understanding the SUBJECT. The formulas are also written in one line format with lots of parenthesis and exponents of 1/2, instead of square root symbols and numerator over denomenator notation.

I liked all the pieces, especially the quietly admiring piece on Cooder, the thorough look at the wild life and music of Nigerian musician Fela, and an erudite explanation of the musical legacy of gospel singer Dorothy Love Coates. It's interesting that the pieces that interested me the most were about musicians I knew the least; the best writing made me want to hear their music and appreciate it as much as these writers did. That really does make for the best of music writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This tells what happened and why.","review":"This book is very well written in a style that is not heavy or boring. It tells what happened and why with the facts that are available to us. There isn't any guessing or embellishing.It gets right to the point without meandering around. To understand what happened and why you do need to understand Rome and its way of thinking. Also, the differences between the way they thought. It was paramount to why Rome won the war.It keeps away from undue speculation but presents the problems that have confronted historians and military theorists over time and discusses all the relevant events that lead to the downfall of Carthage.If you want a book that clearly explains what happened and why in a well written easy to read style, then this book is what you're looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the best CD of the series","review":"Being a huge fan of Lost in Space, I was excited to see that there were 3 CD volumes containing original soundtracks from the show. I purchased all 3 and was very pleased with Volume 1 and Volume 3, but with the exception of the 3rd Season opening title, there was not much on this CD that was featured throughout the entire TV series. Most of the tracks were featured only in the episodes in which they are credited for, (Wild Aventure, The Haunted Lighthouse, and The Great Vegetable Rebellion)so therefore the music is not what I would call \\"franchise\\" themes.

This means that even without abusing it, the metal connections between the connector and where memory is stored become weaker and weaker. My connector broke off entirely yesterday.

Fellow heirloom lovers exchange seeds of different varieties, either in person or through the mail and there are also abundant catalogs for acquiring the seeds. So if you are a person who is ready to try something a little out of the mundane, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 is not enough!","review":"This is a great book. I especially love the pictures with cross-sections of each tomato so you can see the meatiness before you buy. I also appriciate that the taste of each one is described in detail. My only complaint is that a lot of great tomatoes are missing from this book. I hope the next volume has about 500 varieties to truley reflect the unique color, taste and shape variations in heirloom tomatoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Enjoyed the book enough to buy another to give to my tomato-growing son.

There is not much info about each tomato. The 2 page spread consists of 1/2 page of info about the tomato in large print and the second page is a huge picture. There is no info about the history of the heirloom tomato. Also, 100 Heirloom tomatores does not scratch the surface of types you will find in the market.

Not for assassination buffs. I'm not sure who the audience for this book would be as it's not an overview for beginners or people only mildly interested, either.I was sucked in by the possibility of information about the Carter audio gap that occurred when he tried to mention the assassination, but it gave zero additional info about that, not even anything that would allow me to look up the event- no date, network, nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"auditor","review":"I have used this scanner for over a year at work and had no problems. It allows to scan page by page anything up to 8.5\\" wide. It also allows to add comments to both text and pictures.

You can paste into Word, Excel or PaintBrush, if you wish, as a picture (it comes out big, but can be easily resized).The text recognition feature that comes with the software allows to convert the document into either Word or Excel, if you had a table, for example.You can also use the software to fill in blanks in a form, just drag your document into the 'typewriter' (or 'ABC') icon on the bottom of the screen.Very compact, about 10\\"x3\\"x4\\", it's an excellent tool if you travel with equipment.

Had she just written a book with insights into what it's like to be a plus size actress without all the tons of personal who cares biographical crap and armchair psychology I really don't think she's appropriate to spew it really might have been fab. Instead it's a like a fat girl cheer but not from a real live like you and me fat girl, it's from a fat girl on her own pedestal (but who wear Cherokee?!) Read Camryn Manheim's memoir instead, it's MUCH better and she's much more true to life even though she is rightfully a much bigger deal than Patrika!

It picked out and only ate the expected components and filtered out and did not eat the added ingredients.They refunded my money without any questions right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"More fair to poor writing","review":"The first story is fair; they slide progressivly towards poor and hateful sickness. This is, once again, a collection of writing from an author who seems devout in her desire to prodice poor work and then dare anyone to criticize it, by setting herself up as a martyr.There are many varied and brilliant feminist and/or women writers, who take the time to study writing, character analysis, style, form, etc... Such must have all bought into the \\"oppressors\\" dictum of \\"male\\" writing, if one were to believe this \\"liberated\\" author.I somewhat enjoyed \\"The Female Man\\", but that was back in the days when I was more radically femenist myself, in college. If the book can't hold interest past the college age, it is not very much worth the writing, or the reading.

The programing in this item is OUT OF DATE it still has Dale Jarret racing in the #88 car and he has been retired at least two years. So I paid $45.00 more for this item and if I can't figure out how to program it myself I will have to spend at least $25.00 to have it programed. SO as I see it I spent $45 to $70 dollars more than if I bought the REFURBISHED unit as I have to program my \\"pre-programed\\" anyway. I should have just bit the bullet and bought it at the track as it would have been \\"race-ready\\". It is a great unit sharp looking appears to be well built.

Both Chase and I appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical & Excellent","review":"This is an outstanding book. It has a wealth of information for dogs and their training , written in a manner that makes it understandable for the guy with one pup or a dozen dogs. No Hocus Pocus, just practical, knowledgeable common sense. It TRULY covers everything from the time you are thinking of getting a pup. Plus it is interesting to read .Written by a guy who knows his stuff - truly been there and done it AND used that experience to develop this approach.The BONUS is the format, the pictures AND the included video!!! The links within it allow you to effortlessly manouever, the pictures are extremely helpful and the video really puts the icing on the cake. State of the art BUT completely user friendly (if you can turn on your computer you are in business - if not you could still get someone to turn it on for you!).This format is going to be copied a lot , not just for dog training.Should be mandatory for anyone thinking of getting a pup."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jerry Lewis Show Collection","review":"First Off I could not wait to see this set,the show which aired from 1967-68 has never been syndicated.Now for the bad news!,Infinity has butchered them! first they have replaced the original shows opening with thier own,next they have cut out all the musical acts(probably because they did not want to pay for the rights)so basically all your getting are the shows skits which average 23 minutes and even those are EDITED!.It's good to see them but don't expect anywhere near close to what they originally looked like on air in 1967-68.Thumbs down to Infinity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money!!!!!!! unless your a fan.","review":"I agree with other bad reviews of this set. I had hopes of seeing complete sketches in a collection similar to the Dean Martin Show dvd series, but this?!?! The sketches are chopped up, shortened, and the original intros are remade with some 1980's syndication style electronic music and graphics. Each show is about 23 mins. or just 2 sketches. Worst off, they include a photo gallery of images from the series that gives you a clue as to how fun this show actually was...before this dvd company got a hold of them. I'll take the old scratchy kinescopes floating around on youtube rather than this set. I love Jerry's comedy, but let's have complete shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"the same as vice city, but not as fun","review":"GTA:Vice City is great, but Vice City stories is nothing compared to the others.

The sound track if nothing else does it for me. Other improvements include swimming and flying, which were missing in LCS. This is a $20 game and was meant for the psp so keep that in mind. The graphics are not great but the classic game play more than makes up for it. All the LCS naysayers may not be that impressed but it's only meant to be an added installment to Vice City not an improvement over the other titles. Again, the soundtrack is what sets it apart from LCS. Classic eighties tunes and hillarious commercials. For $20 a steal and a good tide-over 'til GTA4 for ps3."},{"rating":"2","title":"I missed you Vice City","review":"I am a Grand Theft Auto fanatic and I love revisiting the cities we've seen, but with new storylines. The way that the games tie into one another through various characters gives the player a feeling of investment in their fates. \\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\\" is no different. It is fascinating to see how the city appeared prior to the rise of Tommy Vercetti. An avid GTA fan will notice the subtleties and will catch themselves amused by them. The game is humorous and as fun to play as the original Vice City. I understand that this is a transfer from the PSP, but my only complaint is that I still would like to see the cities expand as we revisit them. All in all a good game."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could just get by one mission","review":"The only things so far that I don't like about this game is that you can't fly airplanes (at least not to my knowledge).Also the mission where you have to remove the liquor from the warehouse is REALLY annoying me.You can swim in this game,but not for too long as you wind up dying.Sometimes I enjoying going around assaulting people/blowing things up,but hate getting busted.I have to put in the never wanted cheat several times in the game which was different than San Andreas as I only had to put the code in ONCE while playing it.Weapons are almost the same in every game of the gta series!I rather enjoyed San Andreas the most as you could go to flying and driving school.I liked the vehicles better in that game also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Entry of GTA","review":"After playing through the trilogy of GTAs and Liberty City Stories, I would have to say this is the worst one of them all. The story was mature, but this game just took itself too seriously. Graphicswise, this game is showing its age, but comparatively, the originalGrand Theft Auto Vice City's graphics were better in my opinion. Gameplaywise, the game was absolutely horrible.

As has been the case up through now - the reading experience is gripping, grim and utterly compelling - and the issues collected in this volume does not fail to disappoint. Volume 4 takes on a larger gravitas then previous volumes because the core element deals with the psychological consequences of the characters actions and experiences finally taking their collected toll, and as one would imagine not in positive light.

Also the book is fraught with errors, and the quotes can get tiresome because they always end in exclamation points. The book also didn't provide strategies for use in the game, and there were no codes, but there are no codes in any of the books. All of these things combined forces me to give this guide 1 star. It has too many errors, no maps, no field guide, no strategies other than the ones Ash used, no information about the game in general (a type-effectiveness chart, suggested teams, etc.), making it a 1-star guide for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe Chapter books were awesome..

When I select the multichannel option I have to turn my Sony Amp's volume as high as 35 to get the volume I desire.

Unfortunately, he must have been too lazy to take a ten minute look at medline and the abstracts from over twenty papers that have been published over the past five years explicitly showing that second-hand smoke increases tumor prevalence 2-3 fold in mice, drastically increases asthma in children of smokers, increases the risk of stroke to non-smokers by as much as 80%, etc. I am a libertarian on almost every issue myself, but I draw the line on issues where one free individual's actions directly harm another free individual, whether that be with a gun, a baseball bat, or a lit cigarette."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is employed by an industry-sponsored foundation!","review":"Buyers, readers should be aware than Jacob Sullum is an editor of Reason magazine, published by the Reason foundation, which is supported by the tobacco industry.Too bad Simon & Shuster allowed themselves to be used by an industry propogandist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Star Trek of the Star Trek Scores","review":"The choice to have Dennis McCarthy compose the music for the first Next Generation Movie was an obvious one. He had done so much of the Music for the show that he really deserved to do the music for the movie. He did such a great job I think its a shame that he hasen't been brough back to do any music for any of the other films. I Highly recommend this soundtrack for any fan of Star Trek or just good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"Perhaps one of the most haunting tracks, of course, is \\"A Christmas Hug\\", in which Picard must give up eternal bliss to try to save his conrades. The opening title reflects the general theme of aging and coming to terms with the past and mortality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek: Generations - Music that moves you","review":"This was very good music. Having also owned Encounter at Farpoint the music, though in areas sounding a bit familiar, was of extremely high quality. In fact two of the best portions of the music, the fanfare as we see the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-B for the first time (part of track 2), and the last portion of Track 15 (the part where USS Farragut and two other ships take the survivors of USS Enterprise back to Earth), were so goood that I turned them into theme music for my Windows desktop. Of course I couldn't play the whole thing or I'd be there forever, but the two snippets were almost half a minute in length each. But they made good startup and shutdown sounds. To me, that's just the ultimate compliment. A very worthwhile CD to own. I just wonder if the Chromium mini-poster included when this CD was released is still available somewhere. I'd like to get another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!!","review":"Now when Dennis McCarthy wrote this, he really knew what he was doing! This is the most enjoyable CD I have! The music is so flowing it feels as though you are really there. The 'main title' (2) is absolutely gorgeous, along with 'The Nexus' (10). The piece of 'Kirk's Death' (14) is so heart-breaking it's enough to make one's eyes water. But this is the ultimate CD that everyone should have. This is just exquisite! Most highly recommended!!!! It is worth it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Classic Beauty","review":"This ring is so beautiful! It has a timeless look with a brilliant shine.

If you are familiar with Trigun, Hellsing or Cowboy Bebop, you may enjoy hearing a lot familiar voice actors(the voices of Vash the Stampede and Meryl Stryfe from Trigun and Alucard from Hellsing are among main characters). The world of Last Exile is that of a non-computerized future which revolves heavily upon air travel. It has a great balance of action and character development and mystery with an awesome score to accompany it. Last Exile lives up to what you would expect of a cojoint effort by Gonzo, Pioneer, and JVC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be \\"Son of Dean Martin Remembers his Childhood","review":"To me this book was moe an autobiography about Ricci, Dean is in it but more as a supporting character rather than the main.

The book arrived in great condition and in a timely manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean - The Family Man","review":"The new Ricci Martin book arrived yesterday and I read it in two highly enjoyable sittings. It's nicely organized and well-written. Best of all, the glimpses it provides into the life of Dean Martin, the family man, reveal an extremely likable guy. There is a note of sadness running through this story, though, partly the result of the sharp contrast between the flamboyant, man-about-town image on stage and the 'father know's best' reality of homelife. It's touching as well to read about the loving family relationships that endured, first divorce, and then the tragic loss of Dean-Paul. In short, an affecting portrayal of a great entertainer and a loving father. Highly recommended to Dino fans for the anecdotes and pictures alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"I've used the jig saw on a number of small projects and I like it very much.

I had horrible trouble making straight cuts. The blade really seemed to wander off. That said, I've recently spent some more time with it and I think it's really okay. Even good. The biggest factor for me seems to have been backing off the speed (I'm using #3 now). I still use a batten, and I'm very careful to guide rather than push. And sometimes I still work freehand. But backing off the speed seems to have made the most difference (and using the widest Bosch blades I can find). I'm now glad I spent some more time with the thing. Changing blades with an allen wrench is a little annoying, and sure, I'd rather have a Bosch, but for the price it's an okay saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than mediocre...","review":"As a semi-retired residential building contractor, I have a lot of tools. I use them mostly to renovate my own house (a work in progress)and to build some outdoor furniture. Every shop needs a jig saw. This one is well made, typical of Makita but very basic. For a little more money, you can buy a jig saw that has more control options, and is easier to handle.I have a band saw that I use for most things that require curve cuts. Occasionally I break out the Makita, if I need to make a curve cut on something I can't bring to the band saw.The machine works, but I never enjoy using it. Too much vibration.I recall paying about $75 for it. If I was buying a new jig saw, I'd double that budget, and buy something that was more sophisticated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst two printers I ever used.","review":"This printer is a pile of garbage.

It worked fine for a the first few months, but all of a sudden the paper started misfeeding (dragging it in only from the right side) and for the life of me, I cannot figure out how to fix it.I went to the Dell site and they have crap for troubleshooting (well for this particular problem anyway.) As a result, I searched for anyone who has had a similar problem and that would be able to help me fix my printer. I found a message board that discussed this exact problem on more than one Dell printer. The only solution anyone had found to work was to fold up a piece of paper and jam it in between the side of the feeder and the alignment thing. That didn't work, so now I am on Amazon looking for its replacement. When I saw this, I thought I should share my complete and utter disappointment with this printer. It would be a good deal if they could fix that feeder problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest piece of junk ever!","review":"This is by far the worst printer I have ever had.

It can't handle anything except standard printer papers (so don't try to get creative with your card stocks or anything heavier). The ink cartridges are awful and require manual cleaning w/ a Q-tip after about every use and still NEVER get fully cleaned. For the price of two sets of ink cartridges, you could get a better printer than this. Would give it 0 stars if I could. It's an utter failure of a product. Dell should pay me for the space it takes up on my computer stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this printer!!!","review":"This is the worst printer I've owned...worked okay at first (not great, not fast, just okay). Ink is ridiculously overpriced, and only available from them. Paper starts to drag from 1 side...not fizable. Then it will start to print colors a little \\"Off\\" with no way to adjust for more red, blue, etc. Then it printes blurry, or spotty, or prints big blobs of ink, even though it says it full and you put in a new cartridge.Doesn't allow you to make any adjustments, they just tell you to put in a new cartridge, and their only solution is to run a nozzle cleaning, which uses up ENORMOUS amounts of ink.Sigh.Find another printer...this one's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Girl Named Helen Keller","review":"This is a great book !

The other side quickly followed, and soon after, the sides of the plastic insert just broke off. This caused the device to fall out when the console was moved even a little.

But I don't know what they were thinking when they put this cookbook together. Oh wait, I do know: they were thinking that total carb count is all that matters. Anyone who really understands low carb knows that it isn't just the total number of carbs you consume: where those carbs come from matters at least as much. So I was surprised to see recipes in this book calling for ingredients most low carbers wouldn't dream of touching on a regular basis. There also seemed to be an over-reliance on Atkins products, and overall, it looked too much like someone took a regular cookbook and just substituted artificial sweeteners for sugar and Atkins bake mix for flour and thought the recipes would fly. Not only did I make the decision not to buy this book, I didn't even like it enough to check it out of the library after reading through it. I hope the next Atkins book is closer to the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cookbook","review":"i love my new cookbook. i have lost 13 lbs in a little less than 4 wks. i have struggled for the past 5 yrs with my weight due to diabetes and high blood pressure and some of the meds i have to take have side affects that say;\\"weight gain'. i have tried all types of dieting to no success, until now. i love the atkins diet and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"it has some good recipes","review":"having lost 17 lbs in 2 1/2 weeks and not really feeling hungry says alot forthis diet.

As a diabetic, I have to watch my carbs for blood sugar reasons. This particular cookbook had a decent amount of recipes... easy recipes, nutritious recipes, affordable recipes. It just irks me when I get cookbooks where maybe I would make 2-3 recipes based on the time, cost or ingredients but this one is different. I've enjoyed making and eating such recipes as Pasta Carbonara with 5.5 grams net carbs (high fat content though at 38.5 g); the Spinach & Bacon soup with only 2 grams of carbs and 146 calories was good; and thumbs up to the Mexican Chicken Wraps with a 7 minute prep time made good use of chicken leftovers.

There is even one recipe that calls for a teaspoon of sugar! How disappointing. I took mine right back to the store.After all the work and sacrifice of Dr. Atkins and all the good he has done for seriously ill people, it is criminal to put the Atkins name on a book like this.

He is obsessed with the camera and if he said \\"my DVD\\" one more time I was going to turn it off. He spent a third of the video picking on one poor old guy which was amusing for a few minutes but became painful. He spends a third of the time looking at the camera flashing goofy looks for his \\"DVD\\" or talking about the name of the DVD. That only left the last third for comedy. Too bad, it is obvious they cut out a lot of scenes and it doesn't flow well and not his best stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny Moments Too Far and In Between","review":"I wonder if Zach viewed the final cut of this DVD.

Still Zach is a very unique comedian that deserves some acclaim. There were also other segments to this DVD that gave it almost a documentary feel, the interview with his twin brother Seth which was hilarious and the road adventures with his friend Joe was also great. Overall I think this is a great product for somebody looking for a breath of fresh air in stand-up, as long as a little bit of cursing doesn't bother you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"It shouldn't be called \\"Live at the Purple Onion\\" but more \\"Semi-Live at the Purple Onion but More Fake Interviews with my 'Brother.'\\" There's barely any stand-up in it.

He was also good in the movie \\"Out Cold.\\" So I expected this DVD to be really funny. However, this material was no where near as good as the stuff from his half-hour Comedy Central special. I think he may have been drunk during this routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but I understand that it isn't for everyone.","review":"I will start this off by saying I love this DVD. I get Zack. His timing, his style of border-line losing-it delivery and the way he pretty much hates everything. A man I can easily relate to. If you have seen Zack live (I saw him once at Berklee in Boston) you'll love this. His comedy is very... odd... so I understand how it can be very iffy when it comes to Zack. You either love him or 'he is ok' or you hate him. So taste aside, this dvd is very well made. It never drags, except for that one part, but that's ok. It was funny. The Seth Galifianakis interview is hilarious though I hate Brian Unger... for personal reasons. I say buy this if you like Zack, if you don't like Zack, grow a sense of humor, and if you are on the fence about him, get it on netflix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Political","review":"It was marginally OK until near the end where it became inexplicably, awkwardly, and inappropriately political. Why alienate half your audience?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment...","review":"First off, I'd like to mention I really enjoy Zach G's work, especially the witty, awkward comedy featured in his \\"Between Two Ferns\\" webisodes on FunnyOrDie.With that being said I was really disappointed by this feature. The laughs were few and far between and the awkward situational humor of his I so much enjoy fell flat and was far to awkward to even render it as funny. This has really been off-putting for me and has greatly lowered my own opinion of Zach G. Hopefully he gets his act together and comes out on top.All in all I would highly recommend getting a good Daniel Tosh or Bill Burr standup instead, don't waste your time and money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Zach is the best comedian in the game today. His awkward style of delivery is a thing of beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor and buy this...","review":"This dvd is hiliarious, showing Zach doing what he does best, making us laugh. Topics range from family, failed career, politics, etc. The Seth Galiafinakis footage is also priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Giamatti meets Chris Elliot","review":"Enjoyable set from Zach G. A bit self-indulgent and lazy, but hey - he'd be the first to admit to that! Funny pop culture writer. There's also an ongoing segment with his \\"twin brother\\" Seth, who seems to be channeling Christopher Guest.Overall, 3 & 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Actually turned it off......","review":"As far as the content of the DvD goes, it was not that great. It is the first stand up that I have actually turned off half way through. I always thought Zach was awesome in all of his movies, but I guess his stand up wasn't right for me. Rent this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Normally I really like this guy...","review":"I've really enjoyed his movies (especially the recent ones) and the stand-up I've seen on TV.But he was really obnoxious in this video... I didn't even watch the last ten minutes because I wasn't laughing at all. He picked on one guy in the audience really hard the entire time who obviously didn't take it very well, and insulted the audience repeatedly to the point of being awkward. And to be honest, even aside from that, his speech delivery was off and the jokes just weren't very funny. Maybe the pressure is getting to him? I just never had such a bad impression of him before, but this performance has almost completely ruined any draw I had to him and his work. Not at all like what I've seen of him previously.Buy/rent The Hangover or Visioneers instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zach live","review":"Great comedian but not worth purchasing. There are only a few minutes of greatness and the rest is dull. I would have liked to see him doing the entire standup performance instead of weaving an alter ego interview. Rent on Netflix first before committing to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious.","review":"The audience must've had a long while to get liquored up, because they laugh at anything...which includes nothing...which describes what Zach is doing on stage for at least half of this performance.

Do better next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The guy is talented","review":"Weird, Awkward, Mysterious, call it what you want, but Zach has good timing and is quite good at it. Thats All I feel I need to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even finish watching it","review":"I have a very broad taste in movies and comedy. There are very few movies or stand up comedy specials that I won't like. The fact that I couldn't even finish the DVD should tell you what I thought about it. He cracked a few jokes in the beginning which got my hopes up but over the 40 minutes that I could bare to watch they ended up being the only 2 jokes that I laughed at. For the majority of the time he is just talking to the crowd and not being very funny about it in my opinion. The rest of the time, they show pre-recorded skits where he is pretending to be his twin brother or with his group of friends and I felt that both of those were pointless and even more dull than his stand-up portion. I found him to be very disappointing and boring. Overall I can say that I wasted my money on this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny.","review":"This is such a weird performance. Its pretty terrible and mostly not funny. Hes really rude to one guy in the audience and not in a hilarious way like you can find in his BTWN 2 FRNS. BTWN 2 FERNS is actually HYSTERICAL and this is bad - hes not a good standup comedian judging from this. I saw him on SNL doing some standup which was actually really funny. this leads me to believe that he was too nervous or just didnt take this performance seriously at all. i was disappointed. he is however one of my favorite tv personalities and if you wanna check this out because youre a ZACH G fan then by all means see it, but i dont think this will be one of your favorite works by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zach Galifianakis - Live at the Purple Onion - Review","review":"Zach Galifianakis - Live at the Purple Onion - Review:I saw a clip of this on another DVD - and had to buy it.

At the end of the day he came home so excited, and he loved the costume so much he started wearing it regularly! I had no idea he would get so much use out of it. He's even added accessories, like gold chains and bling rings (though I really don't understand where he got the money... oh well, probably just cheap things from the dollar store).This turned out to be a great investment for Johnny. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with the hat, as pictured, which was disappointing for him... but he soon managed to get his hands on the cutest little purple velvet fedora which makes him look sooooo elegant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How could you not like this!","review":"When I first saw the movie, I fell in love with the movie and the music. Music has always been a major part of my life. I bought the sound-track on cassett as son as it hit the store. Then My husband bought me the movie. Both have capture my heart, and now our 13 year old son has fallen too. The cassett has been played so much that it wore out and now we have the CD. My favorite music is when the hawk flys over the lake.....it wish there was an entire score just for that track"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was totally blown away!!!","review":"This album is a definite must for anyone who likes music (particularly for APP and Ladyhawke fans). Alan Parsons and Andrew Powell couldn't have done better in making a fantastical score to go along with a fantastic movie. This is music you can listen to at any time; it gets inside you.

I love the film \\"Ladyhawke\\" But Parson's soundtrack spoils the film from the beginnig...It opens with a rock song (ala eye of the tiger) that is typical canned rock that makes me glad it isn't the 80's anymore...Never mind the movie is set in a midevil period...The more traditional orchestral filler is adequate but doesn't evoke any emotion the way the score for \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" does for example.

Is that a soundtrack???","review":"Who's that guy, Andrew Powell? When I watched the film on TV I didn't even pay attention to the score, though I collect soundtracks. I bought the CD, however, because I was curious, but... I really got disappointed. There's no one single theme to support the score. I can't believe Richard Donner - who signed the film \\"The Omen\\", whichwas scored by the REAL composer Jerry Goldsmith - has written all those kind words about Mr. Powell, a poor talented musician. For those who appreciate this \\"soundtrack\\" I only can say that they don't know the art of scoring movies; they just wanna dance..."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this one like the plague","review":"this cd is purely for alan parsons freaks to say they have a complete collection of his works. the music is typical parsons, but it gets boring after hearing the same stuff for 30 minutes - the film action with it might be brilliant but this is definitely a collector's album - my suggestion is to buy anything else by alan parsons because they are good - this one is only good for the rubbish bin - an appalling waste of time and money even for an alan parsons fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for APP fans!","review":"I just got on the Net and have been looking for this CD for years, ever since I saw the movie.

Since that day I have sought out the soundtrack, since I have everything that APP has put out.

I do not recommend this to anybody, especially beginners. I disliked the instructor as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga tape, hardly useful at all","review":"The Elle Magazine yoga tape entitled \\"Elle Make Better Series: Elle Workout Yoga\\" was practically useless for a beginner. No booklet or written material of any kind comes with the tape, so there is no way to review the material. The exercizes are gone through fairly quickly, with hardly time to even see the pose, let alone get into it. I would not recommend this tape, and in fact am going to try to get a refund on it. Probably no yoga or other exercize tape should be purchased without either being able to see it before purchase (maybe from a library) or reading some recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elle Workout Yoga w/ Brooklyn Decker","review":"Visually the DVD is great. Brooklyn's partner, Tara Stiles has an amazing yoga practice. The practice itself moves much too quickly and the narrator talks way too much instead of giving short, verbal cues.

I truly am his #1 fan!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible & a waste of time and $$","review":"This book represents nothing but a bunch of mixed up stories all jumbled together> I'm sorry I wasted my $$, but even more sorry that I wasted time out of my life reading it! The author sounds like a very mixed up and confused individual. The other people writing reviews on this book were obviously paid off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I have been a huge Limited Warranty fan for years, not only because I am also from Minnesota but because their music was so good. I was friends with one of their original managers, Lisa Carr, and she got me hooked on the band. I saw them in concert many times in the 80's and I had this album back then. I have been trying for a long time to find it on CD and was thrilled to be able to listen to Limited Warranty again. I wish they would reunite and record again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing Study Of The Domestic Interior.","review":"Authentic Decor: The Domestic Interior 1620-1920, is far more than a history of the evolution of the domestic interior. Written by Peter Thorton, of the Victoria and Albert Museum, it shows first and foremost that an interior is a reflection of its owner. Everyone is well represented in its 408 richly illustrated pages, from the poor, to the middle classes, to the rich & the grand. Much valuable insight is to be gained from reading this book. I have kept it on my coffee table for years and have guarded it with my life, because people are so engrossed by it. I hope that somebody will use all of their powers of persuasion to convince Viking Penguin, Inc. to re- issue this stunning & informative book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the PSC500","review":"We have now gone through 2 of these machines. There is a communication problem with the scanner that can't be resolved no matter how many phone calls were made to tech support. It's not worth the headache it will give you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific Printer","review":"I am on my second psc500, and only because my first one was damaged by a liquid spill after using it for about 4 years. I bought a used one off of ebay to replace it as I could no longer find a new one. paid $65 for it, plus shipping, and now its been about 7 years since it was purchased. I wouldn't trade it for a new current model. I own several other hp's, including 2 psc 750s. I like them, but still prefer the psc 500. If others have had problems, it was probably a problem with their own machines compatibility. I work on computers for a living, and have seen very few problems with this particular machine. If you can still find one, don't hesitate to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy reading","review":"If you need a book thats easy to read. try Alex Harrington . She is a good writer.good story with romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorough resource of motion graphic design","review":"A nice book with an ugly cover that contains a wide variety of examples from the motion graphics industry, showcasing the work from e.g designers like Saul Bass, R/GA and Imaginary Forces. A good thing is that it also deals with webanimation and typography in a nice way, instead of just showing motion graphics from the silver screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good addition to design knowledge","review":"This is book is an addition to the motion design workflow where you can get to know how to use typography in your day-to-day work related to broadcast and motion graphics animation. It certainly has good tips if you want to improve upon the area of typography usage in animation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok if for free","review":"I saw the first Type in Motion book, and it looked pretty interesting, so I bought the Type in Motion 2 because I thought all this cool stuff has happened between the first and second book. Well, the examples aren't that exciting and the layout of the book doesn't make them more so. If you're looking for inspiration, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is missing a key component","review":"The title of this book is \\"Type in Motion,\\" but it's missing just that - type in motion. In order for this book to be really useful, it should have a DVD or CD with image files that can be reviewed. Instead there is nothing but screen grabs, which is interesting but not especially helpful.I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written, imaginative, and original novel.","review":"Here is a young writer with an enviable imagination. The post-mortem character of Dean is a peculiar and wonderful creation, and it's a fun though sometimes exasperating ride finding out what happens to him. I'm eager to see what Leebron comes up with next."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unrelenting noir tour-de-force","review":"An unflinching, searing examination of a killing - how it's committed and concealed - Out West carves its way to the heart of its characters with urgency and dark wit and in the process restores murder as a literary subject, not just a trigger for detection."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a book.","review":"While occasionally interesting, Out West suffers greatly from the fact that it never generates any real feelings or compassion/distaste towards the protagonists, by either the narrator or reader. Their relationship seems TV drama-stilted at best, and since story revolves exclusively around them, Leebron never builds momentum for what could have a been a semi-appealing story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and not well thought through.","review":"Although the book contained a certain element of suspense at the begining, the all-too-familiar flashbacks take away some of the flavor. Most of the flashbacks have nothing to do with the story at all and tend to lead the reader astray. The reader does not care about the two protagonists because there is never really a connection between them. All the scenes were briefly mentioned and its hard to tell where the characters are. None of the major cities mentioned in the book are described in great detail. Normally this would be satisfactory but the characters describe the effect their environment has on them. What environment??? Furthermore, some of the scenes are awkward and could have been omitted. The book was reminicent of 'Double Indemnity' except not well thought through. To sum it up, the story was not well thought through and therefore everything else (i.e. style, dialog, etc.) could not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly written, poorly conceived novel.","review":"One-dimensional characters. A flimsy plot that lacks the shading of true noir. Writing that is both trite and dull. While Mr. Leebron seems to have some skill, I'm afraid his writing is so mannered that even the most interesting premises fall flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time and/or money","review":"It seemed that Leebron decided to write this book with the best intentions of making it great. But something was lost in the transfer to paper. All i can say is: Better luck next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Driller has no positive aspect whatsoever","review":"I'll put it simple, it's the worst game on the face of the earth.It's also a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"An in-depth exploration of language and the mind.","review":"In this book, Frawley links Vygotsky's sociocultural theory of the mind with the computational mind in cognitive science. He presents an in-depth exploration of the development of linguistics and how it relates to the nature of the mind. He explains that we not only have a language of thought, but also a language for thought. This book is designed to challenge our beliefs on thinking, not to give easy answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The age of Elegance","review":"Is a beautiful book , I think it's .a great book about images and content, it's size is perfect to take anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare gem!","review":"Not only does this book include all the favorite Hong Kong style dim sum dishes, but it also includes step-by-step illustrations in beautiful and yet informative pen-and-ink drawings. You will use this book for every Chinese meal, so buy two, in case one of them gets tea spilt upon it."},{"rating":"1","title":"questionable security","review":"Plastic construction will provide questionable security. Hopefully will be sufficient for my small midwestern town. Expected steel construction. Also, mounting screws do not provide solid attachment, box could be easily pried from mounting post. Bought some large washers to improve the strength. Would not recommend where strong security is required."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Safety","review":"This is an excellent unit. I did some serious shopping for a locking box and this is perfect. Durable, reliable and a lot of space. I go away on business trips so often that I need the protection without having to worry about my mail. This is a tough box and a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor manufacture","review":"THE DOOR ON THE MAIL BOX DOES NOT CLOSE WITHOUT PUSHING IT CLOSED AND I HAD TO PUT A HANDLE ON IT TO PULL IT OPENIT REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF FORCE TO CLOSE IT AND OPEN DUE TO IMPROPER FIT UP OF THE DOOR INTO THE MAILBOX ITSELFTHE CONCEPT OF IT IS GOOD, THE CONSTRUCTION OF IT IS POOR"},{"rating":"1","title":"Illusion of Safety","review":"The bolt seems adequate to me, the problem is the hinge mechanism is a joke; I had to pop it into place by hand. A thief could pop this open in 1/2 second. Ironically, the mail compartment is hard to open normally, I will probably need a pry bar just to get my mail. They also only provided 3 out of 4 mounting screws. The flag mounting design is also poor, although I wont ever use it so I don't care.Update: while attempting to sand down the door so that it would be openable, it fell onto the floor. The top mail slot broke off, and is now unusable; the bottom (\\"secure\\") mail door popped off its hinges. This thing is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst customer service ever !!!!","review":"I purchased this product, hung it up ,then realized the lid didnt close therefor all my mail got wet!! I also had a difficult time using the lock! This mail box is very big so make sure you check out the measurements before you buy it. The worst of it is, I called mailguard three times, left messages and didn't get a phone call back!!! When I emailed them they denied I called them at all!!! You gotta love it when you make a purchase, ask for help from the manufactor and they lie to you saying you never called them!!!! Unbelieveable !!!! How silly and unprofessional of a response from there customer service. Need I say I returned this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap and flimsy","review":"I still can't believe I spent $90 on a piece of cheap and flimsy plastic. The mailbox is poorly designed.The problems I have with this product:1. The incoming door \\"sticks\\", so you need to pull hard.2. The storage compartment door is extremely difficult to open.You need to have long fingernails or a screwdriver handy to pop open the door. The manufacturer should attach a handle.3. There is NO reinforcement of the mounting holes. This is my biggest gripe.Due to problems stated in #1, the door pulling will eventually crack the plastic around the mount points.This is a very BAD design flaw.The manufacturer should have reinforced the mount points with steel brackets.Also, if you overtighten the mounting screws you could crack the mailbox.I plan on attaching a steel plate to reinforce the mount points.And I'll leave the incoming door open so my mailbox won't break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me!","review":"I was pretty impressed.

I found a better one else where"},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"This is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever purchased, the door will not stay shut, I had to drill holes into door and box and installed magnets, found the locking door pried open and mail gone, so had to install a steel hinge to prevent the door from being pried open at the bottom this is not a good buy find yourself a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Security Mail box is junk!","review":"The top door is very hard to open. It is so had to open that the screws that secure it to the 4x4 post will pull out of the plastic back of the mail box in no time at all. The entire top of the box flexes when the door is being opened. The locking mechanism doesn't work either. The key can be inserted and turned, but when it is locked, the key can't be removed. Not much good this way. Save your money and buy something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wet Mail","review":"This mailbox leaks so you have wet mail if it has rained or if it rains while the mail is in the box. Melting snow also presents a probem.

This is a very low maintenance product and easy to install. I beat on it with a baseball bat (not toooo hard) and no damage or even marks are evident. It is approved by the \\"Post Master General\\".The construction is not on par with the design. I purchased two units. One worked perfectly and the other has (had) problems with the mail door staying closed. The design relies on the interference of the door lip and the top of the hole it fits in to. Too much of the plastic was ground off during manufactering and the door tended to flop open. Using pliers I was able to crimp a portion of the plastic at the top of the door causing a firmer fit and now the door stays closed. This problem did not affect the security of the mail.Hard to beat for the price. I recommend the product to my friends."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],x={key:0},M={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-096be680"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/43.md","filePath":"quotesmag/43.md"}'),B={name:"quotesmag/43.md"},j=Object.assign(B,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{P as __pageData,j as default};
