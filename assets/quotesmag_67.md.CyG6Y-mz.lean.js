For this reason it is a disservice to Father Judge's memory, the Franciscans and to readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Podium for the Author","review":"Michael Ford has written a book hurriedly with a distinctively personal point of view that does not do justice to Mychal Judge. It is obvious that Mr. Ford's intent was to get the book to market and further along a media frenzied with the opportunity to \\"out\\" Father Judge after his death. We are left with snippets of a life that must have been overwhelmingly dedicated to others. There seems to be so much to investigate and develop that is left untouched in Mr. Ford's rendition.

The conjugation feature is the only thing that keeps me from tossing it in the trash bin. The vocabulary is extraordinarily limited. The huge number of translations can be explained by the fact that each verb is conjugated at least 16 different ways for each of 11 different \\"persons\\", not including the infinitive. So a single verb knocks out at least 177 of your 800,000 translations. The keys are hypersensitive, so it's far too easy to enter typos and time consuming to go back and retype.

Other reviews are right in that the materials feel pretty cheap. I decided not to use the screws that came in the box. Instead I used some expansion drywall anchors. They're holding the bike (about 20 lbs) and bike helmet nicely. I'm a bit worried that the cables supporting the full weight of my bike may not hold up to years of use. One cable is slightly longer than the other causing more weight to be on the longer cable.Yes, there are better, higher quality shelves out there, but you'll have a hard time finding one for $30.

It's also the best way to quickly reheat a slice of thin-crust pizza and have it come out crisp. Sure, the size is small but people trying to be ambitious with toaster ovens are kidding themselves. My only disappointment is that the non-stickiness of the non-stick surface seems to fade (even without being scratched).

It is so refreshing to here soloists not give in to bombastic oversinging and histrionics.The rest of the the disc's program is a mixed bag: trite, uneven music from Gounod and Wood, lovely moments from Howells and Diana Burrell's Treble Service, odd programming of Byrd's Mag from \\"Great Service\\" without the Nunc, and Finzi's Mag that doesn't stand up to his wonderful output in other works.A good addition to the series but without the overall attractiveness of some of the other volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Does Not Work!","review":"I followed the instructions to the letter...

The built in ignition is great compared to the ones that need a lighter. It heated up fast and was easy to use, although a fold out stand to rest the iron while in use would have been nice. However I less than a week after I purchased it it started giving me trouble, the butane seemed to not flow as well as it had initially and it started to develop problems lighting. Withing a few more hours of mostly attempted use (90% trying to get the thing to light and warm up hot enough, 10% actually soldering) it was on its last legs, the sound of butane even on full was faint. I disassembled it and tried to clean the jet but no luck so I'm calling this one dead.

Among other things, it suffers from two flaws. First, it does hardly mention the other minorities that used to live, more or less peacefully, in Kosovo (before NATO decided to install the KLA as its puppet regime, that is). Second and in relation to the first flaw, it occasionally falls for the propaganda-claim that in the 1990s Kosovo's inhabitants were 90% Albanian, a claim that Vickers herself flatly contradicts by saying that an estimated 400.000 Albanians (most of them from Kosovo) had left Yugoslavia already by 1993.

It earned me many a compliment from the young ladies. It's a very spicy scent. Some would consider this a \\"night\\" scent. I like the very sophisticated smell. And it was really unique. I think it was discontinued because it is very overpowering. And I doubt a lot of people could wear this scent properly, since I think it probably would've matched well with an older person's phermone. Too bad it was discontinued. I still have my bottle, but it doesn't smell the same. I've had it for over 20 years now.

This volume is notable for the character development of Adolf Kaufmann as he is torn between embracing the doctrine of Nazi cruelty versus his sympathy for the Jewish plight. While the artwork may seem somewhat 'old-school,' for those accustomed to more contemporary manga, the art still manages to be fluid while conveying a range of emotion even beneath its surface simplicity.

Included is a wonderful booklet about Bix and the music that is very helpful in enhancing enjoyment of this excellent CD. Even if the listener somehow never heard of Bix but enjoys the creative feel for these pre-1931 tunes, this CD is a must have.

It features a cast of good looking people that looks like they stepped off a soap opera or MTV. That's one thing I miss about the 80's horror films, the teens in those films looked like real people rather then Hollywood actors. Anyway, a group of friends pull a prank and someone dies. A year later they start to get messages from her. The first death was painfully stupid that it might go down as the worst death scene ever filmed that didnt involve CGI. It's cliche and not worth the time, even though the story was pretty good. The death scenes are some of the worst i've ever seen, right along side Prom Night. Overall, I do not recommend this to serious horror fans. If your some teenage girl who watches MTV alot and looking for a good scare, then this is up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"B for Bad","review":"The original April Fools Day is not classic, but it was original and had the unexpected twist.

The basic premise of a far future in which Earth has merged existentially with an alien culture is beautifully realized. The prose is strong, the pacing is as it should be, and the experience is very satisfying. However, his attempts at humor are laughable (get it), his dialog doesn't have much to do with conversation, and his characters lack the spark that would give them personality, soul.This book, the first in the series, is also the best. The second is excellent, and it's downhill from there. The last went on and on. But this novel is a must-read for lovers of serious SF/fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a classic","review":"I read this in college nearly 30 years ago and just re-read it. It's a timeless piece of fantasy that, unfortunately, languished in the shadows of Tolkien which came out just before it.

Very hard to describe. It has to be experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a shame this is out of print!","review":"Goth is back and without this great book.

Unfortunately, Martin's laconic quavering isn't suited to a relentless pillow soft procession of beddy-bye drowsers so gooey and tame they rarely flutter above a deep sigh.

When it is too hot and humid to go outside he pops it in and does Silly to Calm to get his wiggles out. I don't even have to remind him he has it, he does it all by himself. My only complaint is that one of the DVDs is slightly off, the intro is scrambled, but it doesn't affect the work-out part of the video so no big deal. I would definitely recommend this set to anyone with young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast","review":"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter and my 7 year old son because they tried yoga and loved it so I thought it would be a great dvd to take on the road so we could do it whenever we wanted. It was way too fast for them. By the time they got the move the instructor was on to the next move. This DVD is intended for 3-6 year olds.the moves Are easy enough but the pace is just too fast!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My students LOVE it!!!","review":"I teach elementary school PE class, and my students LOVE both DVDs! What a terrific and creative way to introduce yoga to young children. The DVD says ages 3-6, but even my 2nd grade students love both DVDs. The length of the DVD is perfect; it keeps their attention the entire time. Marsha is just great (very engaging), and the kids are absolutely adorable. I think that's part of the reason my 2nd grade students love it. :) Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yoga for kids","review":"My 4 year old daughter loves it.

I wouldn't call this yoga. Its just a lady doing things with kids and moving with kids. But not really yoga poses. When showing the \\"poses\\" it goes from kid to kid to instructor then to kid from kid again so fast its hard to know exactly what you are expected to do. You know those people who have too many pictures on the wall so its hard to look at any of them. Its like that with every pose. They just switch the camera from kid to kid. There is no real guide lines on how to do any of it... and the kids on the movie don't even do it right and they are there with the instructor. not the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the essence of yoga","review":"While many of the movements in the dvds are quick and/or silly, this DVD set really captures the essence of yoga. Connecting with nature and using breathing to work with our emotional states are taught in a kid friendly fashion. Also, the \\"namaste\\" song on the ABC DVD of this set is spiritual and beautiful; my two-year-old daughter sings it all the time. I find that 1/2 of the DVD is about all that she can attend to for now, but that will change with time. We do the Yoga ABC's DVD whenever we do yoga during the day because it's energizing, and we do the \\"from silly to calm\\" DVD at night. I highly recommend these DVDs for any parents who want their children to learn and grow from yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids will love this yoga series","review":"I purchased this set for my child and some friends, and they all love it. I find the instruction a little awkward, however, my daughter was able to do most moves from 3-years-old, and still likes the video. The Silly-to-Calm video has, in my opinion, a better flow that the ABC yoga video. The ABC video has many poses that seem similar, and the silly to calm is more active."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting...","review":"I actually saw this video as a recommendation when I was purchasing Hooked On Phonics for my son who is 6 and having difficulty with reading and phonics. I was on the fence due to the reviews being so mixed so I decided to check it out from my local library, I'm glad I did because it was not as I expected. I think this video is geared towards smaller children learning the alphabet rather then elementary school children learning phonics or to read. Both my children had fun with the video, but when asked if I should buy it after we need to return it I received a resounding no from both, and as I said I was looking for something to help me more with phonics then just the alphabet."},{"rating":"1","title":"edu-science land and sky telescope","review":"this toy is hard to operate, hard to see through, I should of bought a more expensive one to get better quality"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album that is fun and has lots of variety","review":"This album is my first Audio Adrenaline album.

You can literally read this book in one sitting. I have read Madame Guyon's spiritual torrents and Short Method of Prayer. They are a lot better than this. Mainly because I think this book was revised and isn't in her own speech and use of language. It is modernized. I didn't like that. Her own language carries with it her spirit and with her spirit her spiritual life and with her spiritual life her relationship with God. In her other books you can feel the closeness to God.

The first section covers introductory stuff everyone should know (with lots of typos like botching math sum notation for the definition of the dot product and stating \\"if the dot product is zero, the vectors are parallel\\"). The next section covers standard shading equations for raytracers. After that it's very basic \\"hello world\\" shader and dx programming followed by filler for various shader tools out there. Then we get to a few basic examples of vertex shaders and 3 intermediate examples of pixel shaders (toon shading, bump mapping, and fresnel) written all written in assembly!! Then the rest of the book is all filler material for the assembly instructions for the old style vertex/pixel shaders. Oh, in case anyone is wondering, this is pretty much a DX 8.1 only book with examples from 1.0 to 1.4 level shaders."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good shader intro book","review":"I picked up some of the other book on shaders for DX and it turned out to be a cookie cutter book. There was little explanation on what the shaders were DOING - just source code. I found that frustrating. This book gois into much more explanation of what a shader does and how you program them, so its good for someone leaning how to program shaders. The other book and the new Cg book are more if youre looking for cut and paste. This book did not cover hlsl since hlsl wasnt finished when the book was, but, oddly enough, it does talk about using DX9 and about the DX9 low level language.If you already know shaders or just want source code then look at the other books. This could have had more examples. It did have a big section on the mathematics of light which I found interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to DirectX shaders","review":"If you know very little about DirectX 8 or 9 shader programming this book is an excellent introduction. It is low level assembly only, no Cg or HLSL, but in my opinion you need to know the assembly programming to ensure the best performance of your shaders. The introductory material is good, covering basic things you should know, ambient, diffuse, specular, and Fresnel equations. The second section builds working shaders implementing these basic concepts. The third section is a shader assembler reference. IMO this book is well written and an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first half of this book was on basic computer graphics. The second half wasn't much more than a rewrite of Microsofts DirectX documentation. There were only a few pages of shader techniques that I found useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the content?","review":"Although some of the content is interesting, if feels like it lacks organization and structure. In addition, half the book is a shader reference which seems to almost be ripped from the Microsoft DirectX documentation"},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Forward and Concise","review":"Unlike the other reviewers I was looking for a very short and concise book on Tai Chi sword. This book fits the bill perfectly. Gives very good high level overview of the aspects of Tai Chi sword, but the majority of the book is the sword form in step-by-step pictures that are done very well with directional arrows. I use it with a Tai Chi sword DVD and it makes a good complement to my training and study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Standard","review":"This book offers little more than a look at the common Yang Style Taiji (Tai Chi) sword & is little more than that. It is the kind of book which would have been acceptable years ago but pales in comparison to Rodell's, \\"Chinese Swordsmanhip - The Yang Family Tradition,\\" which covers two Yang Taiji forms in greater detail or in comparison to Zhang's, \\"The Art of Chinese Swordsmanship,\\" which covers Wu Style Taiji Sword. Kobayashi's book states there are no applications for certain movements that Rodell's & Yang Jwing-ming's books give clear applications for.

This is a well written and organized book that gives valuable insights into the history, development and practise of Tai Chi Sword. It answered a lot of questions I had in how the various teachers and styles relate to each other and provided a complete explanation of the relationship between Wu Tang Sword and Tai Chi Sword. The addition of graphics for foot positions, hip positions and sword position are very clever and useful. In addition, directional curves and lines are drawn over the photographs to depict transitions and movements.As I practise and study tai chi sword I have purchased several books on the subject and done extensive internet reading. This is so far my favorite book/resource on the subject. Buy it and decide for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very thin...","review":"I have to agree with the previous review, this book offers very little. Many of the \\"Chapters\\" are little more than a few paragraphs.

A book, which might have been acceptable 30 years ago. It seems the 2 authors have not evolved since they first brought Taiji (ZMQ-Version, 37 step) to Germany. Their writings and teachings aren't up to modern standards, like nothing was learned in all those years.

The image is so small that you can't read the credits & if you're hard of seeing you might want binoculars to read the subtitles, half of which cover the image and half in the windowboxing (with so much windowboxing, the least they could have done was to put all the subtitles in the black border.)

The water was starting to smell and when I retrieved the feeding block out of the tank, it absolutely reeked! All of my poor fish were very pale and barely swimming and it took a long time to coax them into eating the normal fish food. It took about two days for them to recover and act normal.

(A previous set of plastic tumblers that these were purchased to replace took a decade to reach this level of deteriorization.)

From original guitar scheme's, to breath-taking vocals and harmonies, to the most tight, together rythym known to man. These 5 Idaho, Kenya produced musicians have taken modern rock/worship to a whole new level.

As stated by all the other reviewers....they did not come with the customary crumbs for the top of the casseroles. And the flavor was so bland and mild as to not have any at all. After trying two flavor packages from two boxes of Tuna Helper in one casserole to no avail, I ended up having to add a can of creamed soup to give the noodles flavor beyond the strong tuna taste. Of course that just added salt injury onto salt injury!! Either Betty Crocker has changed their box contents and their flavor packets or these cases from Amazon are the 'irregulars'. I will not be buying this product again....they are truly awful! You can buy the noodles alone for a whole lot less if you need to add other products just to make it tasty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed/false advertising","review":"I was greatly disappointed in this product when I received it.

And I've got a picky taste. It's got all the nessecary elements of a great tune such as an appealing melody, swinging bass groove. \\"Blue\\"s beautiful, and screw the fact that it's commercial dance tune, or whatever, but it's a great song, and one of the very few today that actually deserved to become number 1 across many nations.

No wonder \\"he ain't go no one to listen!\\" Then we get to the chorus. What the devil is he saying? I can't tell, due to the heavy use of the vocoder, a disturbing trend in recent pop that seems to think obscuring vocals with an ancient cheesy technology is a good idea. Then we come to the.. er... verse, which consists of a guy sounding like he thinks he's cool in 1983 talking, not singing, about basically nothing. Horrid.

By the time it ends it has expressed little and accomplished nothing. Chief among its features is the use of the vocoder, a machine first heard by most people in the seventies that distorts vocals; it has been recently used by Cher and others. Simply put, vocoder effects were cheesy in the seventies, and they are still now. I hope this trend will soon pass, like the too-much-echo and saxophone solo fad of the mid eighties, or the harmonica solos of the mid nineties.

The car seat ended up with the car seat handle hanging over the bike seat. For about 5 cents more of metal it would have fit. Also, the bolts were of poor quality and stripped when installing so I am buying new bolts already. I will spend more on 'rigging' this car seat so it works than what it would have cost to buy a nice one from a real bike store and not a cheap mass retail importer. I think it will be safe once I modify it all.

I ordered the Topeak Babysitter afterwards. When it arrived, I removed the Bell seat and threw it in the trash. I wasn't even comfortable giving it to someone else.The Topeak Babysitter rack attaches sensibly to the frame, the seat attaches securely to the rack, and the seat is rigid - not flimsy at all.Do your kid a favor and spend a little money up front.

It took a little coaxing but I installed the seat in about an hour and it looks great on the bike. The bike was expensive and I didn't want to bugger the nice paint job up, but the protective plastic frame guards that are included seem to protect the paint. My local bike shops said that no seat would fit the Electra Townie, even seats costing more than twice the price of this one. I wasn't giving up until I had at least tried to install one myself and I'm glad I did. The plastic seat is a little flexible but the rack it's mounted on is very secure. The three bolts that secure the seat onto the rack seem sufficient. There is a teather strap for peace of mind.

Have not read a review claiming the seat broke or snapped as some of the negative reviews seem to be concerned with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"My husband and I purchased this 2 days ago and are returning it today. It took him 2 hours to install and the plastic is cheap and flimsy. We were afraid to put our son in it but decided to go for a very short ride down the street. After 5 minutes in the seat he was in a reclining position almost touching the back tire. The seat itself was comfortable for him but it bends and moves around too easily. I would not recommend buying this product...spend some more $ for a more safe and reliable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dangerous","review":"I just bought this product so I could ride around the neighborhood with my daughter. The first few trial runs wre great, and she loved being in the seat. But the 3rd time out we took a different route that had a few gentle speed bumps for cars. When I was almost home I felt the weight in back of me shift, and my daughter and the seat fell into me. ALL FOUR bolts holding the seat in place had come off during our ride. Had she fell backwards instead of forwards she would have fallen onto the pavement in the middle of the road we were crossing. I do not recommend this seat at all and am taking it back to the store where I bought it as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and unsafe","review":"This seat is flimsy thin plastic w/ holes in sides to allow child hands to hang out, the frame the seat mounts to is flimsy plastic that allows to much movement of assembly. My 2 yr old was scared the whole time and we never went on a ride with it. That was just sitting in the driveway. She has riden in other brands and enjoyed it. You may think the flexibilty of the plastic is fine but eventually the plastic will fatige and crack. The wobblyness allows for childs center of gravity to keep changing from side to side and contributes to the bike being unstable. I whole heartedly agree with others who have decided not to use this brand.

For my other Copilot seat, there are only 4 points to secured with bike, plus one belt to fasten to seat pole. It seems not a good design to me. However, Copilot does provide me an advantage that I can remove car seat easily which Bell does not.I suggest Bell can write its manual more friendly. Or, at least, assembly the rack in factory, then customers just secure it to bike.

The price, while secondary in my decision to buy, made this a bargain.I now wish I had spent a little more for something that I'd feel safe transporting my child in.

But with a little resourcefulness it worked out. My daughter is 19.4lbs (14 1/2 months old) and even after not riding a bike for over 10 years, the bike was easy to handle with her on. She loves it! She used the handlebar in front the entire time. It is very lightweight and flexible (at first was apprehensive)BUT VERY STURDY!

After only one ride around the block, I was amazed this seat passes any safety standards. Although attached securely to the bike, the plastic \\"coccoon\\" itself feels very flimsy and allowed alot of side-to-side sway while I was riding and daughter was looking around; I was constantly worried the whole thing was about the crack and break off. I was also really worried about her spine as every small bump resulted in major jolting for her (granted, Bell certainly doesn't claim to have any shock absorbers on this seat).

I have an old carbon weird frame mt bike and I was able to adjust the arms to fit. So the adjustments are limitless.

The allen bolts that tighten the poles stripped on the first tightening, the poles were not flush at the joints giving the whole stand a lopsided look. Following the instructions, I positioned the stand against the wall and put my first bike (the heavier one, 23lbs) on the hooks. Ok, no problem here. Added the second bike - the 16lb machine - to the upper hooks, and the whole stand started to fall away from the wall. Took both bikes down, rechecked the instructions, made a couple of minor positioning adjustments and rehung the bikes. Same result. The only way I could prevent this stand from toppling over was to use the top hooks for just a 4lb frame.A most unsatisfactory product and an excellent advertisement for buying a more expensive, stable storage system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The tubes which extend off the body of the rack have less than three or four threads to secure the 6mm bolts.

Sophie's life is summarized rather than fully shown. The epilogue does not match the prologue or even the rest of the novel. I found this book really slow and uninteresting.

The history of each haunted area, the possible candidate that became a ghost and the relevant incident(s) leading to his/her death or murder are portrayed very well. Interviews with individuals who have seen or experienced the presence of the ghosts, and descriptions by authors who have written books on the Chicago ghosts are remarkable.The portrayal of Bachelor's Grove Cemetery is the spookiest. St James Cemetery is also very spooky.The only drawback is that some of the major ghosts of Chicago are omitted.

When I discovered that many of the situations in Freaks and Geeks were based on Feig's life experiences, I wanted to read this book.While he mentioned a few things that conjure memories of the show, this book is overall racier, filled with sex anecdotes (most of which involve self-love). His sense of humor permeates the stories, and his penchant for self-humiliation knows no bounds. He even offers transcripts of some of his diaries and comments on them.I really enjoyed the honesty of this books, and it gave me a lot of laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plasimo 300 Ft Line with 15 1/4inch Chain","review":"Plasimo lines are some of the best.

The book is not complicated to read in one sitting (15 - 20 minutes). You will gain a lot of information if you are just beginning to explore this subject. I wished that the author had expounded more on research information like liens and other encumbrances and how these can potentially affect the bidder.I originally borrowed this book from the library.

They are sung by a huge mixed choir, which gives the pieces a tremendous power.The rendition is first-rate and deeply moving.Unfortunately, the clarity of the recording leaves much to be desired. I have played this cd on several hi-fi players and the result has always been disappointing. The sound is muffled, muddy, it does not come out with full force and clarity.I recommend the \\"Best of the Renaissance\\" by the Tallis Scholars if you want to listen to a crystal-clear Spem in Alium and to \\"Lamenta\\" performed by Philip Cave et al for the Lamentations of Jeremiah."},{"rating":"2","title":"divine","review":"The rendition of \\"O Nata Lux\\" is exquisite.

The Tallis Scholars' performance, initially more spectacular thanks to its brighter acoustic and the more virtuosic pre-eminence of the trebles, for me finally loses more of harmonic complexity than it gains in intensity. The accent on the treble part overwhelms the majestic interweaving of harmonies, which this recording displays to awesome effect. To me, the Tallis Scholars' Spem is like a spectacular display of fireworks, while The Sixteen's is ocean waves crashing against cliffs.

Why can't they get that recipe? Also, they are sickly sweet. They need to lay off on the sugar. Plus, no ingredients listed, so God only know what's in these things.

Once, I ordered 2 cartons. I received instead one carton of 24 plus 1 single stick. Later, I ordered 1 carton of 24, but received only 1 single stick.

The original Space Food Sticks were far more chewy (harder, just a little softer than a Tootsie Roll) and had a nice subtle chocolate taste.

Each new bar packs a walloping 210 calories with 80 calories coming from fat. Think about that. Eating one new bar is like eating 5 original bars.

The quality of the picture is horrible and it jumps around on the screen to the point that it makes you feel dizzy. It simply shows a fake family having a fake Thanksgiving dinner. You never hear any sound from the dinner - only a narrator reminding the viewer that it is important not to make noise when eating your soup. These are not original candid home movies. The second one is also centered around a family and is partially narrated with the actors speaking breifly. The acting is horrible, the lines are corny and the actors are stiff. The second feature suddenly cuts off mid sentence while the father is talking to the viewer.

With some better design, there would have been some contact between the different pieces, making the unit much more solid as a whole. No problems yet, but for the cost I want a solid unit, something that feels sturdy. I mean, if you put 4 nice bikes on it, you want the unit to be bombproof.

But that doesn't matter if it can't stand up to a little use."},{"rating":"1","title":"drive belt broke third time I used it","review":"This is a decent-looking sander, but the drive belt between the motor and the belt broke after less than an hour of use. I removed the belt and saw that it's about 1/4\\" wide and about 1/16\\" thick, and is reinforced only by a few cloth strands. I called Makita at their customer service number and was politely told that I could take the sander 25 miles from my zip code to their nearest service center for warranty repair, or they would sell me a new belt for $3.30 plus $6.95 shipping and handling. Shipping for this 10-gram belt should be under $2; I think that handling charges should not be applied to warranty repairs. I ordered two belts for a total of $14 since I don't anticipate the next one lasting very long either, and I will think carefully before buying another Makita tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Juice","review":"Dear Karen Hesse,Just Juice was a great book!It also taught me 3 lessons!You should try this book to have a fun time reading books.Sincerely,Emily Cheung"},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming book","review":"Just Juice is a charming book which tells the tale of a family who faced with challanges including loosing their house in a tax sale, and a child with learning disablities, is able to triumph and survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little no nonsense self teaching book","review":"This book cuts straight to the chase without being too wordy. It shows you visually how rhythmic things work, and gives you easy to understand exercises to reinforce the concept. Make sure to read the \\"How to Use This Book\\" page at the beginning. It covers bare basics from duration of all of the note and rest notations, bar lines, and meters. It then goes up to dividing beats into every number up to 16, changing meters on the fly, and polyrythms. It also illustrates how to conduct each exercise. An instrument is not necessary for these exercises and is actually best used with humming and tapping.

The first device was defective, and the company quickly replaced it. For that, I gave credit to its customer service. The new device works, but the performance is not great. I made phone calls via the device, the listeners complained my voice was too low, especially when driving on free ways. The FM channel has unpredictable static noise while driving here and there. Now I decide to return it. I guess it is the universal problem for all FM-bluetooth devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfect, once you get the right phone","review":"I got one of these FM transmitters only to find out my phone didn't have A2DP, so no music. No problem, I needed a new phone anyway. So then I made the mistake of getting an LG Shine. One of the other reviewers complained about \\"FM\\" audio quality, and I can tell you why. The \\"Shine\\" connects as a MONO headset first, which sounds terrible, and won't connect as A2DP until you disconnect and reconnect the bluetooth. I got tired of doing that every time I got in the car.So I returned the problematic LG and got Sony W580i.Works great every time.Sounds great too.My suggestion is contact Satechi sales and make sure you have a phone that works well with this device before you buy. Satechi: you might consider making a list of phones that work well, and ones that don't.

Sound quality is very good and the FM Transmitter is the best I've ever used - and I've tried many. Only downside is that it does not have an on/off switch; so you have to unplug the unit to cut the power if you vehicle does not have a switched power outlet. This is a minor inconvenience. One thing to note is that, when using this unit with an Iphone, be sure to turn off WiFi on your Iphone or you may experience interrupted connectivity. That's because Bluetooth and WiFi interfere with one another. This may be caused by the shared antenna on the Iphone. Iphones are infamous for problems with Bluetooth. I would recommend the Satechi unit to anyone looking for a good hands-free solution and a way to listen to music in their vehicle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as promised unlike many others","review":"Before finding the Satechi Bluetooth FM Transmitter, I tried another highly touted brand-name FM transmitter for my iPhone, but it was a dismal failure.

That is just what a quality, well designed product ought to do. If only I could get some more volume--the loudness control needs to be punched up nearly to maximum most of the time--I would give it a perfect rating.

It took me awhile to find a good radio station in my area to tune to, but now that I've found one, I never have to change it. I bought this unit mainly for handsfree calling using my iPhone 4 through my radio speakers. Everyone I speak with says they can hear me very clearly and I can hear them as well. It's also super easy to connect via blue tooth - if I can figure it out, anyone can. When I'm listening to music through itunes on my phone and a call comes in, the music will pause, will allow me to take the call, and then resume my music when the the call is done. The only downsize, and it's small, is sometimes when I connect my iphone to the charger through the transmitter, I get some feedback which can be heard in the back ground when listening to music.

Voice acting is bad even for a survival horror game. And speaking of the genre, what is this game? Its a tangled mess of different types. Gameplay is dull with an RPGish atmosphere losing all of its formers survival horror. Graphics arent too good on the eyes either.

I had a lot of trouble trying to get the screws to hold - they needed to be deep enough that the thread of the screw held the plate, but not deep enough that the end of the screw dragged against the other plate. This was easier said than done, because the threads on self tapping screws (even the short ones) don't start at the end of the screw.

I'm not a fan of this type of puzzle, but I do like the picture. All the pieces are like an Impressionist painting. Up close, most of the pieces look like a blur of color with very little, if any, detail. But once all the pieces are put together and you stand back, you can see what the picture is. I spent hours starring at it and probably only fitted five pieces. There were only one or two pieces that I saw that could have been cut finer. I had fun, but if I can help it, I will avoid buying this kind of puzzle in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun challenging puzzle","review":"We found this puzzle challenging and fun to do.

Not much else to say about it. Pantomime makes it a worthy purchase for a fan alone, but when you throw in two of Incubus' best live (and studio) songs, Pardon Me and A Certain Shade Of Green, that deal gets even sweeter. Talk Shows On Mute was never my favorite track by Incubus but it's performed to perfection here, so I dunno, maybe I was wrong about it. So yeah, if you're looking to round out your live Incubus bootleg collection look no further.

I had already read several reveiws and it was just as I expected and a little more. It follows the original \\"Ring\\" tale with a twist. My grandson had never seen the original Ring movies which I realized needed to be explained a little to help him understand what he was watching. This is not for younger children, (even though the silly songs are typically silly songs) the story is a little deeper. I had to explain a little about the theme behind this version. The idea that a special gift needs to be used to help others was part of this video but it required a little more explanation.

I highly recommend it. As far as The Gospel According to Jesus, I was impressed with his exegesis. I believe that he is right on. Christians ought to understand that they have been provided a gift, and the idea of sanctification is not just an option but imperative. Certainly we cannot earn the grace of God, but neither do we prove God's grace by sinning like hell. This is the message MacArthur effectively communicates in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful Defense of the Biblical Gospel","review":"My wise pastor once told me, \\"When two people take diametrically opposite, incompatible positions on a subject, one of them is right and the other is wrong, or they are both wrong, but they cannot both be right.\\" John MacArthur's view of the Gospel is diametically opposite and incompatible with the gospel of Charles Ryrie, Zane Hodges, et. al. When it comes to the subject of salvation, one had better figure out who or what is right, since his or her eternal destiny is at stake.John MacArthur Jr. masterfully expounds and defends the Gospel of Jesus Christ (as revealed in the Gospels), the Gospel proclaimed by the Apostles, the Gospel of the Bible.If you've read or are considering reading a book by those of the so called \\"free grace\\" position, you owe it to yourself to read this book.Then read the New Testament and decide for yourself which \\"gospel\\" is the true, biblical Gospel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving Ryrie a fair read.","review":"MacArthur quotes Ryrie's So Great Salvation but after reading The Gospel According to the Apostles I am not so sure he did read it. Ryrie tackles some \\"straw man\\" issues in his book So Great Salvation which MacArthur seems to ignore that chapter. It seems MacArthur is so blinded by his own position he can't appreciate the position of Ryrie.He quotes Ryrie's SGS but when he writes in chapters 2 and 3 of his TGATTA he didn't read the early chapters of SGS. Seems MacArthur only wants to quote Ryrie when it will give him a better presentation of his position. In short, I think it distorts Ryrie's point and creates a straw man."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!","review":"THE BEST!As with Dr. Macarthur's books, The Truth War, Fools Gold, Think Biblically, \\"Hard to Believe\\", \\"Charismatic Chaos\\" and \\"Twelve Ordinary Men\\", etc., this is EXCELLENT!

What this book brought was the colour that animated objects and actions- a look into the lives that produced the artifacts.

There was no description for this book, so I wasn't sure what it was like. I was looking for something for her to record special events, thoughts and feelings, pictures, doctor appointments, etc. This book is definitely a 'journal'. It has three sections - one for each trimester - with plenty of lined pages, but no specially designated places for specific information. It's just a spiral-bound, hardcover 'notebook' designed to keep a diary during your pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unreadable...","review":"This book displays some of the worst writing I've seen since editing my elementary school newsletter. I can't believe this thing made it through an editor. Bad grammar, twisted logic, and non-sequiters abound, and I didn't even make it to page 50.

The reader's mining of such information from this book is tedious, laborious and minimally productive. The text is full of fits and starts, restarts and redundancies, and so many non sequiturs that it approaches comedic proportions. I kept reading in hopes of finding something worthwhile or substantive, with little actual result. I kept wanting to throw the book across the room in frustration. Don't study it and hope to retain your sanity for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction, not fact","review":"For all of Dr. Goodrich's energetic prose, she understands neither the medieval Arthurian Grail tradition nor the variant forms of the Grail tradition as they existed in medieval culture. Judging by the visual arts, a form of the Grail history was known possibly as early as 200 C.E. with the tradition exploding in popularity during the Middle Ages. Variant Arthurian tales (most of which bring the Grail to Europe in the time of Joseph of Arimathea, the first century C.E.) can be accounted for by historical impact from the Sanct Sang traditions, by legends of sacred treasure, and by folk traditions, some of which still flourish today. The Grail story is Continental in origin and transmits to the British Isles well after the dates it appears in the Rhine region, Brittany, and southern France. Dr. Goodrich weaves an eminently believable fantasy that she misrepresents as historical fact and that is doing her readers a grave disservice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did throw it across the room...","review":"One of the reviewers said they waded 50 pages into this swamp before they gave up.

And the best of the best are the two stories narrated by Jack Nicholson (this one and THE ELEPHANT's CHILD). Nicholson's wry, sardonic voice, the imaginative drawings, and Bobby McPheron's strange, otherworldly vocals give an exotic and magical feel to these two stories. For those who aren't familiar with Rudyard Kipling's \\"Just So Stories,\\" the two fables are about what happens, \\"back when the world was new and all,\\" to two animals who are rude, unpleasant, and lazy. For those who aren't familiar with the Rabbit Ears line, these videos and tapes, which are appropriate for kids of about four and up, are storytelling at its best.

The highlight might be the finale, \\"I Gotta Know,\\" which Jackson did herself so many years back.

The inside has a mini dressing room with curtains, and a mirror, there is a door that opens and closes, and a window and two other big openings on the side for going in and out of.

It has really held up well (they're in it almost every day), especially for the price! I did leave the door off so they'd have more open spaces. The mirror is distorted, but it's safe and they love seeing their reflections in it. Assembly couldn't be easier-it was worth the money the first week they had it.

The bottom of the window (where the netting is located) tore right away after several play dates. All in all, I wish I would have gone for a more expensive playhut.

I tried to fix it but it had over 15 screws inside and out and I had trouble looking getting inside it to see where the loose connection was. The third toaster just quit working after six months.

Fresh insight, or new information, or more detail backing his theories would be the least I expect from this author. None of these things were present.

It was so terrible, so embarrassing, I had to stop listening.I think a much better interpretation of the Vitali is the one by Oistrakh, but sadly it is with piano accompaniment while Chang's is with orchestra - one that performs superbly...

The chances that you get a job are 1 out of 10. All the other jobs go to robots. Lisse and her friends try to make the best out of life until a strange letter appears from 'The Game'.They are told that at the places to which they are sent they are to look for clues and if they win they will be given their hearts' desire. (If I sound confusing I am trying to make it sound as simple as possible for such a complex science-fiction novel.)Soon though even when they are back home, in their assigned designated area (DA), their lives circulate around The Game. They get in shape for The Game. They read at the library for The Game. Sound boring? It isn't, you devour it and beg for more. The ending leaves you dangling on a hook, and that's the worst thing about 'Invitation to the Game' by Monica Hughes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is extremely unrealistic.","review":"I would have given this book 4 and a half stars if the content was more believable. Most of the time, Lisse and the other nine people who made up her close-knit group of friends were acting way too maturely for their age catergory. For example, when they ended up on Prize (their final resting place), they built a loom! How many people who are 16 can build a loom? And what about when they wanted to build a log cabin? How the hell did they learn how to build a log cabin? It's not exactly common knowledge.All of the above are reasons why I give this book only 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Disturbing look at a possible future","review":"This book really puts your mind into motion when you realize what the heck is going on. You realize that this book has a lot more to offer than a story about a VR game, much more in fact. The book can get a bit disturbing as to how the future lives might live. But when you get through the book, you see just how deep this book gets and how you might even be in this situation. For most readers, this might be a good start into a nice reading career or a nice book to just sit down and read. It is always enjoyable to read and it can easily be picked up, even for younger kids. I suggest this book highly to anyone who likes Science Fiction, or a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, then worse...the story when books are dumbed down","review":"This book is so pathetically bad.

WHY, you might ask? BECAUSE, this book is so lame. It is dumbed down to a seemingly \\"teenage\\" level, and the ending is worse. Everybody finds love and gets pregnant. Gross.

The bottom of the tumblers are concave, holding pools of water too deep to dry in the dishwasher.

Also, the pattern seems printed on the outside of the glass, bumping against other items in the top rack of the dishwasher has caused scrapes that damaged the pattern after ONLY 2 or 3 washings.I've never had an acrylic cup perform this poorly in such a short time. Surprised and disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not put in dishwasher...","review":"I liked the idea of having matching glass to go with my dishes that were acrylic because of kids.

I've been picking up more and more of these \\"Comp CDs\\"-- collections where every song is by a different band. And I've had a wonderful time discovering so many bands I might otherwise never have heard of (what a cool marketing gimmick). Some, like THE BOSS MARTIANS and THE AQUA VELVETS have impressed me to no end! Of them all, this has become my favorite collection.

As thick as a major metropolitan phonebook, nearly every possible food is listed with a brief description, history, simple preparation instructions, and the occasional recipe. Obviously, the contents have a French cuisine slant, but the majority of the alphabetical entries are global in origin. For example, persimmons and pumpkins have long entries, even though they are New World fruits. This book works best if you have an ingredient or technique in mind, and then research what to do with it.

Well worth the money, and no experimenter should be without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than no book, but in dire need of revision","review":"This book is a better guide to fish identification than to fishing methods. Still, identifying certain fish is a challenge due to mismatched descriptions and illustrations. Under the Mediterranean spearfish, you find the right description but a photo of a gar. Under Atlantic sailfish, you find a photo of a juvenile fish recognizable only to marine biologists. Or try identifying a wahoo from the dim and distant silhouette provided. Discussions and illustrations of tackle are also full of errors: a flying gaff is pictured without its quick-release handle, and outriggers are described as \\"often fitted but seldom used,\\" whereas the photo on p. 58 shows outriggers in use but describes them as \\"rod-holders directed outward.\\" Better than no book at all, but in dire need of revision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide book","review":"We finally had a chance to experience saltwater fishing (and scuba diving!), and bought this to read about the differences between fresh and saltwater fish, and fishing.

Thrown out of his old mob, Robinson joins a monastery (!) to plot his next move. Offbeat, funny and improbable, BROTHER ORCHID is practically an outright spoof of thirties gangster flicks with Robinson broadly giving a caricature of himself as the title role (so named because he finds himself adept at raising orchids while hiding out at the secluded monastery; the name stuck after being affectionately named it by the fellow monks). Ann Sothern turns in a delightful performance as Eddie's ever-faithful floozy blonde girlfriend."},{"rating":"1","title":"God 1 Mammon 0","review":"This is aN excellent movie for those well acquainted with Holywood's pre-1960's 'moral stance.' It may at face value seem a little improbable that a gangster would seek refuge in a monastry but even post-World War II this seeming improbability of church sancity is based on solid fact [Nazis hidden in European monastries].

What makes this album special are three previously unreleased live recordings from 1989: Two solo pieces (\\"What Child Is This\\" and \\"Variations on a Theme from Pachelbel's Canon in D Major\\") and the ensemble recording of \\"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,\\" featuring Eric Tingstad (guitar), Nancy Rumble (oboe) and David Arkenstone (synth).

It isn't Classical music (it just plunders some of it in a very dull and unimaginative way) and it is vastly too pretentious to be good Pop/Rock music. The performer is really only selling herself and her looks in a highly dubious way. Vanessa Mae's jejune career is all about marketing and selling herself as a consumer product - need I comment of the value of this? She certainly hasn't contributed one iota to the world of music.It is hard to imagine what sort of musical future Vanessa Mae envisages for herself, when fashions in Pop/Rock music change and her fans get bored or grow up, where will she go?If you're looking for Vanessa Mae albums, I suggest the nearest jumble sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"I've listened to this CD 3 times today, & this is what I have to say: John Tesh + Andre Rieu = Vanessa-Mae.Put another way: Crap with a beat.Great looking babe, though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow, great condition","review":"arrived in a timley mannor .Great product, and I will porder from here for the holidays as well.thanks, brandy idaho"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great combination of classical and modern fussion!","review":"This CD is very eclectic and exciting!

But not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karajan at his best though unsatisfactory","review":"I can't understand why this is included in EMI's Greatest Recordings. Karajan is better here with Philharmonia under Walter Legge's direction than his DG days with Berliner Philharmoniker but he tends to run too fast and it is really bothering. Singers are doing well... especially Erich Kunz as Figaro, Sena Jurinac as Cherubino and Seefrid as Susanna are excellent. Elisabeth Schwartzkopf is very mature and graceful but still Lisa della Casa is more noble and shining as Countess in Kleiber recording. George London as Count Almaviva is not very sophisticated and a bit coarse. Tenor singer as Basilio/Don Kurzio is too lyrical for the comic character. Ensembles are not superb.To sum up, I don't agree to those Karajan manias who insist this is a must-have for Figaro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Recordings Of The Century - Mozart: Le Nozze Di Figaro / Karajan, London, Schwarzkopf, Seefried, et al","review":"Great Recordings Of The Century - Mozart: Le Nozze Di Figaro / Karajan, London, Schwarzkopf, Seefried, et al is a recording being led by the one and only Herbert Von Karajan whom leads the Winener Philharmoniker on this EMI recording from 1952. We also get to hear the amazing Chor der Wiener Staatsoper. Richard Osborne has written great linernotes when the recording was re-released on cd in 1999. The text also is in French and German. The lyrics come in Italian, French, German and English. We also get great photographs of Von Karajan and the performers from the time of the performance. The mix of the genius of Mozart with the equal genius of that of Von Karajan makes this one of the best recordings of Le nozze di Figaro that I have heard so far. 5/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a misnomer!","review":"This version is ruined by Karajan's driving conducting, which ends up with garbled passages and lack of coherence. Despite the interesting account of Susanna by Seefried, this one is not worth having -- Schwarzkopf's Countess, though different, is to my ear no better than her later one with Guilini, and that one is magnificently paced.

Furthermore, Boyer seems to only value 5 characteristics of a college that a student should look for; nevermind that every student in every major will not need every one of these characteristics in a college.

I'm a pneumatic tool newbie, so I can't compare with other siding nailers, but I'm pretty well satisfied. Adjustments are easy, weight is light, nice belt hook for getting it out of the way when I'm on a ladder, easy loading, etc. My one complaint is that it occasionally fails to recycle after driving a nail. A pneumatic nailer works in two steps, driving the nail, and recycling (with air exhalation). When if fails to recycle, I either have to wait--it may recycle spontaneously after a few seconds--or wait even longer--the residual air eventually leaks out and it can operate again--or else unhook the air hose from the tool and reattach. The last method is the quickest solution, but also somewhat dangerous, since the tool often spits out a nail when I reattach the hose, so I have to be mindful of which direction it's pointing. Nail-driving operation itself is great, I just wish it didn't have the recycling uncertainty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool","review":"Have owned this gun for a few years and it always produces on the job.

Elementary kinematics. Something often taught at the first year undergraduate level. But the book goes far further into its specialised need than you are likely to see in a physics text. Many computer games that rely on real time feedback need fast ways to see if two or three dimensional objects collide. Because then, some involved interaction must occur.In essence, the book deals with simulations of moving bodies, where you time step Newton's equations. Much of the book becomes an excursion into linear algebra, as we seek to find if various geometric objects intersect. There are important special cases, like when a moving sphere hits another sphere.The numerical computations, or, more specifically, the efficiency with which they can be found, is also important and discussed.Many other topics are also studied.

Parrish's first book, \\"Dark of the Moon.\\" With some authors it is difficult to follow a best seller with another one. No problem for P. J. Parrish. Dead of Winter continues the story of Louis Kincaid, a man who (although he has a strong academic backgound and other career choices) wants to continue his career in law enforcement as a cop. Go figure! Nevertheless, he brings to the job a deep sense of honor and integrity in the failed hope of finding those same traits amoung his fellow officers. Coupled with his mixed heritage, Kincaid quickly gets our support to keep trying and not give up on society or himself. Well, this is one Louis Kincaid fan who has no intention of giving up on the fictional character or the excellent writer, P. J. Parrish."},{"rating":"2","title":"P.J.

It isn't a good biography (precious little is said about Roush's post-1919 career), and its Black Sox material is a disorganized non-story. I give it two stars for providing some basic material about Roush's early days in professional baseball, but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book and a fun read!","review":"This is a great book! It is the type of book that will engage a high school, or even a junior high school, student (adults find it fascinating, too). The best part of the book is that it gives you a different perspective on the scandal. It is an excellent opportunity for teachers who want to demonstrate that there is more than one perpective for a particular event (and more than one way to describe it). It is told by a relative of Edd Roush and does not masquerade as formal historical analysis. In fact, it is what it says it is, and readers who try it will be both entertained and educated."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ironic parody of ideological politics in a SF world","review":"Vance ventures in the world of politics in The Grey Prince with an ironic tale where the oppressed are found to be oppressors and the self-righteous prove to follow disguised self-interest of grandeur and fame. Curiously, this time the main Vancian character is introduced as somewhat of a villain, the storytelling evolving to show his true side as well as his \\"noble\\" rivals - whose true face is not as noble as it appears. The ending, as always, shows an admirable ironic witt.An intelligent, educated critic at how real world politics can degenetate between natives and colonials, with a keen reminder that \\"abstract\\" interest groups rarely defend their members' grassroots views.Interesting for the student of politics as for the SF fan looking for inspiring social dynamics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hammond B3 heaven!!!","review":"I just got this CD set!!!

This is the real deal: just organ, guitar & drums. And most tracks are 6 min and more, so you get a lot of LOUD organ by the man. To me the best track in this session is Laura, breathtaking. This album will make reevaluate the stature of jimmy as a soloist; he is right there with the best of his time: trane, ornette, sonny. A masterpiece! One of my all time favourite Blue Notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the casual; organ lovers only, please.","review":"Do not buy this unless you really (really) like organ-based jazz. The organ is overpowering on this 2-CD set (as it should be), and for me, a former organ player turned pianist, even I get really tired of the incessant leslie effect and those eight and ten finger chords. Oh, it's good, to be sure, but after a while, I really (really) just want it to stop. There are some songs that, even after I'm sick of hearing the organ, I still can listen to and really enjoy, such as Lover Man, Slightly Monkish, and Just Friends. Other than that, I'll just say what I say in 90% of the other Blue Note recordings I've reviewed: The liner notes are generous and helpful, the Rudy Van Gelder remastering results in a clean, crisp, noise-free recording that does not detract from the music, and all in all, this makes a good addition to any jazz music collection. Just remember: this is organ music and Jimmy Smith will not for the briefest of moments let you forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids From Shaolin","review":"Excellent movie.

She practically carried the album Adiemus to best seller status, but it was more classical than pop. In Miriam, she combines some of the choral energy of Adiemus with more pop and rock oriented music. At times, she sounds very much like Sarah Brightman or Loreena McKennitt. Her cover of Peter Gabriel's Mercy Street is especially haunting and beautiful. This CD is a great initial effort to find a niche in the pop field, and I hope she keeps expanding her range in the future.

However, the subject matter of this book and all the psychobabble and drivel from experts as to how Zoloft affected Chris Pittman and why he killed his grandparents was laborious to read. Not an enjoyable read at all and it took me forever to finish this book and I'm not sure why I did. Perhaps because other true crime books are few and far between right now. Usually I don't want books to end but I popped the cork on champagne to celebrate finishing this ugly tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst True Crime Book I've Ever Read","review":"This book was so poorly written and edited that I was unable to get even halfway through it. Another reviewer has already gone into detail about this, but I feel compelled to chime in because I am flabbergasted by this book's 4-star average rating.True crime is not a genre known for its spectacularly written books, but most of the time the books are written well enough to keep the reader interested and to convey the story in a comprehensible manner.The sheer volume of grammatical and spelling errors, as well as the author's (or editor's? or both?) unfortunate fondness for the comma render this book unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOO MUCH DETAIL","review":"I agree with other reviewers in that the author went to great length to research and report all the details, and I mean ALL the details. It is indeed a tragic story, but very difficult reading at times. Mr. Hudson's use of all the initials (SSRI, SLED, DJJ) got rather frustrating at times, because maybe I couldn't remember 100 pages and two days later what SSRI stood for, and to go back and try and find the explanation was a bit too much to ask. I have not yet finished the book - Christopher has just spent his first night free - so I'm still not sure how it ends. I don't really remember the case - maybe because I was on Zoloft and couldn't function right. Sarcasm? You betcha! I do understand that everyone reacts differently, but Zoloft was a life-saver for me and thousands of others as well. The other thing I noticed - and this was Pinnacle, not Mr. Hudson, was all the typographical errors.

S. Bach ( e.g.: \\"If only his writing were not so turgid, so convoluted!\\"). Scheibe's own talents, though obviously nowhere near as stellar as his target, are nonetheless considerable. The two flute concerti on this wonderful recording are seductively and sensitively rendered by artists Maria Bania and Irene Spranger. The musical lines of the inner slow movements are gorgeous and the outer movements are captivatingly playful.The concerto by little-known Johan Joachim Agrell is delightful as well, and the one by Johann Adolph Hasse is a real surprise, because it is far less dramatic and more affecting than might be supposed, given the composer's vast output of Neopolitan opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made!","review":"These were a gift for my son for Christmas.

I will certainly order more colors of this hat, but I will look for another seller. My hat was over a week late and when I got the box it looked like megatron and his transformer friends had played football with my package; while I can't fault the seller for what the postal service does I CAN absolutely fault them for their piss poor service. When I kindly and concisely asked for a status on my week late package, the following is the response I received: \\"Hello. Please contact amazon/fba team. They handled your order and will have information.\\" REALLY? Could you at least pretend to be sorry or care? Got it, it's a straight forward situation and not \\"your problem\\" ehats, but your manner of handling customers and the impression it leaves is 110% your problem.

Another evolving factor is from few items with buyers close at hand to the beginning of this century when we produced more to sell than customers and emphasis changed.

Wonderful dialogue, characters; poignant and heartfelt without being contrived. How a previous reviewer can compare him to John Grisham amazes me..filet mignon to a soy burger....."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully written with well-drawn characters","review":"The Risk Pool was wonderful, as are all of Russo's books, but I think that this one is my favorite.

Please give us more books like this Richard Russo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting into the dirt","review":"I have read all of Russo's novels and somehow missed this one until now. This exploration of Ned's roots rings true. The main character, Ned, a resourceful inteligent and, like most kids, honest boy. then teen and man, travels through the maze of confusion caused by a fragile mentally ill mother and a rugged, hard drinking WWII vet. I so appreciate Russo's grace in telling hard truths, in this case about the secret language and deals we make in the most intimate of our relationships. Many thanks for a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russo novels seldom disappoint","review":"The rogues, tricksters, mentally-ill, gamblers, alcoholics and ne'er-do-wells in Risk Pool are nothing less than adorable. Russo writes beautiful prose that pulls at every one of the reader's emotions. Here, he creates a cast of loafers with a dry humor that will have you laughing out loud at times. I've read six of Russo's novels and while this one wasn't my favorite, it's nonetheless a masterpiece. It starts to run out of gas in the last quarter of the book but by the end it's... kinda worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"I loved it. I would liken his attention to details along the lines of Joyce Carol Oates and Ian McEwan, except his details describe actions to propel the plot, whereas Oates and McEwan's (I like both) use of details moves more of the exploration of the interior and motivations. But it's a lot to plow through, and I wasn't anxious to start another Russo book right away. But I will."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same good small town stuff","review":"Russo's novels all explore these two-bit towns in the northeast, with faded glories and unrealistic hopes. The Risk Pool is perhaps the best one I've read. The relationship between the boy Ned and his reckless father who careens through life breaking all the rules is the theme of the book, but it's so much more. Russo has the knack of making \\"ordinary\\" lives interesting, and for me this book was a real page-turner. If you've read Mohawk, Nobody's Fool or Empire Falls, you'll settle right into this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best ,, From the Best...","review":"Russos' best, no question.. Ive read them all,, I reread this book every year.. Character development without peer.. Small town life depiction.. extraordinary.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anywhere","review":"Mohawk, New York could be any small town in the United States. People out of jobs, bar dwellers, heart attacks...every town has them and no one likes to talk about them.This is, perhaps, one of the best novels I have read. Russo combines wit and dimension to his characters...so much that they become real.Ned Hall has the dull life of a boy living with his mother when his father interrupts everything. Told from Ned's point of view, he walks us through the simplicity of his father's drunken stupor to the complexity of his teenage feelings...and everywhere inbetween.The writing isn't filled with thesaurus words, rather words common people identify with everyday.All in all, this book shows the reader a life in the life of a young boy. Parents estranged and town falling apart. And it holds you in for the whole ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much focus on negative...","review":"I was SO excited to get this book. Finally something out there to speak to me. But once it arrived and I started it, I was completely disappointed. I am pretty hefty and it seems to speak to women two and three times my size. I don't understand. I'm overweight and I was told it would be hard for me to get pregnant, still trying BTW, and this book speaks to women much bigger than me?Bottom line, if you are very obese then this book may be EXACTLY what you are looking for. If you are only slightly obese then apparently the regular pregnancy books are more in line with what you are looking for.Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"I had high hopes for this book, as I am 4 months pregnant with my first child.It seems like it's mostly re-assuring you that \\"big is beautiful\\" and retelling horror stories of being discriminated against because of size, with very little actual information. There are descriptions of medical tests, but this is mostly a self-esteem book, not a very helpful guide for pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book fails to deliver","review":"This book was filled with information easily found elsewhere, with very little that might actually help a plus sized woman trying to prepare for birth.It was extremely biased toward medical/hospital birth. It interpreted medical studies only in ways that might make women afraid and more complient to doctor's wishes. Little was covered concerning natural childbirth methods, but there was no end to the sections encouraging women to passively allow physicians to do whatever they want.There were some redeeming qualities though- there were several resources listed for plus sized maternity clothes. Also, the advice for discerning wether your health care provider will discriminate against you based upon your weight was helpful.Overall, not worth buying- everything in it can be found online using a search engine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference for plus size Mom's to be","review":"This was a great book.

The writing is terrible and the editing is no better. Dates and timeframes do not match up, names get confused, etc. The beginning few pages should have been enough to make me put down the book for good, but I needed some fiction about Inanna for a class so I tried to stick with it. It was awful. If you want some interesting representations of Inanna try 'Snow Crash' by Neal Stephenson, but please don't buy this book.

While Bud Powell's best recordings for Blue Note are from the late 40s and early 50s, captured on the two volumes of \\"The Amazing Bud Powell,\\" this is one of three sessions he made for the label in 1957-58. (The other two are \\"Bud!\\" and \\"The Scene Changes,\\" and while the former is currently unavailable as single issue, it is available as part of \\"Bud Powell - The Complete Blue Note and Roost Recordings.\\") The hallmark of Bud's second stint at Blue Note for me is the wonderful sound of these recordings. It might just be the difference between the mono recordings of five and ten years earlier, and the distinct stereo sound of the late 50s, but it makes the music come to life. You can even pick out Bud's trademark moans during his solos (which sometimes get a little old, but they are endearing nonetheless).

I use a Hitachi stick gun, and will be switching over to these guns, they reduce the fatigue by a great margin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nail Gun","review":"This is the best framing nailer I have ever used. It's light, well balanced, has plenty of power and very versatile. The only complaint I have is that I had a hard time finding info on the nails that it would except. I still don't know if I should be using the smaller diameter siding nails or not; I installed about 800 sq. ft. of siding with it without a single problem, so I guess it must be okay. The gun is great for framing, it,s compact and fits into tight spots much easier than any stick nailer I've used. This is the first coil framer that I've bought and what I like best about is how long you can go without reloading. I don't think I'll ever buy a stick nailer again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic Toy","review":"This is NOT a framing gun. I don't why the great reviews. We build for a living, and would not want this on the job site. We have two Porter Cable FR350A's and a Bostitch F21PL. We use them to hit boards into place when it's too difficult to grab our hammers. You'd never do that with this light duty gun.This gun seems to have average power. It's definitely not the \\"most powerful nailer in its class\\".On a separate note, holding 300 nails isn't actually as beneficial as it seems either for a framer. The magazine gets in the way a lot, and the coils are very fragile too. You can always keep extra nails in your belt.As for value, I think it ranks poor. Porter Cable and Bostitch are your best value. I highly recommend the Bostitch F21PL- it can nail anything. Even wood into masonry, and joist hangers.If you like Makita, get their MAC5200 compressor or their lithium-ion tools.

This show is horrible, it rarely has Dick Tracy in it, basically he just tells this dog to go get the criminal and then at the end the dog tells him he got the criminal. The bonus, at least on the first disc, is just Dick Tracy giving useless service announcements, I think that is what they'd be called. What I don't understand is if this is a Dick Tracy cartoon why isn't it about Dick Tracy. It has the criminals so it should have been called 'the villains of Dick Tracy'.

Aside from a few adult references (such as using a Peter Lorre-like voice for Flattop) these are not very clever, and definitely do not hold up as adult entertainment by any stretch of the imagination. I guess I was fooled by my own enjoyment of many great reprints of the original Tracy strip (which I see is now coming out in new editions ~ look elsewhere on Amazon) but after 3 of these cartoons I knew I was going to be trading this one in at Coconuts.

The only issue you might have is the tie bunching up from looseness"},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea but.....","review":"I love the idea but the product does not hold up..... the plastic broke after a couple of uses.... I am going to come up with a modified version using items from my local craft store...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Received Product !","review":"Never received this product - despite Paying for it !Therefore,while it appears to be a very useful product - I'll never Know. I hope you have better luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever","review":"This is a very simple trick to keep your tie in place without the use of a tie stays. Tie stays still have their place I find myself using this one more often than not. The plastic they used to make this is very soft so be weary of needing to buy another eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful piece of plastic","review":"Yes, this is a tasteful replacement for a tie clip. But ultimately it is only a cleverly designed piece of plastic, that I received in the mail taped to a sheet of paper. There is no reason that it should be sent as certified mail; I had to make a special trip to the post office to pick it up. Ordinary first-class mailing will do, and is good reason that the distributor should lower the presently disproportionate shipping price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely awkward when you bow/bend your posture","review":"OK it works as it is advertised, BUT (A HUGE BUT) when you, for instance, sit on your chair and bow/bend while you are writing something or simply looking at your computer, your tie will appear cracked from the point where you attach this thing. Believe me, its extremely awkward. The reason I gave 2 stars is because it does what it says, only when your posture is almost 90 degrees straight, which is something quite impossible to maintain all day long.Also considering what you pay for the shipping, it is better you don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No reviews before watching...hmmmmm","review":"I wanted to like this movie but Damn it Jim I can not. I liked the sound track but this movie is boring. There are a few scenes and a few lines that are funny and that is it (the funniest lines are in the closing credits). It's not worth sitting through the whole movie even if you're having a B-movie party night. You can find something more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it could have been...","review":"The idea behind this movie was a winner, but it was unfortunately executed rather poorly. I wanted so badly to like this movie. I mean, a Christmas time zombie holocaust sounds like it should make a great movie. I found this movie to be too slow. The zombie effects were bad, even by low budget standards. The acting was okay considering it is a B movie, and all the actors were likeable enough. This movie just seemed to be missing something and I can't quite put my finger on it. It ended up being kind of boring and forgettable.I will say that the cover art for this movie is amazing and really drew me in to purchase this item. I was tempted to keep it on my shelf for that reason alone, but I ultimately decided to give this one to my brother (a bigger zombie buff than I am). He had a similar reaction to me and said it was \\"alright, but should have been better\\".Rent this one before purchasing it if possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this holiday themed zombie comedy!!","review":"Really dig this little grindhouse zom-com with an old school horror feel. If you're a horror-comedy fan, or just love a good zombie flick, don't miss it! Plenty of Christmastime gags and gore to fill your home with holiday fear... I mean cheer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cadaver Christmas","review":"A blood soaked janitor walks into a bar to clean up on Christmas eve with only two patrons in the bar. He calls the cops while the janitor tells them why he is covered in blood. He reminds of a hillbilly version of Bruce Campbell. Anyways, the cop shows up & they go to the school to investigate his claims. It's a fast paced, moving story that looks straight from the 80's. The ending had me surprised but it was smart & something i've not seen before.Overall, if you love horror comedies, then you'll like this. It's fast paced, funny, & gory. I watched this right after the great film, The Sleeper, & the two go good together. Both films should be watched back to back."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's soft in the belly!","review":"11 fights, 8 decisions, 3 finishes all coming from body blows.

And there wasn't nothin that we could do about it. Anderson Silva was a made man and Chael Sonnen wasn't. And we had to sit still and take it. It was among the Brazilians.

The cuts from \\"Porgy and Bess\\" are rocked up when they should be moody, and the rest of the music is haphazardly put together, making the CD difficult to enjoy. Georgia sounds better than ever, but whoever created the arrangements should be punished!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic TV Makes for a Great DVD!","review":"I am a HUGE Boris Karloff fan, which is primarily why I purchased this DVD. However, the series on presented in this two disc set is wonderful. The acting is great, the transfer is extremely crisp and, of course, Mr. Karloff is his usual charming self as the host (and actor in most of the vignettes).The bonus two episodes of 13 Demon Street, hosted by Lon Chaney, Jr., are interesting if not as polished as The Veil.I am extremely happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy A Cheaper Set","review":"Though this Series is a lesser accomplishment for Karloff, it suits Collectors. However, the Cheaper Sets than this most expensive $24.95 one are just as good, I'm sure. Don't waste your money. Buy a cheap Set of \\"The Veil\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dull Veil","review":"Before buying this DVD set, I wondered why it was never a series. When I watched it, I know why. Most of the tales are predictable and dull. The only redeeming value is that Boris Karloff is the host and in most of the stories.

Although it's a pretty good CD, it's not exclusively from the Bob Crosby Bobcats chart. I have most of the Bobcats' recordings, but \\"Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\\" is not among them and some of the arrangements are quite different from the original l935-42 recordings. Oh well, you get what you pay for and l5 cents plus shipping is acceptable, although disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book alone is worth the whole price.","review":"I do not even use tarot cards, but the book that comes with this beautiful card deck has become one of my most important reference books on Voodoo and related religions (santeria, etc.).

It is an amazing work of scholarship and for me, the gorgeous artwork is just a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey of Mind and Soul- Voodoo Tarot","review":"Martinie and Glassman have created a most incredible Tarot Deck and companion book. A MUST have for the seasoned Tarot reader as well as the beginner. The deck itself is a joy for its artistic merits alone.

Intuitive, functional, and revealing are just a few words that come to mind in praise of this Tarot. You will not be dissapointed in using the New Orleans Voodoo Tarot."},{"rating":"2","title":"very confusing ... read my edit....","review":"I bought this based on amazon's reviews. I have been reading tarot cards 25 years & i am always open to new avenue's of divination.Even with a master's degree this is a tough book to get through & follow.The art on the cards rarely corresponds with the meaning of the card which makes it even harder.I suppose if i was an expert in voodoo it would help a lot.It is not written for an novice, although it was written with a novice in mind. I wish it was. In most cases, i have found the text more work then enjoyment. there is good stuff in there but a lot is hard to follow.edit... after 6 months i really do enjoy these cards & yes, they can be very powerful. had to do a bit of research on voodoo.still learning. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerouse stuff, read and use with cautin","review":"I have been using this tarot deck for three years and havs had amaizing results. Everyone knows me by my tarot deck. Though I recomend these cards wich are highly magical, infact I have never used a deck more powerful, and I have used many. I warn to use with mutch respect and honor. The book has some rituals that can get you into trouble \\" nothing that will kill you.\\" There is a ritual on birthing the deck, and naming them. This was the first thing I did Madama L La Mama Chola has been with e for three years and I cant immagine life without her. \\"WORD TO THE WISE! \\" If you put the spirit in your deck, it will be a powerful deck capable of both good and evil, make sure to study on voodoo and Santeria befor attempting this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deck for voodoo practitioners","review":"While I like other Tarot decks due to artistry, I much prefer this one as it speaks to me due to my own beliefs. I am able to help others with this deck who follow the Ifa Traditions. Other decks are aimed more for Wiccans. While that is fine, those decks do not speak the language of the Orishas and the ancestors. Our ways are very different than Paganism and am glad there is a deck for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it would be...","review":"I collect tarot decks and books and was simply adding this one to my collection when I purchased it. I had used the deck via computer generated tarot reading sites a few times and was drawn to the deck due to it's accuracy and dynamic visual energy.What I had not realized was that this is a complete divination system unique unto itself. The book is large and full of explanatory information regarding the images on the cards as well as the spiritual/esoteric philosophies inherent in the cards as expressed by any type of layout. There are several innovative spreads with suggested interpretive approaches to any given reading. The book is heavily illustrated and the cards are of good quality paper stock.It has been well worth my time to study the cards and read the book despite having been an avid tarot enthusiast and reader for almost 20 years! The New Orleans Voodoo Tarot book and deck are worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...where's the deck?","review":"I may come back and change this review but for right now I'm sorely disappointed. Be aware: this listing is apparently for the BOOK ONLY--THE DECK IS NOT INCLUDED. It's looking like I'm going to have to send this purchase back and get an actual set, since after a quick search, the cards by themselves cannot be found.As usual, Amazon's shipping was lightning fast so no complaints there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better books out there","review":"I was very disappointed at the quality of the recipes in this book. One recipe actually used boullion cubes for the stock!! From the tilte of the book I would think that each of these soups would be a \\"labor of love\\". None are very inspiring. I will probably never open this book again. I suggest the Willams Sonoma \\"Soup\\" highly over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A recording to admire rather than love","review":"This recording tried to trump the famous performance under Solti that showcased Birgit Nilsson in blazing form. Karajan waited to find a Salome who could compete on a different scale--smaller-voiced, warmer, younger, and without the Nilsson steeliness. He found her in Hildegard Behrens, but the result, to my ears, isn't really right.Jose van Dam was a Karajan favorite then, but his Jokanaan sounds gritty, forced, and totally without the spirit of a Christian prophet. Behrens herself is a wonderful singer, but she puts a distance between herself and Salome's lurid decadence. As does Karajan. I think the missing ingredient here is Struass's vulgarity, which is the glue that holds this biblical shocker together when it works.This is one of those rare occasions where an unsublte rip-snorter like Solti is preferable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great opera","review":"Salome is required listening of great opera by a modern programmatic composer. Richard Strauss was very much inclined to such music. Much of his other opuses are tone poems.In this opera, Richard Strauss captures biblical moments of interest to many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring performance","review":"This is an uninspiring performance with Karajan. Worst, the title role is mis-cast, for Hildegard Behrens has neither the voice or allure for Salome. The other singers are adequate, but no more. A recording to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed the way I veiw food!","review":"This book is wonderful! Sandor Ellix Katz has a great way of conveying his personal beliefs on food systems, and how we eat affects our culture. I've been making many of the fermented foods included in his book, and hope to get around to trying to make them all! My friends all think I'm food obsessed now, but I'm completely enjoying myself and keeping myself entertained with the wonderful recipes in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on fermentation","review":"\\"Wild Fermentation\\" offers a broad overview of the subject from A to Z, including a wide range of fermentation processes and their history, as well as specific how-to's for a variety of recipes in each category. This book is thorough, comprehensive, fascinating and easy to follow. By the time I put it down, I had already compiled a list of foods and beverages I'd like to make. What I like best, though, is Katz' laid back approach that immediately puts the reader at ease about things like: \\"Will I be able to do this?\\" \\"What if it flops?\\" And of course: \\"How can I tell the difference between fermented and spoiled?\\" I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic of fermentation in general or any of the subtopics, such as beer- or cheese-making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but, I am disappointed","review":"Before I bought this book I researched how to ferment and make other preserved foods. I guess I read too much, because when I read this book I already know all the information that I was interested in. With that said this is an excellent book, Sandor does a great job in explaining how to make and store fermented foods.He goes way beyond what I need but someday I may just try some of the other recipes. After all I never thought I would be making sauerkraut in my kitchen. If you ever wondered if it was too hard to make our own sauerkraut do not worry, anyone can make it, the basic sauerkraut has only two ingredients, then you expand from there to add other veggies, herbs, and fruit to make it your own. Anything goes when fermenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get snookered.","review":"Read a lot of books on food. None ever inserted their sexual orientation or politics. Good idea for a book, too bad he added all the irrelevant nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for conservative cooks","review":"I purchased this book because I have Nourishing Traditions and Sally Fallon wrote the foreward. I was also impressed with the good reviews. But this book really ruined my appetite. The author feels it necessary to use the F word to express himself. I might have been able to stomach this in order to get my money's worth, had there been good recipes in addition to those in Nourishing Traditions. There aren't in my opinion. Unless you like crude language and descriptions of decomposing bodies in your cookbooks, say \\"No, thank you\\" to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring many to ferment","review":"This second copy of Wild Fermentation that I purchased was for a gift. I have also recommended the book to friends who have purchased it and loved it. The book is a real jewel for anyone new or old to fermentation. I have been fermenting for years and I have been inspired to ferment things I have never fermented before. No doubt, that Sandor has a real passion for fermentation and this passion is contagious. I am certain that this book will inspire a new generation of chefs and others to explore the benefits of wild fermentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and follow","review":"I do not follow instructions very well but this book was written so simply that I am able to follow every step. I am at the research stage for fermenting kraut and every website referenced this book. Very excited to start my first batch! After that...on to kimchi & kambucha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly well-researched","review":"The author really knows his fermented stuff. He walks you through the recipes so you know what you are doing. He writes well and with a good tone; he is entertaining. Katz's recipe are much more user friendly and better tasting than the Nourishing Traditions versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare gem","review":"Sandorkraut has done a superb job of gathering his practical experience about fermenting foods, and putting it all done in a fun-to-read book. This book became an instant favorite of mine. I finally know that I am not alone in my fascination of fermention. This book will supplement anyone with a homemade wine, beer, or mead hobby. If you've ever wanted to make your own lacto-fermented veggies, this book is a must read. Great job Sandor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"This book is a rare gem. It contains all of the practical experience needed to ferment your own foods and beverages. Yogurt, kefir, country wine, T'ej, hooch, and much much more. It is all in here. Fermentation is such a fun hobby. This book is for the germo-phobe as well. Mircobes are our friends, not our enemies.This book is truly a gift to share with others. [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"much more than a simple cookbook- its a \\"culture\\" ;)","review":"Thank you Sandor. I rarely have a book that changes my way of doing things. The only other book that I thought was equally changing was \\"Extraordinary Popular Delusions..\\" btw: I didn't just purchase one of these, I've sent copies to dearest/beloved friends. Back to the book...To summarize, this work is a critique on modern food production. Mr. Katz makes an eloquent argument that in our headlong rush to modernizing food, we cheated ourselves. We strive to remove all microbes in a take-no-prisoner attitude, without realizing that some of those microbes are beneficial.His work includes many recipes. some dating to ancient Egyptian beer! I haven't tried it yet, I'm still trying to perfect my pickles! There are numerous recipes for foods that we've forgotten.I am also a person who has had health issues, mostly digestion related. My previous issues are fading away due to changing my diet. Can't possibly say thank you enough to Sandor Katz."},{"rating":"2","title":"bubblin' pots","review":"I loved this book. I also read his other book \\"The Revolution will not be Microwaved\\", and both are wonderful. In \\"Wild Fermentation\\", he covers a wide range of fermented foods, and really makes it easy to try things immediately at home. I currently have fresh cheese, saurkraut, honey wine, and ginger soda all going right now, and I didn't have to go out and buy a bunch of equipment, or read some technical instructions. This is a very simple, punk rock way to ferment food. And it is delicious. You will be reminded of what life was like before modern technology, and how fun it is to make these bubbling brews in your kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good recipes!","review":"This book contains lots of different recipes, and it is most helpful for all interested in fermentation. Kimchi-recipe is ok, fruit.kimchi something I've never heard of - soon to be tested in my fermentation studio! That recipe alone makes the book worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learned my lesson","review":"Well I learned my lesson in making sure in the future to read all of the negative reviews as well. I only read the one about not including enough meat recipes. The \\"Wild\\" part of the book is definitely his lifestyle. I was very excited to get the book and then very disappointed in the content inside regarding the \\"community\\" in which he lives and the goings on. There was too much of his views on his lifestyle and I could have done with none of that lets just get to the fermentation info. I wouldn't buy nor recommend this book just write down some recipes from a book at the library if I were to do it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick To The Recipes","review":"I used to cringe at just hearing the words \\"pickles\\" or \\"kimchi,\\" as they immediately brought to mind spoiled cucumber and cabbage. After reading this book, however, I decided to give them another shot. Now, I feast on gorgonzola and tempeh as readily as I do fresh vegetables. My only complaint about this book, and it is a very minor, nitpicky point, is that it ignores concepts completely. I have tried to branch out from the recipes and make some of my own inventions, starting with fermentation of a head of lettuce that had been sitting in my refrigerator for eight weeks. A stomach pumping later that night quickly taught me not to stray from the script. Who knew the black liquid pouring forth would have been bad for me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Wild for Me","review":"I tried just blacking out all the offensive passages but there were so many! In the end I just got rid of it.It didn't really have any more information than there is in \\"Nourishing Traditions\\" anyway.I do find it interesting that I reviewed this when I got it and my negative review was taken down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing...","review":"As soon as you open this, you get problems. First of all, the man who wrote this book is a vegan, and does not include any fermentation on meat. Good luck living in the wild without a concentrated source of energy and nutrients. We run yet again into problems where much of the fermentation isn't even wild, in particular for dairy. I understand dairy isn't usually available in the wild, but the book is about wild fermentation, right? If you want to learn about fermentation of dairy or grains, you can find all the info you need for free searching on google. Soak, sprout and ferment...If you want to ferment meat, you're going to have to find another source anyways.The attempt at appearing philosophical at the start of the book was purtty unimpressive.Other than all of the other problems, there is a wide variety of fermentation of products, and it will suit you well if you're a vegan/vegetarian."},{"rating":"1","title":"disclaimer: this is a recipe for \\"alternative\\" lifestyles","review":"I am surprised that Amazon published this review and then 3 months later censored it and then deleted it for 'PC' purposes.Quite frankly the topic of fermented food is interesting but the author's anecdotes about transsexual behavior and transgender lifestyles are not! This book should come with a disclaimer about its so-called \\"alternative\\" lifestyles..."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much personal ideological info to my liken.","review":"Normally I do not rate things that I am not thoroughly used, test or read but I make this an exceptional. first its too much personal ideological being stated in this suppose cook book.secondly you can obtain most information in the book from the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I lost my appetite","review":"I was really looking forward to getting this book. I thought the author's enthusiasm was really refreshing, I liked his energetic style of writing. I guess I didn't read enough of the \\"look inside\\" and should have read more reviews.I wasn't expecting the book to be so heavy with social activism. I'm the type of person who looks away when people kiss in movies. I don't want to hear about how a \\"trannie\\" likes their water kefir while I'm getting ready to prepare a home made soda pop for my kids. But that's just me. I'm getting my money back. you'll get everything you need in nourishing traditions by sally fallon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not scientific enough for me","review":"For a book purported to be the fermentation bible I was sorely disappointed when it came to the science of fermentation. It's more of a meandering autobiography/philosophical journal with approximate instructions. I was especially disgusted by the decision to give measurements in both standard us cups/tbsp/etc and milliliters. Which means for example that a recipe might require 1 tsp of salt or 2 ml. What the heck! How on earth would I go about measuring out 2 mL of salt. If you want to bother giving two units of measure, one of them should be volume and the weight, two volumetric measurements is just redundant.It wasn't a terrible book per se, but it is next to useless to me and far short of my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Overview","review":"The rambling, folksy narratives aside, and the political statement, this book gives you instructions on the basics of a wide variety of fermented foods. Each of the food types can, if you want to take it to the limit, be made more fancily, and perhaps better, but this guide gets you started. For example, his sauerkraut recipe works. Will your sauerkraut be tastier in a Pikl-It or a Harsch crock? Probably, but this book gets you started. For another example, his mead recipe is dead simple (honey and water, 1:4, use an airlock). Is mead better with fancy yeast, racking, aging? Probably, but again, this book will get you started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely opinionated, light on recipes, repetitive - look for another book","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. It has a number of flaws as I mentioned in the review title.Let me summarize 99% of the recipes for you, chop vegetables and add salt.There are much better books out there to help you get started with fermenting/pickling/canning that explain the processes well and give many variations on recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Balance!","review":"Wild Fermentation is informative and practical. Specific and flexible. Background and application. Upbeat and profound. In other words, it's a book with balance. The reader can learn all about the great reasons to consume fermented foods and also learn to make them. I've tried several of the recipes -- they've all worked out more or less, and I think the less part has to do with my skill and attentiveness rather than the clarity of the directions. I can't wait to try out some more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspires experimentation, very much an overview","review":"This is not a cut and dried cook book nor a picture book but it does give some very interesting recipes and a good introduction to fermentation techniques. In several cases, I have found it more inspirational than in depth. For example, I found the section about ginger beer plant needed to be supplemented from the internet. However, I don't regret buying the book and we have definitely enjoyed reading it. The recipes I have followed have worked out well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I really enjoy and admire the author's style and tone as well as the useful information in this book.Katz includes personal and historical background about many different fermentation processes and does a terrific job of encouraging readers to experiment and use their good judgment in adapting recipes to local circumstances. Where they overlap, the book's information accurately matches my experience and it has a useful index and sources for cultures, equipment and more.The author obviously has much experience with fermented foods as well as great enthusiasm for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book","review":"This book has many great recipes, tips, and ideas for those who are new to the art of fermentation.

I have compassion for Sandor Katz but I firmly disagree with some of the things he writes about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fermented Author...","review":"I purchased this book in conjunction with Nourishing Traditions and at the recommendation of Amazon.com. Last time I do that. The author sees nothing wrong with promoting his \\"way left into oncoming traffic\\" unhealthy, unappetizing, and uninteresting, alternative (being nice here) lifestyle.I would HIGHLY recommend that you NOT purchase this book, but if you were duped into buying this product, use it to start your wood cook stove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fermentation?

NOT A REAL COOKBOOK... A PROPAGANDA PUSHER","review":"I have never before given this kind of a review...but then I have never needed to. Save your money and save your time! Honestly! This author is purporting his fermented belief systems. This book cooked up more than recipes for health. It has cooked up recipes about life that bring only sickness and harm in the end. I don't enjoy seeing anyone harmed. I have witnessed both friends and co-workers alike who have tested these ideas out and have ended up broken and sick in body and mind. I don't personally enjoy the gross-ness of the ideas and descriptions in this NOT cookbook. I am very surprised that this author thought it was o.k. to add his personal lifestyle choices so inter-twined in a cookbook where no one is suspecting such things ...I will avoid this author in the future because I cannot appreciate what I feel is an upside-down approach to great health... and I do not like sneaky mixes of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazin","review":"Absolutely amazing!

I couldn't wait to get this set, seeing as I'm a collector, and it turned out to be a major disappointment! The animation is lacking, the voices are annoying, and the dialogue is very corny.

Tezuka's work in manga and anime is unparalleld and stands alone in style and substance in this graphic Japanese genre. He is without peer in the entire ouvre of his work, especially with \\"Astro Boy - The Complete Series.\\" He is in a class of his own.

I found it on youtube what tipped me off was the opening on the series I brought showing a kid on a flying wheel chair but there was no story in the disc set that covered it. I grew up with Astro boy and I'm glad that they're trying to bring it back. They stayed true to the original drawing design and yet gave it a fresh modern look and a good story line as far as I'm concerned. Seeing it in color for the first time was great.

The gags are dull and plot is recycled. Even the patented ultraviolence (and the deliberately offensive dialogue) feels watered-down and off-key.

It balances nicely between an inside look (and it is quite honest about the players and other characters, showing their true human qualities--it does not pretty them up) and an ode to the one of the last places where the true spirit of the game lives. I had long known of the league, but mostly through the reports of Peter Gammons and Baseball America. It was all numbers and thumb nail scouting reports. This book added layer after layer of humanity to these guys. It also captures quite beautifully the connection of the game and the mythical qualities and the small town virtues. It doesn't overdo it either. The touches are excellent. The narrative is a bit meandering at times, but that is ok, so is the game. A beautiful tribute to the men (mostly Pauly, D'Antona, and Stauffer) and a game that is timeless. Thank you Jim Collins."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Summer, One Season, One Great Book","review":"Jim Collin's book is THE most enjoyable sports book I have read in over a decade. Maybe it's the ephemeral beauty of a single Cape Cod summer, maybe it's the timeless coming of age saga, or maybe it's just a story of three individuals, any one of whom could be a brother, a friend or a neighbor. I believe it is all of these - you don't just read this book, you feel it - the Chatham fog, the building summer heat, the unmet athletic expectations and the frustration of players sensing their athletic futures unravelling with each unsuccessful at bat. The stories flow together seamlessly . . . I'll be looking for more from Jim Collins."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS Baseball","review":"Collins gets it. Baseball people have a certain way about them, and Collins obviously is one of them; he also knows how to write about them. This book--an in-depth and endearing look at the 2002 Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League--shines with the polish of good baseball writing about a great baseball subject. The players and team staff come to life, as does the ebb and flow of a summer on the cape. The poignancy of this moment in time, in these specific lives and in this specific baseball season, got me a little misty-eyed at the end. These are the kinds of dreams everyone should have, at least once in awhile, even when they have to come to an end.This is such a big part of why I love baseball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer in New England","review":"Jim Collin's THE LAST BEST LEAGUE is a well-written look at a summer of baseball at the famous Cape Cod League. Collins evenly divides the book between the local manager who views the League as his big time and the collegiate superstars under him who are often humbled for the first time by superior pitching and wood bats. The underlying question is what separates a major leaguer from the rest, and the answer at times seems to be not much--one or two bloops that fall a week for a hitter or a pitcher who for one magic season can light up a radar gun. At the other times,the answer is pure athleticism or stick-to-it-ness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is an abosolute waste of $$. He describes his own book as a \\"how to\\" but does not describe how to do anything. He basically describes things that can be done, but does not provide any useful pictures/diagrams and provides no insight for 'anyone' on what the different components look like, located, etc. It gives a list of thing that may have to be removed or checked, but not a lot of detail on what to look for.

As with most movies involving time travel, I half expect a Borg to pop out of no-where. ;) What caught my attention is the demonstration of how fluid human sexuality can be and how little we really understand about ourselves. Sure, you can turn on PBS and watch the mating habits of almost any other species, but put some humans in there and it's labeled \\"pornography\\". Alas, such is the paragon of animals.

Bach's death. He endows them with feeling and humanity without a lot of overindulgence in rubatos or other mannerisms. The \\"prestissimo\\" movements of sonatas 2 and 6 are especially good, played with breathtaking virtuosity. And as Woolley demonstrates, there is an excellent case to be made for J.C.

I just finished reading it, and man, did I have to fight to not just give up and read something else! Straub struggles to make the killer Koko scary, but it just doesn't work.

While \\"Koko\\" has a riveting plot and some sharp characterizations, it wanders on so aimlessly that it's easy to lose interest about halfway through. As some reviewers noted, the identity of Koko is spotted easily early on, and even though it doesn't totally eliminate the suspense, it makes it harder to get involved in the book. A couple of riveting scenes are truly frightening, but overall, this is a vastly overrated novel. The lack of a resolution in the end is disappointing too, although I understand this is the first in a trilogy of novels that includes \\"Mystery,\\" and \\"The Throat.\\" I will have to reserve final judgment until I read those two.

The idea of a group of war vets who don't neccessarily like each other cooperateing for a greater purpose is a fascinating concept. The twists and turns in the plot keep the novel going strong throughout most of its entirety. Only most though. Even though it has interesting plot twists, the going door to door questioning strangers bit gets a little old.

Its long (and over-written) but one of Struabs better constructed novels. The writing is more fluent and easy to read. There is a lot of detail but thia adds to some fine character development . The book suffers from a big dip in the middle where nothing really happens. This is not a story full of exiting happenings but stick with it ! The ending is clever and helps to give the book a lift. Basically this is a very good read for those who like serial killer thrillers !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre mystery novel","review":"I picked up this book after reading a much better book by Straub, \\" A Ghost Story\\". I was really let down by how little this book grabs you. Really. At best its a decent mystery novel. In this book Straub gives the reader little reason to care about what the ending holds. Seeing how most reviews of this book here are pretty positive, i guess i will have to file this under \\"to each his own,\\" but let me say this: I was perusing the rave review blurbs that are often put in decently successful paperback novels, and this critic emphasizes how this novel, more than just about any other, has an unguessable ending. BS. The twist is put out there, in the first chapter, right under you nose so blatantly its not even funny. \\"Hmmmmm, i didn't even know that his first name was Manuel.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"His second best novel","review":"The only other book by Peter Straub to even come close to GHOST STORY. An excellant read. Don't pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long, Too Slow, Didn't Care When All Was Revealed","review":"I like most of Straub's early work but this book didn't flip my switch. It's about a group of buddies who fought in Vietnam together a decade and a half before the time in which the book is set. Someone is stalking and murdering the men one by one, and the survivors of the squad--soldiers who in a moment of violent madness which affects each differently undertook and got away with a massacre of civilians in a Vietnamese village--gather at the Wall in Washington DC in order to figure out who is preying on them, and how they can stay alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workouts","review":"I have worked through the 1st trimester cardio/toning and yoga workouts. They are short enough to make it reasonable and tailored to each trimester. I feel energized after doing them. The 1st Trimester dvd pauses for a second in the middle of the workout but keeps playing. I'm not sure if this is just my dvd or what... Lindsay Brin is energetic and passionate about mom's getting in shape in a safe manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL prenatal and postnatal workouts!","review":"These are the best prenatal workout videos I've found, and I've looked long and hard. I loved that I could work out, easily, at home, with minimal equipment on my own schedule, AND that each workout was tailored to a specific trimester. The workouts are right on track -- as soon as I hit the next trimester, the new workout hit all the new areas of my body that needed to be targeted. After I had my baby, I got right into the Boot Camp video, and it was the perfect way to start building my endurance and strength back. Plus, when I started the Boot Camp, I could appreciate just how much the prenatal videos had kept me in shape during pregnancy which helped speed the return to my regular clothes much faster than after my first child when I didn't know about Lindsay and these workouts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pregnancy Workout Ever!!!","review":"I absolutely loved these pregnancy workout videos! They were easy to follow, yet they challenged me. They kept me in shape throughout my entire pregnancy. It was nice to not have to worry about what moves were safe to do during each trimester. I was able to rely on Lindsay's expertise to keep me in shape in a fun and safe way. The cardio and toning segments helped me gain weight in all the right places, while keeping my body toned. The yoga segments were relaxing and helped me maintain my flexibility. I recently had a baby and am now using the bootcamp workout to get back into shape. It is challenging and I think it will do the trick! I would highly recommend this workout series. They are very effective and are well worth the time and money. I will definitely be using them again during my next pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pregnancy workouts!","review":"These are thorough, safe, and fun. I have enjoyed using them throughout my pregnancy! Lindsay really focuses on back strength, stability, functional moves, and getting ready for labor. All of these things are so beneficial for common pregnancy symptoms. I've done one of these workouts about five days a week since I purchased them. The cardio, toning, and yoga have all really helped me with fluid build-up, energy, and sleep. Overall, these are excellent, and well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"When I bought this set of DVDs I was looking for something that would really work me out, but also keep in mind that I was pregnant. I was used to doing Jillian Michaels DVDs and wanted something that would kick my butt like that - after reading reviews and looking at several different \\"pregnancy work out\\" DVDs I decided to try Lindsay Brin since the reviews were generally great, saying it was good cardio etc. - I have to disagree; I could barely get through 1 workout because I was so bored. She's a darling girl and I loved her personality but I was really hoping for something intense and a much faster pace - I haven't tried the yoga, and will for sure since I've been unable to do my regular yoga due to the expanding belly, but the cardio and toning aren't something I'll do again - I just need a little bit more to feel satisfied in my workouts - but that's just me! I know a lot of others have liked it and get a good workout from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout","review":"for a pregnancy workout dvd this is the dvd to get. it workout every major muslce while keeping you safe. I truly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the one","review":"I purchased two workout videos and this is the one that I reach for first. It is challenging but provides you with alternate moves if you are feeling tired. The other nice thing is that since the workouts are divided into trimesters, you aren't stuck with the same workout all the way through. The workout and yoga sessions are seperate, so if you are really beat you can opt for the 20 minute yoga to assure that you are stretching out those tired muscles. I don't deal well with an over-enthusiastic instructor, and Lindsay is chipper but not annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post natal bootcamp","review":"Im not pregnant and never been pregnant so I bought this for my sister Bc she has a two yr old then I ended up doing it with her!!!! We love Lindsay. I was running 5 miles a day so I would say I was in pretty good shape but Lindsay still kills me!!!! ( in a good way). Sometimes the music was bland so all we did was plug in our pandora radio to the surround sound and sweated our a**es off!!!!!!!! I have lost 6 lbs since I have more muscle. While jogging just kept me at the same weight for half a year. I had hit a wall. I went from 116 to 110!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the Swingin' A's, baby!","review":"Great video of the '72 World Series that was such a contrast in styles. The colorful Moustache Gang Swingin' A's vs. the button-down Big Red Machine. Reds manager Sparky Anderson is miked up for some scenes.The video is narrated by Curt Gowdy (who was everywhere back in the '70s). they throw in some clips of the NLCS and ALCS so we get to see the infamous bat flinging at Tigers pitcher Lerrin LaGrow by the A's shortstop and top base stealer Bert Campaberis after LaGrow intentionally threw at Campy. We also see the injury A's star slugger Reggie Jackson suffers in the ALCS on a slide home that puts him out of the World Series.The series itself is one of the best ones of the decades featuring a lot of one-run games and plenty of ebb and flow plus the surprise hero of the Series in A's catcher turned slugger Gene Tenace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for boiling water -- but that's it","review":"This pot is useless for anything short of boiling water. My husband tried to use it for pasta and managed to boil out all the water and had scorched pasta and chipped enamel for his guests. Clearly not entirely the pots fault but due to the very thin bottom, scorching is easy to do. The enamel even burned onto the stove itself. The bottom is really only thick enough for the simplest of jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything pot not what it seems","review":"I read the description that showed it was 11\\" high and it only measured 8\\". I needed a pot that was 11 inches high so I could put a gallon jug inside it. this ad was misleading. I paid extra to get it here quick and then it was not even close to what was described.

Vivian runs off the next morning, but later discovers she is pregnant. At least she does the right thing and tells Ross about the baby. Through the rest of the book Vivien and Ross are basically hateful to each other. Vivien has a sharp tongue and seems to lash out every chance she gets. When Ross calls her a shrew I thought that he was right on target. There physical relationship is anything but romantic. Ross is hurt and his words and actions border on violent. Happily ever after is just not what I picture with these two. This could have been a good story, but somewhere along the way it turned into who could be the most hateful despised character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"Not sure if it's just mine, but the case I received was of low quality. It didn't quite fit the new RAZR which is my fault for trying however the case didn't function on it's own. The snap in the back would not fit together properly had the phone been the correct size. I ended up throwing this away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gob is Awesome","review":"Two fans from Canada think that this soundtrack is really awesome mainly due to Gob's 'Paint It Black'. We bought the CD just for this song. We are Gob's biggest fans. Moist's 'Breathe' was an added to this already great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"great mood ambience","review":"Hard hitting tracks - Gob especially - and deeply moody ambience. Two versions of Paint it Black were done and only one included on this CD - the Stones original is covered closely by Gob on the other but you'll have to rent the movie to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntig Score, the rest is OK","review":"If \\"Unbreakeable\\" is the sister score of \\"The Sixth Sense,\\" by James Newton Howard, then \\"Stir Of Echoes\\" is the cousin that nobody talks about. The score in the song/score album is simply brill. The same uneasyness that is in the above mentioned scores is present in this score. The main theme is simple a creepy. The \\"Kidnapping Jake\\" cue is great, pulsating fun. The songs are OK, but I wish that the score and songs were on two seperate album, which is why I gave the album a 4 instead of 5. One last thing; I wish that they would have added the childs vocals of \\"Paint It Black\\" (as herd at the begging of the film) on the album as an extra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the Stones?","review":"I was severely disappointed in the soundtrack when I came to find out the Rolling Stones' Paint it Black (which was on both the preview AND in the movie) was replaced by this Gob garbage! Really disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks","review":"Music CD's are supposed to have music on them. What happened here? There are 15 tracks on this disc, 7 are actual songs......7! Of that seven, the only songs even worth listening to for more than a minutes are \\"Breathe\\" by Moist, and Gob's \\"Paint It Black\\". The rest of the disc is filled with \\"spooky\\" sound effects from the film. What am I listening to here? More like a sound FX disc for halloween. The film was great but this soundtrack was in need of much more beef instead of all the bi-product that you get. All I recommend is Aspirin. Don't buy this one, instead go see the movie two more times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold up","review":"This seemed like the best egg poacher and I loved the 6 egg cups. I noticed the first sign of trouble when I left the water in the pan. The next morning I discovered little orange rust-like streaks in the bottom of the pan. My other stainless steel pans have never done this when leaving water in them to soak. I made sure after that to immediately pour the water out after use. I continued to use it thinking everything was fine as long as I never left water in it, but as time went by I noticed the bottom of the pan was bulging. I expected stainless steel to hold up better than that. (I purchased it Aug 2008, and noticed the bulging on the bottom of the pan Jan 2009). I've had my other stainless steel cookware for many years with no trouble at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be poached by this poacher","review":"As mentioned by other reviewers, the egg cups' coating delaminates after a few uses. Also disappointed that, regardless of use of additional nonstick remedies (oil, PAM, butter) the eggs stick to the cups anyway. I'll try RSVP for remedial action."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disaster....","review":"This Poacher looked like the best and turned out to be the worst.Eggs stick in the cups whether you use oil, butter or spray.This causes the eggs to break when you remove them plus it's a nightmare to then clean the cups. I wish I could return mine, but as it was a Xmas gift, I am passed the return period.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Perfectly","review":"We used this poacher for the first time last evening and it worked like a charm. Used butter-flavored non-stick spray on the cups and the eggs literally slid out onto the plates. Very, very pleased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Clean!!!","review":"This product looks like it has a non-stick surface - but don't be fooled! We've tried everything, hoping to find the magic answer but there isn't one. I've coated the cups with butter, cooking sprays of several types, with light and heavy coating. I've cooked the eggs all the way through and only partially. But no matter what we do, the eggs stick and then the cups are impossible to clean. Definitely won't come out with a sponge or the green safe scrub back of the sponge. We've soaked them in warm water, hot water, cold water, with mild dish soap, dishwasher detergent, for a few hours, for a few days - but no luck. Takes lots of elbow grease, time and energy that I don't have. Total disappointment and for $50, felt pretty ripped off too. I wouldn't even pay $1 for this at a garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"We've had this poacher for many years and find it great for family breakfasts. Easy to use, reliable results, easy to clean and still in great shape after many, many uses. When our grown daughter put this on her Christmas List, we knew immediately what we would give her! We were disappointed to learned that Williams-Sonoma no longer carried this poacher, but they gave us the necessary information to find it online. If you like to poach your eggs, this is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"charred duck a jojo","review":"This title was given by my butcher when I asked him whether a duck can be roasted for 2 hours and not look like a charred corpse. The duck jo-jo's veggies were charred as well. By now I have tried quite a few recipes by now and quite often the timing and quantity is completely off. At least I hope this is not what he serves in his restaurants. No go. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unusual cookbook with straight forward fantastic recipes.","review":"I once read that if you can find a single worthwhile recipe in a cookbook, it is worth having on your shelf. This text has several that a neophyte can easily master. The ingredients are somewhat difficult to find, but the Asian food stores in my area carry the required elements. Furthermore, the author offers suggestions on which dishes to serve with each other. Overall, a welcome addition to my culinary armamentarium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for people who like to eat out, but mostly eat in.uite","review":"I am a home cook of 40 years and a cook book junkie. Contrary to Time Magazine, I think this is one of the best books by prominate restaurant chefs. I have cooked about 12 recipes and only had one failure, the leek terrine, which tasted okay, but fell apart. I also learned how to oven roast at high temperatures particularily chicken which will be on my forever list."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is one of my all time favorite cookbooks. Jean-Georges Vongerichten has an amazing palate. Some of his cooking techniques and flavor combinations may be somewhat unusual but they are spot on. I've had this book for a number of years and have made many of the recipes. They are delicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Cuisine at home","review":"This book totally exceeded my expectations. I loved the fact that it makes French cuisine affordable for any cook, no matter what the level of practise you have had. The section on salads is particularly good, as it mixes very different ingredients, it even has some recipes inspired by Jean Georges experience of living in Asia so many years. So, what this book basically does is, simplify French cuisine in a really straightforward manner. The recipe for the warm melted chocolate cake is the best I have tried yet, totally foolproof. Buy this book if only for this recipe alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Honeymoon Continues","review":"My wife and I bought this book at Jean-Georges' Restaurtant Nougatine after dining there on our honeymoon. In addition to the recipes the other reviewers mentioned, I can attest to simplicity and elegance of the Coconut Sorbet, Butternut Squash Soup, and Potato Ravioli. A fascinating and extremely usable cookbook by a master chef."},{"rating":"2","title":"a winner","review":"This is a terrific book of simply prepared sophisticated food. What prompted me to write was the review below concerning the apple confit. The recipe works. It's a ton of work, but if you follow directions (with adjustments, perhaps, for your own kitchen equipment) you get a desert that will impress any crowd. Most of the other recipes work just as well. When dealing with sophisticated food like this one needs to understand how to balance flavors and adjust technique. Probably not a book for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"I thought this book was very intriguing, to say the least. Throughout the book, Bok brings up different \\"lying\\" scenarios that force the reader to think what would be right and wrong for the situation. The book helped me better understand the consequences lying and deception have on each one of us.Lying is all too commonplace in our society today. This book focuses on the consequences lying and deception have on each one of us. If you want to realize the personal and social ramifications lying holds for us all, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book will make you think...","review":"This book includes so many modern day examples mixed with scholarly philosophies about lying. I like that many different beliefs are included and debated. Bok presents some reasonable and also some quite bold ideas about this controversial subject.I would recommend this book because it contains many thought-provoking scenarios and demands the attention of the reader. This book is not afriad to address the power lying can have in relationships and in society. I felt I gained a greater understanding of my own feelings about lying by reading the ideas of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good start","review":"I found this analysis of lying and it's moral implications very interesting and inspiring. The field of morality and psychology of lies is rather unexplored, and this book can provide a good beginning for students interested in the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Sissela Bok","review":"On the subject of lying, this book is the best of the lot. The author tackles the hard questions like, what is lying, while many of the more erudite academic authors skirt that detail. This book originally appeared in the 1970's before the tendency to morph moral issues into scientific incarnations was intellectually acceptable. So it remains the most honest book on the subject of lying."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent exercise in intellectual thinking","review":"This is a very thought-provoking book. The author pretty much dissects everything possible about lying, and does so in a thoroughly effective manner. If you have any interest at all in the concept of deception, this is a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Channel Whelk","review":"The cute little hermit crab has made his home in a shell....but what kind of a shell is she (he) living in? On Cape Cod, we call this shell a Whelk. Actually, a Channel Whelk - and it is the official shell of the State of Massachusetts. Cape Cod is a Peninsula tacked on to the Eastern part of Mass. The Cape is actually an island now, because somewhere back about a hundred years ago they carved a huge channel splitting the Cape from the mainland. Two stalwart old bridges get you back and forth..but most Cape Codders hate to go OFFCAPE. anyway, we get the whelks' shells when the empties wash up. These finger puppets capture the fun of finding a shell, without the sand and the sea....and you can play with them in the winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun mystery novel","review":"This is a terrific little mystery novel for hard core mystery fans. The story is set in a mystery writers convention (Bouchercon) and includes a clever blend of real writers and fictional characters. There's lots of inside info and jokes about the mystery writing profession not to mention numerous pop culture references which really make the book fun. Collins throws in a solid whodunit and the whole thing adds up to an enjoyable reading experience. Max Allan Collins is an extremely popular and versatile writer and although this is one of his earlier and lesser efforts, its still a worthwhile book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little old fashioned","review":"and I like that.

Very nifty."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE IT","review":"I don't like leaving books half read , so I forced myself to finish reading this one. Why I hated it? The author constant mentioning characters from other books is very annoying. I knew some of the characters, like Mike Spillane and the singer Bobby Daring, but there were too many I never heard of, and I am a baby boomer. It was aggravating wondering if the numerous writers mentioned in this book were real or fiction. The plot is interesting but the hero didn't do much in finding who the killer was. The ending was predictable and stupid"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun little mystery","review":"I was looking for a light fun read and this certainly fit the bill. Written in the 80s, it has all the obligatory romance, light action, and eclectic characters that make a mystery an entertaining read. If you're used to more complex mysteries, this may not be your fare, unless like me you're looking for an escape from some heavier reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"Those who are seeking an magisterial overview of how one dynasty came to control both Spain and parts of German-speaking Europe will be sadly disappointed. There is little analysis that adds any fresh insights.The writing style does not achieve the easy grace of Alison Weir, Diane Preston or David McCullough. Indeed, the sentence structured is tortured. Look up the genesis of the First World War, and this is what you get: \\"Although the line of succession had been assured, first to his nephew Franz Ferdinand (although that was to be overturned by the archduke's murder in Sarajevo) and then to his great-nephew, Karl, and eventually Karl's son Otto, Franz Joseph had come to see himself as standing at the end of the line.\\"This is an unreadable book that should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I couldn't agree more with the reader from San Diego.

You have the choice of a postions done from a chair or standing with a chair for support if needed. There are 5 programs that last from 5 minutes up to 90 minutes to choose from. The male instructor gives excellent instructions in a soothing and relaxed tone. The students demonstrate modifications of the yoga positions. There is constant reference to breathing which is extremely important in yoga. I found the circular movement he demonstrates for loosening up and relaxing to be very effective. There is also a separate music and chanting menu. I have to agree with one of the other reviewers, this is a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Helps Seniors with Disabilities","review":"Seniors with various disabilities do these gentle yoga exercises with my help at a Senior Apt. building. We do 1/2 to 1 hour of the DVD twice a week.One person uses a wheelchair and oxygen tank and has noticed how much easier it is for her to breathe after doing some of these stretching and breathing exercises. They expand the lungs and teach the student how to utilize their whole body for breath.There are also complete relaxation positions in between each practice performed. Meditative in quality, this is a huge asset and incentive for them to attend class regularly. They know they will leave relaxed and loosened.Another person has low mobilization and the gentle stretching and rotations helps facilate movement in their joints and lowers muscle pain.When the class is over, everyone is smiling, commenting on how good they feel, how relaxed they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Serenity in the AM with Yoga","review":"I began doing Yoga about a year ago, but everything always seems to be scheduled for Tuesday nights! Because I opted for a writing class, I needed an alternative to Tuesday night Chair Yoga at the community center. After reading many reviews on Amazon, I opted for this DVD. I am not disappointed. The routines are well organized and the on-screen participants provide good examples of the correct postures. I appreciate the format, as well: After the disclaimer, a list of several routines comes up--everything from joint flexibility to balance--and the viewer can choose the appropriate routine. Also, the exact times are given, so a routine that fits one's schedule can be chosen. (Most are around 18 minutes.) This is not a good video for those who are used to putting their bodies into unique positions while balancing on one leg. It's really gentle, really basic.

I was hoping to find Yoga poses done sitting and perhaps gentle standing poses. However, in my opinion, there were no Yoga poses at all.

Sometimes I actually had to guess what the actual word should have been.Is it because of KIndle ?? It was really strange.Otherwise I want to add, that Mrs. Steel is changing her style. I was at a point to predict everything in any book, but now the stories are touching deeper ground. \\"The Ring\\" is a good example: not everyone is surviving. In addition, there are a lot of twists that one cannot predict. I love that.So I am looking forward to her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story You Will Never, Never be Able to Forget","review":"After I read this book, I was able to understand all Danielle Steel's magnitude. The plot of this book is so huge and so powerful that you just can't help but fall in love with this book. With THE RING, for the first time I felt portraited to World War II, I felt like I was there, suffering, trying to survive and be happy.The plot deals with a family saga. During three generations, you see how many things can happen to a family that struggle to survive even passing for so many tragedies.THE RING is the kind of book you'll never forget. The third and last part lacks a bit, being not so good as the two before, but you almost does not perceive it, so great and wonderful is this unforgetable story that makes all your feeling come up.

Hey, someone who is so well circulated has to be good, right? I shouldn't have just come up for air after reading so many creative writing books. I found the writing nondescript and flat. Her only saving grace was that she got around using \\"he said\\", \\"\\"she said\\". That technique I had never seen and so have to thank her for. That said, the story moves well.

I have been a longtime fan of Soviet and east European rock, so I was plased to be lucky to come across this fine specimen of post communist era new wave rock from Leningrad. It is all in Russian, but the vocals have a strong resemblance to the singer in Sisters Of Mercy. I applaud the efforts of this band amid the oppression of free expressionin soviet society.The musicianship on this is not real top notch, but they do well with what they have. The quality is good and it is obvious they use a drum machine. This band can also be heard on the 2 lp compilation 'Red Wave' which feataures Kino and 3 other Russian bands from 1986.

The game is really fun and easy to play, with lots of details in the scenes, and several stages to play.

My 8 and 6 year old sons LOVE this game and keep returning to it month after month. That's probably because they love lego and Star Wars, so if you love these two things then this is the game for you! Best of all, it meets their mother's stringent standards against gaming violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids","review":"My twin 7 year olds love this game. They love going to the different levels and changing the characters. The graphics are great. The sound is kept in the background so it's not too distracting.

The concept is creative and the tongue-in-cheek humor makes it all the more fun.As I said, it's not horribly difficult to make your way through the storyline play. However, there are enough collectibles which require unlockable characters to retrieve that the fun is extended into free play for quite a while.I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent back","review":"Game was scratched up on the back and would not work.

We own Stars Wars 2, Batman, and Indiana Jones but SW2 is by far our favorite. My boyfriend and I have spent endless hours unlocking characters, finding studs, solving puzzles, and snagging mini canisters.. and we're both in our 30's.

They cannot keep off of it! I have to wake up early to get on our console on weekends. When I have stolen a few moments to get on it, I have discovered some of the most amazing secrets. The minikits are the most fun things to collect. If you get all 10 minikits on 1 level, you complete a Classic Star Wars vehicle. The most fun \\"move\\" is probably when you press \\"X X Square\\" with a Jedi. If it is a Jedi, they jump way up high in the air, and stab the ground with their lightsaber. If it is a Sith, they do the same thing, but they do not sink into the ground.

Not much fun afterwards when you complete the game"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids","review":"I was myself surprised at how in depth these lego games are, basically folllowing the entire story lines for all three original movies all in one video game. That seemed like quite a value. My son loves these games and as a parent it is nice knowing that these games are E rated. Seeig some of the lego version scenes in this game are quite amusing when compared to the actual movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"adrian 11 years old","review":"It's fun and not violent, because if you kill someone you don't kill the person, you just break it and it just falls in pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"AH Compilation","review":"This is pretty much a compilation of some of AH's out of print 7-inches, along with some of the new stuff. It's pretty awesome; i'd say get this after Microstars, House, and possibly Easy Instructions. It's before AH really evolved into the band that they are today; you can hear a lot of their different sounds though. This has some of their more requested songs, such as 'Pop Sensibilities.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect camera bag!","review":"Bag is just right for a video camera; removable bag is a great addition that isn't available in the stores.

Lowepro makes great products!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Camcorder bag","review":"This has turned out to be an excellent bag for the PV-GS500 I purchased. It has a detachable bottom section to store the power cord and charger in it which is nice. It is able to hold the camera, spare tapes, pretty much everything you need but a tripod with no issues. Only thing it is missing is a shoulder strap, and I personally do not consider that a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on making the most of your selling abilities.","review":"In this book Dan Gendron gives advice on selling and making the most of your talents to make a maximum amount of money. In many ways, his book is more of a primer on common sense, which, of course, is not all that common anymore. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to increase their selling power. By the way, unlike some books I have read on this subject, Dan does not suggest anything that is underhanded, illegal, or immoral. As I said, this is an outstanding and refreshing approach to common sense rules about selling your product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will forget it quickly, but, neverthless.....","review":"My problem with Steven Saylor's \\"mysteries\\" is that they are not, in any meaningful sense, mysteries: as a sleuth, Gordianus is little better than mediocre, and we are not able to see him, in any way, developing anything approaching a trail of sustained thought allowing him to unravel a complex, dark intrigue; what matters in the Roma Subrosa novels is the sensitive reconstruction of the historical setting of Late Republican Rome, which, in the larger novels, always gives the impression of physical accuracy, as one almost feels that Saylor is describing living experience - not a lesser accomplishment when you think of it. Therefore the fact that, in this short-stories volume, one feels the absence of the usual broader historical canvases;neverthless, there's always a reasonable amount of savvy, racy, lush, almost physical prose that allows for sustained interest and makes it impossible to put down the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good selection of short stories","review":"These collection of short stories by Steven Saylor add new insights into the character of Gordianus the finder as he begins his investigating career in ancient Rome. His early relationship with Lucius Claudius and Beshesda are done well in the confines of these stories and add the missing link between his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical fun!","review":"I would recommend this to anyone who would like to get better acquainted with ancient Rome during the last days of the Republic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good short stories but low quality ebook-wise","review":"The short stories in this book are a good read, like most of Steven Saylors stories and novels. I was disappointed however by the amount of scanning errors in the ebook version. One should get better quality than this, paying what you pay for an ebook. It should at least have been proofread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bridge","review":"This is the second book in the roma sub roma series that takes place between the two novels. This is a good book but most of the stories are forgettable. The best short story is the namesake of the book about the potential sexual escapades of a vestal virgin which would lead them to be executed. Very good book that bridges together the two novels but nothing really exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ave Saylor, legentes te salutant","review":"This is not the ultimate in literature, but the stories are vey pretty, nevertheless. The characters of Bethesda and Lucius Claudius are drawn beautifully. Without them, Gordianus the Finder would just be another oppidanus of Subura. But I do not feel that the author brought ancient Rome \\"to life\\". and he certainly did not bring history into play, except a few mentions of Caesar, Cicero and Sulla. Still, it was enjoyable light reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bell Beamer Toddler Bike Helmet (Glow Bugs) review.","review":"I got this helmet for my granddaughter for her second birthday. I don't think she really understands the whole helmet concept. However, she thought it was pretty cool because it lit up, so maybe she will be more likely to wear it. I thought it was really cute, kind of thought it would be nice if they made adult sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great helmet with lights for safety","review":"This is a fantastic helmet- bought for my 3 year old - it is now a year and a half later and it still fits my growing girl. I love that it lights up when it is getting dark outside at dusk, not just in total darkness. Pattern good for toddler and the big preschooler she is becoming.

My use, for example, is to attach headphones to the computer under my desk. Standard headphone cords don't reach, but these are great. Since they stretch, you really only use as much as you want. Unstretched, this cord is about 12-18\\" long. Description says it goes to 10 feet, but probably gets a little taut past 8 or 9.The coils DO add a little weight to it, so this really isn't ideal for portable use (walking, running, biking) but ok for car for the kids or something: some cars have a headphone jack in the stereo or in the overhead DVD player, and this will give you the stretch."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"works fine for the price. just what I needed.

Perhaps his second novel will be better. I will probably give him a second chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book would have been better if it had been half as long. It is repetitive, full of nonsense and mistakes. It reads like one of those stupid horror movies where the bad guy keeps on coming back to life and the good guys make stupid mistakes. Makes me wonder why I wasted my time reading the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been so much better","review":"This book started off so well. I expected it to be a heist story where what the theif stole led to uncovering something damning to the church and changed the world. The first half of the book seemed to lead to support this conclussion. A master theif steals two keys from the Catholic church to pay for his wife's cancer treatment. It had everything that makes a thriller exciting. Likeable characters. A motive for the reformed theif to return to his old ways. A risky and well planned heist in the Vatican, with a twist thrown in with decoy keys. And then we find out the man who hired the thief was actually the devil, and the keys are the real keys to heaven, and heaven is now closed. Come on. Two chapters into this revellation was all I could read. The story became so far fetched, I couldn't take anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mot at all what I expected","review":"I read about a third of this book and stopped. It supposedly was about a thief, but the chapters didn't flow in much of any form. I couldn't tell if I was in the past, present or future. And the guy was always worried about his 'emortal soul' and how his profession could be rationalized. I expected a thriller, instead I received a thesis on religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Storyline","review":"I loved this book. A great good verses evil story. The book revolves around a thief who steals two keys from the Vatican, which will prevent his wife from entering into heaven. It is well written and does not disappoint. A great protaganist who will be a repeat character in future storylines. I could not put this book down. I will definetely buy another book from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!","review":"I could not put it down!...As someone who is not an avid reader, maybe a few books a year, this was a terrific page turner...Suspensful, a thriller, history, it has it all...Listen, for me to choose reading this book over a Yankees/Red Sox game I think says it all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!! Spectacular!","review":"The Thieves of Heaven is a gripping, non stop thriller that combines Love, Suspense, Mystery, and Adventure into one extraordinary novel. Doetsch's debut is truly a treat, and will keep the reader wanting to turn the page. The twists and turns and the exciting development of events alone left me wanting more. The cunning plot is only surpassed by the smooth and spectacular writing style. I have read many books in my time..believe me, and this by far takes the gold medal. the Thieves of Heaven is a class of its own--nothing short of brilliant. Bravo Mr. Doetsch, I tip my hat to you and I will truly be looking for your next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating read","review":"Picked the book up at the airport for a 2 hour flight leaving at 11PM.

Only drawback ... it's not in stereo, but it is a digital remaster of the recording from 1955 so what can you expect? It's great and you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Biography","review":"I was very disappointed when I got this book.

I did enjoy reading about Lu's experience, I found the book to be lacking in one major area, a very important area.. pgeant preperation.

MAny of the sections such as \\"sponsors\\", \\"mental attitude\\", \\"make-up, \\"skin care\\", \\"physical fitness\\", etc were very short and not very clear. In my opinion the book does not give in depth information about how to prepare. \\"101 Secrets to Winning Beauty Pageants\\" by Ann Marie Bivans, I feel does a much better job of discussing all the factors surrounding pageant competition and is very throu"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good snapshot of after you win...","review":"Being a coach, and also a former state/national titleholder, I was hoping this book would give some more useful tips for young women who are just starting out in pageants. While the pictures and the story she tells about her journey through the USA system are very nicely done (and I would love to know where she got those rhinestone hoop earrings!), there was very little about wardrobe selection, entry forms, getting the right \\"type\\" of look for a pageant, etc as opposed to her experiences after she won. It's a good read and a nice addition to your pageant library if you have one like I do with over two dozen books, but if you are looking for hardcore pageant tips, stick with Ann Marie Bivan's \\"100 secrets to winning beauty pageants\\" or the hard to find out of print \\"How to Win Pageants\\" by Ginie Polo Sayles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairy Tales Not to Miss","review":"A wonderful collection of lesser-known Victorian fairy tales. The anthology includes well-known writers such as Lewis Carroll, Edith Nesbit, and Rudyard Kipling - as well as 19 others.

But this cartoon treated the kids more like teenagers and there was little or no \\"fart\\" humor and with the addition of Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, etc. it took on a serious tone without being overwhelming for kids. Put this team in charge of any product aimed at appealing to kids and their parents - great stuff! Only minor complaint was it seemed to end quickly with some battles left to do and you are left feeling maybe they are thinking tv series - which i wouldn't mind but it seemed to end quickly... my son has watch it twice in two days. If your kid (and you) likes comics, Ben 10, etc. this is your speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift","review":"I gave this movie to my nephew as a 6th birthday gift.

I saw the previews and was disgusted. I thought it was a cheezy attempt to create a marvel teen titans. I was so horrified with the Ultimate Avengers, its failure to tell a story, and the sub-par animation that I never watched the second Ultimate Avengers. I certainly wasn't going to pick this dvd up.After being blown away by Hulk Vs. I decided to pick up a copy of Next Avengers. I got a copy on clearance at a closing Circuit City, so I figured if it stank then I wouldn't lose out on much money.Much to my surprise, this movie was PHENOMENAL!!!!!!

I grew up reading DC and Marvel comics. As I grew, so did the themes and story of these super heroes. The characters (heroes) started to become more complex. The Next Avengers is more for kids. It has the simple storyline of good guys win in the end. If your like me, mature and older, you might not enjoy The Next Avengers as much as the other Marvel animated video films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun twist on classic comic heroes","review":"I found this quite enjoyable. The story is clever and sufficiently involved to keep things interesting. Okay, Thor-girl was a bit over the top, but I could find myself cheering these kids on! Fun entertainment and kid friendly.

This large, almost cardboard-style book reads like a children's book, with a simple tip per giant page.. and the tips all seem pretty obvious. These might be good tips for people who couldn't realize on their own to reduce frivolous spending like Starbucks lattes and tucking aside money for the unseen, but for the rest of us who were hoping for a more novel/article-like book with good wisdom like we've come to expect from these authors, I think the first step to saving to afford a family would be to skip buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"malarkey","review":"I do not believe the author knows what he is talking about. Not everyone has the temperament for child raising. The boarding of children means that there will be extra demands placed on the parents plus extra expenses. Also I don't think the author takes into account that more money has to be earned by one or both parents. There is security, food, clothing, amenities, lodging, transportation, education. I think the author should rethink what makes a good family and the exorbitant costs that this endeavor entails. It is far more expensive to raise a family, than to stable a set of horses.

And I suddenly realized that the 'author' has the writing skills of a fifth grader...and I may have insulted some 10 year olds by saying that.Awful, awful book. The plot is all over the place, there's no sense of a timeline, the dialogue is SO phony, and the characters are flatter than the pages.I haven't been so dissapointed since I found out the Tooth Fairy was leaving everyone else five bucks and I only got fifty cents.Don't waste your money on this one...me, I'm off to the publisher's website because I think I may have a promising career ahead of me. :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind numbingly useless.","review":"I procured this tome hoping that it would help me on a paper I was writing for an anthropology class.

Experimental Documentary.Armed with video cameras, twelve artists present a highly stylized portrait of SAN YUAN LI, a traditional village besieged by China's urban sprawl.China's rapid modernization literally traps the village of San Yuan Li within the surrounding skyscrapers of Guangzhou, a city of 12 million people. The villagers move to a different rhythm, thriving on subsistence farming and traditional crafts. They resourcefully reinvent their traditional lifestyle by tending rice paddies on empty city lots and raising chickens on makeshift rooftop coops.Directed by acclaimed visual artists Ou Ning and Cao Fei and commissioned by the Venice Biennale, SAN YUAN LI explores the modern paradox of China's economic growth and social marginalization.Also available in these formats:VOD Rental:San Yuan LiDVD Purchase:San Yuan Li (Institutional Use)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lightweight book, very pro-Kerry","review":"As a political junkie, I loved reading \\"Election 2004\\", for the behind-the-scenes peek at the candidates' campaigns (well, mostly Kerry's). However, if you are to enjoy the book, you must realize that:a) Newsweek is very pro-Kerry.b) the Bush campaign (wisely) kept them at arms-length.So we get fawning adulation over Kerry's daughters, while Bush's twins are treated as snide pranksters. Laura Bush is \\"simple\\", while Teresa Heinz Kerry \\"takes charge\\". The Swift Boat Vets are \\"grudge-bearing\\" while 527s like Moveon.org are \\"groundbreaking\\". Kerry's team used \\"sound strategy\\" while Karl Rove and Karen Hughes cooked up \\"dirty tricks\\". You get the picture.If you can stomach the liberal spin, it's still a good read and does provide a few tantalizing tidbits (especailly about Dean and how he was perceived by both the Democrats [crazy, self-destructive] and Republicans [manna from Heaven]).The left-wing slant is made more bearable by the fact that Bush won."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book would be relevant if Bush actually won.","review":"It's called election fraud, and if the media EVER does it's job you'll be hearing a lot more about it.

The band has a great time, giving Tom cat Blues an old time radio sound palette, imitating traffic sounds on Sidewalk Blues and featuring an exchange of uproarious of laughter between a couple of muted trumpets in Jungle Blues.Great listening, complex, traditional, modern, fun and often funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Smushy Lord","review":"Since the liner notes insist that all jazz is \\"modern\\", you'd think Marsalis & Co. would try to put some fresh spin on Jelly Roll's compositions, or at least capture the nuances of the original sides. But no, this is just corny Dixieland oom-pah mush, the stuff tourists hear at Disney World. To appreciate Mr. Morton you will do much better with his original recordings.

Jacobsen's research in weaponry, espionage, the military and Islam is astounding. Islam has always seemed so mysterious to me and I've known little about it other than turbans and beards and women taking small steps in their swathing garments.

It's strong and durable and will last no doubt for many years. I didn't measure how much, but the scoop holds a lot, and I can fill a bucket in no time.What else can I say about a scoop?

Though the performance of the great Black Dyke band is, as always, virtually flawless, this music is definitely not \\"easy listening.\\" All of the pieces on the CD are first section test pieces, composed especially for the Brass Band National Championships of Great Britain. The best of the best composers (Percy Fletcher, Edward Elgar, and others) are represented. These pieces are written to challange the finest brass bands, and Black Dyke demonstrates why they are often on the top of everyone's list of \\"all time greats.\\" The music represented can and will be enjoyed at some level by every listener, novice or not. For full enjoyment, arm yourself with some liquid refreshment, a full score, and some space where you can crank up the volume a little bit.

I found this series, and the response from the students have been positive. Even though these DVD's are a little expensive, I am pleased to say that it was worth the money I paid.

The 'Canzoni' performance demonstrated a rich, beautifully controlled voice, producing the most lovely pianissimi since diStefano in his prime; definitely a voice to cherish. While this performance shows much the same, the voice seems thinner and effortful in production during the more dramatic moments. Of course, this is probably due to the fact that his lyric voice has to push a bit to be heard over an orchestra playing full force. However, his approach to this music is dead-on, and in many cases revelatory. I look forward to many more offerings from this very talented singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful voice","review":"He must be Godsent.

I read a lot of reviews on various footrests, most of which had only one or two reviews that were all negative. So I figured that only angry people bothered to comment, and it can't be that bad.Three weeks after my order arrived, I had to toss it in the trash. The board broke down the middle.

Unfortunately, the plastic thing is held to the footrest by a single screw that goes into flimsy particle board.You might think that a screw going into particle board to support someone's legs is a bad idea, given that particle board is flimsy and falls apart when even a modest amount of force is applied in one place. Well, you would be thinkin exactly right. I bought three of these footrests two weeks ago. All three have fallen apart.I'm actually surprised the products haven't been recalled; they're much better sold as firewood than footrests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"\\"Don't Torture a Duckling\\" is about someone who murders children in the Italian countryside. The motive for these murders is unclear while Fulci makes good use of red herrings to develop a whodunnit flick Italian style--or a giallo as many refer to it. Given the film's age, it is difficult to be too hard on the film, but while the suspense is clearly evident, the film's execution is clearly lacking. Moreover, the film muddles along in a great deal of needless dialogue that works to depress the movie's acting and suspense. However, the mystery of the movie keeps it going (barely) as is the case with most giallos. In other words, the only thing that holds one's interest is who committed the murders, and that's just not enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid...","review":"I had high expectations for this considering I liked some of Fulci's other stuff. It also got a high rating on IMDB.com. When this movie finished I was so angry. Angry because I felt like I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this. I hated it. One of the few times I was pissed after watching a movie. It was very very slow, not very scary, not a good story, just plain stupid. This is one of those movies where I will no doubt never watch it again. I dont recommend it.(insert Fulci fans complaining here)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rare collection of Breton poems","review":"I ordered this book to research into Breton's relationship with Suzanne Muzard. It contains a nice contextual preface by the author & a few interesting notes on translations in the back. Great resource to see the differences in Breton's relationships with Lisa Deharme & Muzard as expressed through his poetry. I give four stars only because I would have enjoyed footnotes or references for some of the facts presented in the preface - if I were ordering for non-scholarly purposes, I would have given 5 stars. Be advised, the publication is small and contains a handful of poems (design and content are great, just don't expect an anthology of his poetry.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The model I had was supposed to have a \\"safety feature\\" where the heater does not work outside of water.

I work in a physics lab to which I took this mixer to see if it will perform to the level Mackie claims. To my surprise, mine exceeds Mackie's specifications: for example, they claim a very low 0.0007% distortion and linear response to 60000 cycles, mine far exceeds those specifications (measured on lab quality equipment). I also have a small home recording studio and work, part time, as a DJ and play in a small band. I needed a mixer with very low distortion, without costing a fortune, for my home studio and capable of handling mobile DJ work (MP3 from a computer) and work with a band as well so that is why I selected this unit. It is not specifically aimed at the DJ market-no cross fader-but works quite well with only a little bit of practice.

Because of this, the concepts lose their impact, and many times appear as rehashed material from many other books available today.I enjoy a majority of Matheson's works, and was excited to find this extension of some of the concepts and ideas from \\"What Dreams May Come,\\" but unfortunately, Matheson was too sparse on the details. I don't feel any more compelled to pick up the works of Percival than I did before.

It encomapasses the new couch with the comfortable chairs that have seen several generations. The people of Provence treasure their time-worn furniture and artifacts.

We can't figure out how to fix the problem.....Very frustrating!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HP not for me!!","review":"I spent many hours to get the scan function to work. Via HP support emails, I was given 20 pages of possible fixes. Well they did not work. In addition, I could not network the printer. It was not recognize on the other computer.I gave up and returned it to the store. I have bought a Canon MP530. Took me a hour to install on my computer and five minutes for the other computer to recognize the networked printer.Disappointed with HP. Maybe it will work fine on other computers. But not here.

The installation process has taken 2 months. Finally, the machine prints, copies, and faxes beautifully. That said, this 73 year-old techidiot just spent 3 hours trying to extract the (EXPENSIVE) inks from the HP 7580 - notwithstanding the instructions \\"to pull lightly\\". They should have read, \\"PUSH DOWN HARD & TUG LIKE CRAZY.\\" I liked my HP7000, but prepare for lots of trouble shooting if you get the HP 7580. Added stress: If you call for help & get an overseas voice, hang up and try for the Canadian support folks whom you can understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome all in one","review":"This is a great little workhorse of a printer.

After 15 hours on the phone to India we concluded the following: 1. There are no compatible Vista drivers and software even though you can download software from the web site. 2. Color correction was impossible. 3. Support spends a lot of time with you but has no clue how to make this one work. 4. If your time is worth anything stay way, way away from this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad machine to buy. poor quality","review":"Machine made of cheap plastic and foam rubber parts. worthless machine. buy a better quality machine.

I have been in the industry in one dimension or another for over 25 years - and this is one of the worst printers that I have ever seen. I purchased it for networking but it continuously drops off the network. The software doesn't work at all. Ny recommendation to you is not to purchase this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"AIO that wroks...sometimes","review":"I have had this product since July 2007 and had various results. Bottomline: HP has sent 2 replacements after 16 total manhours on the phone with (English as a second language) tech-support. The scan function works and interacts well with my XP based laptop. The Fax function is good for flatbed but if you need to send multiple pages, not so much; the feeder has caused the printer replacements. The printer is fine for color and b&w;, but print quality is not a big issue for my business. Ink usage is on par with other printer I've used and an low/empty cartridge doesn't stop b&w; printing.Recommendation: Pay the extra for quality business machine for a specific purpose and save yourself the time/ effort of maintaining this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it -- won't work right with Vista","review":"Four hours with HP customer support in India with people who are difficult to understand could not get it running with Vista.

They could not help with the install to Vista."},{"rating":"1","title":"14 months and died","review":"This printer did everything it was advertised to do...even lasted beyond the warranty by a couple of months.

This is by far one of the worst pieces of office equipment I've ever purchased. It acted up immediately, would not print properly and the software created problem on my OS (Windows XP). I wanted to return it but made the mistake of allowing tech support to talk me into receiving a free replacement set of print heads. That solved the problem temporarily but only ended up delaying me long enough to have my warranty expire, then they wouldn't talk to me. When in use, the printer software would slow my computer down to a standstill and caused crashes regularly. The complications only got worse until I finally uninstalled the software. What a piece of junk and a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick printer, everything else is a headache","review":"This printer is great on paper, and actually prints just fine.Scanning and faxing are unbelievably unreliable. 3 out of 4 faxes lock up the entire machine, with paper stuck in the document feeder. Scans frequently lock up the printer and client software. Days after a failed scan, you can try scanning from a different computer and it will still fail even though there is no error on the display and the printer will print. Frequently, the only solution to problems is to pull the power cord, remove any paper jams, start over and cross your fingers.Very, very frustrating machine - DO NOT buy this for demanding users - and by my experience, I would avoid the entire Office Jet Pro line."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This fax machine/printer/scanner is horrible. Do not buy it! I have a problem every time I try to use it. When faxing or copying, the printer often jams. The machine also tends to eat your original documents, tearing and folding them. Also, this might be because I have a PC and not a Mac, but it is nearly impossible to get this machine to scan a document to your computer. This machine is a piece of crap. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy HP All in Ones on Windows","review":"The software that comes with these devices is excessive garbage. The whole setup is basically designed to sell more ink. Our printer gets into a mood where it constantly resets itself whenever you try to print with less than 10% of ink remaining. It whirs and grinds for about 3 minutes, then flashes on and off. All of this is a result of the feeble software it comes with- it takes ages to install, a sure sign that it is doing too much.I took a similar HP all in one and plugged it into my Mac Pro desktop, never letting an HP CD near the machine. It brought up a little picture of the printer and just worked.If you put the Windows CD in, even on XP, it's the beginning of the end for you. Don't buy one of these things. I'm going back to my Xerox scanner and Samsung color laser printer. They might not be \\"all in one\\", but they work flawlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vincent Price's Voice","review":"I usually enjoy the Universal Horror Films of the Forties because they are quick, not to be taken seriously, and very entertaining. This film is no exception, and in fact is better than most of them. Vincent Price stars as a man wrongly accused of murder who is injected by his friend John Sutton (a doctor and the brother of the Claude Rains character in the first film) with a serum to make him invisible and able to find the real killer. Nan Grey is Price's girlfriend who helps him along the way. The special effects are good, and the climactic chase between Price and the killer is very well done. Price was a perfect choice for this film, which requires an actor with a great voice, since that is the actor's only asset for most of the film. Price (like the great Claude Rains before him) had an excellent, distinctive voice that he uses to great effect, portraying his descent into madness superbly. This film is a lot of fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting, Exhausting","review":"In Father and Son: A Novel, the star is the villain, the antihero. Instead of hating him for all his dastardly, savage deeds, it's easy to care for him. He is, in a sense, a wayward vehicle, a device gone bad by way of circumstance, killing or crippling anything in its way. Larry Brown weaves a tale of tragedy that leaves the reader exhausted, reflective. After all, how many of us, if we suffered and survived the same boyhood as this criminal, would have emerged with any greater sanity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant!","review":"I am honestly not much of a reader, but I had to read this novel for one of my college courses and it was truly excellent! Highly suspenseful and intriguing, Brown gives you just enough to want to keep reading. The relationships are exquisite and the characters, well developed and interesting. I guarantee you won't want to put it town! A definite MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality read.","review":"Larry Brown's \\"Father and Son\\" will sit you on your heels and make you consider the responsibility of the parent in the future of the child. The hero is the bad guy and he is the soul of evil. By the end of the book, just reading his name will chill your soul. You will find yourself wondering if this man was the \\"bad seed\\" of sixties belief, or the product of a horrifying childhood who took it all to heart. Glen is the man so many women find attractive... distant, dangerous. Bobby is the one our mother's prayed we'd bring home. The plot is complex and the characters well-drawn, and thoughtful. I truly loved this read. It has it all. A good-hearted woman in love with a two-timing man.... and a knight in shining armor. A story of love, betrayal, and hope. Characters that shine, language that provokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Hemingway? Bukowski? Flannery O'Conner? Read this book","review":"Maybe you have to have a hankering to mix with the dark side to enjoy this book. A lack of such desire is the only thing I can figure that would account for the spate of bad reviews from other readers.My guess is that Larry Brown, personally and face to face, knows the Devil. I suspect he knows a few angels, too. The man sure has the goods on the conflicts of good and evil in the human heart.This is not a book for the Danielle Steele crowd or the Sue Grafton crowd or even the John Grisham crowd. But if you like the real thing, 190 proof blow the top of your head off literature, read this book and any other Larry Brown material you can get your hands on. The man can purely write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art of the ugly","review":"This book was selected for our book-group. As I read the first 100 pages, I kept wondering am I reading the right book? The horror, the horror, indeed. Killing animals, raping women, murdering men, running over children, being drunk are all aspects of our culture like other horrific and banal issues such as runaway pollution and overflowing toilets. Not something I want to read about in its 'realistically' raw and detailed form. But art works in mysterious ways; perhaps this book may be just your 'cup of tea'."},{"rating":"2","title":"My personal fave Larry Brown title","review":"This book can be considered a screenplay for a film. I don't know how to describe it adequately, maybe a Tarantino-meets-In the Heat of the Night affair. I read this book literally in one sitting and still ponder it to this day. The hot sun, the cold Coca Cola in a glass bottle, beer cans with peel-off tops, bugs, old cars, Vietnam, Church on Sundays...Brown covered all the bases in this one (We won't get into the Juke Joint Monkey). I felt like I was put in a time machine and made to see my home state 30 years ago. I recommend this novel to anyone interested in a good Southern writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Second best to 'Fay' so far!","review":"Just as in 'Fay' (which I recommend if you haven't yet read it!) - Larry Brown brings to life all the sides of his characters, all their flaws out in full glory and paraded around. He makes them real to you, so that you imagine you are sitting in the corner watching it all unfold right in front of your own eyes and not just in your imagination. The realness of his stories - even though it is all from his imagination - the other side of your brain says \\"I bet if I went to the right little out of the way, road-to-nowhere town in Mississippi, I would find these people living these lives!\\" It is such a refreshing change in storytelling, very believable, not so far out of the \\"norm\\" that you don't really believe it couldn't be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a modern classic","review":"Larry Brown hits his stride with this wild, dark Southern gothic. Imagine Hemingway taking on Faulkner's more disturbing themes, getting mean drunk on whiskey and heading to the typer to vent it all in stark, lovely prose, and you get a hint of the power of this novel.And if you like this one, give Dirty Work a try. It's one of the best novels to come out of the South in the last 10 or 12 years and one of the best anti-war novels ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Father's day gift","review":"Not \\"Dirty Work\\", but having own his two short stories also, I find Father and Son a wonderful read . Larry Brown is one of the few writers that I will always buy and read !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does this book get good reviews?","review":"I bought this book because it received several good reviews. It really must have been a slow month for books. Larry Brown's writing style is poor, at best, maybe even awful, and I can't imagine why anyone would think differently. Check this out: \\"He held it in his hand and laid it on the seat of the car and looked at it. He had a full tank of gas in the car, but it was drinking it pretty fast. He didn't know if it was because it had set up for so long or what. He thought about riding over to Puppy's and getting him to look at it, but he was probably working today.\\" (Pg. 209) If you like that paragraph, you'll like the book, because it doesn't get any better. I kept reading, expecting something interesting to happen, but it didn't. What a waste of time. Brown's style reminds me of Stephen King's: \\"print the first draft, editing takes too much time\\". I suggest Patrick O'Brian. Or George Carlin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty dang boring","review":"Best I could tell, beer, coffee and cigarettes were the main characters in this book.

Although they accomplished that purpose, the sound quality on them is far from spectacular and the construction is CHEAP. The plastic slider broke about a month after i bought them, and the actual earpieces are held in by nothing more than a few low quality plastic tabs. They constantly fall out and hang by no more than a wire, at which point you have to try to stuff it back in. They are also uncomfortable after you wear them for more than 45 minutes.For the price, i would recommend you go for some sony or sennheiser phones. They will sound much better, and last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"I recently bought and returned these headphones.

The sound quality was far subpar, mathing up unfavorably to my 10 dollar sony mdr-xd100s and even worse the left speaker buzzed uncontrollably, weak. I, after a couple days of use have since returned them and bough a pair of seinheiser hd 280 pros a huge upgrade, hopefully anybody who reads this review will steer clear of the woeful G.I.'s and get a pair of real headphones since these are bassicaly a 60 dollar piece of plastic jewelry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Treasury of Bible Wisdom","review":"A timeless collection of poignant Bible verses with succinct explanations of how it applies to your daily life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just about perfect!","review":"Finally, briefs that fit right and are well made!

Some of the pieces, notably the Seconde Stravaganze by Giovanni de Macque and the Seventh Toccata by Rossi, make use of chromatic harmonies popular during this period, which do produce an \\"out-of-tune\\" effect in mean tone tuning, but that was the point! If this at first seems grating, it becomes intriguing and appealing after a few listenings. A highlight of the recording is Frescobaldi's impressive Cento Partite sopra Passacagli, considered to be one of the finest pieces of variations of the 17th century.

Even if you only see the red devil outfit for a few small panels, you don't miss it. You know DD is all over these bleeding, tear filled and wonderfully suffering pages. As always, you have to feel for poor Matt Murdoch. Also, Bullseye is there, as no DD-Elektra tale can be complete without getting him into the action in a very meaningful way. A visceral, visual experiernce, somewhat disjointed (in a good kind of way, a la Blade Runner). Gives deep meaning to the term \\"graphic novel\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good finale","review":"I was fine with Elektra's original death and really didn't see the need for this story, but it was impressive nonetheless. Matt Murdock spends the whole story as himself, not Daredevil, adding to the serious tone. The purpose behind the story is a bit weak, but it works. Actually, the better parts involve the psychological elements, plus getting to follow M.M. through his daily routine. The fight sequences, while beautifully executed, didn't seem as interesting as the rest.I feel that this is Miller's artistic high point - the artwork is very clean, and Lynn Varley's colors add tremendous depth to the pages. I wish that Miller's current projects had this look, as I can't stand Sin City's chiaroscuro, and 300 looked too sketchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable Sander","review":"I am very pleased with this sanders performance, It produces extremely smooth finishes, but it is designed as a finishing sander, so either a random orbit or belt sander should be used first to sand off the rough spots before this precision tool comes in to play.

The other live recordings of songs from the 1st album are from a San Francisco gig in 1966. Although these 1966 recordings aren't as well recorded as the previous tracks, the historical significance of the Elevators doing psychedelia in the Love Capitol at a time when the Airplane were still a Mamas and Papas throwback makes up for any minor lack of fidelity in the recording process. The instrumental \\"Levitation\\" is a studio workout.

As a first-timer, I naturally have questions about just about everything that is happening to my body and my baby. Dr. Thurston's \\"no-nonsense\\" approach is very refreshing!!! His answers are straight-forward, to the point, and easy to understand. I'm sure I'd be calling the doctor's office daily if I didn't have this magnificant book. I will be recommending it to all my friends!! LOVE IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One Of His Best!","review":"I've been a big fan of John Farris from when he published his first novel -- Harrsion High --while (I believe) he was still a high school student. To me, his best works are The Fury and Sharp Practice. For about the first third of Dragonfly, I thought this book was going to rival his best. However, the last two-thirds became predictable and unrealistic. Farris' depiction of the women in this book are love-starved, easily conned, defenseless and in desparate need of a man's attention. For this male reader, these characters were poorly developed and it seemed more like a Harlequin romance novel than a thriller. While Farris tried hard to create suspense and surprises in Dragonfly, he didn't succeed as far as I'm concerned. Hopefully, Farris will recapture his ability to create edge-of-the-seat suspense, strong plots and credible characters. I'll be looking forward to the return of the \\"old\\" Farris in his future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware schitzophrenia..........","review":"If you like the first few pages read somewhere in the middle before you buy the book. I picked it up from the library based on what I expected to be an economically written thriller (first hundred pages or so) and found myself in such a confused zoo (characters, writing, and plot) that I cannot believe the same person wrote both parts unless there was some tragic event in his life about page 100 or the deadline situation became so desperate that anything would do. I believe the last part of the book is \\"southern gothic\\" of which I know nothing (based on this example everyone goes hysterical, guilty and stupid) so this is not saying you won't like it, just be warned if you are looking for a thriller or a coherently written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Grinder/Sander especially with fiberglass","review":"Borrowed one of these (then bought one) and used to grind out an old floor that was glassed into a '65 fiberglass runabout.

Granted there are some sharp insights scattered around but nothing to repay the effort required to wade through the self indulgent verbiage. I threw it across the room in exasperation with ten pages to go! Maybe I don't have the intellectual capacity to appreciate Mr. Amis' point of view but it is a severely demanding task to finish this one. My advice is read The Moronic Inferno instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't speak so good","review":"London Fields? Probably one of the best books i've read. The Information, the best I can say about it is that it should be required reading for anyone about to take the SATs. Amis pulls words from thin air, many of which I wasn't able to find in my Webster's Collegiate. Obviously he's well read but Jesus, what does schadenfreude mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius consumed by the same cultural rot he describes","review":"Martin Amis has talent to burn, but why spend it in a bonfire like this? The Rachel Papers was funny, shrewd, brilliant, and London Fields deserved to win the Booker, but Amis seems to have entered a tailspin. Time has shown that his satirization of money and fame was indicative of a fascination that is neither objective nor indeed properly critical. Perhaps he was trying to exorcise his own demons? Unfortunately the demons seem set to finish him off as a writer for good, which is a tragedy, because he could have been one of the greats."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this book about?","review":"Frankly, what is all the fuss about this book?

Then you question your own sanity for persevering for so long.I have never read another Martin Amis book but still urge everyone to read 'Lucky Jim' written by the clearly more gifted father of Martin Amis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately tiresome and disappointing","review":"Martin Amis is a very talented writer. He just needs to find something worth writing about. This lengthy saga of a failed writer isn't it. When writers start writing about being a writer, this is almost always a bad sign. Better to reread \\"Money.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The book that goes in circles","review":"I'm halfway through and can't see where this book is going. Amis comes up with some inventive language, but the story line limps along. Perhaps something gets lost in translation. I'm pushing myself to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"London, What a glorious shithole it is","review":"A marvellous tale of revenge in literary circles. funny,sad and sadomasochistic. One mans genius is another mans poison, so the story unfolds in a high new style that Mr Amis has surely made his own.Anyone who has ever lived in London knows where the characters are comming from. Dickensian ? .. could be, but what makes this book a must buy is the record advance paid by the publisher to Amis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me feeling empty","review":"Martin Amis is not what you would call a \\"generous\\" writer. Talented, perhaps. Witty or original, maybe. But not generous. He frequently strings together words and sentences that sparkle and dazzle with their elegance, that sing to the ear in a very satisfying way. But there's just something about his writing that makes me think that he wasn't doing it for us, the readers. He was doing it for himself. There's no emotional connection between author and reader in this book. At the end I was left feeling like I had been made love to by a skilled yet uncaring lover, a narcissist who performs her act not for my pleasure but for the satisfaction of watching herself in the mirror. I want and deserve more than that from a writer. Writing is more than just putting words down on a page, more than just creating characters and plots. Writing is about the relationship between author and reader, and that's what is missing here."},{"rating":"1","title":"just say 'no'","review":"I'm sorry I ever started reading this book. The writing is so good that I couldn't stop -- but man . . .Somewhat like the fictional author's fictional readers, my nose started to bleed and most of my goldfish died. You need to be really hard up for a book to read to knowingly choose this one.After much cursing and gnashing of teeth, I finally finished it.Somebody owes me money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading, but not his best","review":"I've read about 5 of Amis's novels and must admit that, while brilliant and laugh-out-loud funny in places, there are far too many passages where I found myself wondering if I was just dim or the message wasn't getting across. While some (many?) would place their votes in favor of the former, I think Amis wasn't quite sure what to do with several of the characters, so he has them intertwine with Tull and Barry in ways that make no sense. All that being said, it is still well worth reading if only to savor the moment when Tull realizes how best to make Gwynn miserable. All that typing....."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"This was a grind to get through. I hate oblique writing, and, of course, some people equate oblique writing with genius...well, this book has the oblique writing, but not the genius. I like natural writing, a la Tolstoy. Anyway, the story's sort of amusing. But the postmodern injections of Amis' own personal anecdotes (in a FICTION novel!!!) are jarring and out of place. Amis has confessed to egomania, but just because it's there, doesn't mean you have to display it. Some passages in this book are first rate, though. The plot can basically be summed up by Gore Vidal's famous line: \\"When a friend succeeds, a little something in me dies.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and unflinching","review":"The Information is a devastating and relentless book. It is at times hard to handle--the world Amis creates is so bleak and fraught with petty envy and manipulation that it's hard not to get overwhelmed by it. That said, it is without question a brilliant work, and though it left me feeling ripped open, I had to admire the talent on display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there a better observer writing today?","review":"Whatever else you may think about Martin Amis, he sees the world and reports it better than any one writing today. The man is incapable of thinking in cliches. His view of the US from a brit-writer-on-tour's pov is priceless. And he does it without once bashing the obese who have become the prime target of every other euro-brit-ozian who writes about yanks.If you're looking for a lovely, linear narrative (as some below seem to be) look elsewhere. If you're to sort who liked \\"Withnail and I\\" try this. It's the next act.My reading of this one was long overdue. Glad I finally got around to it. A true gem. My only problem with it was that every few minutes I had to fight back the urge to read out loud to whoever else was around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that it???","review":"This book infuriated me. Amis is an author who I always promised myself I would enjoy. I had owned the book for years, and after a few aborted attempts to get into it, I finally got hooked. The principals contained within the novel are fine, pitching Gwyn Barry's Lust & Greed against Richard Tull's Jealousy. However, the plot and the characters are so over-developed that there is never a chance to tie up all the loose ends. After persevering with the book for 300 pages expecting a firework finish, the fuse never lights."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Information is a Hoot!","review":"This book reminds me of something my mother use to tell me: \\"You've got a bad attitude, and nothing good can come from that!\\" Richard Tull is a miserable, compulsive, obsessive character and his nemesis Gwen is an innane slug. Get'em Richard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice style, too much bile","review":"I guess Martin Amis set out to write a book that would often be unpleasant to read, depicting a world that is frequently hateful. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's poignant, often it's beautifully written, but finally The Information is just a rant. The strong overtones of racial and gender prejudice and the jolly view of alcoholism also seem to slip across the line from the foibles of an anti-hero to the noisome biases of the author. In the end, Amis loses control of the abundant venom and it poisons his whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupendously Bad.","review":"The first 50 pages are funny. All the rest are dead boring. A bitter boring feud between writers that oozes nothing more than senility. After 100 pages this becomes one of the most morose novels I've ever read. You really can't stomach it after a while, it just plainly goes nowhere.A mixture of irrelevance, unfunnyness, and stupidity permeates you. A story about two bad writers written by a bad writer, and in the end who cares? Martin was never profound, clever, or imaginative, he was just funny occasionally and he's not anymore here.Thanks to the internet media this guy's hype has started to fade and people take him for what he is now, a very, very mediocre writer. Neither profound, nor clever, and certainly not imaginative. If you want to plough though 400 pages of garbage about two lesser writers squabbling by all means be my guest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish silliness","review":"Well written but halfbaked, and ultimately pointless as usual when it comes to Amis. Very funny, and sometimes stimulating, but not satisfying as as whole. Amis is mimicking himself. Too bad, because he's not worth mimicking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mimicry","review":"With this novel, Martin Amis began imitating another current present-day writer: Martin Amis. He really has become almost a parody of himself. Perhaps he knows that he is incapble of receiving a negative review, so he feels he can just ease back and write what only APPEARS to be an important novel. Yes, the book has some bite, but it's ultimately empty: it's bite for the sake of bite alone, with nothing behind it whatsoever. Hopefully, Martin Amis will start being Martin Amis again rather than just a washed-out copy. His best book is \\"Money\\" and that was ages ago. He had fire in his belly then, had a point to make. Now the whole point is pointlessness itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for MIT kids","review":"MIT kids graduate with a profound sense that the world is and should be a meritocracy. There is always then that horrible moment when they are forced to confront the fact that the best things in life go to the ass-kissers and incompetents with big PR budgets. This book is for them. It is about Richard Tull, a brilliant writer of modern fiction. His books are so great that that they are not only unreadable but actually make readers too ill to finish. He starves while watching his friend Gwyn Barry make millions writing tripe with a sentimental appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Retrospect","review":"In terms of maturity, \\"The Information\\" is a more mature work than either \\"Money\\" or \\"London Fields.\\" This is not to say that it is necessarily a better novel. Just like saying \\"The Last Tycoon\\" is better than \\"The Great Gatsby\\" or \\"Tender is the Night.\\" It is tedious in parts,... and difficult to understand for non-artists. My only hope is that Amis writes a sequel to this book. Richard Tull is more sympathetic than Richard III (I hope!) and deserves to be expanded upon.

I then bought Tonight's Decision and loved it. So, I had high hopes for Viva Emptiness, and never before has a band delivered better than Katatonia has with their latest release. Every single second of every single song is beautifully dark, and yet lively. I haven't taken the CD out of my CD player for a week, which is a feat considering how many CDs I have and how fickle I am about music. From songs like Ghost Of The Sun to Omerta, their heavy stuff if equally as good as the softer songs.

Their style is a mix between heavy and somber, slow and mid-paced, with mainly clean vocals and mainly distorted guitar, but they use the clean guitars a lot more often than their peers. There is some incredible songwriting on this release, lots of dual guitar work but not what you'd expect. They are as progressive as Tool or Dream Theater, heavy as Venom or \\"...Puppets\\" era Metallica, somber like Opeth or Pink Floyd, but also sometimes catchy like Black Sabbath, CKY, Black Label Society or Lacuna Coil. If you like ANY of the bands I mentioned, or bands like Perfect Circle, Rush, even Korn, Godsmack or Disturbed, you will definitely like Katatonia!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diverse and melodic.","review":"Katatonia has surpassed their last release with an album brimming with musical experimentation. Mixing metal/jazz/fusion and plain old down to earth rock, Viva Emptiness is an exploratory and wonderfully diverse album.

Winnicott (1896-1971) was a pediatrician and then a child analyst whose contributions to theories of child development and psychology (mothering, love, language, attachment, dependency, anxiety and many other topics) were enormous. Phillips' book illuminates Winnicott's body of work and includes a chronology. The tone is respectful and insightful and Phillips' knack for skillful explanation and analysis is here. But he knows Winnicott's work -- and life -- by heart, and has written extensively on him elsewhere, and occasionally in this work he meshes the two -- biography and work -- so seamlessly that I wished for more.

This strap is definitely more comfortable than the stock strap that my Nikon came with, however, it is not as comfortable as I thought it would be. The foam is nice, and the rubber grippers on it are great. My issue, and maybe it's just me, is that the edge of the foam is actually a little sharp, if you can believe that foam can be sharp. It's a thick and firm foam with perfect 90-degree square edges, and when I have it on I can feel it dig in a bit on my skin if I am not wearing a collared shirt. To fix this, I actually filed the edges down a big and rounded them and now it is perfect, but I thought that this was worth reporting.

One word of warning: you should buy the heat sink paste cleaner kit and clean the old paste really well, on both the graphic chip as well as the memory chips (the latter will be cooled by the small aluminum heat sinks which come with this product).I bought the Arctic cleaning solutions for that. Quite often people also buy the Arctic Silver heat-conducting paste.

I would love to get the HD 6990 or the HD 5970 but for now I'll dream. For those that know, GPU mining can put the card under full load and run very very HOT! With the original stock cooler, when my card was mining it would hover ~95c and sometimes spike up to 108c. I'm surprised my card didn't fry on me, but we can attribute that to the fine quality engineering from the good folks at ATI. After replacing the stock VGA cooler with the Zalman VF900-cu, under full load when Bitcoin mining the highest I've seen my card temp get up to is ~60c. Thats a full 30 degrees cooler, and the VF900-cu also has a fan speed controller for if you want maximum cooling or quiet operation. Very happy with this product would definitely recommend if your doing high end GPU intensive work whether gaming or number crunching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy install and quiet","review":"My main reason for getting this was the fan on my video card was quite noisy.

Contest Music, written in the early seventies, is, with out a doubt, my favorite. Being a member of the Salvation Army, most of his music was published by this wonderful organization, and therefore required some spiritual thought. Although Contest Music was not written for the Salvation Army and has no overtly spirtual theme, it is very spiritual music. Mr Heaton's true character shines through this wonderful music. You cannot listen to this piece without thinking beyond the notes. Some say, it is the best piece written for the brass band.

I have many recordings of Dvoark's 9th, on both LP and CD -- all different from each other, most delightful in their own way. And while conductors are entitled to their interpretations, I think that Bernstein was smoking something serious when he recorded this disk. It is, in my view, a travesty\\u0003-- unless Bernstein meant to be silly, in which case he succeeded. As to the sonics, one has the impression that Sony is trying to do to SACD what it did to Beta, which is to torpedo the better format. This 9th was clearly recorded with a forest of mikes, and with \\"hot strings\\" that were the fashion of the day. Simply awful -- particularly when contrasted with other SACD releases that are entirely breathtaking. If Antonin was alive, he'd drop dead on the spot listening to this.

After installing the new igniter, the grill still failed to ignite properly. I tried 3 different propane tanks to see if there was something in the gas supply that created the problem but the igniter failed to work with any of them. There's a design or production flaw somewhere in the gas igniter system. If you purchase this product, plan to have a lot of matches handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Pleased with my Weber","review":"When I opened the box and saw all of the pieces, I was skeptical that I could assemble the grill.

The wheels lock to keep the cart from moving. The ignition feature is a winner. I lit my coals easily and did not have any problems installing the tank. The features I like best are the thermometer, the ample work space, the rack underneath for holding platters, and the charcoal bin. The work platform is an ideal place to put your digital thermometer so you can monitor the temperature of the meat as it cooks under the dome).

There is only one level for cooking, so you have to be careful to control the temperature.

For the Christian dieter however, we are told to present all our requests before God. How or why would God care about that kind of prayer? I always felt it selfish, but knew I couldn't succeed even I didn't turn that part of my life over to Him as well. This book provides not only a daily devotion that can be applied to many areas, not just limited to dieting, but also provides earnest prayers that you can use for a basis of your own to turn selfish desires into a godly will. Not only will this book help you keep the desire and focus of not giving up on your weight loss program, whatever it may be, but it focuses your need on God and his importance over our struggle with weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This book is such a blessing to me.

Giving God your eating habits and your size will be the best thing you can do for yourself. This book IS worth getting. Please buy it and find out for yourself how much it can help you.

When Emily and Rose begin to play with their aunt's long abandoned doll house, the doll family who live there discover that their baby, Walter, is missing. The doll family's problem nicely mirrors the difficulties the sisters' family face without being too heavy handed. By sending the girls mental images, the dolls are able to communitcate their need to find Walter and enlist the help of the girls. Rose's anger and the fighting between the sisters are well drawn, and are wonderfully commented upon and analyzed by the warm, old-fashioned dolls. Emily is convinced that reuniting the doll family will ease her own family's transition into a new phase of their lives, and it gently does. A must read for doll lovers of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I think.","review":"This product is very well equiped with a tuner and a case and the item itself is also of good materials.

Michael White's men are all one and interchangable. Perhaps, a male himself, he is better able to detatch himself from the female characters. They are real: unsteady, afraid, human, and a must-read. I have read his novels and find that this carries over; the female voices in A Brother's Blood and The Blind Side of the Heart are captivating - the narrator in A Dream of Wolves pales in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scholarly but foundationally flawed","review":"An author who claims, 'Christianity is powered by a myth' is not Christian. An author who refuses to consider the scorching criticism of the Jewish prophets of their own nation's sin (and that of other nations) lacks perspective on Judaism. An author who claims ab initio that hostility towards Jews (his main but profoundly inadequate definition of anti-Semitism) is always baseless is not well qualified to analyse the subject.I am sympathetic with Nicholls concern to remedy manifold and extreme Christian evils against the Jews, and the tidal wave of new anti-Semitism in the form of anti-Zionism renders this more urgent. Sadly this analysis and this remedy is of little value other than as a partial description of causes.

In addition, there seemed to be too many generalizations and conclusions drawn without proper citing of materials. As a parent and a provider in the field of FASD, I found this text to be too focused on the negative. I am concerned that language used will only strengthen the negative perspectives others tend to have on our children. This book uses terms such as \\"stubborn\\" to describe behavior. We work very hard to change other providers perspectives that our children are \\"stubborn\\" and somehow willfully doing the things they do. Too many of our children are simply written off as being oppositional when in fact, we need a greater appreciation for the symptoms that are caused by their brain damage.

Anthony weaves a very good plot and has a great icky bug. I especially liked the just desserts one character got (don't want to reveal too much). Yeah, poetic justice!I did find two things startling though. In two places, he jumps to the future, taking the reader out of the story. One involves hugging his dad. The other is learning that girls get nervous on a first date too. I am surprised his editor let him get away with that!

The main premise, a tracked submergible, just did not make any sense to me. And the technical inaccuracies were too big to ignore; it is not that easy to arm and detonate a nuclear bomb, or to tap into a fiber-optic cable.I also think that the terrorist sub-plot overpowers the main plot. The end is more coincidental than climactic. Only a small part of the book is actual submarine action. The main character's role was more to tie together the two stories than to lead the plot.Finally I think some of the character development was too elaborate (eg. the gardening terrorist), compared to the almost rushed action. The hotel room scene seemed longer than the final sub battle.\\"In the tradition of Tom Clancy\\" it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Had More Downs Than Ups\\"","review":"I can't complain about the plot, but the execution could have been better. First off, even though Cmdr. Brad Mackenzie is headlined as the hero of this book, I felt the story would have been stronger without him. Practically every piece of Mac's dialogue sounded like a classroom lecture at Annapolis. During the obligatory final submarine battle, he was totally useless. In addition, the USS Bowfin's captain kept talking like a hero from a 1930s weekly movie serial.Still, there were some characters I found interesting. Russian Spetsnaz commando Mikhail Borisov and Scots commando Colin Stewart were true warriors. Confident, dedicated to their people, and never afraid to take on any mission. Borisov actually came off as a likable guy, considering he was on the wrong side.While the story had nice plotting, the ending just didn't live up to my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky moody alien ambiences with feeling.","review":"Mouse on Mars's most accessible and least quirky album.

(Not a bad comparison mind you, think the Orb's first two releases for reference). \\"Frosch\\" is my favorite track, it sets things to a good start, but the rest are too midtempo with not alot going on in them. I must admit that \\"Future Dub\\" has a nicely hypnotic rythym. I recommend this only to the die-hard M.O.M. fans who want to collect the band's entire output. There is little on Vulvaland to even hint at the style of present-day Mouse On Mars.

The onlyadvise worth anything is that New Zealand is a wonderful place to live, don't tell anyone your plans, and tear up your credit cards.My advise to would-be fleeing perps is \\"face the music\\" here or live in misery somewhere else! The vapid descriptions the author paints of life on the lam would have me jumping out a window. The most important issue the author doesn't address is how to escape yourself.

Markets tend to be one of the more immersive activities tourists can experience, this book gives explanation of which markets in which cities, on which days can be found. Certainly worth buying in addition to the main Lonley Planet book. One could also find good advice of 'foodie' blogs in and around Hanoi / Saigon.This particular version (Vietnam) gives a full pardon to establishing dietary restrictions in terms of unwashed vegetables and overall quality of meat.

Clearly somebody who loves food, probably a food geek. This means that the benchmark for a good book is high. This book contains the basics of Vietnamese ingredients and styles. No problem with that. However, more should be provided in a specialised book - much more. For instance a better distinction of different kinds of pho, etc. This would probably be hard for a westerner to accomplish without help of a local.

Sometimes out of sight but never really out of mind. I'd like to see Cas a little more but at least he shows up more than last year. The Felcia Day episode was a real stand-out as well as the Looney Tunes ep. All in all a much better season that last year.Off topic...has anyone seen the book cover for \\"Wilder:The Chosen One\\" by Christina Dodd? You're on Amazon now, take a look at it. Definitely Sam Winchester. Maybe some new money making scheme for the boys?

We tune in, or pay Amazon, to watch Sam and Dean do their thing. We do not tune in to see a few no name actors plod their way through a mediocre script with fake amateur camera work. These actors simply are not in the same class as Ackles and Padalecki and watching them was, well, kind of tedious.I am voting this episode down because I would like to discourage the producers from ever wasting another episode. This episode could easily have been part of some failed series. Not an episode in the 8th season of a hit like Supernatural. Please, producers, never do another episode with so little Sam and Dean in it.If I had known that the time was mostly taken up with no-name actors, plodding through an undistinguished script, with so little of Sam and Dean, I would have skipped it completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst episode ever","review":"I adore \\"Supernatural\\" but this is the worst episode of all so far.

I hope this is the last one like this and they return to following our guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This episode has to be the worst thing the series has ever done. No one tunes into SN to watch a bad home video with no talent actors and actresses -acting out a badly written story. It was painful.I overlook the misogyny and total boys club attitude of this show because good supernatural thrillers are far and few between, add in they have killed off Ellen and Bobby, who gave the boys their family-base and then they took out the rock music and then the car for an entire year.

Back story is weak as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The magic of this series is gone","review":"I hope this is the last season. I loved Supernatural when it was borderline scary. The old scripts were pretty good and aside from a few episodes (ghostchasers) they were clever. Now, however, there are more stupid episodes than good ones. Dean and Sam seem to be just coasting through the episodes. The loss of Bobby and his subsequent replacement with \\"Garth\\" (oh God why...if there were ever a annoying character it is him) was a stupid move. Goodbye Supernatural, may you rest in peace instead of continuing on as a shambling mockery of what you once were."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much of this season is boring.","review":"Is it just me who is sick of these flashbacks to hotel rooms where soppy mushy dialogue fills up half an episode. Its like Days of our Lives thrown in and a cheap and easy way of filling up space. These guys are suppose to be hunters killing supernatural beings - the story now has such a formulate to it. Surely the producers and writwrs can be more creative in giving viewrs more entertainment value with unusual beings and creatures appearing. Something new and exciting. The characters are becoming older and the show is looking tired and has very little bang - special effects are old from series 3 and 4. i now watch a bit of a show or just switch it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiger Mom ??","review":"If for no other reason, this episode of Supernatural should be watched for Jensen Ackles' performance. He is rocking Dean Winchester this season, now that he has some meat to work with. The Purgatory scenes with him and his vampire friend, Benny (Ty Ollson) are excellent acting, lighting, and editing. The episode was good for setting up the mytharc for this season. Supernatural is an awesome TV series with very talented people, both acting and production, working on it. I wouldn't miss it, and I'm not a big TV or sci-fi/horror fan. This one I like, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture quality was jerky","review":"Supernatural is a great show. Enough said about that. If you've made it to season 8, then no review is needed. I was disappointed in Amazons picture quality though. I was expecting to be able to play it through my tv but found that when I streamed it through my computer to my tv the picture got jerky at times. Netflix streaming is significantly better and smoother. I had high hopes for Amazin to get in the streaming market but they just aren't there yet. Downloading and watching videos works great.

I've had a few that were not in my favorites list, but \\"Bitten\\" is the first episode that I have EVER deleted from my pc library. We have had episodes in the past where the Winchester brothers were not central stage (Ghostfacers, Weekend At Bobby's, etc.),those episodes had other qualities that made them very worth the time to watch. \\"Bitten\\" is, in short, a waste of film. Yes, the brothers do appear in several shots and give a short analysis of what they think might be happening. This episode however, does not stand up to the quality of the Supernatural brand. I am voicing my own oppion on this, watch it and evaluate it for yourself. I already have season 8 on pre-order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh... found footage.","review":"I am a bit disappointed with this episode. It wasn't bad, but I am no fan of found footage films, for one, and for another, this was pretty much a straight rip off of \\"Chronicle\\" -- nerdy, socially ill-adjusted kid gets superhuman powers, and soon becomes an amoral monster, all while filming it. I love this series; at its best, it's great. But greatness is seldom achieved by copying others, and that's what they did here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy to see the boys heading back to the old ways","review":"I and my husband have been a fan of Supernatural from episode one, but the show lost alot of it's grit in seasons six and seven. It became painful to watch the required ten minutes of them talking about their feelings, and it seemed like one of them was always crying. I am happy to report that season eight seems to be a return to the old days, feeling much like season four. There's alot of slow build-up, plenty of off-canon episodes, and best of all there's like no crying. We also are hearing the seventies and eighties songs again, which was always one of my favorite things. The show is being headed by a new person now, and it is obvious and much better. The bottom line is if you liked this show several years ago but gave up on it, now's the time to pick it back up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Supernatural","review":"This season is also excellent, full of excitement. But for those like me, who weren't able to watch some episodes this was a great option. No advertising, no interruptions and a plus if u can't watch the whole episode at once, you will be able to keep on seeing it whenever u can. And you know that Supernatural, meaning Sam and Dean are worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries too hard to be creative","review":"I must side with the majority of the reviews here. Maybe I've seen a worst episode in the past 7 seasons but none come to mind. The new director and writer put too much effort into what is an apparent goal of keeping the show fresh by tackling the storyline through a different angle, or maybe they just wanted to give the stars of the show most of the week off when making this episode. It is a shame because this season started off with one of the best episodes and perhaps set the bar too high. Keep with what works, and definately don't put less of the stars in the episodes, put more (hint, it is time for Castiel to come back and revive this season)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After watching Supernatural since it came out, this episode was one of the worst Ive seen. I found myself mostly uninterested and bored with the premise and nothing about it was a surprise.

With GURPS, you can adapt the rules in such a way to fit any setting, be it hack and slash fantasy or superhero mayhem or cyberpunk thriller. It isn't as innovative as systems such as Fate, but regardless, it is comprehensive enough to satisfy any roleplayer who wants a realistic experience. Also, characters are made from points not levels, so unlike DnD where higher level == higher combat prowess, a higher point total means you can spend the points on whatever you want. This unfortunately makes it a little more difficult for the GM, but not overly much.The one bad thing about the product physically is the binding, the first copy that I ordered had fallen entirely out of its binding and I've heard reports of editions falling apart within a few weeks, so maybe pick up the PDF from [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great System","review":"The fourth edition of GURPS doesn't disappoint. This time, the basic book has been split&#12288;into two volumes. This one deals with the creation of characters and can be considered to be the player's guide.

I can't believe people are raving about it. The new version barely addresses the problems of the previous one, is poorly laid out and hard to read, and many changes were made to parts of the game where there were no problems to address.

There must be an already restored version of the movie somewhere in the vaults of Apple Corps, but I suspect there's still a lot of red tape or hurdles to overcome for a wide release.

What we witnessed however was The Beatles coming apart at the seams and Paul McCartney's desperate, but fruitless, attempts to keep the stuffing from falling out! Those who watched this film on its first release were given a glimmer of hope at the time with the brilliant, now famous, impromptu Roof top performance. It was a cold drizzly day that welcomed the band to play together live again like no other band would play again. It was the end of decade, the end of an era and the end of the greatest Rock and Roll band the world had ever known. A poignant occasion is marked as one Member steps up to the microphone and says to a visible audience that only just out numbers the film crew and themselves. \\"I'd like to thank you all on behalf of the group and myself, and I hope we passed the audition\\".Bring on the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Running Time","review":"On the product description provided by Amazon the running time is listed as 113 minutes.

I own an original copy which I took from a rental store back in 1986 but that too is VHS and the DVD bootleg versions are inferior since they are just copies of the VHS version.

However, going through the workbook alone without these things would still be life changing if a group is not available near you.

Basically, and in accordance with the title, this tome deals with how books were either destroyed or preserved in Nazi occupied countries.Each chapter is written by a different person, and therefore offers a unique voice and perspective on literary censorship. The standout chapters for me were \\"'The Jewish Question' and Censorship in the USSR\\" - which offers a great glimpse of how governments can slowly turn to censorship, and \\"When the Printed Word Celebrates the Human Spirit\\" - in which the author talks about the library kept up at her concentration camp.This book offers an informative, interesting look on literary censorship; and given the variety of authors, everyone who is seeking to learn more about this subject will likely find at least one or two chapters to be particularly useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty package, but...","review":"I was not happy with this book, I found it boring without pictures, just black-white text.

It's layered loud and melodic. This album is most sucessful with the boy girl harmonies. That stuff makes me want to melt. \\"Rubles\\" is a skipper though. It's also creeper -- takes a bit to sink in.It's not throuoghly innovative though, actually some songs kinda sound similar to Stereolab's Switched on Th' Faith Healers (but still Seely's own).The strange thing is, as active as it is, it's not attention demanding. The cooing vocals kinda draw you into whatever you're doing, weather that be reading, painting, driving, sleeping, whathaveyou -- it does what good semi-ambient music does.

This page-turner will make you melt as June describes her passionate tales of love with Elvis, and readers will find themselves falling in love with the often funny, always tender young man.

If any of Elvis's girlfriends could write a book about him no one could beat widdle bitty June's. You have to read the book to figure out where the widdle bitty comes from.

I have used it in my university history courses and it has enabled me write essays that approach the origins of the First World War from quite a different perspective than the current Anglo/American view that Germany was entirely responsible for both wars. After a thorough study of this book, I am firmly convinced that Germany was no more guilty of causing the first catastrophe than any of the other belligerents and, considering that she was always outnumbered by the rest of the Allies, including Britain and her colonies, France, Russia and, near the end of the war, the USA, she fought magnificently. If there had been no First World War there would most certainly never have been a Second; Germany would probably have developed into a constitutional monarchy, like some other European states,and Hitler would never have achieved power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This embarrassingly awful film, released in 1972, features some fairly well-known B-movie actors from that era, including Grant Williams, Ruta Lee, Mala Powers, and, for some odd reason, musical star Bobby Van. I suppose devotees of truly terrible films might get a smile out of the absurd plot, wooden dialogue, atrocious acting, and laughably cheap production values. I just felt bad thinking that this was the final film performance of Williams, who had actually been a professional musician (opera singer, pianist) before going into acting. His earlier science-fiction films (notably, \\"The Incredible Shrinking Man,\\" but also \\"The Monolith Monsters,\\" and \\"The Leech Woman\\") and soap operas (\\"Written on the Wind,\\" \\"Susan Slade\\") may not have been masterpieces, but no one should go out of this world with a cinematic pustule like \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" as their parting contribution to civilization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome book!

The author is a lesbian woman who is already living her life in the context of how lesbians get it on with each other as they like. So she's trying to give people a way to figure out how to make that life that is already just how she and her lesbian friends live be happier by setting up some sort of rules and ethics. She's talking from her own life.People who aren't into that life already aren't going to get the same results. I don't think male-female bonds are like female-female ones.

It sounds very liberating when everything else seems so inhibiting.

Now I have a book that I can recommend that covers most of the areas extremely well. An additional benefit of this book is that is is written by two women in the lifestyle. Many other books written on the subject are written by men and are looked at by women readers as just another man trying to convince women to be more sexually promiscuios. The only area that I wish the authors would have spent more time on is the subject of nurturing your primary partner and relationship while introducing them to the new way of living. All in all, this is the very best book I've found concerning open relationships and swinging. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed bag of information","review":"For the first few chapters I was disappointed in the views of this book in that the authors seem to have great disdain for anything even vaguely resembling monogamy - or even fidelity. While I know that monogamy is not an appropriate choice of lifestyle for everyone, I also know that polygamy is not a healthy lifestyle choice for every personality either.Toward the second half of the book the authors views seemed to become more expansive and they spent some time explaining that different arrangements are necessary and healthy for different individuals.Overall, the book was not what I expected but I did find several sections to have useful information in them. I must say that the section about dealing with jealousy was very enlightening and the section on ethical behavior was also quite useful. There is even a section on fidelity, whether practiced in monogomaous or polygamous relationships, which I found to have solid information in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative, educational & ENTERTAINING!","review":"What a great book !!

I have to agree with a lot of the negative reviews.The author comes across as a narcissistic teenager looking for rationalizations on why it is good to put sexual gratification above other peoples feelings. This is not for someone in a loving relationship looking to experiment with alternate life styles. According to the author if it gets in the way of your orgasm then you walk right over it. Relationships and communication on how to work things out in a realtionship be damned.I think maybe if you were single and wanted a way to justify why its ok to play the field, then this book is for you.

Then the whole concept goes to hell in a hand basket. Polyamory is our era's freak-show-du-jour. Our alternative to the failed free-love mish-mash of the 60s.

It serves as an uncommon-sense how to for those who are interested in branching out of the world of monogamy, but the same tips and rules (being upfront and honest, owning your feelings, taking time for everyone in your life) can be applied unilaterally.The most important parts of this book include tips on how to manage one's own feelings and how to manage multiple relationships with multiple partners.

Cecilia Bartoli is but a minor character in this grand production, but again, very little insight into her world. There are some interesting moments, but few, and not an easy read given how Ms. Holeterhoff wanders. Granted, some of her scathing remarks about Kathleen Battle's behavior and Mr. P's divorce are warranted. Yet her hurtful comments about other singers and their weight trouble is particularly nasty. Keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never met a singer I didn't hate.....","review":"While Bartoli is on the cover, she is really not the center topic of this book. It's really about the people that make opera \\"big\\" today. The author never misses an opportunity to slam any singer that crosses her path or someone else's path. What bothers me most is here is an obviously intellegent woman who seemingly makes most of her income in a world that she so abhors. Perhaps she felt better about herself after writing the book but it does little for the world of opera.

I can never get bored. EVEN THOUGH I can't stand Kiara, I'm still addicted to this book.

I'm so into the book that even though I can't stand the main girl I still read it to the end! I think Nykyrian could do a lot better. Maybe he can cheat on her or something. Okay now I'm just hoping for too much. Oh well!!! Don't mind me! =)Either way, this is one awesome book.

I really think the story is breath taking, it's so creative, it's so majestic, I just loved it. But I got the final chapters of the book and was highly disappointed. It felt rushed. It almost felt like she ran out of paper. I kept re-reading sentences to figure out who was talking because it was specific enough.

It seems as though Ms. Kenyon has stretched herself a little thin and perhaps both she and her loyal fans would be better served if she did not try to juggle so many series and storylines at the same time. Whether Nykyrian reminds you of Kyrian or Acheron or embodies so many other Dark-Hunter characters she's published since she originally wrote this book, this book pales in comparison to other works.

Readers will be spared having to figure out the motivations and characteristics of the main characters, since the author helpfully spells these out in detail and with great frequency, rather than risk having someone make deductions based on the characters' actions and dialog. If you like authors like Vance, or are the type that tends to wonder how the gadgets and cultures actually work, there is very little chance you will like this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eagerly awaiting for the next.............","review":"Picked this book up a few days ago and I eagerly devoured it in 2 days.

Princess Kiara, a Ballet Dancer is a target by the League, and her father calls in Nykerian and his band of warriors to protect his daughter. Unfortunately, Nykerian and his warriors become the target by her father and his soldiers. Sounds comfusing, not really just an action packed book that had me until the very end. I loved all the characters and my heart went out to these men, that have been picked on by everyone, and they did not deserve it.

Don't waste your money on this movie. It's the worst depiction of a Lebanese immigrant. As a Lebanese myself, I know that Lebanese fathers are very protective of their kids especially their daughters so there is no way a Lebanese man would leave his 13 year old daughter home alone to fend for herself. It is very hard to believe that Jasira's Dad would neglect her and allow so many people to take advantage of her. We came to the US when I was 15 and we were not allowed to date no matter what color the boy was let alone have sex. This man would've shipped his daughter straight to Lebanon if he even suspected that she is sexually active. The worst part is that Jasira seemed to enjoy all the abuse and even ask for it. I don't think teenage girls are that ignorant now a days or that stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Approaches mere exploitation","review":"There is no substance to this movie. What we have here are a bunch of stereotypical characters victimizing a thirteen-year old Lebanese girl repeatedly. Very little of the story deals with her heritage and coping with that in a bigoted society, and when it does it feels very artificial and forced. The focus of the film seems to be on the girl's nascent sexuality, and pretty soon \\"Towelhead\\" devolves into a series of scenes that feel, track, and sound like something you'd experience in soft-core porn. I'll give this a star for making people squirm and the guts the actress has for participating in this cinematic sadism, but I did not develop a deeper understanding of life experienced by Middle Easterners as they try to cope with bigotry and misunderstanding. The coming-of-age aspect of the film simply flattens any other subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this garbage? It's no American Beauty.","review":"I only watched half of this movie.

It wasn't. Was it supposed to turn me on? It didn't. Was I supposed to sympathize with perverted, cruel, moronic classmates, parents and neighbors?

Whynott gives the reader a real life picture of a handfull of local legends in the tuna fishing industry. In a race to fill the Government quotas, these blue water hunters ply the Atlantic for the elusive and lucrative fish that often weighs more than 800 pounds. An exciting page turner for the fisherman already familiar with Giant Bluefin Tuna fishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE STRONG AND AMAZING FISH","review":"I thought this was a great book to learn about the bluefin and the fishng for them. It is crazy the amount of money these fish go for. These fish hav incredible power I believeit states in here that if you tied a bluefin to a marlin tail to tail the blufin would win. great book give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good; could be clearer","review":"The book is good and it provides rationale for why the skill needs to be done a certain way. I think it could be clearer though because the pictures overlap; you could be reading one skill and looking at a picture for a different skill which can be confusing the first time you're reading the material. And the CD-ROM is useless. It is just a checklist. So if you can get a used text without the cd--go for it. It'll probably be cheaper as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Required for class","review":"I'm not impressed with this book, and have actually hardly ever used it even though it is required. It has a lot of information, and some color pictures, which is nice, but overall it is just crammed together and kinda confusing to find anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"clinical skills book not what i expected","review":"I was dissapointed.

I e-mailed the seller around the 1st of June and was told to wait out the shipping period which covered May 18th thru June 8th. I needed the book for an assignment, I could not wait any longer.

With insightful lyrics, interesting melodies and lush, carefully arranged accompaniment, this album (though significantly different from his previous works) truly pushes the envelope of creativity. Credit Peter Gabriel for maintaining his enthusiasm and inspiration over the years and ultimately, for his ability to create masterpiece after masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking the language barrier to help victims of abuse.","review":"This book opens up the world in which Social Workers are able to communicate and understand victims in a precise manner, breaking the procedure down step by step, asking the questions that need to be asked, ultimately allowing the language barrier to come down.I strongly recommend this book for those who are involved in the Social Work field and those in the Law Enforcement field who are confronted with various circumstances that are described in this book.Abuse is a serious problem that, at times, is not reported or misunderstood exactly because of the language barrier. This book helps bridge the gap and will be useful in guiding people to enforce the law and helping those who are victims of abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Book You Can Judge by its Cover","review":"This books is called CHILD ABUSE PHRASE BOOK, and that is exactly what it is. I was hoping that it might provide me with words or phrases that might be helpful in other areas of my clinical social work practice, but, as it states, it is very child-abuse-focused. Some of the translations to English are a little odd. For example, in discussing confidentiality, the script for the therapist says, \\"You can tell me anything. It's all right, I won't blurt it out.\\"I think this book is most useful for people who already have a good foundation of Spanish and just need the specific abuse-related terms. I'm glad to have it in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is the Master.","review":"Spectacular performance from a genuine maestro. The recital style of this concert was geared toward true appreciation of such rare brilliant talent. Mr. Wakeman's ancedotal chats provided entertaining background to some of the songs and past tours. The only complaint I have is there should have been more material included in this fantastic performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"willis reed wept","review":"It is clear what Dolan has been doing with his time. Rather than actually taking control of the NY Knicks and making them into something other than the laughing stock of the NBA and Professional Sports in general, he has chosen to front a mediocre blues band.Of course, in his spare time he anally rapes his Cablevision subscribers as well with the highest rates in the world.It is astounding that he found time to \\"play\\" guitar while he should have been arranging for NHL playoff hockey to be broadcast.

The sound quality leaves you wanting more, and Mr. Dolan's voice sounds like the album was recorded right after he got over the flu. In all honesty, I couldn't even listen to the whole thing, which is saying a lot; \\"Right on Time\\" is really rather good.If you're planning on buying this album, take a look at the reviews. They speak for themselves. Instead, snag a copy of \\"Right on Time.\\" You can thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will give the musician a headache-more ways than one","review":"This book has plenty of tunes,but presents them very poorly. The small print of the tunes and the placement of two on a page makes reading very testing for a musician. Also the chord changes on some tunes,the bebop tunes in particular,are wrong. This book is good for the casual player,but one who is looking for decent representation of the music should look into other sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable source of lead sheets, but hardly all jazz.","review":"This copious collection is made up of clear, well-conceived lead sheets. In general, they are melodically accurate and harmonically acceptable. Many of them also contain lyrics. Despite the title, however, the book contains a number of songs which are inconsistent with the idea of its being a jazz source. Such titles as \\"Jingle-Bell Rock\\", \\"Put On A Happy Face\\" and \\"Everything's Coming Up Roses\\" are, at best, gratuitous filler material. Also on the negative side, the lack of double bars and/or other delineations of form may cause less experienced seekers of musical treasures to experience some confusion. Otherwise, this is a valuable and highly economical reference, with tunes costing the buyer only about a half a cent each. My money was well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This is a book worth buying only if you are a singer looking for melody and text to jazz/dixie tunes. The chord progressions are weak, with many faults and flaws. The lineup is poor as well, as the compilation process has forced the songs to be typed with no concern to form etc. No four-bars-per-line here. No book to bring along to the gig, but a great resource for old-and-nearly forgotten tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look other places first","review":"I have eight fake books I think, and this is the last one I reach for. The changes are not always right, that's my biggest complaint, but the presentation isn't that good, either. Warner Brothers publishes a 'Just Standards' Real Book that is my first choice. I like the changes and I like the presentation. If I can't find the song there, I check the Sher Music Real Books. The Sher Real Books are the standard, almost everybody will tell you that. Nice presentation, good song selection, the right changes. I also have a couple of books in the Jazz Bible series, and they're good but the binding doesn't lay flat easily on a music stand.I recommend that you check out the Warner Bros. or the Sher books first, you'll find that you don't need this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lesser Wabi-Sabi","review":"How can two books with virtually the same title be so different? I bought both books that Amazon lists with \\"wabi\\" and \\"sabi\\" in the titles. The other book is highly informative, imaginative, and profoundly artful in the manner of wabi-sabi. WABI SABI: A NEW LOOK AT JAPANESE DESIGN, however, would be more accurately titled \\"WABI SABI LITE.\\" It is a regurgitation of all the tired cliches about Japanese design and culture I have come to loathe rereading. Sorry. I'd let this one pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale facsimile of the real thing","review":"This book only skims the surface of wabi-sabi, dealing in the tired truisms of the \\"cherry blossoms in the spring\\" type and the cheap exoticism that often plagues Western writing about Japanese aesthetics.As a student of Japanese culture, I bought this book and was very disappointed. You're not missing anything--skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special, except the dull photos","review":"This book is derivative and enraptured with cliche. The photos look like cheap snapshots gussied up for placement in a rather nice design. But the elegance of the overall production is the exact antithesis of the the REAL wabi sabi, so expertly revealed in that other book. They could have named this anything, and you wonder if the title was chosen to do anything but ride on the other author's achievement. I'd ignore this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whet my appetite...","review":"This is a beautiful book. The book is not comprehensive, but I don't believe it intends to be. I appreciate how the author visually and lyrically introduces vocabulary and ideas through his own experiences. I now want to know more. I will continue to refer back to this book as I search for more knowledge and as I pursue my arts (architecture, as well as art). I was enlightened, as well as astonished. I'd like to keep that feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wlliams Fairey Band Scores A Hit","review":"The talents of the Williams Fairey Band is truly heard in Brass from the Masters. Of special significance to their talents, is the Severn Suite, by Edward Elgar. The melodic lines spotlighted in the high brass in the opening of the \\"Cathedral\\" is quickly answered by the middle and low voices. The work's rhythmic and variety of tempi and form spotlights well the unique talents of this wonderful brass ensemble. This CD is a must have for conissieurs of Brass Ensemble music, I highlyrecommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"6.5\\" ceiling speakers","review":"I bought these two ceiling speakers for my kitchen along with two 8\\" ceiling speakers (different brand) for my dining room. Both sets of speakers I bought based on customer reviews without actually hearing the speakers in person. I am more impressed with these 6.5\\" speakers than with the 8\\" speakers I purchased for my dining room. These speakers have excellent sound! I think they have very crisp and full sound that is quite impressive for such relatively small speakers. Installation was easy, the directions were good and I had no problems. They look great and match my white ceiling nicely. The sound quality to price is high value with these speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers for a great price","review":"We bought these for our living room 5.1 as well as for two speakers on distributed audio in our bedroom. They were easy to install. Just cut a hole in the ceiling and hook the wire to the connectors on the back. Then tighten the 4 screws. They are super stable and sound great. It's also nice to have the tweeters adjustable so they can point to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbie Princess Repunzel's Wedding Styling Head by Mattel","review":"I ordered this Barie Princess Rapunzel's Styling Wedding Head by Mattel.

I did this because the midrange was not quite right with the MC-100's. I could hear the highs and lows (from sub), but the mids were muffled and dull. I could turn the volume up, but everything else was too loud. Since the front speakers do most of the work, I was looking for something better. These RM101's filled the gap beautifully. I feel I can hear everything without having to turn the volume up at all from the same Yamaha receiver. The balance of sound and clarity made it worthwhile. Since I already had the ceiling mount bracket installed, setting these in place was a snap and used the same standard bolts. The pewter color is cool too, without being too flashy. My rear speakers are still MC-100's though."},{"rating":"2","title":"James McNair's Custards, Mousses, and Puddings","review":"I couldn't find my origional copy of this book after moving,so I ordered another one.

Book in good condition and came very fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music of love","review":"Once I began to read the book, I wanted to finish it quickly, yet I did not want that time in my life to be so far past. Lyrics with feeling and meaning, voices that were a gift that cannot be taught or trained, and entertainers who while very human were heroes and heroines to their audiences. \\"Only Make Believe\\" is able to put these factors together in a way that leaves the reader nourished yet not satisfied, saddened at the passing years, but pleased to be able to remember a better time in the entertainment business. Congratulations to Howard, Judy and Joyce and my sincere condolences to the Keel children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true hero of stage and screen","review":"Not only is this book good, I couldn't put it down. He was so damned funny! Maybe it wasn't meant to be that way, but I laughed my butt of several times. He may have not been the best writer in the world, but he was original and honest. I could have done without all of the facts of everyone in every show, but I was so amused that it really didn't matter. Without a doubt, one of the greatest voices ever. I wish he'd have spent more time in discussing Doris Day. I always thought they were a cute couple. All in all, one of my favorite books. Maybe it is because I was in awe of his voice, or maybe it's because he didn't dance around the facts. It was a great read, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOWARD KEEL: A SNOOZE OF A STORY","review":"We'd only be making believe if we say we enjoyed Howard Keel's autobiography.

Lipson writes likes a philosophy teacher. His rambling ideas and wordy paragraphs make the book extremely hard to comprehend. Reading is slow and tiresome as you trudge through the text trying to follow Lipson as he attempts to \\"psycho-analyze\\" the history of politics. My Intro to Political Science class used this book as our text and stuggled the entire semester to make heads-or-tails of it. It made even basic political science concepts hard to understand. It wasn't until our professor brought in Understading Politics: Ideas, Institutions, and Issues that we began to understand our course. This book was wonderful. It was straight forward and made learning so much easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Walter classic beautifully restored","review":"Much like the other Bruno Walter reissues in this series, the DSD transfer faithfully records the musical information in the master tapes and presents it with a clarity, immediacy, and warmth unmatched in any previous transfer.

He also describes the ridiculously naive and stupid PC-based regulations which we have implemented which hamstring our field intelligence-gathering abilities. We should have been able to at least have a fighting chance at preventing 9-11, but not with the dysfunctional intel community described here.Gertz also provides a brief plan to correct these major problems. This book is worth the two-three hours you will invest in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money elsewhere","review":"Bill Gertz doesn't deserve your cash. There are a number of books on intelligence reform written before 9-11 that are just as valid today. Gertz effort at \\"recent history\\" is as flawed as many similar works. It's too close to the event, with not enough objective data, Congress wasn't close to releasing a report when this was penned.Gertz resorts to the same Clinton-bashing (and I'm no Clinton fan) he used before, and continues to highlight vulnerabilities, sources, and methods which I'm sure our foes will find useful. I've personally had sources eliminated after someone leaked a classified report to Gertz and he printed it verbatim.I recommend books by Greg Treverton, Loch Johnson, or Berkowitz and Goodman instead of this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book scratches the surface of 9-11,but avoids the heart","review":"This book takes the 9-11 issue from the Bush Admin perspective of truth.

Even Republican, Shelby from Alabama, is outraged over Bush's unwillingness to tell America what he'd been.To understand what led up to 9-11, and Bush's suspicious behaviour regarding 9-11 investigations, you must read \\"The War on Freedom\\" and \\"Forbidden Truth\\" both available on [website].To only read this book leaves gaping dangerous holes in your understanding of possible Bush Admin. complicity in what occurred on 9-11, and their continuing stonewalling of a full independent 9-11 inquiry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book Not Worth Paying For","review":"Thank goodness a friend passed this book on to me, for I don't buy books written by anyone who has spent his/her life in the depths of Rev. Moon's psuedo-religious/political cult. But one has to wonder why it is that Gertz is acknowledged by numerous experts in the Intelligence Community to have inordinate access to inside sources.

There is a long record of regime change instigated and in some cases, accomplished by the CIA.The Clintons didn't take advantage of oppurtunities to locate bin Laden, but to be fair, what have Bush and company achieved toward that end in the last 7 years?The author seems to have a positive view of the PATRIOT ACT. Intelligence at the cost of personal freedom and Constitutional liberty may be a fair trade for some, anyone that values the Constitutional rights of America's citizens will disagree.This book is more of an apology for Bush's failures by blaming the Clintons and other Democrats. It's neoconservative propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Wash","review":"Bill Gertz has done some excellent investigative reporting in the past; however, this book just absolutely looks over the facts surrounding the September 11th attacks. The overall conclusion to this book is that our Inteligence just \\"dropped the ball\\".An honest look at the facts will show that this is absurd. First, we have many FBI agents who have gone public about the criticism they received from within their departments for even investigating such an attack and David Schippers(Chief Counsel for Clinton Impeachment), who is representing some of these agents in their suits, went himself to the Attorney General's office with details surrounding the attacks two months before hand. He was not even given the time of dayFinally, there is too much information that is just skipped over in this book - I have only included a small amount here.

This is an excellent opening to play, as you have a good chance of knowing it much better than white. The book is light on instruction, heavy on variations. But there is a nice history section and good sumamries of chapters to let you know the overview of what's going on. The format of the book is quite a bit like the Blackmar-Diemer Keybook II by Sawyer, with 40 base games, filled with hundreds of game fragments. There is an excellent index and bibliography. Plus, the book has the excellent Russell Enterprises production values. I have used this book a lot and really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually stunning Herzog production","review":"There are no authentic Wagnerian voices here but everyone is dramatically committed and manages to sing well. The main pleasure is the imaginative production by Werner Herzog which is absorbing and truly theatrical, to say the least. The costumes, reminiscent of grotesque medieval drolleries, are particularly interesting and the spare sets and filming are equally effective. Conducting is incisive and detailed. If you buy it in the three-disc Masterpieces of Opera set at $25 it is a real bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice presentation of Tannhauser","review":"Decent singing all around although not world class. The Heinrich is a little short on top but the voice is pleasant and he generally sings all the 8th and 16th notes, which many Tannhausers just glide right over. The Venus seemed a little unsteady on top. There was alot to like about the singing of all the principle singers. The production is the most beautiful of all the three Tannhauser videos I have seen so far. I do think that world class singing might more likely be had on the Met video, but I personally find that production quite brown, and the Heinrich terribly nasal."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD big let down; see it live instead!","review":"This DVD was a great let down. I had seen this production in Baltimore and was expecting great things. When viewed live, the combination of the Venusburg set and the overture created the proper mood. Unfortunately, this DVD features the conductor and orchestra during the overture and continually flashes back to the conductor even after the singing has started. So much for thinking you are in Venusburg. The National Theater of Munich DVD has a much less interesting set design, but at least the shots of Mehta are kept to a minimum. I find it very disturbing that a conductor thinks that shots of his face are more important than setting the mood for a music drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book on Combustion","review":"I would recommend this book for people who have no previous knowledge of combustion.

I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn some great facts and see actual writings by women in history. Reads more like a novel than a history book. Definitely not dry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear and compelling statement","review":"By his own admission Yaacov Lozowick did not come easily to the conclusions that he subscribes to, yet he presents one of the most logical and historically consistent explanations and of Israel's current policy positions I have read. As the title suggests, this book defends the Israeli position, and may not be seen as \\"balanced\\" by those who believe that the wars against Israel are justified. Still, Mr. Lozowick's detailed, logical, and balanced (yes, I believe that is the right word) presentation of the historic and political landscape make this book a must-read by anyone who wishes to inform themselves of the current conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Impassioned Argument","review":"Those who disapprove of Israel will denounce this as a pack of lies (whether or not they've read the book), and some of Israel's most ardent supporters will complain that this book airs too much of the nation's dirty laundry. I found this book to be a remarkably well-argued and well-reasoned one that also is useful as a history of a nation and as a portrait of the people who inhabit Israel. You certainly don't have to agree with all or most of the author's points to find value in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you think...","review":"i read this book to give myself an education on the Middle East problems and who was to blame for them. i found a book filled with facts and history that enlightened me profoundly. Unfortunately for the author, when i finished the book i didn't hold with the most of the views he expressed in the book. His facts left me more knowledgeable about what happened, although in the end, i could not agree with him in the end on why it was alright that it did happen that way.After reading his book i feel Lozowick's moral defence falls flat on its face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for our underweight son!","review":"Our 2-year-old son is a former preemie who is slightly underweight and a VERY fussy eater-- he does not like meat, cheese, or eggs so it is very difficult to get enough calories/protein in him. Each day I mix up 2 scoops of this shake with 2 cups of whole milk in a shaker bottle, which provides nearly half of the calories required per day for catch-up growth, and he just LOVES it!! I also love the fact that it is whole-food based, sweetened with natural fruit sugars, and contains all the nutrients he needs in 2 servings. I only wish it came in more flavors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Item does not work.","review":"Service was great but item does not work with my phone. Spent the money for nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Solid","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this album. I must admit that when I bought it, I was caught up in the \\"O' Brother, Where art thou?\\" frenzy - so after the first playing of this disc I was momentarily struck by one of those, \\"what the heck did I order THIS for\\" moments. While there is an obvious Appalachian influence, this is not a collection of old-time thigh slapping tunes. This is well constructed, beautiful instrumental (only) music with a Blue Ridge flavor. It's even possible to say that there is more of a New Age feel here than a Southen one. The music is mostly upbeat, though there is a nice mix of fast and slow tunes. This album will appeal to those who are more inclined towards classical music than those who are inclined to 1930s and 40s traditional Bluegrass. God bless you if you're inclined to both."},{"rating":"2","title":"BlueClassic?","review":"Amazing... see the other responses. It's like a classical bluegrass album. I come from the bluegrass side, and all the music is there, just played together like a symphony. Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST introduction to the subject","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to understand calligraphy. The description of how the various hands evolved and developed as well as the context and background truly set this book apart. Numerous historical examples and relatively clear, large examples complete this book. Other books may provide more alphabets, but few provide the depth and understanding. This one does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use Calligraphy Instruction Manual!","review":"This is a must-have for anyone interested in learning to write calligraphy. The author's use of grid lines to form and then perfect the letters is the greatest tip I have ever found to enable me to make perfect calligraphy every time! If you are trying to decide on just one book, make this the one you purchase! You will not regret it! I feel so strongly about this book that I have purchased two copies. The first copy 15+ years ago and a replacement just recently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your run of the mill copy book...","review":"It's much more interesting than that. Not only does it show you how to write some of the most intriguing scripts, but the historical commentary is enlightening. There isn't a boring page in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medieval letter forms","review":"The book provided an excellent history of the evolution of letter formations used in medieval manuscripts. Especially interesting was the impact that the Emperor Charlemagne and a Benedictine monk had on standardization of text forms throughout much of Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource for the serious calligrapher!","review":"A terrific book for those who wish to develop the art of scroll writing in a truly authentic historical style. The only thing I could wish for is more colour photos, but you can find those just about anywhere. Consise information on the different fonts used, the similarities and advances as they change through time and use. Two of my scrolls can be seen at http://www.geocities.com/heartland/estates/sca.html."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightfully sufficient reference","review":"My interest in calligraphy has been purely historical. While I recognize all lettering arts as beautiful, I have no interest in learning the more modern hands or techniques to come along after the 18th ct. So, it has been my delight to read and use this book. The information gathered in this book is adequate and complete, not exhaustive--so one may read as little historical background and other information as he/she likes, then move on to practical application.My advice: do use this book as a resource for historical scripts, but do not begin with it. There is very little written on general principles of calligraphy and lettering, so expect to shop for a beginner's book on calligraphy if you are thus inexperienced. You might find yourself frustrated with the gaps in essentials and not be able to truly enjoy trying the historical hands once you try them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first was better...","review":"When I read the first book in the series (4 stars), I was excited and surprised. K.A. Applegate wrote \\"Search for Senna\\" with such power, I couldn't wait for the next one. But what a dissappointment. I read the book in an hour and was let down big time. This lacked power and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everworld land of loss","review":"I thought this book was great.

K.A. has done a good job so far and I'm really enjoyng her books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!","review":"I was intrigued by the description of this book. It sounded like it had such possibilities that I just HAD to try it. However, I felt the author was just trying to impress us with his computer knowledge. I do have a working knowledge of computers (hence my interest) but, geez. How in the world do you expect your average Joe Blow to understand this?Sorry. I passed on the remaining 1/4 of the book. It wasn't worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, poor finish","review":"I thought this would be a real winner. It has all the pieces of fiction I love to read about, Computers, Science Fiction, Archaeology and ruthless assassins. Unfortunately, the author never put them all together in a believeable or logical recipe. Also, the ending left me wanting, it was as if the author just gave up because he had enough pages written. I also cannot believe that the hacker could possibly go to jail for the heroines poor driving ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"great hook, poor book,","review":"I was attracted to this book after reading a review that mentioned its \\"countdown\\" hook and eclectic Y2K/SETI/archeological components. But the book itself was tedious. Once it became clear that the characters were no more than cartoonish stereotypes, I lost all interest in what was happening. And what was happening wasn't much: the plot was formulaic and in great need of subtlety and humor. The author is also no wordsmith. Among other annoying habits, he is addicted to packing his nouns with stiff or hackeyed adjectives (\\"the tall and stocky operative\\") that make the prose a constant uphill read. And did you notice? -- everyone in this book is \\"seasoned.\\" Everyone. And I do mean everyone. This adjective is so overused, one of my few joys in the book was to play the game of waiting for its next appearance. (If you're going to read this book, it might be fun to do an actual \\"seasoned\\" count. Better yet, if you haven't read the book, my advice is: don't.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could have been a contender...","review":"The information on the Mayans is interesting, if true, but the overall story is so cartoonish that I am not quite sure if one should believe it. The story hangs together by a thread and is poorly written. How does the Japanese couple from South America fit in? And more importantly, why? The ending? No wonder there was an epilogue. The editor did a disservice to the author and to the buyers of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused...","review":"What is this book? A mystery? Harlequin style romance? Science fiction? Suspense? Who knows... Certainly the author doesn't appear to know. There is nothing that the main characters appear to be incapable of. They \\"outsmart\\" the Mayan culture and in the process reduce the intellectual abilities of the people to that of a computer addicted ten year old. Unrealistic emotional reactions to events (sorry I'm not going to elaborate since you might actually want to read it.) predominate.The first half of the book is the best. Before you read it, open it 2/3rds the way through and write...\\"and they all lived happily ever after\\"... Stop when you reach that point. Only then will it be worth your time to read... I did enjoy the first 2/3rds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Involving, Fast-paced Novel","review":"This is the first book of R.J. Pineiro's I have read. It is not particularly well written, but not poorly written. It is a good distraction, though, and quite entertaining. It is fast-paced, involving, and suspenseful. Though not in the upper echelons of literature, it is worth the time to pick it up and turn the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Stuff !","review":"Cameron Slater was SO sexy! I just wanted to feel his chest. Nice work, RJ (RJ meaning reject)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great spin on year 2000- dissapointing ending","review":"it's too bad - this book was amazing. Pineiro ruined the last two chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing -- don't waste your money","review":"Piniero starts out with some interesting ideas, but fails to create a book with a coherent plot, or believeable characters. His run-on sentences, uni-dimensional characters, and many inaccuracies make the book hard to read. Descriptions of Mayan culture (particularly its calendar)are novel for most readers, but better described on several web sites. The mix of computer hacking, archeology, Russian spies, the FBI, and radio astonomers is not coherent. The graphic violence does not move the plot along. The inaccuracies and improbable events are so bad, they are actually humerous. I got tired of reading in the middle of the book, whereas the author seemed to get tired and just stopped writing at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst line I've ever read in a novel","review":"I hung in to the end, as the writing continued to deteriorate, presumably as his deadlineapproached, until being floored by the following (I'm quoting from memory here):\\"I assure you that in a hundred years, whathappened here today will be completelyforgotten, and in five hundred years willbe nothing but a distant memory\\".So I guess in a THOUSAND years it will be fresh in our minds? Jeez.Go read your cereal box. At least that's probably benefitted from an editor at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great First Half - Hazy Finish","review":"R.J. Pinero caught my attention with Y2K. I really enjoyed the \\"down-to-earth\\" way he crafted a technology based concept into a really good book.So, I bought 01-01-00 with high expectations.At first, perhaps because I'm in the network security business and actually know one of the key characters, I was intrigued, even a bit excited. It really promised to be a great read.Even when he began to inject the Mayan angle I was fascinated. Hey...\\"Chariots of the Gods\\" made the premise almost believable.However, I suspect he just got tired of writing and took the easy way out with a surreal ending that left me cold. Too bad.

The author admits that up front. Other reveiwers seem to think it starts out well. I don't. It never did capture my attention, let alone maintain it. This is a book you can put down and never miss it. Trust me, there is better stuff out there. I note that one reviewer compares this guy to Crichton. What a joke. Crichton's worst story was a quantam leap better than this thing. Pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"A weak effort. In addition to a weak plot and a strange ending, this book was full of typos and miss printed words. The technical descriptions were poor and the author had an annoying habit of restating entire scenes and descriptions from only a few pages earlier. To top it all off I still cannot comprehend how the evil hacker is responsible for the heroine's personal tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRULY AWFUL","review":"A book so bad anyone who bought it (typically in an airport where publishers shovel their most meretricious garbage) deserves to suffer in hell for encouraging the like.Especially awful for software engineers, who will find the author's lack of understanding of his major plot elements too painful to endure."},{"rating":"1","title":"no title","review":"What started out as a terrific read just totally disintegrated at the end.

Bought one of these new about 8 years ago for 600 bucks. It has had pretty light use and died on me a few months ago. Took it in for repair, 50 bucks later used it for 5 minutes and it died again. Took it back for repair and they determined it needs an armature, field and controller- about 350 bucks to repair it. I can buy the parts and do it myself for 250 bucks. So now I'm torn, do I fix it and hope it lasts or bite the bullet and spend another 600+ bucks for a new roto hammer. My Dad was a commercial contractor, he has a Hilti TE72 (bought it in 1981 or so) that we used and abused and it's still going strong.

It is also perfect if you want to use other liquids such as wine, juice or whatever. The only downside is the clean-up. It consists of four parts, each of which get coated with chicken drippings and need some serious scrubbing to get off the cooked-on residue. I've found a dishwasher alone doesn't really remove all of it. A little scrubbing is necessary to really get the device clean.This is certainly a useful item for us backyard cooks.

It sounds like the guy got picked on in high school and listened to way too much Marilyn Mansion. Akin to a bastardized hybrid of Rage Against the Machine (the politics), White Zombie (industrial crunch), and (of course) Mr. Mansion, dope leaves nothing to the imagination, and no reason to buy this piece of garbage.

These essential reflections bounce outward like a little child dancing in the rain. I found these poems from various spiritual traditions inspiring me in my own Christian faith as well as my own use of words. The writer of Proverbs warns about the danger of too many words, and maybe these poems remind us of the value in speaking less and allowing the mystery of divine love to hide behind our words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love of God and Man flows from these writers","review":"Love Poems from God is not for those who prefer to keep God safely tucked away in heaven, and sinful humans separated by human created barriers. I would not claim these significant writers are mainstream, but that's what makes them interesting. Much of the passion of these writers were erased or filtered by the organized religions that 'claim' them as their own. As a freshman in college, I was amazed when I learned that the old English \\"Thee and Thou\\" was the long dropped INFORMAL tense in English. As a child when I read the King James version of the bible I thought it was much more formal and remote. This ignorance that I shared with many may be what makes these poems so powerful. All of the writers express a powerful and intimate connection with God, one that isn't regimented by church dogma. This can delight and possibly horrify the reader. This isn't \\"New Age\\" this is really OLD AGE that steps into our world and speaks our language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly! :o)","review":"I picked this book out of my pile of unread books about midnight, and spent the entire night reading, meditating on the poems, and finding myself unable to but the book down!

The chapter about Turkam felt very disrespectful in my eyes. Ladinsky should have sold this book as one of his own writing's, instead of the writings of the saints he has chose. Even though I know for a fact none of these are authentic, Ladinsky in the most part is a good poet. But a horrible translator. Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read Mr. Legge's review below before purchasing this, but decided he was probably just a Christian offended at Ladinsky taking liberties with some of the great poets/writers from this tradition. Unfortunately, I wish I would have listened to him.I have trouble believing that these poems, or even something similar, were written by the sources credited. They all come off sounding a bit like Hafiz, (or at least, as I'm beginning to suspect, Daniel Ladinsky's version of Hafiz), but not nearly as good as the Hafiz translations in Ladinsky's other volumes.Something about the \\"translations\\" just seemed a little smart-alecky to me and not very deep. I don't think for instance, that Kabir really said \\"a fish in the water that's thirsty needs professional help.\\" Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladinsky flogs his work on the reputation of others","review":"Yet again, a book by Daniel Ladinsky rides on the coat-tails of other, much more gifted writers. Ladinsky doesn't translate these poets, or even provide new renderings based on previous translations - as he himself admits, he writes poems which he believes to have been divinely revealed to him by various famous writers and poets from previous centures, revelations which bear no relationship to anything these writers produced while actually alive. Funny how they all come out sounding like a twentieth century American."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only our ecstasies offer any real clues about Him","review":"I am just barely half-way thru the book but oh! the thrills and frizzons these poems have wrought in me. As I read them I am often smiling like a fool, if not laughing out loud like a madman.In these times when the name of God is blasphemed by the very ones who claim to speak for him, it is so liberating to discover these poems by His lovers.In the intro Daniel writes:\\"I think God loves bootleggers-defiant poetswho ferment the air as they singand lift the corners of our mouths.\\"Words about God should never bore.God is the opposite of boring...Whoever made this universe is a Wild Guy.I think only our ecstasies offer any real clues about Him.\\"Just as Woody Guthrie famously wrote the slogan 'This Machine Kills Fascists' on his guitar; this book kills 'tiny gods'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Real Thing","review":"This book is seriously misleading. Ladinsky claims to \\"edit\\" this volume of poems of Eastern and Christian mystics, but at least with respect to the Christian sources, he has not edited them in any meaningful sense - he has fabricated entirely new poems from whole cloth. They certainly were NOT written by the people to whom he attributes them. At most, they are Ladinsky's own (erroneous) impressions of these great Christian mystics.Each of these men and women actually did write their own poems, but you won't find them in this book. Look instead at, for example, \\"The Aquinas Prayer Book: The Prayers and Hymns of St. Thomas Aquinas\\", edited by Robert Anderson, \\"The Prayers of Catherine of Siena\\" edited by Suzanne Noffke, or \\"The Ascent of Mount Carmel\\" by St. John of the Cross, edited by Henry L. Carrigan.The real poems by these authors are well worth many hours of meditation, but Ladinsky's \\"edited\\" versions only give you what Ladinsky himself thinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Divine honey for the soul.

Reading the poems of these eastern and western mystics opened to me a much greater awareness of the intimate and generous love that God has for me and for all of creation.Rather than attempting to recommend this book to my friends and family, I bought them each a copy so they could enjoy a deeper relationship with God too.Only through poetry could these spiritual giants begin to communicate their profound encounters with God. I'm so amazed at their humanity and beauty expressed in their poems. We all need to hear the words of love and this book will nourish anyone's heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacred poetry that delights the soul","review":"This book is quite a gem.

Don't miss it as it is a comfort to read each night before sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twelve great voices reduced to one","review":"Ladinsky's choice of poets for this volume is inspired. All twelve write with clarity of image and meaning that works across time and religious divides. All speak at some time from a experiential place of ecstatic love. So why do I give only one star? Read translations then compare to these adaptations. What Ladinsky gives us is one voice - his. The differences in place and time and religion of the originals have been flattened into an English-speaking present. The stark clarity of image in the originals have been muddled into blurred images of modern interpretation.While it is true that the ecstatic experience of love is common across culturals, the language in which the experience is described is always the unique voice of a particular individual's experience of the divine. It is that particularity that was lost in these adaptations.Rather than this volume, seek out translations of the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Treasure!","review":"An intuition of the Divine that continues to give me comfort and open my eyes says that God is a sphere whose circumference is nowhere, but whose center is everywhere. It is an intuition that Ladinsky knows in his bones, as this work so clearly shows. The offerings in Love Poems from God fill that nowhere with true song, and make that everywhere available to readers in a voice that fills the soul's yearning with comfort, awe and delight. These poems return to readers a sensibility of such extraordinary depth that-against all odds in this troubling world-we begin to believe what the great mystics have taught again and again: that the essence of our life is both deeply human and truly Divine. Our lives, then, are a dance set to the very music that whirls throughout these marvelous poems, as, once again, Ladinsky \\"strikes up the band\\" of mystical truth and delight.I keep this book of poems close to me, I hold it like I hold a loving Friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is good","review":"A wonderful collection of spiritual poetry from world wide sources.

I drink alot of smoothies and I wanted one that would work well. Well this was a HUGE disappoinment.

The fruit ends up at the bottom plugging up the blades so I rarely put any ice in it and have to use lots of liquids.... well thats doesn't make for a good smoothie when I am left with a waterdown mess. I tired writing an email to the Oster about it and I never heard back from them. I ended up retiring it to the garage and then got me a NINJA blender.... now thats a blender that will never need a big spoon.

Very solidly built, very easy to use, very effective. BUT it is loud. With the jar off, the motor does not make that much noise, but the with the jar on, it is almost deafening -- and high-pitched. Not ear-piercing but enough to make me want to hold my ears. I think two things cause this. One, the all-metal body. Great for durability, but the metal just transmits the noise. Second, if you look at the enlarged picture, you'll see that there's a silvery collar at the base of the jar, lifted a bit off the body of the blender. I think that this just allows sound to escape. Oster could have done something to baffle or muffle the noise.Still, it is an excellent blender -- if you can live with the noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance","review":"I am sending it back!! I tried to make a shake with ice cream & milk and had to take off the lid to stir it so it would blend. Would not blend at all, eventually after stirring it enough I got a shake.

This was a HUGE disappointment, especially after reading all the reveiws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and good, but noisy.","review":"Powerful, though a sound baffle wasn't part of the production budget.

I especially like the glass jar as all my other blenders have had plastic jars which over time developed small cracks.

I have had this blender several weeks now and use it every other day for protein shakes and i love it. the only tricky part is making sure attachment is sitting right on spicket (sp?) before turning on the switch. once you get the hang of that it is cakewalk. i also was afraid of only one speed but remember even with last retro 70's blender i had with 14 speeds i only used high and pulse so this is not a problem. good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blender","review":"I bought an Oster Professional Series blender because of its all metal drive and powerful motor.

Thinking, \\"It's Oster, right?\\" - so it will be good, I got this one, intending to use it to mix up puppy mush using already-finely-ground meat and milk. Since I have maybe one litter a year, this task should not exactly be heavy lifting for a good blender. It worked fine last fall, then was used a couple of times for routine kitchen tasks afterward. Today it burned out without warning while pureeing puppy food. I know it came at a good price, but once a day use for a total of perhaps 3 weeks over a year... not good value, no matter what the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Blender!","review":"Why anyone think less than great of this blender is beyond me. I've had it for about a month now and I have been making Pi~na Coladas none stop! The ice is crushed so that it looks like a smoothie. Never before have I had a blender that does such a great job crushing ice. The old blenders I've had used to just hit the ice and send it back to the top and when it was time to serve the drinks, there were huge ice chunks still left inside, but not with this blender, in about 30 seconds all the ice is completely crushed for a two person serving. I highly recommend this product, it is a great blender for a very affordable price, you can't possibly go wrong here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems stable enough.","review":"Everything from the motor up is a pretty standard oster blender. The motor however seems to have a bit of kick. The only downside is that it doesn't have a slower speed so sometimes things don't blend well without being packed down multiple times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought it","review":"I bought this blender to crush ice in protein shakes based on all the glowing reviews. I thought the complaints about the noise were over reactions. Boy, was I wrong. The sound that this blender makes is horrendous! If it weren't so much effort to send it back, I would have done so immediately after my first use. And, it really doesn't do that great of a job crushing ice. The number of times you have to stop the motor, scrape the contents down so that they will continue to blend just isn't worth it! Contents just can't get over or around that air pocket that forms at the bottom of the jar. Far better to buy the Waring Pro electric ice crusher and use your old blender. I did and am much happier. If this is your first blender, try something that doesn't come with an ear protector warning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and powerful!","review":"I did a lot of research on blenders before committing to this one, including polling friends and family with discerning taste when it comes to cooking and appliances. I ended up choosing this one based on its simplicity and the three year warranty, a rarity in most anything you can purchase today. This model is simple, easy to clean, nice looking, and most importantly, has an awesome way with Margaritas and smoothies. And it isn't nearly as loud as I feared it would be based on what many of the other reviewers had said. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This blender is great for smoothies","review":"I am very happy with this blender. We bought it to make smoothies at a school fair. We made about 100 smoothies in an afternoon. It grinds through ice and frozen strawberries with ease. Much better than the other blenders we had in action there too.

Certainly nothing that would take a star away."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"I've used this blender to make drinks/smoothies.Loudness: the high-speed (constant on) setting is fairly loud, but the low-speed (pulse) setting isn't that loud.Sturdiness: I agree with all of the other reviews about the strength and sturdiness of the product. It's a solid machine.Ice: unless there is a fairly large amount of liquid you have to keep pulsing/shaking/poking the mixture to get it down near the blades. This is a design issue, and the reason I dinged the product one star.Overall, I'm very pleased with this blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get it for Smoothies","review":"I'm having trouble understanding how people could be raving about how great this blender is. It is nice-looking, and I don't care that it only has two speeds. But ice or other frozen chunks don't get pulled down into the blades, perhaps because the jar is narrow. And it is so loud it is like having a helicopter in our kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice blender for the price!","review":"I drink a lot of smoothies using spinach and kale. Because of this, I've been through a couple of blenders. It's just not something that every blender can handle.This blender has done a really good job for me. Mixes everything I need for a \\"green smoothie\\" and does a good job of it.

I paid a lot of money for it too. After cleaning another mess the other day I decided to throw it out.Thanks to all of you for your reviews. I decided to get this blender.It's everything I wanted in a blender, fast, doesn't overflow, and, while it looks as tho it doesn't hold as much as my old blender, it DOES.Instead of having chunks of berries left in the bottom, it blends them in with smoothies. It's fast too.So, it's noisy. So what. It only takes seconds and I don't think you could have such a large motor and quiet. I'd rather have the horsepower.I don't think you can go wrong buying this blender.Almost 3 years later:The Blender is still performing, even grinds small amounts of grain like flax seed, oatmeal. Best blender I've ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"I liked this blender. Powerful, attractive and makes a nice smoothie. After light usage for 3 years it broke.

Would buy again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weak motor","review":"I purchased one of these and I have to say, they are made in china and have a weak motor. It is 1/2 a horse power, which is equal to 372 watts. If your looking for a blender that is completely made out of metal, the base and the drive system are solid steel and the pitcher is made of all glass. Get a older Oster. The ones made before the 80's are old school, but they are made to last. They were made in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, not CHINA and come with 800 watts of power, back when they used big motors on things.Your not going to be able to blend frozen fruits and chop ice with a 372 watt motor. The reason why VitaMix are good is because they are made just like the old school Osters, but you do not need to spend $500+ on a blender. Just buy vintage Oster and your be able to get one for under $70 used.

I have used this blender for everything from smoothies to margaritas to crushing just ice, it does it all. The Oster solid metal drive train tears though anything you put in the way and does so handedly.While it only has two blending settings I find that helpful and not as redundant as many other blenders. \\"Yes i would like my drink blended as fast as I can possibly have it, I am not concerned with the speed the blender wants to do it\\" If you are tired of dealing with second rate blenders that can hardly blend yogurt but you do not want to give an arm and a leg for a nice one this incredibly classy, professional blenderOster BPST02-B Professional Series Blender, Blackis your best bet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent (if noisy) blender","review":"I got this to make smoothies. My wife uses a lot of ice in her recipes, so I needed something substantial to get the job done. This blender is quite powerful, and if you run it too long, the blending motion will actually start to warm up the ingredients! Overall, this is a good step up from the 29.99 variety blenders. I didn't feel the need to go to 499.00 for a vita-mix, but I wanted something more durable than the garden variety blenders I've had before.Excellent Blender, no frills, good build, a bit noisy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frozen drinks","review":"I bought this blender to make frozen drinks (margaritas, daiquiris, etc.). Generally, the blender performs very well. The only problem I've encountered with blending is that if there is not enough free liquid (too much frozen fruit or ice), then no rotation occurs and you have to add liquid (water or mix) into the top. It is also extremely loud, but that's to be expected. Overall, it works well for what I bought it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a year or so of seldom use","review":"Agree with other reviewer Lindsey on this one. I hated this blender from the beginning... it's so loud that the kids have to go in their room or risk going deaf. It was AWFUL for smoothies... just never worked. Finally the whole blade mechanism just broke off. Unfixable. I'm definitely upgrading to something more professional that actually works. Blenders need to be fun and easy to use, otherwise you just won't use them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lid Stinks","review":"Be forewarned, as two other reviewers have pointed out: unfortunately, the pressure that the machine puts out causes the liquid (soup, in my case) level to rise to the point of dislodging the plastic center cap. In my case, I had my hand over the lid and the cap popped into the blender (and soup) and promptly cracked and broke. Considering its price and appearance of durability, I planned on using this machine for much more than just mixing a marg but I have a feeling that's going to be its limit for me. Now, the next dilemma is finding a replacement cap..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"This blender worked great while it worked, but after a year, the motor stopped working. My husband said that the motor burnt out. I would not spend the money to repair because it didnt make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, attractive, and noisy!","review":"This blender certainly performs. I use it to make smoothies and in seconds it is completely blended which is fantastic. But, the drawback is, it is REALLY loud - probably due to the all metal drive. If you have young children in the house please take note, they will be frightened. Also, don't let the photo fool you, the blade collar is plastic. I assumed from the photo it was metal and was excited since the plastic ones always seem to split on me (I guess I tighten too much) but was dissappointed to see this one too is just plastic. All in all it's a great blender and it does the job it's made to do incredibly well but the noise level is shocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Blend Frozen Fruit","review":"The blender is a nightmare for those trying to blend frozen fruit. Because it only has one speed, it does not allow you to gradually increase and immediately creates an air pocket which stops the blending process. You have to keep stopping and bring the smoothie back down with a spoon to the blade so you can try to finish. This is also an unusually loud blender and one we as avid smoothie drinkers were really disappointed in. It does crush ice and blend well if you are not using frozen fruit, but again, if you like a thick smoothie, it still makes that air pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender not durable for frozen fruit or ice","review":"Purchased this item after reviewing the positive reviews. For the past 7 months we have used this product daily to make fruit smoothies using frozen fruits. With the series being named 'Professional', one would figure it would be able to handle such use. However this is not the case...the coupling broke off. The product advertisement states that its an 'all metal drive'...however the inside of the coupling is mostly rubber. Sent Oster an e-mail explaining the problem a week ago, yet they have not responded. Will be asking for a refund, if it is still under warranty. Blender may be okay for other uses not involving ice or frozen items frequently...appearance is excellent --appears to be a commercial look."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal","review":"I was impressed with this product. when my other oster blender stopped working, i went to my favorite place to get a replacement. amazon did not only sale this product at a great price, i got it send to me free. best of the deal is when i used the blender to blend beans, i was pleased, it did make a really loud noisy and had air forcefully coming from the base, but it did the job well and i would recommend this blender to friends, i have just purchased it, but i pray it last because it does what it was meant to do well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, great price.","review":"I love my new blender. I have been making smoothies everyday and it works great. It crushes ice very well and blends the drinks better than any other blender I have had. It is very light, yet powerful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! That's powerful!","review":"There are many choices out there for blenders, but all the rave reviews for the Oster BPST02-B helped me decide. It is a nice blender, seems to work well. Has plenty of power and the lack of different settings isn't an issue. I would have given it five stars, but for a \\"Professional Series\\" blender it lacks the quality heavy metal collar to hold the glass container, and the plastic cover on the underside of the unit says this blender LOOKS LIKE a Professional Blender but is short on quality craftsmanship of real heavy duty blenders. Bottom line-it's worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic cap dropped through lid and was pulverized","review":"The second time I used this blender, while I had my hand over the lid as I was pureeing fruit, the plastic cap in the center of the lid fell through the lid and was pulverized by the blades. Based on the other reviews, the blender probably works very well, but I would consider another blender with a more soundly constructed lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to crush ice, get the ice blade attachment","review":"A lot of reviewers problems have seemed to be with crushed ice, or frozen fruit. I purchased an ice blade to go along with this (only $10 more) and it crushed everything up in about 4 seconds. My honey was thrilled with it!! We have gone through 2 other blenders this month alone, and I will be shocked if this doesn't last. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is I would've like it better if the glass jar was just a little bigger..... but I wonder if I can just order a bigger one?? I'll have to look! GREAT purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great, really loud","review":"The title says it all. I would give it 5 stars if they somehow could make it quieter.

Heavy, therefore stable with no \\"walking\\" when in operation. Was surprised at how much I like the black base. NO fingerprints and very easy to keep clean. The two speeds are 100% enough to do any blender job. I don't miss my old 16 speed at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"We have owned several blenders, some average and some 'professional.' None come close to power of this one. First, you can tell by the weight of it that it is well built. Metal construction and very powerful. I put whole ice cubes in the blender and turned it on. (Only one speed with a pulse on that same speed). The ice turned to sluce before I could blink. I could not believe how fast it blended the ice. It is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for sheer power for making frostys or other ice crushing capabilities, this is the one. I would have given it 10 stars if I was able. You can not go wrong with this powerhouse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for frozen fruit - smoothie makers beware!","review":"I bought this blender because of all the rave reviews it received in using it to make smoothies. Please note that if you plan on blending FROZEN chunks of anything, it has a hard time pulling chunks to the blades. I use it primarily for fruit smoothies with small frozen fruit chunks and everytime I make one I have to stop the blender several times to manually push the chunks down toward the blades. It spins incredibly fast, creating a pocket of air right above the blades, which is probably why the frozen chunks don't get pulled down to the bottom. Not sure if the taller skinnier jar design has anything to do with that, either. Once everything reaches the blades, it does completely pulverize solids, but it takes several manual attempts to get the food to reach the blades.Also, WOW, this is one loud blender! You almost need ear protection to use it! Best of luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST \\"Coffee Blender/Icy\\" Drinks","review":"Without question, the very best blender I have ever purchased. I can see this blender lasting me quite a while. I was so tired of buying blenders that were not good at all of blending any type of smoothy-type of drinks..ie...Frappuccino type coffee drinks. My very favorite blender drink. Now with this GREAT new blender I have no problem making my coffee drinks. The ice is blended in seconds, just like in the store! One review mentioned about this being a loud blender...it is no louder than any other blender. I believe that this is as close to a professional type bar blender that you can buy at such a great price. I would highly recommend this blender to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Find Somethig Else Before This Blender","review":"It is the loudest appliance I've ever owned or heard in my life. I can be in the back room of the house when my wife is using it and it will still drive me crazy. You can imagine how loud it is when it is me actually using it.The second downer is, while being extremely loud, the unit goes berserk vibrating and moving all over the counter while blending. It is literally a chore to try to hold it still and keep the jar and everything in place.Third bad thing is that we've had it only a little over a year and it is starting to break, we are looking for a new one now from a different manufacturer. The reasons we bought this unit originally were from the good reviews and the single serving cup attachment, sadly it wasn't worth it.The only one thing i can say good about the blender is when it does work it does blend \\"okay\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality jar-base","review":"i bought this blnder depending on the customer's reviews actually its a good blender but the jar base was cracked after 5 times of usageits very poor quality ... i had to buy another jar base .. they could make a better quality base :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Powerful","review":"We purchased this unit based on reviews and it is exactly as stated.

It's certainly a powerful enough motor to handle a bigger container. Otherwise, I like the simple design, and the way it looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Blender","review":"After reading all of the reviews, I decided to purchase this blender. I use it almost exclusively to make smoothies with fruit, juice, yogurt, and ice. Other reviewers complained about it not mixing thoroughly. I found that it works best if you pulse twice to thoroughly circulate the chunks of fruit, juice, and ice that are near the blades. After the pulsing, use the switch in the ON position until thoroughly blended. If you put too much ice in, the mix gets too thick for the blender to circulate. I remedy this by adding more \\"warm\\" juice. I have no complaints about this blender. I am 100% happy with my purchase. (I use it once daily.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good with forzen fruit","review":"I bought this blender because of the excellent reviews on Amazon.com.

I used it once and was so annoyed I made her take it back.I then started to read about this Oster blender. I had good luck with buying small appliances from Amazon in the past, so I ordered it.This blender is very well constructed: all metal motor, thick rubber feet, thick glass container. It has two settings: on/off and pulse. What else do you need? Simple and functional.Just a warning: when you use this blender it sounds like a jet engine spooling up.How does it work? Let's say I'm impressed, and that's not easy to do. I followed a recipe for potato pancakes provided in a little cookbook that came with the blender.The instructions said to put a bunch of cubed raw potatoes in the blender with a whole onion. I thought, this blender is just going to spin or bog down, but it turned that stuff into batter very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"ice smasher","review":"Needed something that could handle crushed ice.

Other reviewers are correct when they say it is a bit loud - but it's a blender - what do you expect?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disagree!","review":"The 2nd time I used this blender was to blend soup. The liquid spurted up, dislodged the plastic cap which then sank into the soup and was pulverized. Goodbye soup. Basically, it does look like a very strong motor but the immediate high speed and flimsy top have their liabilities. My hand was on the lid so it wasn't a matter of inattention. Maybe good for ice but if you are using this for a variety of kitchen tasks then definitely get a model with more speeds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in only two months!!!","review":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.

I mean LOUD and SLOW.The design of the blender does not promote shredding and blending.Poor purchase on my part, can't recommend it no matter what price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plug In Jet Engine","review":"Though this blender was extremely powerful and industrial looking, it was WAY WAY WAY too loud. I mean ear splitting tooth grinding loud. It was a cross between a 747 engine and a dental drill. It's practically unsafe to operate this blender without hearing protection.If you don't mind the noise, this Oster performed well. It made pretty good smoothies and I could throw in whole frozen strawberries without slowing it down.Due to the noise, I gave it away after using it a handful of times and bought a Vitamix blender instead, which I'm very happy with. If you use a blender a lot, the Vitamix is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked For Three Weeks","review":"I received the blender on 06/04/08 and began using it shortly thereafter to make daily smoothies. However, on 06/27/08 I noticed that the blades had stopped turning. When I took the blender apart, I noticed that the silver thing that fits into the center of the base (the drive?)--was no longer attached and could not turn the blades. I was very disappointed because I expected great things with such a powerful motor.Amazon gave me the option of replacement or refund. I'm going to try the blender again. If this one does the same thing, I will request a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problem as others - not good with frozen fruit","review":"Since the only thing we use this blender for is fruit smoothies, it's a bit annoying that the thing can't really handle frozen fruit. The fruit doesn't get down to the bottom and it creates an air pocket. I have to use a wooden spoon to stir every few seconds of blending.Huge disappointment. I think this would work better if the base was wider and if the blade went in both directions. My parents have the Oster Fusion. We tried the frozen drink button and we got the perfect smoothie. May go ahead and try that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This blender is fantastic","review":"It is solid, sturdy and very powerful.

Nice to see a well made product that I can afford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Blender Yet","review":"I have gone through 4 blenders in the past couple of years. They have all had loads of buttons and a special one for ice crushing. But they all have burned out motors within a year or two. By far this blender beats them all.

I recommend highly to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Don't Want Hearing Loss, Don't Use This","review":"This blender really does work very well, but the noise has too many decibels!

Powerful, and completely blends up ice for smoothies and milk shakes. BUT the lid turns very soft when it gets hot. I've been burned more than once, and had to clean up the kitchen from all the food spewing out. This is not due to putting to much into the blender. It's because of the flaw in the lid material used. If someone knows of a replacement lid of harder material, please let me know.As someone else mentioned, I do suggest that you get a blender with more speeds.I will keep this one for smoothies, shakes and other cold foods. Now I have to find another blender for pureeing hot soup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud Awakening","review":"I Purchased This Blender after reading countless reviews.

I bought it after the cheap blender that I had been using started failing mechanically. I thought I would buy a more expensive one this time, and I liked the looks of the professional Oster. To my disappointment, the blender looks and feels very cheap. The lid is plastic and very flimsy, as well as the silver colored plastic piece around the pitcher base. The bottom of the unit is also plastic. I haven't used the blender yet, but I am so put off by all its cheap qualities. Its so different than pictured, and I don't feel its worth the price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken twice in 2 years","review":"Look around the net and you will find quickly that the blender is garbage and has a VERY high failure rate where the blade connect to the motor.

Others can attest to the pros of this blender, and so my primary purpose in writing this is to say some cons I wish I knew to go into the decision making process.* The power cord is extremely short (maybe 2-2.5 ft. long)* The container's lid is a very cheap and thin* The glass container has fairly thin walls.* The motor is extremely loud to the point of it being irritating if on for more than several seconds.Those four cons add up to a deduction of a star, but really, I can get an extension cord, be careful with the container, and deal with the sound. The machine certainly quickly crushes ice well, and that's what I wanted this blender to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"very impressed","review":"bought this blender after checking reviews for a half dozen other blenders in the same price range. first impressions are: seems very hefty and solidly built, plenty of power for my needs - mainly protein shakes - i like the toggle switch - simple and rugged, somewhat loud, but just below the level where i would call it \\"too loud\\". all in all i can't see how there can be much difference between this blender and others costing two or three times as much. made in mexico, but the fit and finish is very good. i almost bought the braun powermax, but chose this one because of the all metal drive system. comes with three year warranty - looks, sounds and works like it could last forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful Bible study for all Christian writers","review":"This is a wonderful Bible study for all Christian writers.

So far I have made it to page 451 (out of 800+) and I am rather disappointed. Many of the nuances that could make this a great text simply aren't there--such as tricks of the trade and drug info and more background on conditions. In addition, there just doesn't seem to be any life to this book. Ok, granted it is a textbook---but I have read textbooks before with some life in them, and this isn't one of them. It is so boring and dull it just makes me want to cry. I start to read and find myself several hours latter drooling all over the book, wishing that I had been abducted by aliens as that would have been a better way to past the time. Finally, this book glosses over several common ER complaints, does not cover several others, and seeds the material that it does provide with errors and outdated facts.

Like old-time radio engineers, who pulled back the loud sections of music, he (or she) decided that some sections of the music were just too much for home listeners to stand. I have hundreds of DVDs, many of the Berlin Philharmoniker, and none of them have this problem. The excitement of the music was destroyed by the distortion of the music and its dynamics. I am certain that Levine and certainly not the producers of this DVD are aware of the problem i havedescribed. It never should have been released.

It would be fine for kids under 6. The discs, however are double sided, and I think they would scratch easily.If you are a geek like me and wanted the cartoons... what this appears to me is a Saturday Morning Cartoons show that just used the old harvey cartoons. The original credits are cut, and worse the cartoons are cut up.There are no menus as well.Avoid this set till a better one rolls along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvey Toons - Awesome old cartoons","review":"I bought this so that my kids could enjoy some of the \\"real\\" cartoons that my wife and I grew up on. We both remember racing to the TV to see these toons and both my 8 year old and 2 year old seem to love them just as much. What a nostalgia point for us.

Could be! Let's see how...","review":"Right, well, The Bits is saying it will include all 312 cartoons. If they run between 6 and 8 minutes each that's an average of 7 mins per cartoon. 7x312 = 2184 minutes. Slice that by 8 (the number of sides this 4-disc set will have) and you get 273 mins per disc. Halve that to get your dual-layer total and it comes to just over 130 minutes per layer.Since these were mostly limited animation cartoons, that starts to look a lot more likely. Though they might not have much room to breathe - and any bonus features are sure to be a no show - it is possible that this release will contain all 312 HarveyToons.Time will tell, which is why I haven't rated this yet (hence just the one star), but considering how cartoons like this have been bundled before, I wouldn't be surprised if this was legitimate."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking??","review":"First of all...this is NOT the complete collection. Secondly, the cartoons are butted together with hardly time for one to end before the next one begins. And lastly, there is no booklet, no listing, no menu of any kind on the DVD itself.Very shoddy package of some very fine cartoons and characters. I hate to sound like an old-timer...but why do most people not care anymore about what they produce? How could you sign you name or be part of a team that worked on this very mediocre (at best) packaging, and walk out of work with any sense of pride?Dramatic, I know, but fight the urge to be any part of mediocrity. Be proud to sign your name to anything you produce. No one should be proud of being any part of this packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Screen Songs","review":"After searching and searching for the Screen Songs, and then to find so many listed as available on this disc I was very excited.But after viewing it I was very dissapointed. There are only the first minute or so of the Screen Songs included, NONE have the follow the bouncing ball segments with the sing a long songs and that was the sole reason I bought this dvd. The cartoons are great and the dvd is worth the price but it is not what I was expecting and I would not have bought it if I had know that the Sceen Songs were essentially not on the dvd. If you are looking for the Paramount Pictures Screen Songs, they are not on this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Incomplete Collection","review":"A horrendous excuse for a collection. Many of the shorts are cut and incomplete. Some of them have no title given, they just start up right after the previous toon. As others have said, there's no episode title listing any where in the packaging. I would have rather paid more money for a truly complete collection. Unless Sony Media changes the way it's doing these types of collections, I'll never buy another. It's a waste of money for the true Harveytoon fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, despicable quality...","review":"I bought this as a x-mas gift last year. When I was able to get my hands on it, I realized that a child would have a difficult time workign the toy. Also, the mechanism was a bit faulty. The kid has a lot of fun, but it left me to wonder why Nerf didn't stick with a classic design which is not only simple but higher in quality as it cuts down on parts that break.I'll definitely preview the toys at the local toy store before buying online.

I love his classical CDs and I LOVE his rock interpretations, but somehow he misses the mark with jazz. I don't really know why--he is such a good musician. But I don't think he understands the fundamental nature of jazz, the way it lends itself to improvisation, and the \\"conversational\\" expression that takes place among jazz musicians while they play that makes jazz so distinctive and compeling.This is still an admirably creative endevor and worth a listen.

How many \\"scientist gone awry\\" pictures do we need? Looking for cooky special effects to entice you? Well, if you find a man in plant suit cooky, then you will see this as a great achievement. For others looking for camp value, there is little to see here. As for the technical qualities of this DVD, the sound is actually quite clean and brilliant. The picture suffers from an aged print and some visual artifacts (though these are not terribly distracting, just annoying). As for the price of this DVD, its a bit steep for what you get.

I think he'd had the old one for about 10 years, so that should give you some indication of just how durable these wallets are! The zip-around feature means you don't lose slips of paper, the slide-out plastic ID tray is very convenient, and he was pleased to discover that there are more credit card slots in this newer design--as many as are in a standard leather tri-fold wallet--but that hasn't added any bulk to this wallet. It is still very slim and fits easily and comfortably in his pocket. I will definitely buy another one in 10 years or so when this one needs replacing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big and too small","review":"It's unbelievable that a wallet could be both at the same time. In the \\"too big\\" case, its almost twice as big and just as fat as my old trifold with the same amount of stuff in it. In the \\"too small\\" case, I can barely fit my bills in it. Another annoyance is they put a mesh where my ID would go. What is the point in that? I have to pull it out anyway to show it because the ID cannot be read through the mesh.On the plus side the zipper does seem to hold up very well and that is the only reason why I haven't chucked this expensive wallet.UPDATE: It has been two years since I bought this thing and the zipper finally gave out. Bad wallet. Now I can buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small...","review":"Nice wallet...but who are they kidding? The bill compartment is even too small for US dollars.

And what's the deal with no change pockets in wallets these days? If you're looking for an ultra slim wallet to carry just a few things this'll probably do just fine (and the zipper is a nice touch).

They last ~2 years for me personally before the zipper starts to wear out completely. I love the idea of the wallet and they're great while they last, but the most critical feature isn't high enough quality to justify the price in my opinion. If they could beef up the quality of the zipper (stainless steel maybe?) I would gladly pay twice the price for a longer lasting (ideally lifetime) wallet. However, I still give it a 4 star since I love the wallet while it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"I bought this to replace a 5-year-old victronox wallet - the zipper finally failed on my old wallet. In contrast to my old wallet, the new one is very stiff - it feels like there's a piece of heavy cardboard in it.

While the strings and Phillip Martin on the piano seem to carry their weight fairly well (the recording of Mock Morris is very nice), the wind players leave much to be desired. Balance and stylistic problems plague this CD. The first trumpet plays decent but can't time his breaths worth anything and the low woodwinds and brass put out a pitiful amount of sound. The flute's interpretation in \\"Blithe Bells\\" is stylistically terrible. There is also a horrible electronically synthesized solo in \\"Green Bushes\\" (Imitating Bassoon maybe???) which completely destroys that piece. Overall I'm very unhappy with this CD. If you're looking for Grainger, purchase the Chandos Grainger Edition CD's with the Royal Northern College of Music Wind Ensemble. Those CD's are vastly superior to this poor attempt at Grainger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salmonson is better than your favorite fantasy author. :)","review":"In my opinion, Salmonson is among the five *best* fantasy authors of all time.

I have bags and wallets from the collection. I have wanted the leather braided watch for 2 years so I was very excited when it went on sale. However, when the watch arrived I was very disappointed. First, the leather was very cheap and looked more like plastic. Second, the watch did not fit. I have very small wrists and it barely fit me. Third, there was no real place for the clasp to go through so you were forcing it literally through the leather. The face of the watch was small as well.

This books helps to quickly get the reader to a clear understanding using diagrams, graphs, flow charts and photos along with the text written in laymans terms.

EVER.","review":"There is a distinction about this book; it isn't the worst book we've ever read in our lives, but awfully close. Merman's life has already been revealed in several other times (most notably her 1978 autobiography and the Bob Thomas' solid 1984 I Got Rhythm); here author Geoffrey Mark promises to tell the truth. Really? Where? Merman's alleged lesbian love affair with Jacqueline Susann has been documented already, as has the tragic death of her daughter Ethel Jr. and her very brief marriage to Ernest Borgnine. The book needs major editing and proofreading. Any book boasting lines such as \\"Romantically, she thought with her vagina\\" deserves to be slow-roasted, then spit out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother, unless............","review":"Don't bother buying this book unless you are a fan of supermarket tabloids. There are many factual errors & the author seems far more interested in speculating about Ms. Merman's private life than in providing factual information on one of the greatest performers in Broadway history. I was furtunate enough to see Ms. Merman in all of the shows she did after 1940. She was a true original & deserves nuch, much better than she receives from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fawning, gushing, sloppy and poorly written","review":"The book is nicely produced with excellent photos and a polished, professional look. The professionalism ends there. The writer flits randomly but amiably among first, second and third person, with breathless accounts of events that, in some cases, are exaggerated beyond recognition. The book appears not to have been fact checked (Merman and Robbins embracing after \\"Rose's Turn\\" in 1954????). So there has yet to be a definitive Merman biography.

That's why ETHEL MERMAN: THE BIGGEST STAR ON BROADWAY is an important survey of not only her life but the Broadway scene as a whole: she worked with some of the biggest names of her time and their stories blend with hers in a fine biographical survey.

Conveniently comes with a sturdy deep tray to keep all the parts in. All around a very nice, well-engineered little machine. Not expensive, not heavy, not noisy, doesn't occupy a lot of storage space, not frustrating. Just a lot of fun to use, and it made great sausages. If I ever use it to make pasta, I'll comment on that later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unusable product","review":"I attempted to use the grinder for over two hours, trying to grind up some chicken breast. I could not manage to get the grinder to sit still on the counter while turning the handle, and it also did not force the chicken through at all well. I finally gave up and threw the whole mess into the trash. Not a product I can recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"Chops meat well but plugged up when I tried to chop pickles. I had to remove plate to loosen the chopped pickles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipped incomplete","review":"Product received with one part missing (coarse blade). I tried to reach Amazon via e-mail and have written the company customer service department in Everett, WA. I'm hoping to receive this part so I can at least TRY it out. Due to the \\"pink slime\\" news report lately I refuse to buy chopped meat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard on the arms!","review":"Bought this grinder so that I could make store-bought ground beef even more tender so that my ninety-year-old dad could chew it. But, the ground meat would not pass through the holes of the grinding plate well at all. My husband and daughter helped me by taking turns turning the handle. It took us about an hour and a half to grind 4 pounds of ground beef. Then, the meat still was not tender enough for Dad to chew. I never tried the grinding plates for mincing and those for making pasta. So, I did not give this grinder a 1 star. Perhaps it would have performed better with nuts and noodles! Return and full refund were completed in record time. Bad grinder; great customer service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grinder","review":"I specifically bought this grinder to grind up green chili & fruits to make jams. It has wonderful. The suction on the bottom is excellent & it is very easy to assemble & clean. I haven't tried grind up meat or make pasta, but I'm excited to try it. I liked mine so much that I purchased one for my mom as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This was really hard to use since it didn't suction to the counter and the meat kept jamming at the end. You have to keep reversing counterclockwise to make it work right. I do not recommend this at all and advise you to get an attachment to your mixer instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected","review":"Ordered this thinking it would probably have to be returned, but was encouraged by past revues. It far exceeded my expectations! Wanted it to process venison for hamburger and sausage and it did a wonderful job, quick and easy. I did pay attention to reviews that stated to assemble according to directions, when I did, it looked so wrong, but was so right! Easy to clean and made quick work of grinding 10 pounds of venison and 4 pounds of pork shoulder, first a course grind and then used the fine blade. Have used it three time now and for the money it is great. Haven't tried the pasta maker and did not buy it for that function. Another plus is that it easy to clean after use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control","review":"There are nipples on the mincing plates that fit in slots in the mincing cup to keep the plates from rotating. However, with the one I received the shaft is too long to let the nipples on the mincing plates easily fit in slots in the mincing cup so the mincing plates rotate as you turn the crank and no meat is ground. I was able to tilt the plates sideways on the shaft so one of the nipples fit in a slot and held the plates in place with one hand while I tightened the cap with the other hand to grind the meat I had. This is probably the same problem others have had who complained about the device not grinding meat. It's just poor quality control. I returned this and bought one that works fine from a local butcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice grinder but useless because of an Achilles' Heel","review":"This is a nice compact grinder that suctions well to the counter (we have Formica). Unfortunately when we were grinding meat the plastic piece that receives the metal crank stripped rendering the grinder useless. It might work well for softer foods. Also the instructions were extremely minimal and it takes a while to figure out how to put it together and operate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, mostly","review":"I received this a week or so ago and have used it a couple of times since then to mince some beef.The grinder part works pretty well--nice long lever so it's not too hard to crank. But the suction cup is terrible--I ended up having to hold it with one hand, hard, while it skittered all over the counter. It slowed down the grind and made it a lot more work to use. I feel like it might work better on a perfectly smooth counter, but I wouldn't hold my breath. I still give it 2 stars because it's easy to clean and assemble and the mechanism works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Plastic Grinder","review":"This is a great little kitchen tool, not to be confused with the much more expensive aluminum and stainless steel models. It's plastic, and it's fully functional and fun to use. If you're a survivalist looking to turn an elk into ground meat, buy something else. If your doing pasta or specialty grinding or mincing for Christmas ... this is the tool for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to clean","review":"I was excited and after the positive reviews of being easy to clean, stays on your counter top, does not slide - great reviews.It does not stick to my counter top (granite, which is very smooth!), I made pasta (which was delicious) but the pasta dough came out in the front and the back and for cleaning I needed a toothpick to get all the dough out, which is now in the drain...

The grinder did not grind in uniform pieces, thus making it's usefulness pretty dissppointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"Very easy to use and clean. Most parts are non-metallic, so there is no worry of possible rusting. The only thing you need to make sure is that the installation is done properly for it to work smoothly.

It didn't take long and we only had to run it through once. I haven't used the pasta attachments yet.

But I still decided to give it a try.It turned out to be a great try:1. It is easy to be assembled and works perfectly.2. It is clean and easy to be cleaned.3. It is small and doesn't occupy too much space.Definitely a good deal (value for money)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful for meat and vegetable!","review":"I've purchased this for the whole family to make grounded meat, and it works very easy and smooth.Pros: You don't need to be a strong person to prepare several pounds of meat, the sharp blade will do it for you. So instead of buying who-knows-what-portion grounded meat from the supermarkets, I can cook with what I know exactly was in there. It is also very good for mincing vegetables like carrots, celery, and a lot more. Nuts are good too. Easy to clean.Cons: There will always be some portion left in the grinder, so the more you grind every time, the less ratio of loss you will have. You need to plan ahead a little bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far Better Than Expensive Grinders","review":"Perfect for me!!!I have had two very expensive meat grinders that I threw in the trash in frustration. All I want to do is grind my own ground beef and those models wouldn't do it. In a last ditch effort, I read the reviews on this and thought I'd try one last time, but my hopes weren't high because of the adage 'you get what you pay for'. That is not true in this case!This grinder is perfect!!! It doesn't jam up and have to be taken apart every few grinds! I ground an entire pound of sirloin without every having to stop and clean out the gears!!! Clean up was equally as simple.I highly recommend this little machine and can't wait to make some pasta and spatezle with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic and cheap","review":"I bought this in hopes of having a cheap way to process a few lbs of deer at a time. The cheap plastic didn't even make it through 4 pounds... the spindle started to sheer and leave plastic bits in the meat and then the blades completely stopped cutting and wouldn't even push the meat through the front. Terrible product if you plan to use for grinding meat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for grinding meat","review":"Not so good for making pasta. I was a little wary because of some of the negative reviews. But it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. I mainly use it to grind pork to make dumpling stuffing. The unit handles well pork belly meat with quite a bit of sinew. The plastic parts seem sturdy enough to last a long while. I do cut the meat into small strips before grinding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little gizmo from Amazon","review":"I bought this for the sole purpose of grinding wildsalmon to make salmon burgers.

We just used it to make stuffing for buns. It works really well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little grinder","review":"This grinder comes with various end attachments. The two grinder plates and stuffer end are why I really bought this. I've tried the pasta attachment a few times and it didn't turn out great, but I blame this more on my bad pasta making skills. Best result so far is a drier dough to use for the extrusion. For grinding meat this is solid. The suction cup really sticks to the surface. You have to mount it so the handle overhangs the edge of table/counter since the long arm designed is for more torque. This is a minor inconvenience and isn't a deal breaker. The plus is that it disassembles easily for cleaning, the plastic is very very strong/sturdy, and it works. For those DIY meat grinders out there the top clear part slides out and the handle unscrews so you can put it in the smallest of freezers before getting your grind on. When you lock the suction cup to the table another tab pops from the top of the white base locking the clear hopper/grinder into place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mincer for the Price!","review":"I bought this because I was tired of trying to chop my cat's chicken small enough to suit their desires. Yes, I know - scheesh! - for a cat??!!. Yes, they are quite old and pampered. This is GREAT and does a great job of grinding it up in to tiny morsels. My only complaint is the handle is longer than the main body forcing me to place it next to an edge of the counter. That can be awkward for the turning process and placement of the bowl. For the money this is a great little mincer, though!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect little machine","review":"I am so glad I got this, grinds perfectly, and the clean up is so easy, it comes completely apart for easy clean up, and to dry I just stick everything in a colander(strainer) as it dries so the blade doesn't get misplaced or in the wrong hands.this is a perfect grinder to get if you live in an apartment with very little kitchen space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome machine!","review":"This is a fantastic machine, especially coonsidering the price. It EASILY made the best ground beef I've ever had. For my first run, I used a whole chuck roast, and this little grinder went through it easily. I ended up with incredible ground beef, and the machine itself breaks down entirely (all pieces) and is so easy to clean. It really doesn't get any better than this at this price.For a higher priced model, you'd expect motorized grinder and a bigger hopper, but other than that, there is no improving on this unit. Fantastic. Here it is in action with pics.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented.

Everything gets stuck after a few moments of grinding - pasta dough, meat, etc. The worst thing, however, is that it leaves plastic shavings on the ground meat. They are so tiny that you can barely see them. Unless someone likes eating chemically processed plastic... This product couldn't have possibly passed quality control! I had to throw my meat away because of the plastic shavings! What a waste of perfect meat! It is unacceptable to sell something like that. Shameful! I am returing it as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"very diappointed","review":"I bought this more for the pasta maker than a meat grinder thinking both might be useful. Mistake. The pasta maker clogs up continually and the base won't stay fastened down. Eventually had to take the dough out and do it by hand as I couldn't get it go through. Waste, waste, waste of time and money. Won't buy that brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing!","review":"I bought this grinder to make fresh vegetable relishes. Bad choice!

The tendon in the meat would tangle and block the plate and the grinder would be jammed. Today I had so much trouble with the grinder (about 30 minutes), I simply went back to my 20-year-old GE food processor. That took about 3 minutes. My guess is that this is only good for chicken breast and salmon.As for pasta maker, my experience is that the shape of the pasta does not hold and they all stick together after coming out of the maker. It is very difficult to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the individual household","review":"I returned some wretched electric grinder I had bought on Amazon a week before that couldnt cut warm butter. This cuts very well and is pretty quick with a small volume of meat. Only negative feedback is I did a first grind on the larger blade and put through a second grind on a the same grind, and given there is no logical way to put meat into the grind other than manual it can take a bit of work as well as overgrind. Still, first grind with frozen cubic centimeter sized meat was perfect, and for the price and functionality, a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rigatoni A+ Fettucini C-","review":"My first project with this was to make Rigatoni. I used the recipe that came with the Pasta Maker and it was super. As a matter of fact, I'm being questioned by my family as to when I'll be making it again. I thought I'd try to make fettucini instead for my second pasta making foray... the top part and bottom part of the stuff that came out was fettucini, but the middle rows spit out big globs of dough. Perhaps this was some form of \\"user error\\", but I was a bit dissappointed in how much more difficult it was than the rigatoni.I haven't used it to grind meat yet and will probably try to make fettucini again, just to see if I get a different result.The product arrived before expected and was packed great.

It wouldn't go through and the machine wouldn't stick to the counter. Every time I tried to crank the handle it would come off. And the few moments it did stay there I couldn't get the dough to come out of the attachment. I thought that perhaps my dough was too wet so I added more flour and kneaded it and it still stuck inside of the machine. I promptly washed it out packed it back up and sent both of them back. This was very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was too good to be true for the price","review":"I have been interested in making my own pasta and mincing and saw the general feedback for this was quite positive so for the price I thought I would give it a go. Only got to use it once, I thought I would use it to make pasta and this struggled big time. Cheaply made machine and it showed it, really struggled to push the dough through the attachments and NO the dough was not too hard. Barely made it through this job and I cleaned it up although the handle was quite sloppy at this point, I thought that I would try and make mince with it next time as I figured that maybe the mince would be an easier chore for it.

The suction cup base holds strong on my granite counter top and handle is easy to turn. I also found cleanup fast and easy.Some of the reviews say about how meat gets stuck and handle is hard to turn, but I would bet anything some of them put the blade in backwards. I could see how that would be easy to do, as it would be intuitive to think the blades goes towards the incoming meat instead of towards the metal plate.I have not tried any of the pasta attachments. Basically bought it to turn a steak into hamburg so I could fry it up on the grill/skillet. And this it does with ease and the burgers tasted great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and cheap","review":"Cant beat it at the price.

It was cast iron and clamped to a table and was easy to use and clean and lasted forever. I got this product thinking I would see if I liked grinding my own burger and making sausage (thanks to the pink slime reveal) before purchasing a higher quality more expensive appliance. From that perspective this inexpensive product did what I needed it to. I will be buying a better grinder. This product reminded me of the E-Z Bake Oven - like a toy. It will grind things but you will spend more time prying stuck meat out of the grinder than you ever would want. Moreover the grinder handle is longer than the body of the grinder which means that you have to awkwardly position this grinder to use it. Grrrr!

This thing does exactly what I want - which is grind up meat. So far I have ground up chicken thighs, wings and raw organs - kidney, liver, heart, and gizzards. This thing chewed up and spat out what my blender had a hard time with (gizzards, heart and parts of the kidney). This thing also chews up raw chicken wing bones like no one's business! Granted, I DO have to rock the handle back and forth otherwise the suction cup will pop off (thats the about the only thing about it thats poor), but it still grinds the bones up enough to make them tiny bits.This thing is made out of solid, Lego type plastic and its pretty sturdy. Suction cup could be improved on, but otherwise its nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"I bought this product for two purposes, to grind meat and make pasta. The grinding of the meat was ok, minus having to constantly clear out the blades, because they would become jammed with meat that it wouldn't push out. The second day I had the product I decided to my demise to make pasta. Once I was through about half of my dough, the piece that connects to the handle broke, rendering the entire device useless. My recommendation is to buy a meat grinder that does not have cheap plastic to form a vital function of the machine. This machine worked for meat, but couldn't push out dough.

Any amount of fat not trimmed off of the cut of meat will jam up the blades and the entire operation comes to a halt. Twice in the course of grinding up two small tenderloins I had to disassemble the entire thing, pull strings of fat & partially ground meat off of the blades and strainer, rinse the entire thing and reassemble it. After it jammed a third time into the garbage it went.If you only want to make meatballs and you are willing to trim every last bit of fat off of the meat then the Norpro Grinder is inexpensive, works very well, cleans easily, is small and doesn't require much storage.

Non-HD video was not as bad as HD, but was still poor. Later, response to the remote would freeze so I'd have to reboot the VDR and wait five minutes for it to restart. Then it would no longer record. Finally it rebooted itself and never restarted. I returned it to my cable provider and asked for a \\"brand name\\" VDR.

Neighbors look at you like you're spazzing out in the driveway. I thought these cheap things were my only option. Much to my surprise, when I went looking for a scraper on Amazon for this coming winter, I noticed this bad boy! I bought a couple of these based on all the positive reviews I read. The brass tip really does do wonders. I only have to make about 10 passes across the windshield to clear the whole thing. Each scrape completely clears all of the frost in its path. I would definitely recommend buying a few of these to stash away in the house. And if you haven't used a brass blade before, you are MISSING OUT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives Up to the Name Fantastic","review":"This brass ice scraper is MUCH sharper than a plastic blade, but it won't scratch glass. So it clears windows MUCH faster than with a standard plastic ice scraper. The only down-side is the small size. For clearing the large front windshield on my wife's minivan, I definitely wish the manufacturer offered a brass scraper that was about twice the size. Still, this one can get in to clear side-view mirrors, and it stores much more easily than the huge scrapers. It's way faster on side windows, and the better ice clearing compensates for the extra passes on a front window with this narrow blade. It doesn't look very impressive, but the results will win you over."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it.","review":"There isn't a whole lot of variety in the ice scrapers offered in Charlotte stores and I had no luck at all in finding one with a brass blade.

It is a million times better than any of the little plastic scrapers I had littering up the wayback of my Explorer. Happy I haven't had to use it often, but happy that I have it when I do need one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Scraper","review":"This scraper cuts ice clean off leaving nothing at all behind. The soft brass edge is robust against ice but weak against glass, so it doesn't scratch. There are two weaknesses if you can call them that - the unit is inexpensive and so not super strong - if you push hard enough you can snap off the handle especially when it's freezing cold. I bought this unit to replace one I broke this way, I had that unit for 14 years. The second 'weakness' is that this will shatter clear ice on your windshield into tiny ice crystals that fly up onto your hand - wear gloves and dust your hands off when you're done with it - they'll have quite a lot of powdered ice on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"A bit small in the hand, so my hand gets tired quickly.

But the blade is very effective for removing ice and frozen condensation off windshield.Overall am happy with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept. Handle needs work.","review":"First of all, the brass blade really shaves the frost off a winshield cleanly. It is a revelation compared to plastic scrapers which really just put strakes through it.

With a sturdier handle, this gets 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not JUST for windshields!","review":"Looking forward to using this during the winter, but as a baker with a granite counter top, I found this is also a GREAT scraper to clean up with.

Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this, buy several","review":"I had a brass scraper several years ago and lost it, been searching for another since. I bought one of these for each car. The handle seems a bit flimsy, but has not broken. Bottom line - it scales frost off the car window *way* better than anything else I've ever used. Don't hammer it, the brass blade is soft, which is why it will not scratch the glass. The only time it failed was after an ice storm, but 1/4\\" of sheet ice is a bit much to ask from any scraper.

I realize now why people are buying these in six packs.Update 2 icy seasons later...my initial review took this scraper to task for being too flimsy...I stand corrected. Two years in Pennsylvania and multiple scrapes later. No issues and still a sharp functioning blade. I gave away by backup plastic scraper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic? Not for ice scraping...","review":"I moved from sunny, southern California to central Illinois. I have learned a lot about \\"seasons\\" and how to prepare for \\"weather.\\" One thing I was told I needed to acquire was an ice scraper. No problem! One quick Amazon search later and I found one that had \\"Fantastic\\" IN THE NAME!Boom. Done.Some of my friends who grew up in snowy climates actually laughed when they looked at the scraper. OK, fine, maybe it's small, but that doesn't mean it's not mighty. Right?! Well, that may be true, but in this case... it's a joke. I imagine the people raving about this product don't deal with much more than a light frost. This ice scraper is pretty flimsy and not particularly effective. The blade actually BENT when I was trying to get ice off my windshield. The blade BENT. I don't think that's supposed to happen. I ended up throwing it away after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Scraper Ever","review":"This scraper removes ice like magic.You'll never go back to a plastic scraper once you've used one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent scraper","review":"Bought this to replace a metal scraper my dog chewed, It's OK but the handle could be a bit firmer-the blade appears OK (used it this morning to scape ice off Rover's window) Like the metal blades better than plastic, seems they clear in one pass as opposed to 3 passes...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and flimsy.","review":"I was disappointed, going by the original picture I saw when ordering this, I thought it was going to be bigger and more sturdy. It's flimsy and tiny to hold onto but at least it does have a real brass scraping edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small and Cheaply made","review":"It's tiny, the blade and handle are much shorter than any other ice scraper on the market. Also the handle has no bend to it like any other ice scraper you buy, it is thin, straight and short. I was embarrased to give it away as a present to my sister in law. If you are going to buy in bulk from China spend a couple more pennies and give people something that they can dig into the ice with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy this junk again","review":"Cheap flimsy handle. The metal blade doesen't scrape very well. Overall I prefer a beer can or and expired TGI Friday gift card over this ice scraper. This thing is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fantastic scraper","review":"I live in NW Indiana near chicago. Tried it out on my iced over car and could not get any ice removed from my windows with it. Sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and works really well","review":"Takes the ice off my windshield better than any other product I've used. I'll never go back to the plastic stuff again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great yet flimsy","review":"Wal-Mart used to sell this exact type scraper 10 or 15 years ago. I loved them but eventually the handles broke and I could not find them locally anymore. I was happy to see them on Amazon, but I can see the design has not been improved a bit after all these years. The thing works infinitely better than any plastic scraper on tightly bonded frost, and even on most ice coatings. But my gosh the handle is flimsy! Also the brass blade itself is thin and bends easily. My kids tried to help me the other day and immediately bent the brass blade in one of my new ones. Maybe the construction is so lightweight as a safety feature to help prevent people from cracking their windshields with a massive brass hammer? Anyway, this thing is the best I ever used when used intelligently, plus I can easily re-sharpen the blade on a belt sander if the edge gets rounded. I just wish it was built tougher."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stocking stuffer","review":"good stocking stuffer for the hubby, its not a big one so dont think that it is but its a perfect hand size"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practically perfect.","review":"Pros:* This thing simply works wonderfully. It gets the ice off of a wind shield MUCH MUCH easier than any plastic scraper.Cons:* Mine came with all-black plastic. Still works great, but easier to loose in the trunk.* This thing seems like it could easily cut rubber, so keep it away from the edge of the window.* It works great on ice, but you still need a plastic scraper, just so that you can use the brush on snow.If you live in an area where you need to get ice off of your car more than two or three times a year, this is an AWESOME product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst computer programming book I've ever read","review":"I've been so unfortunate to buy this book a few weeks before it went out of print.To start with, it is outdated, as it covers Visibroker 3 (not 4) and BOA (not POA).It is very inaccurate: Not only you can find a huge lot of typos (yes, in the source code as well), but also incomplete/swapped figures (e.g. delegation vs. inheritance approach), concepts repeated over and over, entire sections copied and pasted from the quick reference Appendix A.It is also pathetically organised: The authors alternate in a masquerade of inconsistent examples, there are continuous and irritating forward references, and several acronym used without being introduced or a glossary.Take a look at this line of code, as an example to explain \\"Any\\"s:theAnyServer.the_any(theAny);I just don't understand how could 15 buyers have rated this book a \\"five stars\\". No wonder it hasn't seen a second edition. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"No-nonsense coverage of both Visibroker and CORBA","review":"Finally a genuine CORBA/Visibroker book. Having struggled through the fog in earlier books, this one comes across as a crystal clear coverage of the subject. No wasted pages here unlike others which spend 50-200 pages talking about Java (one would hardly be reading a Java/CORBA book without knowing Java in the first place).What I liked very much about the book is the extreme clarity, focus and the clear explanation of portability issues. I also liked the coverage of the advanced features of the OSAGENT as well as the discussion of advanced server topics.The book has one chapter on object oriented analysis and design. While at first it may appear like a devious attempt to fill up pages, it is actually a very well written chapter.I have struggled through the Orfali book (ugh) and also read the Vogel and Duddy book (which was a great relief after the Orfali book). This one is far better than either of those two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is the best book out there on Visibroker. It may also happen to be the only book out there on Visibroker! :) That aside, this is an excellent book. Some minor flaws in diagrams, but the examples are straight-forward enough such that you will likely catch the errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"*The* book for the serious VisiBroker programmer","review":"I am very disappointed with most CORBA books, e.g. the Martian books fill me with dismay and make me wonder whether CORBA will ever make it. But this is a proper book, this is a book that tells you facts. I have printed out the on-line manuals for VisiBroker, and read them, and this book taught me heaps more stuff.I absolutely recommend this book for anyone who has to write a VisiBroker program which is more than just a bank example. We have a team of developers, and the book is in such demand that I have to get a second copy.This book is not a tutorial, and it is not about general CORBA. If you buy VisiBroker, you should buy this book as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for blue collar workers.","review":"Programming with VisiBroker is precise and practical. A very decently organized book with examples and tips on how to design distributed systems. If you are a Java/C++ programmer looking to learn CORBA, you will relish this book. Beware; the Transaction Monitor Service is not covered. This is quite disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Great piece of spiritual music sung by all male choir. It is simply very uplifting, enthusiastic and reminds me of military choirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"patchouli plant","review":"Plant arrived quickly, but was very small. It immediately started dropping leaves. Of the other 3 plants oredered at the same time one was small amd spindly and one is now dead (one week later) I live in Sarasota FL and the weather is not a factor. I followed instructions and watered right away and did not over water patchouli. Am contacting grower for refund. Seller refunded my $$ immediately :-)))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"I ordered 2 of these little guys, and actually got sent three! :) They were in GREAT shape when I opened the box, considering they had been manhandled by my roomate.

I would recommend movie to all my best friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sroller for 4 year old","review":"I purchased this stroller after my 4 year old fell in love with a similar one at Pottery barn (for three times the price). We were looking for a larger size than the other doll strollers because my daughter is tall for her age and always ends up bent over to push her strollers. This one is perfect, my 7 year old can even push it with out bending down. It is so sturdy and well made with realistic buckles, seats and easy to steer wheels. It is now holding 5 dolls strapped in various positions, the girls have not left it alone since it arrived. I have purchased 6 doll strollers between my two youngest daughters and this one is by far the best value, I think it will be my final stroller purchase unless I have to buy a second one for her sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most - but not perfect.","review":"I was hoping for a little better quality. It is bigger and better than any other toy stroller I have ever seen. However - the quality still isn't perfect. The hook that is meant to keep the stroller shut, is too low, therefor allowing the stroller to open a bit too far. It should be higher where it would hold it shut completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overnight increase","review":"Looks like a great stroller - I was shown this on Thanksgiving night and was planning to purchase it the next morning. Extremely surprised to see the price increase $30.00 overnight from 49.99 to 79.99 all in time for Black Friday. I don't deal with dishonest people, so my daughter will be playing with a different stroller on Christmas morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read- description is misleading","review":"I passed this book by over and over before finally giving it a chance. The book jacket summary made it sound very strange to me, but don't worry- its not! It a very cute and fun read. The secondary plot regarding the mother is great too! Give it a try! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious","review":"On a gray winter afternoon I downloaded this book and spent several hours howling with laughter. It is very very funny! About the only criticism I can make is that in a couple of places it felt as if the author included material to stretch the book out. But overall it was a wonderful, short read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable","review":"I am Jane Austen fan. I also enjoy the humor in novels by Georgette Heyer and Dorothy Sayer. I had high hopes for this one, but I found it dull and slow going. I did finish it, but have no desire to explore other works by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen?? NOT EVEN CLOSE!","review":"To be Jane Austen is to be funny, elegant, subtle, witty, insightful, and above all, entertaining. This book was NONE of these things. It is NOT funny, it's hero and heroine don't even begin to measure up to Jane Austen's, and to me it is a tarnished, tawdry knock-off. Very tedious and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"beethoven lives","review":"the music is perfect - drowns out the banal conversations with which i am surrounded - takes me to another place"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with CD","review":"The first CD would not play on my Crosley so I returned.
