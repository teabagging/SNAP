Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Color","review":"Color: A Natural History of the PaletteThis book was highly recommended by a potter on an online listserve for potters. I found this book very interesting because of the travels by the author to find the areas that the materials used in color originated. It told me of the history of the area/country where the materials came from, as well as the methods used to develop the colors, and the people who used the colors. She talked about people continuing to use a color (the painter Turner) even though he knew the color would not last, as well a people continuing to use a color that would affect their health (lead as part of the process) because that's the only way to get that color, which continues to this day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much chaff mixed with the grain","review":"This book is more of a travelogue on the author's journeys to locations where pigments originated than a factual historical textbook. The tidbits of information on the history of pigments is heavily diluted by a great deal of lengthy side stories and I found myself trying to wade through to get to factual information of value.

I want to know how one sort of pigment gave way to another or how it was improved or even how tastes shifted from one favorite to another...advantages and disadvantages of different pigments.

Even after placing the reciever less than 10 feet from the microphones, the problems persisted. To make matters worse, AA Duracell batteries do not fit.

The title track is a great song that speaks to anyone that has ever had to be away from the one that they care about most. This song strikes a chord with those that have gone through a long distance relationship. This CD combines the songs that were only available locally with the 6 new songs that show Pat's continuing growth as a songwriter.

There are two Starbucks and an Old Navy in black Harlem, but none in Spanish Harlem. Moreover, his portrayal of white people living in Spanish Harlem is cheesy and superficial at best.

I have all the Lost Boyz albums and this solo effort from cheeks incorporates some stuff I've come to expect from the LB fam and some new stuff.

Personally I think the loss of freaky tah hurts cheeks a lot because his \\"Ha, Queens!\\" interjections really complement cheeks' flow. I was kind of disappointed by \\"Til We Meet Again,\\" cheeks' dedication to the late freaky tah. The track is a real good one musically, but in terms of letting us into the relationship between the two, it leaves a bit to be desired. This is a good album to throw on when you're relaxing, but it lacks the raw energy of Illegal Drug Money.

You are placed in the midst of the revolution. The observations are from someone very sympathetic to the Bolsheviks - whether this is a net plus or minus to the information is hard to know. Certainly it helped him gather information, but then what he reported was probably also affected not always in the best ways.As for the book itself, helpful introductions to each chapter supplement the dispatches, but the editor also cut a lot out. Some might have been unnecessary passages, but others seemed to be just for length and I would very much have preferred it be left in.

But the songs that makes this album one of the best of all time is \\"Heeding The Call\\" which has an explosive intro with high energy throughout the whole song, \\"Legacy of Kings\\" which has great guitar ripes and awesome vocals and \\"Let The Hammer Fall\\" is just classic bonecrushing metal.

The entire CD was just way to slow for me, I guess after listening to bands like Primal Fear and Arch Enemy these guys just don't compare, I know they are and enitrely different type of metal, but better, i could barely get thru 1 listen of this cd it was to slow, the lyrics to cheesy and to much hymming or humming or ohhh ohhhh ohh ohhh u no what i mean, I guess my taste for music has just grown faster and harder over the year.

This is not progression. This is a band who is stuck in an eighties time warp. By releasing albums like this, Hammerfall is basically setting Metal back at least fifteen years. This is a trip down memory lane. I never liked Power metal (except for Blind guardian) and this is no exception. Every aspect of this album is mediocre at best. It comes complete with clean and safe operatic singing, repetitive double bass drumming, cheesy lyrics, and band members dressed up as knights. If this is the future of \\"real\\" Metal (whatever that means), then I'll stick to my so called \\"false\\" Swedish Death metal bands like Arch enemy, Amon amarth, The forsaken, and The haunted.

It is very Enya-like in that the songs contain simple melodies, with the piano and strings used throughout the songs and beautiful background vocals. And the songs contain a very beautiful but complex chord structure -- also very Enya-like. Beautiful flute and acoustic guitar solos are included on many of the songs, which aren't on Enya songs; I have every one of her CDs, but this is the first 2002 CD I have.

It may have been better to split this into 2 volumes. One for the 1950's and another for the 1960's.

Overall, great product and I will buy again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I gave it a one star so I don't feel like chump for buying this product. You can only blow these bubbles on a day that there is no breeze. They fly away faster than your dog has a chance to catch them. I had to lie on my stomach to blow the bubbles, so my dog would have a chance to get them. When my dog did catch the bubbles it made a sticky mess all over his beautiful fur as the bubbles are plastic not soap. The only way I can see these bubbles being worth your money is if you are at a gathering with both animals and people of varying heights who can run in all directions to get the bubbles. Otherwise, they become very expensive for the one or two bubbles your pet can catch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog loves it!","review":"My dog loves these bubbles! They are strong and they leave a rather sticky, filmy residue where ever they land and pop! Easy enough to clean up from carpets and furniture, but sticks fairly stubbornly to my dogs fur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed these weren't the same quality","review":"Disappointed as the product doesn't appear to have the same quality when compared to the same product I purchased in a Pet Store. Unfortunately these are no longer available in Canadian pet stores so I went to find them elsewhere as my dog loves them. The bubble mixture appears thinner and the bubbles are not resilient when they land on the ground and break almost instantly which is disappointing as my dog loves the hunt. I bought a large number to offset the cost of the shipping ~ wish I had only purchased one as these are definitely not the same quality as what I have seen before with this product. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted dog","review":"My dog is crazy for these bubbles. She begs for them and we cannot even say the word bubbles in our house because she starts running around the house looking for them. My only complaint is that the price is high for the amount you receive so we are forced to use them sparingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petqwerks doggy incredibubbles","review":"Dog loves hem, I love them more. A bit sticky after they dry on dog . Excellent amount of bubbles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"These bubbles are so much fun. My dog loves them. The best part is that they don't pop as soon as you blow them. The bad side about that is that they will stick to thinks and leave soap marks, but they are easily cleaned. I love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"White residue everywhere!","review":"I bought these bubbles for my new puppies because my last dog loved bubbles. I got these and was kind of surprised to see that the flavor was peach, instead of bacon like the previous bubbles I got from another company. I started blowing them, and noticed that everywhere the bubbles land, they almost become plastic and leave a white residue. I was scratching it off my tv, off my dogs faces, it was everywhere! One of my dogs was terrified, the other one only had a small interest. I figured it should be an outdoor toy only."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't write reviews often...","review":"But when I do, the product is really bad.This one is really bad. The bubbles are fine but the wand is so flimsy it bent when I pulled it out of the bottle. The bubble juice is thick and clings to the wand... Until it drips off on to your clothes.The dogs seemed to be intrigued by the bubbles but the packaging was so bad I couldn't use it more than once or twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"perfect! my dog cant get enough of them, they smell like a nice peach and dont pop in the air like your average bubble! this product is exactly as i was led to believe 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like Christmas morning for your pets!","review":"This works for both cats & dogs. And if your pets are anything like ours they will LOVVEEEEEEEE the bubbles! They float extra long and are fun to chase. Also they don't pop when they land so they are super fun to chomp or pop with little noses. We have one cat that doesn't seem to care, but I'm pretty sure she doesn't have a soul. The rest of them love these. Totally worth the money. Buy the bubbles. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog gone it!","review":"My dog loves chasing bubbles, but not this variety. He did the first few times but then decided he didn't like the flavor or something about it. I didn't like it because it was gummy and left a residue behind. I wouldn't buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for my dog...","review":"My dog was scared to death of these bubbles and wouldn't even come near me if I had the wand out.

Also, if you use Quadtone Rip it will completely automate the collection and input of your stepwedge data for curve generation.I'm thoroughly satisfied.

The author survived being gored in the face by a cape buffalo and tossed by an elephant and once shot a lion while \\"garbed in dinner clothes and patent leather shoes\\" (how he got into my dinner clothes . . .) He was a friend or acquaintance of Stigand, Bell, Neumann, Sutherland and other famous hunters of the era, and relates several tales of these men as well as his own opinions of hunting lions, elephant, buffalo, tiger, leopard and rhino. There are several fascinating stories of native hunting methods including that of a tribe that hunts lions armed only with sticks.

When we finish playing with him, we use to put the toy on top of the refrigerator. However, he still wants to play and will go on top of the refrigerator to get it. Now, we put it on top of the closet shelf. If he sees us putting it away, he will sit there, looking up at the closet for a few minutes. It is his favorite play time toy, plus a superb work out! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"getting smaller and easier to break","review":"I think newly purchased feathers are much shorter and narrower than I used to get; therefore, the toy does not fly well in the air and does not spin much.

They LOVE Da Bird! I've never seen them get so excited about anything. The effort they make to catch Da Bird is amazing. They jump so high and often do a complete a 360 flip in the air to catch the toy in their mouth and/or paws. This cat toy has become the go to toy for our cats.

Most of the book takes place with Alex going back and forth from his house to the Michigan town that the incident took place and to Canada where his girlfriend is from.

It's fairly easy to listen to, and the best way to describe it is like the DJLN(Donde Jugaran Los Ninos) album but with the rock factor toned down.

There was hardly any mention of \\"swords\\" in the book, it was a miss-mash ad hoc collection of disjointed essays and misplaced humor with no connecting theme. It's really only about a fencing take on everything, not at all about arms and armor and not even European martial arts. It reads like a college textbook throughout and the author's over intellectualizing belittles the reader as if they are beneath his \\"wisdom\\". Amberger brooks no dissent with his polemics.

That's what playing this game is like. All of the special animations slow down to a crawl, and you're left wondering why you paid $40 for a game that came out 8 years ago, but has LESS SPEED. The new dialogue is repulsive, the slow-down is unreal and unbearable, and the new classes are positively worthless in single-player mode (the dark knight requires mastering 2 jobs and getting job level 8 in 4 others! you'd finish the game before you got half of that done).This is by far the worst remake of a Final Fantasy game I've ever played in my life, and that's saying a lot, because Final Fantasy Tactics is one of my all-time favorite games. So good, in fact, that I can't even bear to give this remake 1 star. If you want to play this game, find the original. Avoid this remake at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of disappointment with a little excitement","review":"I'm going to make this short and sweet because the other low reviews pretty much cover everything. This was a weak remake of a great game.

Yes, I know it was rushed and came out bad, but that added some of the charm). Everything slows down for no reason, you would've thought they would have worked stuff like this out before releasing this game.But wait, 2 NEW JOB CLASSES ZOMG! One is useless unless you master all the other classes (and find it's equipment in VS mode) and the other is really too difficult to worry about getting in the greater scheme of things.Nice try, I hope they get it right the next time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy Tactics Review","review":"If you have played Final Fantasy Tactics for the Playstation 1 then you have pretty much played this game.

There are certain jobs that you have to use early in the game or you'll die almost every time, and they don't make sense. The monk is by far one of the best classes for the first several hours of the game, but how do fists outhit a sword to the face? But anyway, once you get into the rythym of the game, it's a lot of fun, and I couldn't put it down until after 30 hours into it, and that was only because my PSP took a crap. As soon as I get it replaced, I intend to pick up right where I left off with this game, and I would suggest any hardcore RPG fans out there to pick this up too.

The only down side I see is you still have to read the conversations between characters during the game. The other trouble I have is unlike the other final fantasy games where you can just level up beyond your enemies and pound them to little puddles of mush you have to be strategic in your attacks because the baddies keep pace with your level, that and the non-player members of your team always charge out there and get swatted down instead of staying with the group and supporting each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions is AWESOME","review":"I love this game, I played the original avidly - and this game just enhances and adds on to my previous experiences :D Definitely buy this product if you're a PSP owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"alright","review":"It was fun, but with the pan around, you don't really need to go through the trouble of buying a PSP or the PSP version unless you don't have internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful version of a classic game","review":"Have only played it a couple of times, but FFTactics for the PSP is fun as heck.

The momentum is completely lost as the reader gets further into the book. I had no connection to the characters - I really didn't care what happened to them. The entire trial section dragged on and on, made worse by the fact that I didn't care what happened.

I called Crock-pot thinking there was a defect in the unit and they told me it was functioning properly. The representative said that the FDA required them to increase the cooking temps by at least 15 degrees and the only thing I could do is adjust my cooking time and add more liquid. She did apologize that no indications were noted in the manual about the temperature change. Not exactly what I was expecting for a slow cooker.

Costco was good to take that one back and I got another of the same model. This one has been fine, but recently, I've noticed that it is getting progressively hotter. To the point that I'm not confident leaving it unattended. I agree with other posters that it is much too hot on any setting and I have been slow cooking for 30 years. This evening I was lifting the lid off the pot to serve dinner and the handle came right off the cover and I burned my hand in the process of trying to juggle the cover. The plastic on the handle is actually melted! Could that be a result of the pot getting to hot??

I used cold tap water because I didn't want to ruin another meal. I put only 3-1/2 quarts in this 6-quart cooker because any more would have brought it to the edge.

I finally gave up on it. Since the warranty is expired, I decided to keep it and use it for keeping things warm for parties, etc. It is completely worthless as a slow cooker.If you plan on using this to cook while you are away, do a little research on other brands.

It's a good thing I didn't set it and go out somewhere! I am going to search for a crock pot that really is a slow cooker. If I wanted it to cook that fast, I would have put it on the stove.

I did, and turned it from the 10 hour setting to the keep warm. The food was good at the 6th hour, it was crispy fried 3 hours later after sitting on WARM. This is a typical crockpot recipe that called for being on high for 8 hours. and this thing on low cooked it in 6 and fried it on warm.Interestingly, we had a similar earlier model that was white. It didn't have this problem. Then about a year ago it started cooking really hot all the time.

The first time I made stock the plastic handle melted and came off.I couldn't afford a new cooker at the time so I kept on using it...but obviously it's a pain to not have a decent handle on the lid.Now (a year later) the side handle on the base has broken as well...try lugging one of these babies around with one missing handle (and of course I don't dare use the other one because I'm afraid it will break too).I will never buy 'crock pot' brand again.

I quickly lose interest and they eventually shut off on their own.I think I would enjoy this product more if there was a mode where they turned on at random times for a moment or two at a time. This would give me a little distraction throughout the day.

However the screen was slack at the top and tight at the bottom despite being level. Biggest problem, and reason I returned, was the faulty snaps that hold the barrier open. There are three heavy duty snaps on the leading edge of the barrier that hold it open (you screw the receiving pieces onto the wall). The initial attachment was strong, the barrier held firmly in place. But the first time I unsnapped the buttons the top two came disconnected from the barrier, rendering it useless. I even followed the instructions specifying the proper way to unsnap, but they popped right off, as if the rivets holding them on were too weak.

I'll stick with my Stephanie."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Cheesy Side but Entertaining and Funny","review":"Janet Evanovich is such a hilarious writer and can concoct the most hair-brained stories. Her books always without fail put me in a good mood and have me laughing out loud. Love Overboard is a quick read, following the developing romance between transplanted Jersey girl, Stephanie Lowe, and a sea captian, who comes from a long line of pirates, on the high seas off Maine's coast. You can see the makings of the Stephanie Plum character from her later mystery series in this book's central character, Stephanie Lowe.For a light read, guaranteed laughter, and instant mood booster, I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"clearly written before Ms. Evanovich got her craft honed, it was frankly a great dissapointment....no Stephanie Plum that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early work - should have stayed forgotten","review":"The good news is that this early work shows that by the time Janet Evanovich got to Stephanie Plum, she had honed her talents quite a bit. The bad news is that because the Stephanie Plum series has been so popular, they have exhumed several of Evanovich's early works assuming that her name recognition can sell almost anything. Well, sure enough since I am holding the book in my hands right now. This book has a not-well-enough-drawn to be sexy captain who falls in love with a proto-Plum - a screwball heroine for whom everything goes wrong. There's a not-very-scary supernatural twist, and, spoiler here, the guy gets the girl at the end. If you are home sick in bed this could be a better bet than daytime TV, but be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stick to PLUM!","review":"Fans of the Stephanie Plum novels will be VERY disappointed! I would wonder if these were even the same authors, however, Ms. Evanovich has recycled a few of her favorite sayings and character types (i.e. even the main characters have the same name...Stephanie!).

Now those are worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast, fun read!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this fast-paced, feel-good book, which was easily read in one sitting!

Ruth Willmarth, a dairy farmer in rural Vermont, is strong, gusty and intuitive. Each of the mystery novels takes on an issue or two of particular interest to Vermont and, probably, other rural communities. This one tackles mad cow disease and its ramifications, based on a true incident involving sheep in central Vermont. Romantic readers will be pleased to know that Ruth and her long-time man friend, Colm, move a step further to a larger commitment.This is highly recommended. Wright does her research and her characters are fascinating.

If you know or want to know anything real about Taijiquan as a Chinese Internal Martial Art - be for for Curiosity, Health, Self-Defense, Martial Arts, or any set of motivations, then don't spend a penny on this text. Even what little information in here appears to be drawn from legitimate sources (not actually cited or referenced in a number of cases), is so homogenized as to lead you nowhere useful. As more than once said by masters and grandmasters, past and present, 'There is qigong in taijiquan; there is no taijiquan in qigong.'

Good luck.\\" What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great picture book with ZERO strategy","review":"Cool pictures. Perhaps this would be a good coffee table book.

If you feel you or your child (or child's friend, etc.), need just a little extra boost to try and help you with the game then it is a definate must.

I did not need to spend my hard earned money on a strategy guide that tells me to simply 'take my time' in those tough spots.

It lists incorrect locations for several of the hidden gems, frequently gets the directions for the controls backward (telling you to \\"stay left\\" where you need to stay to the right, for instance), and simply gives the wrong advice on how to earn rewards (telling you to jump the gap to the red gem, for instance - which will only cause you to die - when in fact you need to shoot it with the bazooka). The run-throughs of several of the levels even put events in the wrong order or leave parts of the levels out entirely so that it is impossible to follow the guide.

They don't have the great knack that Peterson's, for example, has for giving you the precise few things you need for quick identification in the field.For instance, I recently visited southern California for the first time and saw cormorants with blue throat patches. My Sibley Field Guide was not particularly helpful. Upon returning home, I saw that my other guides, Peterson, National Geographic, Golden, made it clear that it was Brandt's cormorant in its breeding plumage.

Celeste Ascending is one of the few books that I've taken my time to read. I'm on my second time reading it, I lost it in a pile of books for a while, and I still feel the same way. The way Ms. Jones captures her audience is amazing. Her characters are people you can relate to, characters that are flawed and screwed up and just like everyone else you meet. The story can appeal to everyone from people like myself, young and niave without any degrees in literature just a love to people that have a PhD and are lying on their death bed. I owe this book a lot. It's showed me that you don't have to follow the beat of a drum, even if it's your own drum that's beating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being True To Yourself","review":"I found the novel Celeste Ascending to be inspiring to ones spirit. The story is very truthful to the reader. Being a young women, I am able to relate to certain situations and feelings Celeste displays through out this book.

That really came from the case of Kelis. Her popularity really proclaimed her as a one hit wonder during the late 90's. She had a album released overseas, but doesn't really have the star power she needs to have. Her latest single, Milkshake, isn't really a catchy track outside of the beat. It does seem alright at first, but not really a must have. I really suggest this one, only if you have a die hard taste for Hip Hop, but not if your not into this kind of song at all. It is just one of the rauchiest songs of the year, and just doesn't appeal very well to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Song Sucks","review":"I like milkshake with ice cream and milk but this song sure does suck on so many levels !Didn't your career died 10 years ago ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant song.","review":"This is the first track off Kelis' new cd and it finally breaks her wide open in the US market.

Already a number one club record on Billboard's Club Play chart it is top 3 Pop and R&B . This cd single comes with 4 full length vocal mixes that range from house to sort of hip hop/house mixes.The mixes are:1- Milkshake (radio version) 3:052- X-Press 2 Triple Thick Vocal Mix(9:30)3- DJ Zinc Remix(5:59)- a bit more techno.4- FreQ Nasty's Hip Hall Mix(6:24) with rap by Spoonface-best mix5- Tom Neville Remix(6:26)- best house mixJust a brilliant song from top to bottom- a little inuendo never hurt no one.

The game's biggest lacks are personality and originality. As I watched my trade routes increase and my markets grow, I felt no sense of accomplishment. New items and options that are added as your empire grows don't seem to add anything new to the \\"feel\\" of the game as a whole. In addition, everything is so small and bland-looking, much like strategy games that were released several years ago. I never felt a pressing need to finish one more task or to continue playing. The ... price tag is too high for a game that doesn't really add anything new to the strategy genre. If you can later find the game for ... in the bargain bin, it might be worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trade Empire","review":"A wonderful concept, but demands too much detail management.

Bull! This CD was so bad that I could not listen to all of it. At times I thought I was listening to a kazoo when it was actually Bill Evans playing the piano. The background noise sounded like someone rubbing two pieces of sandpaper together. It was like listening to fingernails scraping on a blackboard (for those of you who know what a blackboard is). Do NOT waste your money on this CD and be wary of others by this Spanish company, LoneHill. Fortunately, I had purchased it through Amazon, and even though I had opened the packaging to play it, they graciously refunded my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame","review":"I'm sorry to say, but this release is nothing but a shame.

I know it's pure speculation but I have serious doubts whether mister Evans would aprove these releases. In my opinion it's a matter of making money as there will always be people who will buy everything of Bill Evans which is produced. Please do not buy these bootlegs.

For $90, I expect to get a bit more substantial structure. Now it's set up, it's holding up the speaker. It does flex a bit, though. Also, the bolts do not fit because of the paint in the bolt-holes, which chips when putting the screws in. And, with the spacing of the mounting holes in my Sony 52\\" XBR5, I had to cut the Support Bar (the thin horizontal piece in the picture), unmount the VMCC1B, and re-install it. Also, it assumes your center channel speaker has mounting bolt holes... neither of mine do, I need to use wood or sheet metal screws, which are not included. Also, the instructions are cryptic at best, mostly pictograms that don't have coherency."},{"rating":"1","title":"I finally got it to work","review":"I purchased this to work with a Sanus Wall mount. I wanted to connect a Panasonic sound bar to the wall mount. This is the only thing that would work with the wall mount I purchased. It was not a good fit. The mount is designed for a small center speaker and It wouldn't reach the mounting holes on the sound bar. I called the company and tried to purchase some extra parts to make it work. They were no help at all. They wanted me to buy a different tv mount and use another model speaker mount. I had to go to the hardware store and purchase a steel bar and some brackets to extend the reach of the mount. It looks OK now and works fine but I had to remake a lot of the supports. I lost about $60 getting this to work. Still it was much less than going with the other mount and speaker mount.Sanus Customer service was not helpful at all.Be sure it fits your equipment before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice center channel mount","review":"My only gripe with this product is that it doesn't come with a crossbar to allow installation of a center channel speaker with only one mounting stud. This product assumes your center channel speaker has two mounting holes, most probably do. My center channel speaker does not have two holes, just one in the middle. I ended up using only one of the desending rods and centering as best I could. It would be better if Sanus included a small bar to connect these rods and allow mounting a center channel speaker with a single center mounted stud. The mount does come with plenty of other hardware - this is just a minor overlooked item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper weight","review":"I made the mistake of getting about 5 cheap power tools made in China.

That's part one.In part two, Ilmar's real elf-alien-people rescue him and help remember his heroic past. He sets out a second time to confront the space-witch at the heart of the storm.That's it. Book is 128 pages total.Technology is simply wrong (this was written in 1966), and characterization is bad. Really bad. I recommend reading a translation of the Finnish \\"Kalevala, the Land of Heroes\\" as you'll enjoy it more. The author used direct quotes for probably half his dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish writing of a vain and exploitative plot.","review":"Regardless of your opinion on Y2K this is very poor writing. Exploitative of people's fears, it vainly potrays tecnology professionals, the source of the Y2K problem, as if they are the single-handed saviors of the world.

It's obvious why he had to self-publish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Drivel!","review":"This is the work of an amateur.

Of course there will be problems, but they will be dealt with by far less drastic measuers than rioting and war. If only Clancy had written this......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, weak, obvious - A total disappointment","review":"Poorly written, unimaginative, and only thinly based on a Y2k scenario, this novel is the embodiment of a missed opportunity. Instead of really exploring the fascinating possibilities of a disaster story based on the worst case scenarios of Y2K, this is a silly exploration of the possibility that China would try to exploit our military lack of preparedness. Which might have been interesting had it been written better. Among the many irritating plot points: the ridiculous portrayal of a single Y2K-repair firm as the one and only salvation of the planet. An enormous disappointment, time completely wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the NBC movie","review":"This was the first y2k book I read and I thought it was pretty good. Now that I've read two other y2k novels and suffered through the NBC movie last night, I return to this title with much higher praise. The first half of the NBC movie was taken almost directly out of this book but the last half was nothing but a nuke plant meltdown flick -- quite boring. This novel covers a wider spectrum of scenarios including military and does so with a more interesting mix of characters. While NBC shows a grandfather saving the nuke plant with the advice to \\"hit it with a hammer,\\" this novel shows teams of people from all backgrounds using their skills in their one field of expertise. This is a good book to read in the final weeks leading to Y2K. It shines brighter than other attempts to fictionalize this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"instead of y2k, bad tom clancy like writing","review":"cheap shot - instaed of sticking to the idea kelly takes an easy escape and does a tom clancy look alike with lots of guns blazing etc etc. only he isn't tom clancy (even though he is evidently already planning the sequel...war and everything, isn't that special...). after finding the first two or three chapters sort of interesting, i got bored. the topic deserves better - don't buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy wannabe with doomsday vision","review":"If the purpose of this book is to convince me to stock up on groceries, withdraw my money from the bank and buy a generator, it failed.

And to think I just read this very book one week ago. I bought a cabin in tennessee with 40 acres. The land is breathtaking, and the price was a steal. And I feel comportable about the Y2k Crisis. All because of a book; well, sort of. I've been programming for years, and realized the problems ahead. But never had those possible problems been laid out in such succinct detail as in this book. Never had I gone days without sleep. But thanks to this book, I put my worries into action, and am confident that no matter what happens, myself, and family will be safe. And supposing the Y2K crisis isn't a crisis, I've got a great summer home that I wouldn't have boughten otherwise. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It even predicted the stock correction","review":"I've read this book twice already and recently skimmed it again after seeing the author on \\"Unsolved Mysteries.\\" What's incredible about this supposedly farfetched story is that it has so far proven true. It even shows a stock market correction in May, 1999 out of sympathy for the impact Y2K could have on company earnings. Guess what we just endured? A stock market correction that several newspapers attributed to Y2K jitters. If the rest of this story pans out, be very careful. Without giving away too much of the suspense, you won't believe how closely this book's China connection ties in with President Clinton's selling of nuclear arms to Beijing. Buy this book for a summer weekend read. You won't be let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the controversy","review":"Reading these reviews is amusing after finishing the story. People either love this novel or hate it. The ones who hate it go even further and hate the author, which is doubly amusing since I doubt any of them have met him. I haven't met him either, but I enjoyed the book. I don't know if it's accurate, as some guys claim, but it is a good thriller. That's all I was looking for. Everybody else who treats this like either the most important book of the decade or the worst form of propaganda put across America by a first time writer needs to get out more. There's a lot more to life (and to Y2K) than this book! Take a drive somewhere and listen to some Bob Dylan. Geez!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE","review":"This book is a waste of time, money, and effort. Great effort is needed, I assure you, as the writing is so poor that you will be tempted many times to throw the thing at the wall.It is a page-turner in the sense that one wants, at all costs and with incredible speed, to be done with it forever.

If you are interested in learning about Y2K, you would be better off buying a non-fiction work such as that by Yourdon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"I bought the book because of the high ratings others had given it. When Kelly stuck with the technical and social aspect of the story, it flowed well. When he advanced into the cloak-and-dagger or military fields, I felt it bogged down. All in all, I think it was a good treatment of the subject, although I think he was rather optomistic about how soon the power gets back on. Also, the action centers around southern California. He did not deal with how people in the northern or midwest states are going to cope with a complete loss of energy of all types in the middle of winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed.","review":"As another reviewer pointed out, the topic deserved better. It started out OK, but got so dull I could hardly finish it. Some action and dialogue was completely unbelievable. Just as I was reading the part where Rush Limbaugh was a hero for telling the truth about the severity of Y2K, the real Rush had announced that it was all hype, making a fool of the author. Instead of telling us realistic stories about what might happen, it was a macho fantasy shoot-em-up. Do read about Y2K, but don't read THIS book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really wanted to understand Sotos. I do not share in the majority of his philosophies, but that just made me more curious about where this guy is coming from. I still don't know. He's obviously intelligent and at times, articulate, but he doesn't have enough restraint to explain himself. It all just turns into a big rant about child rape/porn and other social taboos.I wonder if he's really into these deviant acts or if he just gets off on being subversive. He really doesn't make a strong point. He just sounds like someone who had severe childhood trauma and has absolutely no capacity for empathy or compassion.

The cats me spray it watch with mild curiosity (or amused contempt; it's hard to tell for sure), wait for me to move out of the way, and then re-mark their territory.That's the good news. The bad news is that the pump sprayer was designed for use by King Kong: I'm just not strong enough to push it down with my thumb, and have to use the heel of my hand.

It gives good air circulation and made my somewhat large living room much less stuffy feeling. The thermostat and three speed feature is nice. I keep it on \\"low\\" speed and find it is adequate on most days when the A/C is not called for. The only trouble with this little fan is it was a trifle deeper to fit in the nook of the window, so I have to make sure the window is closed securely on it. It gets awful breezy here on the high floors and I wouldn't want it to fall and hit someone on the head, down below!"},{"rating":"2","title":"About this product!","review":"I own this fan.

I never had a problem with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful","review":"I have coached for seven years and I found this book to be a good reminder of what I want to do, and a good start to improving on my faults. This book gives some good work out ideas, and planning, but the strongest section is how each coach should relate themselves to the kids. I found that alot of the ideas that are in the book can directly relate to so many of my kids.

Although it is meant for more experienced coach up to the Olympic level, I find it useful.

Keeps you guessing until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not my cup of... er, blood","review":"I am split right down the middle on Barbara Hambly's Those Who Hunt the Night.On one hand, it's nice to read a vampire novel that doesn't focus on how vampires are tortured, brooding creatures that also happen to be Pure Sexiness to anyone who encounters them. Hambly's vampires are predators, who survive through hunting and killing. Any allure the vampires have, any grace, all their powers are only there to help them hunt and kill. These creatures are scary.But on the other hand, despite an interesting if not particularly imaginative murder mystery, Hambly is a boring writer. I found myself rereading passage after passage, simply because I couldn't make the words connect to my brain. (See also: another vampire novel, The Historian) While I appreciated what Hambly was trying to do here, her execution lost me."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET AMP","review":"As the other reviewer stated Dual makes a very solid amp, and appaer to be underated.

I have read some other titles on parenting and techniques of same, but this is truly an excellent read.Some of the topics in the book should have been expanded (the philosophical discussion on the \\"picking our parents\\" at the end of chapter one, etc.).Helen Hood is either a very open hearted person or a very convincing author.I have read the book twice and I intend reading it again, and again.Thank you for such a marvelous insight !"},{"rating":"2","title":"About seeing your child with awe, raising her with patience.","review":"This book uses one woman's experience as a seasoned caretaker to illustrate how to be with children \\"through\\" there emotions, rather than attempting to always distract them away from them. One of it's primary focuses is to encourage parents not to teach that some emotions are \\" bad\\" and some good. It made me more aware of attempting to see things from my children's perspective, to value their differences, respect their incredible ability to know what they need, and to see their unwillingness to \\"be molded\\" as a blessing. I read the entire book straight through, refer back to it often and give it as a gift when I can. It is not a strict \\"how to\\". If you are at all aware, you already know \\"how to\\", this book will guide you to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"A great look at not only classic JKD techniques but also new ones developed by Larry Hartsell. Being an original student of Bruce Lee Larry has the rare ability to absorb what is useful and transmit that to his students.

For the Newbies it will give you an inside look at what JKD is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just trapping !!!","review":"The pretty negative review is based on the fact that the book is made of 95% trapping drills which are very very difficult to follow.The rest 5% is actually quite interesting as it covers fighting tactics against different opponents types (boxers, grapplers, karatekas, etc....) but the pages dedicated to that are the extreme minority.The book should have just been called: Advanced trapping exercises.Good if you are a trapping fan, but wasted time if you are much more \\"street oriented\\".Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"a cheap copy of My Chemical Romance","review":"They are just a CHEAP copy of My Chemical Romance.

And indeed the dust jacket is pretty, but the images inside are all washed out.I can't comment on the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Mack Was A Man with Guts","review":"Dr. Mack took on a controversial paranormal subject very effectively and even handedly and lent his prestige and that of Harvard Medical School to it. Many individuals who have reported close encounters have had their careers damaged because of their revelations. For example, consider the Rendlesham Forest incident near RAF Woodbridge. Every Air Force member who claimed to have witnessed an alien craft on that occasion had their otherwise good careers clouded, often being denied promotions, etc. Even Dr. Mack was investigated by Harvard's peer review committee for his abduction reserch even though he had committed no offense that was of the kind typically investigated by the committee; he was exonerated. Let's face it: over 90% of alleged close encounters can be explained; it's that remaining 10% or so are unexplained. Even if one of those 10% can be attributed to a close encounter, and I have no doubt that some can, then we are not alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mack confuses dreams with reality.","review":"Mack does a good job of convincing himself that the experiences of his patients are true. However, he confuses perception with reality. I'm sure that the patients experienced something, but to make a leap of illogic and assume that hypnopompic hallucinations are alien abductions is foolish. I read several of the case studies and, although I am not a psychologist, found that his patients were suffering from real personal problems such as guilt over the inability to conceive a child and grief over the loss of a parent. Mack gathers these folks together in group therapy for several weeks where they can listen to each other and add to their initial hazy memories. Then he brings them back to his office and hypnotizes them to bring out the *experience*. Why do this when it is obvious that their problems are terrestrial? If you want to read this book (and judge it for yourself), borrow it from the library. Don't give John Mack a dime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mack has no BS meter.","review":"It's all well and good for people to be researching this subject. As an 'abductee' (that word just doesn't do it justice), my first thought when I heard Mack had finished his book was \\"It's about damn time a major figure got into the field\\". But then I got really ticked-off when I heard about his past life regression and other new-age consciousness theories. I read the book and was appalled that someone of his collegiate stature would be lured-in by this contactee bull dung. Sure enough, months go by and his contactees start admitting they made the stuff up. OF COURSE THEY DID! Anyone who thinks the...'things' act with ethical benevolence is either lying or delusional. The truth is bitter and unpleasant. Want to know what kind of crud goes on? Read David Jacobs' \\"Secret Life\\". I'll personally vouch for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the enthusiasm?","review":"Very interesting new theories especially the hybrid developments. Have the abductees stepped over the line of truth/reality? John was contacted by a lot of people with almost identical patterns of abduction in a very short space of time. The English is flat, if not appalling (days before months please). Lacks pace, flow and enthusiasm, being more like a thesis of high intellectual.

The story traces a murder investigation involving a political prisoner and his keepers, with an interesting twist on the investigator. Although the ending was a bit pat, I won't spoil it by explaining why I felt it perversely cheated fate. Nonetheless, any writer would be proud to call this his first novel.

It is true that minor characters in this book are thinly drawn (especially the Americans) and that the novel may seem a little meandering and slow-paced to fans of traditional detective fiction. But this is a great read, and the meanderings provide a rich (and rather depressing) picture of life in modern Tibet.The general approach reminds me of Tony Hillerman -- use a mystery to entice the reader to learn more about a culture the author thinks is important. I've read interviews with Hillerman in which he regrets how little ethnographic info he can put into his narratives without bogging down the reader. \\"The Skull Mantra\\" is the sort of novel Hillerman might write about the Navajo if he decided to throw caution to the winds and risk losing a few impatient readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product from a good company","review":"I have other products and screen protectors for other gadgets from this company and they are fine but the Nook protectors do not fit right - I finally gave up and got the standard Barnes and Nobles one which is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best window fan ever","review":"Why this fan was discontinued is frankly beyond me.

But the protagonist of \\"Confessions\\" is such a bitter misanthropic voice that the book was spoiled for me.I urge those who haven't yet read any Boyd to begin with one of his books of shorter fiction, or best of all, with \\"Brazzaville Beach\\", one of the best novels I've read in years. Then follow up with \\"Restless\\", another excellent and innovative book.Perhaps after those two, if you're as disenchanted with \\"Confessions\\" as I was, you'll still read Boyd's next work.

All the nostalgia I was feeling for my purchase was ruined in that moment - the very first moment upon playing it. I see this company won't let you try to expose our children to wholesome programming without them trying to IMMEDIATELY brainwash kids into wanting to see the new remake. Also, it shows a lack of respect for their customers. I spend money on your product and you SPAM me right off the bat with forced trailers? You package it in the CHEAPEST cardboard, KNOWING it won't hold up to kids using it a lot? And even up converted to 1080p, this still looks super grainy and dark? No remaster?

The music is beautiful, and Amy Annelle's songwriting and voice are perfect.The only down side to this album are some of the found-audio clips. Some of it is dead-on -- gospel and twangy bluegrass that crackles into and under the new material, giving depth and contrast.Some of it, however, is smarmy Southern Christian radio preachers talking to vaguely impaired elderly men. I can't tell if this material is earnest or ironic, but it sure sets a mood and makes me think. On further listens to the album, it troubles me less and less.I found this album on emusic.com, and have listened to it so much that I then went and bought it from the Hush Records web site so I can have an original copy to play in the truck, and to read the liner notes for more insight.If you're a fan of minimal bluegrassy recordings and artists like Gillian Welch or old Patsy Cline, pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silent?

It lets you sleep while they play.\\" I was very excited about that. My hamster (who is of normal size and weight) was also excited about it, as he ran in it for most of the night last night. But alas, the wheel is just as loud as the one that came with the cage. I mean, I expected a little bit of noise realistically but to have spent the money and not gotten a difference is a rip off. It advertises silent, I wanted it to at least be quieter but it is not.Other than that, it's a good quality wheel.

This book cannot do so, but it does cover a surprising amount, though at the cost of being too concise for easy readability. He includes everything from textual criticism to his controversial canonical criticism (see his book \\"Introduction to the Old Testament As Scripture\\"). The latter means, in this case, that he does not deny that the book can be split into Isaiahs 1, 2 and 3 but he dismisses it as irrelevant and concentrates on the book as part of scripture. Someone making a detailed study of Isaiah would want several commentaries, of which this should be one. Someone wanting a more modest library with only one commentary on Isaiah could do worse than choose this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth a ****","review":"The book imo is infiltrated with some nasty new age thoughts. For example does not even understand the importance or rendering the Hebrew word helel, which should be translated Lucifer in Isaiah 14:12. The change in new versions of the bible does not spring from the Hebrew language but, from the new age 'theology' of editors like this guy. Imo the book is just another link in the chain to massive misunderstanding. The whole point of 14 was to describe Lucifer's descent to hell. And, he missed the boat.

My memory ain't what it used to be). It was an exciting moment, as I suddenly recalled how much I had enjoyed this show as a kid. I ended up purchasing all 3 seasons and have been gradually watching them (I like to take my time and kind of \\"save\\" shows I really like). It is as fun watching it as an adult as it was when I watched it as a kid.

I would have liked to see it played out by a GM as proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, enjoyable book on the endgame.","review":"This book does not replace an endgame manual, not even at the beginner level. You could, for example, read Pandolfini's Endgame Course in its entirety and still get some value from this book. It is not complete.It is simply fun. Seirawan explains the ideas in words. He throws in anecdotes, tension, and humor. He goes over some of the basics in excruciating detail (for example, King+Bishop+Knight v. King, which is extremely rare in practice). He includes complete master-level endings so that you can see how it's done. His discussion of rook endings (extremely common in practice) is helpful. He finishes with a very interesting chapter on the difference between grandmaster play and the theoretically perfect moves in computer generated tablebases.Another enthralling re-print in the Winning Chess series. Most appropriate to about 1300 level, even with no prior endgame knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good book by Yasser","review":"Yasser saved one of the best of his Microsoft series for last. As in all his books, his style is easy to read and informative. It is one of the few endgame books around that doesn't bore you to tears plodding through it. It's also refreshing to see a top ranked player and author show how he blew an endgame against Kasparov, humility at its best.What is nice to see his how he attempts to teach you WHY you make a move in the endgame versus so many other books which plod you through 100's of positions trying to show you the same concept.For the advanced beginner of the lower intermediate player, this book is a fine addition to anyone's chess library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"This book is great if you dont have much experience with endgames, which most people dont. Some of the types of endings discussed are mating with just a queen, rook, two bishops, or a bishop and a knight, and the concepts behind all of them. The concepts of the pawn race, multiple pawn endings, queen vs. pawn on the seventh rank, queen endings, and rook endings are discussed. Unlike most endings I have read, in this book you will learn the ideas behind the moves instead of just numerous lines of play. This has dramatically improved my overal chess skills, knowledge of the endgame teaches you much about the middle and opening, such as how important tempo and control of the center is. It is a great reference.This book is 5 stars if you are relatively new to chess (below a B rank in the USCF), but 3 stars if you already know a fair amount about endgames because it doesnt go that in depth. Hence, 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well for my odd use","review":"I use this plumb bob in conjunction with an adjustable protractor and various levels in a special tool that I use for establishing the \\"rake\\" on the masts of model ships.

Wrath Of Daimajin is remastered, but cropped into a 1.85:1 ratio. but who the hell would re-release a film, remaster it and then crop it? I don't get adv sometimes. they're very strange 40- year old anime fans who would just release non-anamorphic movies with pale transfers and have non-removable subtitles for a japanese 2.0 track and lousy promo trailers for extras instead of putting time in their dvds. I'm sure most people would rather get the non-anamorphic one released long ago. the extras are pretty bad too, a little 22 second promo for all three Daimajins that was on the dvds before and some other adv-made trailers that you won't watch anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful print... buuuut...","review":"For some unknown reason, ADV has taken it unto itself to crop their beautifully remastered print of DAIMAJIN IKARU from 2.35:1 Daeiscope to 1.85:1. The result is the net loss of 40% or so of the image to the left and right. The audio quality is excellent, the image vibrant, but the aspect ratio really destroys any appeal this disc may have to former fans of the film. On the flipside, their re-release of the first film is incredibly inexpensive, in the correct aspect ratio, and features the best print of the film I've ever seen. Fans would do better to simply stick with the old releases or go with the official Japanese R2 discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Your Last Chance!","review":"This is an awesome film with beautiful special effects!

I liked this album right from the start. It is a typical Luis Segura bachata production. Why I say this? The rhythms, the lyrics and his voice are all exemplary of the type of bachata we have heard from El Papa over the years. If you like bachata that is mainly for listening rather than dancing, this production may appeal to you. The themes are always about love and relationships- good or bad. The only song that I am not fond of is #6 which is merenbachata. In my opinion it does not enhance the cd in any way and #12 is the house version which is totally a contrast to the style of this artist which is very unique, classic and very different from the bachata that we here today.

The soft, echoing guitars and vocals are conducive to writing; even after the CD's finished playing, the melodies remain in my head, helping to coax new descriptions out of the things around me.Two paws up for the track arrangement, too; the drum 'n bass tracks in the beginning transition very nicely into the more ethereal-sounding tracks at the end. All together, the 13 tracks are more like one big, lavender, 66-minute mass. Kind of like the album cover, now that I think about it.I'd compare Love Spirals Downwards to the Cocteau Twins, since that's what I'm most reminded of here, but I don't really see the point.

I thought I'd save money buying just the headset part I needed since the base I had was working fine. Couldn't get the replacement headset to synch at all to the base -- tried a variety of ways to get it to work and multiple attempts. The directions were pretty precise so not much room for misinterpretation. Just didn't synch -- so basically, these were useless new headset replacements.

Overall, I would recommend this if you're not a hardcore audio person."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed","review":"After reading the \\"Culture Shock\\" books for Germany, Sweden, and France for trips, I was extremely disappointed with this book. It is basically a history book and gave me no real idea how to relate to Italians. Therefore, my experience in Italy was less than good. I highly recommend the France book---it is right on target and I had a great time navigating the culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and lacking detail","review":"I have read and used the other Culture Shock books and found them very useful.This one though was almost a complete waste of time. It was full of cliches e.g. Italians love nothing more than spending time with their family and friends. It lacked detail and useful hints about how to interact with Italians.Perhaps it suffered in comparison with \\"The Dark Heart of Italy\\" a far superior effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Culture Shock:Italy","review":"I purchased this book to learn more about doing business in Italy, and I found there was not enough detail. I did learn how vastly different each region is in Italy - - and the author tries to show the differences in each region. Perhaps this is why I felt that it didn't do a deep dive into the regions I was most interested in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much nicer than the photo!","review":"I am very pleased with this little drum!

This book will change your picture of health promotion evaluation."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have not found one better","review":"Let's face it. Learning Thai is not easy regardless of the teaching method. This book however was exactly what I was looking for as it also teaches how to read and write the language. I found some mistakes and the audio is not cooridinated very well with the book but you will have to losten to it MANY times anyway in order to ever learn it. After a few times you learn to find the corresponding section in the book. So, all in all the book is well worth the money and it does what it says it will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaches sentence structure instead of just catch phrases.","review":"Smyth's book teaches the structure of Thai sentences by analysing common conversations. It also teaches the Thai alphabet and penmanship. The result is that the reader obtains an understanding of how to build Thai sentences, rather than just presenting a few tourist phrases, as some tape series do. On a 3-week trip to Thailand last year, I found Smyth's instructions to be very useful. His choice of lessons were close matches to situations I found myself in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This product is not for beginner Thai...it is hard to follow and begins like you already have some understanding of the language. Definately not for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"valuable and detailed text and cassettes but hard to follow","review":"The details make this book and cassette intro course worthwhile. But it adds unnecessary frustration because the cassette references parts of the book that are out of order. This causes the student to search back-and-forth in the book, and repeated re-rewinding of the cassette. The pronunciation guide is much more consistent and more intuitive than the Berlitz book. By mixing reading early in the dialogs, the books forces a slower rate of learning conversation Finally the dialogs in romanized and cursive Thai actually omit the English equivalents, again forcing the reader to search back and forth in the unindexed pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost my interest.","review":"The premise sounded interesting, but the characters and plot failed to come through. I didn't care about the characters. Madlax seemed too passive for an assasin plus the fact that she found it necessary to change into an evening gown in the middle of the jungle in order to shoot someone. The little girl just sat around acting strange, but doing nothing to win me over. The anime raised a few questions about how the two girls were connected, but didn't provide enough bait to keep me interested. Seems like it was aimed at an audience more interested in violence and well proportioned women than in a real plot line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great start","review":"After you watch the very first episode Madlax starts to get boring. The only thing holding it up is the power it has over you for wanting to know mystery of the connection of Madlax and Margaret. These beginning episodes lack the right amount of action for this type of series. It's just plain old slow and boring and it literally puts you to sleep. It looks like the story will take forever to develop. The show does seem to have potential but because of that one mystery that bugs you. Basically the biggest problem is there is not enough action and the story development is to slow. Madlax is an assassin so why is there little action in this series. I think Madlax has great animation and potential but you have to get past volume to get to anything decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it looks","review":"I flashed back to 1978 when I opened the package.

I got this to hold my Jornada 548, which fits nicely, very secure and snug into the case. The only killer is the zipper - a brass zipper makes a nice saw, and although the fabric it's sewn to is also heavy, there is no protection between the brass zipper and the PDA. I found this out the hard way, with zipper imprints left in the bottom of my Jornada. I've been very careful when removing PDA from case (e.g. for charging), because a careless swipe across the zipper would no doubt cut into the case, if just carrying it can dent the aluminum Jornada. I'd hate to see what would happen to a plastic PDA. So, I'm returning it in favor of a nylon zipper case or something else. Fact is, the Jornada, with screen cover, is probably safer OUT of the case and in a pocket than in the case (which fits few pockets)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent presentation on cognitive behavioral therapy","review":"If you're looking for a good, systemic view and review of cognitive behavioral therapy, this is excellent. Donald Meichenbaum uses his clarity of thought and presentation to this well prepared and well-acted start to finish case study. If you were looking at how to apply the principles, you will be hard pressed to find a better example."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The presentation attempt to portray a therapeutic process, but actually shows a dogmatic (and a bit boring) version of CBT. There is little or no dealings with complexities and dilemmas which could enhance the viewer.The client is an actor, much of the sessions are described briefly verbally between sessions as opposed to showing what has been done. For anyone with an already basic acquaintance with CBT for panic and depression, IMHO there is little to be gained from this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor paper quality","review":"I did not enjoy this book as the puzzles are small making it difficult to put your \\"ideas\\" in the boxes when needed.

One of the documentaries in this set, \\"Shark: The Silent Killers\\" is perhaps the more informational and interesting of them all compared to the others. What kind of foils some of the slight interest of the overall set is it use of the same footage for near the same information one or two of the other discs.Overall, this documentary set might be good in classrooms for positive information on sharks without taking up a large amount of time; but for shark loves who want a good documentary experience it falls far short."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING BORING BORING","review":"I have always loved documentaries and sharks and so I thought that this DVD Collection may be worth the $26 investment. I was wrong. This DVD Collection uses the same footage over and over, implements grossly exaggerated commentaries and provides advice to anyone who \\"dares enter the water\\".My advice is to save your money and/or purchase a BBC or National Geographic Collection DVD. I am throwing out these DVD's as I will never watch them again. They were a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a fun ride!","review":"I really liked this book.

Thanks Lolita for an enjoyable ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Satisfying","review":"I read this book in about 5 hours.... it was pretty good. But it was also one of those books that ..... once you were done with the book... you forget about it. You don't really take something with you when the book is done. Now... don't get me wrong... it holds your attention, and the language is very believabel and forthright. The characters are all people you know... girls you used to kick it with.

Hats off and two thumbs up to Lolita Files!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner !!","review":"I was truly impressed with Lolita Files sequel to \\"Scenes from a a Sista\\" from beginning to end . I enjoyed this book so much, that it only took me 1 day to finish this book. The characters are so life-like that you cannot help but to get involved and want to see what happens next. Reesy's narration of this novel makes it seem as if you are talking to an old girlfriend and I guess thats what makes this book a winner. Keep 'em coming"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Read...","review":"I thought that this book was really good however, it cannot compare to \\"Scenes From A Sistah\\". I would strongly recommend this book to any woman who is going through a hard time, such as myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtakingly wonderful","review":"7 hours from start to finish, I laughed, I cried, I shouted and loved, and in between I high fived myself a couple of times. Not since B-Boy Blues and Invisible Life has such a sequel been so rewarding. Files brough back Misty and Reesy with a fierce dose of fire and spark that few authors continue with a series. What struck me was that Reesey was a woman that I was begining to \\"love to hate.\\" This book should be shared between girlfriends to sometime express what each is feeling when things go on in each others lives and we sometimes can't include the one person who could understand everything about us. Withhout a doubt, I enjoyed this book--I am just mad that I have to wait another year to read another Files book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get with it.","review":"I am very disappointed in the sequel to \\"Scenes from a Sistah\\". I couldn't wait for it to come out, but when I started reading it, it didn't keep my interest. I would much rather hear about Misty than Reesy any day. Reesy is a selfish slut who doesn't even deserve to be mentioned on so many pages of this book. I think that the book had too much slang and too much cursing. There was too much, albeit protective, sex with just any and everybody. I am 2/3rds through the book, and I am using all the will power I have to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"This sequel wasn't as bad as I thought most sequels are.

Can't wait to read the next one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Sophmore Follow-up","review":"Scenes From A Sista was well written; a real page turner so I couldn't wait to read this book. The wait was worth it. Reesy, on occasion, was a bit much, but we all know someone like her who's always over-the-top, jealous, and sometimes downright mean.. The author did an exceptional job in developing the characters & keeping the story moving. I thought there was too much cursing in the book but then again, that was so much part of Reesy's character; it would have been hard to separate the two. This is a hard book to put down; I think anyone who starts it, will find the end comes too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got to the good part... it was worth the wait!","review":"She's back... \\"Reesy\\" Snowden narrates this sequel to \\"Scenes from a Sistah\\". She tells a much more colorful and drama-filled story than you could imagine. It felt like I was watching an R-rated film with lots of suspense, romance and drama. The sistahs and brothas are fun and full of entertainment.I enjoyed this novel even more than \\"Scenes...\\" because Reesy tells a more exciting story! She is full of laughs and imagery. Although the language was often too vulgar, I was able to accept it as part of her racy, risque, and raw character. Nevertheless, I loved Reesy even more for opening her heart and her mouth to give of herself even when it hurt.This is a good read about good friends who endure much love, pain, and ultimate joy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's done it again!","review":"Getting to the Good Part is an excellent read. Ms. Files is truly amazing. If you loved Scenes from a Sistah, you will DEFINITELY love this book. Such a talented writer. I can't wait to read her next book! Much success to you Lolita! Hope to meet you if you ever come out to the New York City area!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Files Wastes Talent on this book","review":"Lolita Files is a talented writer. I got her first book as a birthday present. I enjoyed the story and bought her second book and kept it for over a year before I finally read it. I found the constant use of The \\"N\\" word very offensive and thought it detracted greatly from whatever it was Files was trying to say. I don't know what The Good Part was but the Bad Part was the every other paragraph hearing a brotha or sistah being called out of his or her name. I won't read any more of her books until she grows up maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Where Was the \\"Good Part?\\"","review":"Hmmm....did we read the same book? I've looked at some 55 reviews and I cannot disagree more with your assessments. I actually checked this book out from the library based on the 4.5 star rating that the book had. I have been sorely disappointed. Reesy is too --dare I say it--\\"ghetto\\" in her words and actions. The way she clowned Hudson in that restaurant was too uncouth for me. And she obviously has no sensitivity or awareness to anything outside of her own egotistical, self-absorbed world. Thumbs down, for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who published this mess?","review":"This was the worst book that I have read in a while. I see where the author was trying to go with this story, but she missed the mark somewhere. First of all, everything was way over the top. Characters such as the grandmother could have been, left out, she could have even omitted the drama about the parents for that matter. Secondly, I think she choose a very cheap way to represent her sorority. \\"They can be some pretty girls...\\" That was way too saucy. Furthermore, Reesy's relationship with the guy was forced and highly, highly, unrealistic. Also, was Misty's relationship with Rick that big of a deal. Overall, this book needs to be seriously workshopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Never Got To the Good Part","review":"This book was an embarrasment, in my opinion. I bought it because it was a selection of the Literary Guild, and was sorely disappointed. The plot was shallow and thin... the characters were under-developed.... the dialogue was low-class, vulgar and unimaginative. And how realistic is it to have a man buy you a Porsche boxster after he sleeps with you for the first time... and give the girl a ring after he catches her naked in bed with another man. Talk about living in a fantasy world! I suspended reality, but this novel just wasn't believable or credible. No more Lolita Files for me. I missed the good part altogether!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book was certainly entertaining.","review":"I thought that the book was entertaining, and I would recommend for those looking for a light, entertaining read; however, I found it completely unrealistic and frankly the character Reesy was somewhat sickening. I don't know anyone that behaves that way....how about you? And how is it that everybody ends up with a man who is rich, handsome, generous and has absolutely no personal issues (i.e., ex-wife, scandal, etc.)....???All in all, if you can past ghetto Reesy and the fact that she responds to her friend Misty as though she were a spurned lover, you'll enjoy the book. I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"I considered writing a critical analysis of this novel from a Black literary standpoint. But, what's the use? It's just plain stupid!

I could not put it down and stayed up to three a.m. to learn what would become of Reesy and Misty.I loved the way Misty socked it to her ex-boyfriend Roman. I remember how he treated her in Scenes From A Sistah.I did not like how tough Reesy had become but I certainly understand why.The main thing I look for in a book is that the author make the characters real to me.

I bought this book before Scenes, but I was told to put it on hold and read Scenes first. I am so happy that I did. Both of these books were page turners. I enjoyed how you put Scenes in Misty's voice and GTTGP in Reesy's. Well done, my sistah. I laughed (out loud mostly), cried, got mad, and rejoiced in both of their triumphs in GTTGP.

Okay, so Reesy happens to be a fan of his and that's fine but can we leave it at that? The brother is mentioned on every other page! Can you give us a break? For all you Maxwell fanatics this book is a good read. But Ms. Files must keep in mind that not everyone shares her obsession.

I must say that I was sorely disappointed. Ms. Files is a good writer but it seems that she put her GOOD PART on the shelf for this one. Some of the language was cheesy and downright ugly. I know Reesy's character can be raw but it was ridiculous how shallow she was. Misty Fine however, was a little refreshing but her story line was hokey. She didn't have any depth.

I have chatted with Lolita Files personally on-line and she is a wonderful, warm person, so it pains me to say that I did not like this book. Reesy is shallow and self-absorbed, and even though I understand that she and Misty are girls to the end, I found it unbelievable that Misty would put up with Reesy attitude.

It was outstanding reading. It would help if you read \\"Scenes from a Sistah\\" first because it sets the stage for this storyline. While Misty is the girl that your mother wants you to be, Reesey is my hero!!! She got it gonin' on. Yes, she needs to channel all of that \\"fire shut up in her bones\\", but she definitely knows how to live life to fullest. This book defines sisterhood and friendship. It also lifts up our brothers and reaffirms the notion that there are some decent African-American men out there that desire to treat a sistah right. These women have the right formula for lasting a lifetime together. I am grateful to have such an individual in my life, so I could really identify with the trials, tribulations, triumphants, and celebrations that these women experienced.

I started reading this book at 7 pm and was unable to put it down until completion (12 a.m.) As a Floridian I am extremely proud of our hometown girl (Lolita Files) For those of you who have read this book you most definately have to read Scenes From A Sista. This will really open your eyes to the beginnings of Ms. Misty and Ms. Reesy.This is a true best friend book.

Granted, you can record the entire EP on a 15 min. tape but hey... its new, its fresh, and Im sure someday there will be other Paxton albums and you will be looking for this EP with hard to find albums in some record store in Green River Wyoming or something like that.

Don't get me wrong because I like Threshold but not one review mentions the fact that the concert is constantly being interrupted by COMMENTARY.

The company initially only issued material on tape.Produced by Jimmy Miller and Johnny Thunders, it is a collection of studio demos and live material which is mostly sloppy and very uneven, as was most of his gigs. The cover art is an infamous photo of Thunders that was made into posters. Being an authorized release is a major plus, since Thunders is heavily chronicled through bootlegs or unauthorized releases.But this is an artist who is living up to a crash-and-burn legend which would ultimately kill him less than a decade later. The studio material is a work in progress and have some interesting moments. But it ultimately tells a real story that indeed is too much, too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"revu","review":"andrew martin of e-map consumers guide(staff of one) doesn't quite get it. but thats o.k. of course the album is slop...of course the sound quality is horrible...people made alot of money off johnny so he played this joke. ha ha.it's on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't want it to end.","review":"Just read \\"Abarat\\" and I was really impressed. In terms of the richness of characters, writing and settings, \\"Abarat\\" is right up there with \\"Imajica,\\" which is probably Clive Barker's best book, next to \\"Weaveworld.\\"When I read \\"Coldheart Canyon\\" around this time last year, it seemed lacking, as if Barker's attention had been distracted by something. It's clear now that he was putting his energy into \\"Abarat.\\"This book is the beginning of a great adventure. I didn't want it to end. I put down the book and said, \\"Oh, it's over?,\\" only to find that I'd gone thru 400 pages.Can't wait till the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to read the next!","review":"Sometimes I find it hard to get into a fantasy book that is part of a series. I feel like all the author does is try to set up characters and settings. That wasn't the case here. We meet our heroine, Candy Quackenbush of Minnesota, right away and her journey to the islands of Abarat starts quickly. I enjoyed the several stories besides Candy's that were being told at the same time, for I was curious where other characters had gone and what they were up to. I also thought the pictures were great to help me imagine what the creatures Candy met looked like. I really can't wait to the read the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little scary","review":"When I was reading ABARAT, I consumed almost half of it in a day. I must say that I was surprised because by then not much had happened. But if you like books with a spooky and semi-morbid twist to them, this the book for you. If you didn't like the way the fourth Harry Potter book got a little gory, this is DEFINITELY not for you. Not for the timid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptastic","review":"I thought maybe Clive would be an interesting read but I was so wrong. The story was such utter crap it's hard to describe. I stopped reading when the main character (floating in an ocean) was found by a a group of fish people (who were floating in the air above the water) playing cards on a floating table that eventually walked away (the table, that it).Seriously?I like horror, fantasy, magic, and the rest as much as anyone else - but please. It was a stretch to accept your first few characters and then the table?I've got better things to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read a library copy","review":"Before you spend money on this book, get a copy from the library. See if you enjoy reading it for sixty or so pages. We have teens who read a lot, but they couldn't get into this book at all, and neither could I. The lead doesn't have a motive or a clue, the other characters are amazing but without personality, and the plot drifts from anecdote to anecdote, getting more confused the farther into the book. This may be a case of the author being too clever for the reader, and the reviewers wanting to embrace a hyper-clever book rather than an interesting one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good...","review":"This book was interesting in the beginning. I was actually into it for the first few chapters. Then, a little later into it, the book sort of lost its appeal for me. I couldn't even finish it. I thought it would be good, but, in my opinion, it was a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great 1st half of a story and that's all you get...","review":"I found the story to be very interesting and much more entertaining than most Barker works. The problem is it's only half a story. The large type, generous spacing, and big margins lend pages to a book that's only partially there. Someone involved in this process got too greedy by putting out half a product and charging full price. Wait until a compilation edition comes out that adds the stories together and you will actually get a complete product for your money. At that point I would reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"brilliant illustrations, dreadful prose","review":"The illustrations are fantastic, but Barker's writing made me want to hurl. His prose is not alive, and it's full of cliches. Furthermore, the episodic nature of the story failed to hold my interest. The terrific paintings are the only reason to read this book, which without them would be a complete insult to readers worldwide."},{"rating":"2","title":"none","review":"From one of the most fertile minds of imaginative fiction, Barker has created a wonderland and timeless tale of the exotic and mysterious, of wonder and awe, terror and joy.

The older (13-but a very mature reader), was wrapped up in the tale from beginning to end and enjoyed the journey very much. I highly recommend for the older Young Adult reader and Parents as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is awesome.","review":"When I first got this book I knew it would be great. I haven't read any of his other books, but several people I know have and they loved them. This book is one of the best stories I've ever read! I must warn you though, that if you are planning to give this book to someone under the age of 12, I wouldn't reccomend it. Some of the pictures are quite disturbing (though exquisitely drawn) and some of the language may not be easily understood by children. Unlike everyone else who has reviewed this excellent story, I am not an adult. I am 13 years old. I highly reccomend this to teens who are looking for a fun and interesting adventure story. When I completed this story, I was actually sad that it ended! I can't wait for the next books to be released!! Trust me. You will LOVE this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What It Lacks in Sense It Makes Up For In Artistic Novelty","review":"The first feature worth mentioning in Clive Barker's newest child targeted exploit, ABARAT, is the wonderfully detailed color illustrations that fill the pages and really make the story come alive. However, at times the story seems to merely present a medium for the art to be displayed. The characters, at most times, are hardly three-dimensional, including the main-character Candy Quackenbush. Her name in itself is far more of a distraction than an asset to the entire plot. However, I do greatly admire Barker's way of displaying the antagonist in the story and will be reading the next addition to the series when it comes out to find out how his life continues.All in all, this book is hardly the masterpiece that The Thief of Always is and will probably always be but is worth acquiring for the pure artistic \\"oomph\\" that this book packs. It makes it well worth that price."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entry into a New World...","review":"This is an engrossing book for all ages. This is not by any means a book to be enjoyed only by children. I was unable to put this book down after a Candy entered the imaginitive world of Abarat...and I'm 21 years old! I cannot wait until the second book which should be even better as some of the loose ends should be tied up. If you are at all interested in fantasy novels...this is an absolute must! Don't think twice, order it now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is amazing!!!!!!!","review":"I cannot believe what all these people are talking about! This book is my favorite!

I'm returning this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realized world, wonderfully portrayed","review":"It seems a whole lot of authors who have written in other genres, mainly for adults, have taken to this 'genre,' which Rowling, and CS Lewis before her, had already pioneered: books that seem aimed at children but are really for all ages. Chabon's Summerland is another such title.But this one does it brilliantly. Barker doesn't rely on borrowed mythology, cobbled together. He has created a world, complete with unique illustrations. This man has an incredible imagination and can render the narrative drive of the story in a strong, consistent voice that sweeps you away.I've not read anything by Barker before. I may just try to see what else he's done. I just sort of associated him with the Dungeons and Dragons kind of crowd. I look so very forward to the sequels to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IN KINDLE/KINDLE APP FORMAT! Get a hard copy.","review":"The book is good. However, it is hugely lost in this format because none of the beautiful images created for this story are included. There's well over 100 images in the book that are not in the kindle version Buy a hard copy. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"I really liked this book.

I hate when they only write half a story and you need to wait for the next book for the rest of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Book","review":"This book is a great fantasy tale with the best illustrations I have seen in a book in ages. Clive Barker no only has incredible talent as an author with wonderful quirky characters and great descriptive scenes, but he is also an outstanding artist!

If you appreciate great writing and awesome artworks this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abarat can be tough going!","review":"Clive Barker, where are you going with this series? I read the book-on-tape version (missed the great illustrations so doing) and right up to the end I still cannot figure out where Barker is going with this story. Barker is very capable of writing a great childrens story: The Thief of Always is wonderful and a must read for all of Barker's fans of any age. I kept waiting for the great revelation/resolution in Abarat, but it never came. Perhaps in the sequel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"Really wasnt impressed with this. There is no warning that this is not really aimed at a mature reader and was given it as gift. Having read almost all his other books and enjoyed them this was a shock to the system. I found it totally without substance, and whereas certain \\"young adults\\" books are readable, this was tepid, and really had very little about it at all. As Clive is writting a set, i think perhaps it will be a while before i next pick up a book by him, which is a shame as he is such a creative talent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"A completely terrible book. Barker takes a typical storyline (a girl is bored with her hum-drum life and stumbles onto an exciting one) and just adds oddities and strangeness to the point that you start to gag every time his eight-headed character (who is oddly reminiscient of Snow White's seven dwarves all wrapped up into one convenient, silly-to-the-point-of-stupid package) opens its mouth. Some may say it's childish and stupid because it's a children's book, but I say it's rubbish.If you buy it, buy it for the cover art, which is decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"Clive Barker paints a picture of an interesting, if disjointed fantasy world - sadly, the story's real world part is even harder to believe.

Big disappointment and very annoying since I read the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck???","review":"As a so-called Young Adult [though older than the Harry Potter crowd] I think they REALLY missed the boat on this one. The art is interesting, but really out of place in the age range, and the writing is bad. It is a weird idea to put the Pinhead man up as a writer for kids in the first place. Not that kids don't like horror, but this is like Charles Addams without the talent. This book is ...not all that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I were a child, this might have been interesting","review":"It started fairly well but went downhill from there.

This, I believe, is one of them. Then again, maybe it's only because I'm an adult. Younger readers may see this world immediately.There are rewards aplenty here. Let yourself see them."},{"rating":"1","title":"abarat/perplexed","review":"Most of the reviews for this book are good, so maybe something is wrong with me, but I gave this book about 125 pages and it just wasn't clicking for me. I like to give a story a fair shake and I admit I paid my hard-earned cash because of the art work and the fact that this book was well put together. The quality is there, but the text. . .It seemed like Clive Barker was just writing whatever came to mind, like a stream of consciousness type deal. I'll try again, but I'll be honest it'll be when I'm good and bored and hard-up for a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine","review":"I love the creativity it took to write this book.

This is the first books of the Abarat series written by the master Clive Barker.

Then there are some utterly silly projects - knitted covers for mobile phones, golf clubs, etc. - which remind me of those awful knitted crinoline ladies to cover toilet rolls and teacosies. There are some real garments - sweaters, cardigans - but they seem to make a virtue out of being badly finished. Also, 'large' equates with 36\\" bust, which may be OK for Hollywood stick insects but most folk would be disappointed. Wasted money, I'm afraid. Anyone who'll pay postage can have mine for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner Perfect! Great Instructions and Beautiful Designs","review":"As a newbie knitter in my twenties, this is my favourite book. The projects are simple, the photos are gorgeous, and I can see returning to this book for years to come because I love the designs so much. The step-by-step instructions are great and I wish more books were written this way. (I can't stand knitting by antiquated abbreviations.)I did have a couple of problems. There are a lot of misprints in the book. If you buy the book, be sure to visit www.sussdesign.com to get the list of corrections before you begin any of the projects. I also wish she included instructions on how to crochet the pieces together, since this is a finishing technique used often throughout the book.Overall, a book I would readily recommend to other beginning knitters. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true waste of money","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book! The patterns contained are so simplistic, you could train a reasonably intelligent monkey to knit them! Oh, it is glossy and colorful, to be sure but there really is nothing in it for the intermediate knitter and for sure, a complete waste of money for the advanced knitter. Who would want to knit a cell phone cover?? When I ordered the book, it sounded as though there were plenty of patterns in it, thirty, I think but most of them are a joke. I would recommend \\"Knitting Without Tears\\" for the beginner or for anybody who really does love to knit and enjoys trying something a little different.

There is a difference between a simple, timeless pattern that lets the beauty of the yarn shine, and a crude, poorly written one. Unfortunately the patterns of this book falls into the latter category.Too bad that I gave one of the patterns, the leather tie cardigan, the benefit of the doubt and started knitting it. The instructions omitted several rows at the top of the sleeve so that the finished piece measures 13\\" rather than the specified 17\\"! I looked for corrections on her website.

How else could they make use of sweater patterns that top out at 36 inches, and tube and halter tops that appear to be sized for prepubescents? The instructions seem to range from mostly clear to inanely detailed (40+ rows of row-by-row instructions for a scarf). The name dropping (all over every page) somewhat impedes the flow of information.I have to think of this book as something like one of those gourmet cookbooks that assumes that you have a food processer, a stand mixer, a spare oven, and the willingness to measure out four onces of egg white and one third of a cup of chopped onion. It's not so much about cooking (or knitting), but about imagining what it would be like to live that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad directions, hard-to-find yarn","review":"I agree with many of the other reviews written. I thought some of the patterns were cute and quick, but now that I've knit up 4 of the patterns, I'd have to say that they are just plain wrong! The baby's cardigan sweater and hat was a disaster. The kids rollneck sweater with fuzzy heart in the middle was not true to size at all. And others were just as bad. I checked my gauge beforehand and followed the instructions to the letter; the directions are simply incorrect.

Of these patterns, none will fit you if you are over a size 8. That's not an exaggeration. I am a small woman (size 2) and started a sweater in the largest size that still looked too small.The tone is full of prentious celebrity name dropping, pompous self congratulations, and boring, unclear, error filled patterns. How can such SIMPLE patterns have so many errors?! very few patterns extend beyond one page. If it wasn't for the huge pictures, all these patterns could probably be filled into 5 pages of printed text.Of the cute designs, there's the orange cover sweater and a child's sweater with a heart.

Most reviews miss the main point: it's fun for kids to hear other kids sing. My 6- and 7-year-old (boy and girl) love to pretend they're real singers, so listening to this music is really fun for them. It sparks their imagination. At this age I don't really mind the nasty content of the real music since they don't understand it yet, and I have them listen to that too, but these cds offer them another option. (In fact, it's pretty funny to hear them sing grown-up lyrics cluelessly.) My son's favorite music is classical. My daughter likes the Beatles and Hillary Duff. Go figure?--but don't be so quick to judge. I'm not thrilled that this one is a 2-cd set, because it's more expensive. Plus, kids usually latch onto only a few songs at a time and listen to them endlessly, so more songs are just a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Not another Kids Bop cd!!!!","review":"Will the insanity ever stop????

The playback volume is pitiful, however, even at the highest setting.

Because they are a huge conglomerate that owns a lot of copyrighted material (movies, music, etc.), they are paranoid about you converting any of it to something that might be useful to you in a format that is not a proprietary Sony format.This is the company that put hacker software on their CD's to try and prevent people from ripping Sony CD's.While there technology is often very good, their philosophy will be their ruination.

This album is an intensely sugary sweet, a rush of flavour that bursts all over your tastebuds and is gone before you feel overindulged.Beulah are a really tight outfit. They marry perfect harmonies to choppy indie guitars and the odd happy blast of a horn section. Think cracked concrete foothpaths and icecreams on a sunny day. This is the sort of music that lights up miserable November mornings with an early promise of next June.As for concerns over its short length, what can I say except I don't think pet sounds broke the 40 minute barrier either.An album for anyone who likes their indie pop to skip down the sunnier side of the street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 5 to Even Start With","review":"Just got these.

I came down this morning (it's a grey day here in Seattle) and when I turned on the light the kitchen looked kind of gloomy. Three more Sylvanias have burned out!

Took it out installed a second bulb exactly the same. The third one was ok. At this stage I repacked the bulbs. Submitted a return order on Amazon. Then bought the TCP Bulbs and are great as my previous experience (see my earlier review).I think that Amazon should not charge the shipping cost to the customer BUT to Sylvania because of their defective product. It ended up that I had to pay the shipping cost which was $9 while the Bulbs were for $13.53.

Calphalon does not recommend putting it in the dishwasher, but that is standard for nonstick products.My experiences with this baking pan so far have been completely positive. The baking does appear to be even throughout the pan and I've had no issue with the nonstick coating.

At first you think, oh, sure, it's the one named Deacon that's going nutty, but you soon find that the movie has better things to say than that.Filmed in the same gritty colors as Band of Brothers, it could almost be an addition to the series - except that it's better than a few of them. The characters and banter are wholly believable, and the story is so well done it could almost be a family-friendly movie - depending on their tolerance for people being shot, of course. But the many little deft touches and plot points really do merit being seen, even in spite of its inevitable war footing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saints & Soldiers is inspirational","review":"I spent time in Germany on a mission too & saw the destruction of war still evident 40 years later.

I'd buy it all over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is a good album that grows on you after at least 3 listens.

I expected this book to be awesome because it was about the best wrestler of all-time, but found that it was basically a picture book about Bret's career. When I purchased the book I assumed that most if not all of the book would be written by Bret but found out that he only wrote about the last five pages which is an excerpt from the Calgary Sun Newspaper after Owen died. If you are expecting a book the calibur of 'Have a Nice Day' you are out of luck because this book isn't up to the calibur of 'GooseBumps.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bret's biography","review":"Folks save your money. This is not the long awaited autobiography that all Bret Hart fans have been waiting so long for. This is at best a coffee table book with some nice pictures.

He is in fact in the midst of writing it now during his layoff from a severe concussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bret has more interesting stories than this drivle...","review":"I am shocked that Bret Hart, who participated in a cutting edge, expose' such as \\"wrestling with shadows\\" would write a book that has such little substance. The book can be read in less than an hour. It has some nice pictures but Bret has virtually no behind the scenes information and pretty much glosses over his split with the WWF and his brother Owen's death. Bret is even in character at times which makes this book unfortunetly more like the kayfabe Arn Anderson book and less like Mick Foley's masterpiece. This book is definitely not the best there is, was, or ever will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bret Hart has a vendetta with WWF","review":"Looking over Bret Hart's \\"biography\\", it is nothing more than just a lot of photos and not much print. It's a shame that Bret couldn't take the time to write a true autobiography like what the Rock and MIck Foley did. As for the photos, the majority of them are action from Bret's matches in WCW. As for his WWF days (which he spent most of his career with), there's only a few photos with him holding the WWF championship belt, and a face-to-face confrontation with Stone Cold Steve Austin. It is very obvious that Bret has a personal vendetta with the WWF because of what Vince McMahon did to him in the 1997 Survivor Series. (If you're not familiar with this story, then check out the video \\"Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows\\"). Overall, this book is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WWF PICTURES.","review":"THIS BOOK IS ALL ABOUT BRET IN WCW WINNING THE US TITLE AND MATCHS WITH STING IN THE SHARPSTOORER.PS IF YOU LIKE BRET IN THE WCW DAYS THAN BUT IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I am a huge Bret Hart fan and this book was overpriced and it underdelivered. Bret certainly is the best ever, but this book does not do him justice. Their is harldy a mention of his late brother Owen or the infamous screwjob at SS '97. I was looking forward to a real autobiography from the most famous member of the greatest wrestling family in history. Hey Bret, if you by some act of God read this review, please write your own book without a ghost writer. I read your on-line column and you would do a much better job. This book was a disgrace to the Hart family name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I ordered this book thinking that it would be an autobiography like Foley's, but after skimming over it (no, I have not completely read it yet. I gave it 5 stars because that was a required field and I didn't want to ruin the rating) I realized that the pictures far outnumber the words. Also, instead of saying, for instance, \\"My first match\\" it would say \\"Bret's first match\\" implying that Bret had little to do with this book. It is soft cover in full color so it just seems like a large magazine. I might send it back, I'm glad Amazon has a great return policy.

If not for him, it wouldn't have been a good film. He was literally all over the place with the same personality that Chevy Chase's Clark Griswold had. I was more disappointed with the last fifteen-twenty minutes of Mafioso. I wished that the director could have come up with a better way to finish Mafioso on a high note. The idea of Antonio Badalamenti being boxed in a crate en route to New York City from Sicily was absurd at best and ruined the film. It was just stupid and senseless. If it happened somewhere in Italy, fine, I'll accept it. But New York City...that seems so far removed. Anyway, wow...Alberto Sordi was just brilliant in this film.

The set is practical, incorporating the 3 most used knives in the kitchen. The paring knife is slightly larger than average and makes quick work of small vegetables, and fruits. The utility knife is versatile, extremely effecient, and saws neatly through just about anything. The East/West knife is a smaller rendition of a classic chef's knife with very good balance and smooth, precise cutting. It sliced through 75% frozen chicken like it was a warm knife through butter. The handles are extremely non-slip, comfortable, albeit a bit gaudy with the blaze orange coloring. The case is functional with handle grooves and silicone covered magnets to hold the blades in place. You could easily spend this on a quality chef's knife alone, but this set includes just that and 2 bonus knives making it a very nice bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality","review":"These knives are very easy to hold in your hand because of the rubber handles.

I put it on Sunday evening and by Monday evening my face felt hot like I had a glass of red wine, then when I woke up Tuesday morning (today) my face (mostly temple areas, forhead, chin, apple of cheeks, tip of nose and neck) had swollen hovey area, is tight, extremely hot to the touch, and overall uncomfortable. Went to the dr. to get steroid cream and took Benadryl so I could even work today. I have used this product in the past.

Unfortunately, my pump feature broke, and my product comes out the side! Lol, I am still using it, but what a flaw in design!

However, at the advice of a friend I purchased the Olay ant-aging 7 in 1 daily moisturizer. After about 4 days of use I had patches of dryness on my checks. It looked very ashy. I went back to my L'Oreal Age Perfect. This product should be tested before you purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dried my skin out","review":"So, I purchased this moisturizer because quite a few beauty recommendation sites said it was full of awesome and one of the best moisturizers out there. Excitedly, I hunted for it on Amazon, and found it. I was also pretty happy because it had a coupon so I bought it right away!My boyfriend and I both used the facial lotion for several days. Unfortunately, it managed to dry not only my skin out (I have a normal skin type which is not very sensitive) but also my boyfriend who used it also ended up with drier skin (he has dry skin type that is sensitive). I am very sad that Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer did not turn out to be anywhere near as good as the beauty recommendation sites had said it would be.Basically, be warned that this will may not work as a moisturizer. Rather, it may turn out to work as a sort of anti-moisturizer. We ended switching to Cetaphil instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"feels good","review":"I don't think it has made me look any younger with it's use but it does feel good going on and soothes irritation from shaving the sun etc. I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY!!!","review":"I've been suffering from combination acne prone skin and thought that this would be the answer to my problems, with Salicylic acid as one of the ingredients and other multiple promises this moisturizer said it would do.

It is NOT GOOD FOR SENSITIVE SKIN! i am RETURNING THIS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke me out in hives","review":"I suffer from moderate acne and it was really bad for the past couple months, so I was hoping this would help it as well as help fade the red marks from past pimples. Before using this I did not think my skin was that sensitive because I never broke out into hives before. After using it once, my face was really red and three little patches of hives had broken out. I had heard such good reviews about this product I assumed it was something else that was making my face break out, so I used it a few more times and each time the hives got worse. I finally stopped using it and started using another face lotion, and after two days the hives were all gone. If your skin is even a little bit sensitive, I advise you against using this product. This was the most money I have ever spent on a face lotion, and unfortunately in this case you do NOT get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I don't typically wear foundation. When I saw this product, I thought I would give it a try. So, after washing my face with the total effects cream cleanser, I applies the moisturizer with foundation. It went on easily and was not messy. But for me, it accentuated my dry areas (around mouth and eyebrows) and made them looky flaky instead of moisturized. It's put away in a drawer. I might use it again, but I will have to moisturize with another Olay product before using this one. Not really a time-saver like I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an all-purpose moisturizer","review":"I love Olay Total Effects and have been using the regular Total Effects daily moisturizer for years. After becoming unemployed recently, I was afraid I would have to give up my Olay for something cheaper. I found the subscription option at Amazon and was thrilled to be able to get it for at least $5 cheaper than anywhere I can find it locally. The UV SPF 15 was even cheaper than the regular, so I thought I'd give it a try. This SPF 15 variety does not feel like a moisturizer at all. It feels a little tacky/sticky going on, and it makes my face feel tight and dry. I do not normally have sensitive skin, but I felt a mild burn after using it. The smell of sunscreen is also obvious. I can see using this in the middle of summer when I'm slathering on the sunscreen anyway, but I would only use this specifically when needing extra facial UV protection...not as a moisturizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rash!","review":"I wish I would have read these reviews before trying this product, though I am not sure it would have made a difference--I probably would still have bought it. I have never had a reaction to a moisturizer or sunscreen or even make-up before, but while applying my third application of this I noticed the red rash on my cheeks that others have mentioned. I've used other Oil of Olay products with no incident, and I was actually trying to switch to this from the Neutrogena anti-aging product I had been using simply because of the name brand. Didn't work.Aside from the rash, I was also not a fan of the texture of this product--it was thicker and greasier than I had expected, more of a traditional sunscreen than a moisturizer. All over disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"To greasy","review":"A little to greasy for me. I like a lighter cream so it doesn't feel heavy on the face.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thick foundation with overpowering scent","review":"I am trying out new products to find a moisturizer/foundation combo that I can wear throughout the day. I don't need a heavy foundation but just something natural and light to gently cover the flaws in my skin. I am in my late 50's with fair/medium skin tone. I have purchased several products and thought I would try them out until I find one that I like. 'Olay total effect 7-in-1 Anti-Aging' is one of the products that I recently purchased. This product is very heavy and perfumed. The coloring in this product is too intense to wear as a foundation. Therefore I plan to use it as a blush for the contour area under my cheek bones. Also I cannot use this product daily since I find that I have an allergic reaction to the strong perfume if I apply it too often. I will not purchase this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful moisturizer!","review":"My friend recommend this to me, she said it is a very wonderful moisture,so I ordered it.Now I have used this moisturizer in the morning for several days.The texture is rich and creamy and absorbs quickly.

I decided to try to Total Effects Touch of Sun for a little color, but was disappointed to find that it made me break out. I never get blemishes, but got numerous blemishes when using this product. It also did not have much color to it anyways, but had that horrible sunless tanner smell to it. I will continue to use the original regular Total Effects, but will not use the Touch of Sun again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product -Great Price","review":"Olay makes great skin care products and this is one of them. My skin has a much more youthful look after using Total Effects. The price on amazon is very competitive and on top of that I receive an additional discount by signing up to have the product shipped every 6 months. I will probably change that to every 3 months since the product has impressed me and now know that I will be using it daily.

It feels and smells like sunscreen lotion and stings. I feel like washing it off as soon as i put it on. It doesn't moisturize at all. It feels thick and sticky and it never vanishes. I'm not keeping it long enough to find out if it works well long term. I'll be returning it as soon as possible. Now I have to go back and look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very strong sunscreen-type smell","review":"I bought this hoping to spend less on a daily facial cream with SPF. I've been using Ole Henricksen's \\"truth revealed super creme SPF 15\\", which is $55 a jar. Well, you definitely get what you pay for. The smell of this \\"unscented\\" cream is so chemically (is that a word?) and sunscreeny, that it's almost unbearable to wear. It is thick, so only a little bit is needed, but it isn't fully absorbed by my skin. My makeup brushes have to be washed more frequently because of the residue and the smell (I don't want it to cross-contaminate into my blush/powder foundation). I will not purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"In love","review":"I am in love with this daily moisturizer. It smells so good I wish I could use it all over.

I've been using it for a few months and while i haven't noticed any radical changes in my skin (my fine lines are still there), it is still my favorite moisturizer. I decided on this product based on the review at beautypedia.com, it seems to be a reliable product. It goes on very smoothly and dries quickly, you don't need to use too much. It does smell slightly like sunscreen lotion, but I don't mind. I like the pump design, and if you have read up on moisturizers you might have heard that you shouldn't use any product in a jar because it is constantly being exposed to air and bacteria. The packaging, spf, and anti aging aspects are unbeatable at this price (mine was $14 on Amazon at the time)."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"Love that it has no scent. After using it religiously for about 3 weeks, I started to notice little bumps almost like a rash start to appear on my cheeks.

Started using it twice a week along side other lotions for my face and have been fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I've used many Oil of Olay products before, and was excited to try this one. The first few days, people commented on my skin looking fresh and dewy, however, after the first week I noticed small red bumps starting to appear on my cheeks, and my skin becoming itchy and irritated. I stopped using it after two weeks, hoping that this was just a phase of the product I would have to endure, but alas, my skin just got worse. I went back to my Aveeno lotion, and my skin calmed down after a few days. I will never buy this product again, it was so uncomfortable having itchy skin on my face, knowing that were I to scratch it, I would only make it worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works","review":"after a few weeks of use you will notice the subtle changes--for the price--you can't beat this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Olay Touch of Sun is a great product","review":"The Touch of Sun version of this wonderful cream really does give just a touch of color, but it's enough to give a \\"healthy\\" rested look without looking really tan.

Almost like it fades to your skin tone. I try to put it on right after I get out of the shower when my face is still moist (it goes on alot smoother). I love it now...I use it on the days when I don't want to do my full makeup but still have a couple errands to do cause it still has the coverage but I know at night if I get really tried I don't have to worry about washing all my makeup off I just head off to bed and my face never breaks out.

Then I noticed the low-volume hum (60 Hz?) coming from the bass ports on the back. The lower you turn the volume, the louder the hum, though it was always very subtle. The more I tried to ignore it, the more annoying it became.Repositioning the unit had no effect, nor did moving the cord or antenna or trying different modes (CD, radio, aux). The power cord has a two-pronged plug, and there was no way to ground the unit to see if that would solve the problem.Since this was to be used right next to the bed and normally played at low volume, the hum was unacceptable, particularly at the price of this radio. Paying shipping to return the radio has also left a bad taste in my mouth.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, great quality","review":"It feels heavy and very well made. It has great sound, simple controls and overall one of the best table clock radios/CD around. My only complaint is, it does not offer a digital tuner, my reason for taking away a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound -- weak CD player","review":"I've had this unit for about 8 months. It looks and sounds great. I mostly bought it for the CD player -- I put a CD in when I go to bed. About a month ago the CD player began to have problems. It began to play CDs with a very noticeable \\"vibrato\\" effect. In the past month it's gotten worse, and now the player seems to lose its place, stop playing for a few seconds, then start up again. At this point the CD player really isn't usable.The radio still sounds great. I still have CD players from the 80s that still work fine, so this might just be a once-in-a-million problem, but it's a bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk.","review":"I thought I could trust the Teac brand. I liked the styling. My kids needed a clock radio and like to go to sleep listening to a CD. Bought this unit for Christmas. Within one month, the CD player began to fail. It wouldn't read certain CDs. Store-bought CDs, old or new, when loading a CD it would just spin and spin and ultimately the display would simply read NO. Another month later and it won't play any CDs at all. That's a complete failure of a main feature of the product. Unacceptable. I say AVOID THIS PIECE OF JUNK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Price - Hospital Grade","review":"Hibiclens was introduced to our family as hospital-provided wash for MRSA infection requiring surgery and then found to be known to many of our contacts as a superior anti-bacterial product. Less effective products only wipe out the weaker strains of germs... it's survival of the fittest... so sloppy use of weak antimicrobials may actually increase your risk.

Well it does not have the smell like other hair dye that was nice. But the color is AWFUL!!! I am going to have to re-dye it with my old color just so I can stand to look at myself in the mirror. The color is brassy and just not (natural) at all. Another thing I did not like is the way my hair felt after using it, it felt corse and dry even after using the conditioner that was included.

She seems upset but then sigh she forgives them (blah). Brief moments of backbone and then (sob) she's kissed and forgets to be mad(Barf).Seriously though sarcasm aside; of the many I have read this one was not worth my time or money. The characters had potential but they were so contradictory that their actions were confusing and irritating. The heroine had moments of promise and backbone, but then she would become this naive basket case. It was a big contradiction. All in all the book was a sore disappointment and I wish I hadn't muddled my way through it. Should have gone with my gut and tossed it after the first few chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monte Cristo","review":"Monte Cristo is an old townsite below a sleepy glacial basin located eighty miles northeast of Seattle. It's the destination of thousands of recreational hikers annually. Hidden from their view by a century of harsh winter storms and avalanches is a rich mining and townsite history that Philip Woodhouse brings to life. We returned from a weekend hike so intrigued that we went directly to the public library Monday evening. We found precious little, mostly Washington mining reports and embarrassingly anecdotal histories. This book represents the only comprehensive, readable history of the environs. And it's a wonder to behold. Skillfully woven together are journalistic accounts, anecdotes, recognizable sketches and maps, and a narrative complemented by a generous collection of historical photos. Woodhouse is a writer evidently in love with these mountains and their history. His account is compelling and full of surprises, every bit as enchanting as the townsite it concerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Stark, But Beautiful & Creative!","review":"Marc Bessange has produced a collection of black & white male semi-nude photos here that are simple, yet beautiful and creative in there presentation. There are no props, fantasy settings, fetish images. There are just good-looking, young, masculine males who seem very relaxed before the camera. These are reality shots of these male models, posing the way they want, in a natural way. There is no frontal nudity, and I believe this makes these poses even more sensual than if they were nude. These guys either have attitude or they don't, it is up to them. This is to Bessange's credit that he lets his models take control, and be themselves in all of his work. This is a fine collection from a very talented photographer. The cover photo is one of my favorites, and I think you will enjoy this collection. Check it out!Joe Hanssen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rodeo Failures, not Bloopers","review":"I regularly attend and assist in orchestration of rodeo events.I bought Rodeo Bloopers 10 - and rated it a 1 star because there as no zero star option. It was advertised as a great 'party video'. Advertising as a party video is a misrepresentation as I've not attended a party nor thrown a party for 30 min. in duration. Secondly, while I admit I enjoy the thrill of rodeo - an extremley dangerous sport, the events filmed in the video were failures, not bloopers. There were a couple of humorous events, but there was approx. 15 minutes of extremely boring 'acting' by some gentlemen trying to be funny - but they were ridculous. One gentleman made me want to throw a boot at the TV and use the other boot to kick myself for buying the video.Bottom line, while I've not seen any other Rodeo Blooper videos, don't waste your money, or time on Rodeo Bloopers 10.This video sucks so much, I'm tossing it in the garbage"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marshall Mathers kills!!","review":"D12's new CD (Devil's Night) rules and most of all Purple Hills rules!!

If your not a die hard Dead Space fan, leave this one alone. As for the people giving it a five star rating I can only assume they must be fanboys/fangals of the series to have overlooked simple details. Just as one prime example in one of the story tracks a man of the African-American persuasion is grieving over the tragic loss of his daughter, who is represented as an Asian girl for roughly 90% of his story who is then transformed into an African-American girl. Its small details like this that offset the viewing enjoyment, and its not the only one. But overlooking magical racial flips this is a filler with no direct story content to the games or any of the lore other than the Marker and its effects really. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"It did not have that same grit as the first one.

I don't see what the fascination is behind making video games into movies, but Dead Space: Aftermath could serve as the only proof that this practice should be stopped altogether.The movie's plot is hard to follow because you don't really know who to root for. None of the characters are particularly likable. You get the general idea of who's a good or bad, but you're never given a reason to care about any of them.The monsters are cool, but I'm sure they can be found in the video game. I don't know if the video game is more fun than the movie, but I'd be shocked if it wasn't.Maybe it's because I'm too old or maybe it's because I'm not into Dead Space, but I hated this movie. It's a waste of time for any member of the human race. I don't say this very often, but I want the time I wasted watching this film back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good. Disappointed","review":"I am a Dead Space Fan, normally. But, I was very let down and disappointed with this movie DVD.

I have picked up the movie because I am not a fan of sci-fi. Sci-Fi animation can sometimes enahance the imaginary sense of the experience.With that being said, I must say that the animation (effects) are fairly low quality and not particularly impressive. The story line may make more sense for anyone who is familiar with the game. I was not shaken up by it.This movie anumation will kill a couple of hours in your day but it will not leave you in awe and provide you unforgetable experience. With that being said, that may just be enough fro anyone spending a lonely night at home with nothing better to do. It beats the re-runs on your favorite movie cable channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering & uneven entry in Dead Space lore","review":"If you have thrilled to the adventures of Isaac Clarke in the Dead Space series you will probably be let down by this short feature. It tells the tales of 4 adventurers and what really happened aboard their ship USMG O'Bannon (wink), the CG intro scenes that are intercut throughout the stories are of distractingly low quality, like something out of THE LAWNMOWER MAN. The voice acting and other animation are mostly passable but the story doesn't service anything other than a few shocks, some titillation and quite a bit of profanity that doesn't feel character driven just chucked in for effect. The unitologist characters and some of the gore bits work but not enough to make this a whole. The marker that serves as the cover art and the trailer for the ridiculously better in everyway game (DS2) only make the fact that this is tacked on product stand out all the more. Look away there isn't much to see here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Space Aftermath","review":"Dead Space: Aftermath was fairly entertaining, even though I've never played the game or had any other introductions into anything related to Dead Space. I did enjoy the story for the most part, though it seemed somehwat incoherent and vague in details from time to time. I thought the different animation styles used for the various character's flashbacks were really well thought out.The DVD has Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, which in my opinion was very well implemented, blending seamlessly with the movie for an overall excellent experience that helps pull the viewer into the the story.I do wish this movie had been rated, or at least had a label warning of the nude content and strong language used in the animation. Anyone not familiar with what Dead Space is would probably be in for a surprise if they just bought it on a whim for their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Space Aftermath","review":"Its not bad for being a second installment to the first Dead Space anime.

It appears to be set between the first game and the new one.This is a space age shoot-em-up Anime ghost story. Reminiscent of the last work on Animatrix, but instead of internal dialogues, you have the corporations/government as the bad guys (this was old when Aliens splashed across the screen).The overarching motif is 10 Little Indians meets Grindhouse.Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate it, but it lacked any sort of logic or consistency of tone.If someone you love, loved the video game, get this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie in every way","review":"This is the absolute worst garbage I've ever seen.1) No real character development2) Terrible animation and CGI quality - think afternoon kids show quality, like Battle Force 5.3) Horrendous writing - no better written than the 'aforementioned afternoon kids show', but with profanity and gore.4) Stupid nowhere to go plot.5) Characters in CGI looked NOTHING like their cartoon animation counterparts.I have played Dead Space and thought that it was good game.

And it's about as scary. The animation in the final scenes of the movie is so bad that it's laughable.The story provides a slight background for the transition between DS:1 and DS:2, but for any other reason this movie has no value whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Space fans owe it to themselves to watch this.","review":"Any huge Dead Space fan should watch this movie. Especially if you played the first and second game a lot.This is not a cash in! (Like what Resident Evil has done to us so many times. lol)A few important story elements to the backstory of Dead Space are revealed here! If you are obsessed with Dead Space you are going to want to at least watch this movie once! We get to see what happens to Necropmorphs should the Marker actually be destroyed.Plus a very important character from Dead Space 2 is introduced in this movie.My only complaint is that the computer animation is awful when compared to the animation from the first movie. I wish they just kept the movie fully animated by that guy who did the second or third animated stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good going you CGI morons....","review":"Like others have said, the mix of different animations in this movie are just down right annoying. One scene has great movie like CGI, then next one has some cartoon network junk, then some, etc... its really annoying and hard to concetrate on the movie itself. I have not played the game but I watched the first movie and really liked to gore, language, and plot, etc.. animation/CGI could have been better, but this one, is just plain horrible... I still like the idea of the movie, but the lame animations just ruined it. I stopped watching after about 5 minutes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this made?","review":"This movie did not need to be made, it was honestly one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, not only was the plot nonsensical, but the random animation changes are strange as hell. Please, do not rent or buy this movie, just like dante's inferno this is EA cashing in on a franchise's success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"While this wasn't a horrible experience, it wasn't anything spectacular. The plot's kinda rough and the CGI was pretty bad, making it seem like a rush job. The overall artwork was just okay, with some parts greatly detailed and some very mediocre.I'm not against profanity, but there was a whole lot of swearing and the \\"F-bomb.\\" This is strictly a tie-in to the game and would seem confusing to the average viewer looking for a sci-fi flick. If you watch this with no expectations, then it'll be okay. Otherwise, you're going to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Movie, Didn't Like the End","review":"I really like science fiction. Like movies, like animated movies and I liked this one, though there was a lot of blood and gore, but still it was animated blood and gore, so I was able to roll with it. Not that I don't mind blood, even to excess, but there was a whole heck of a lot of excess in this movie.I like zombies too and this version of a zombie movie was pretty good, an alien artifact bringing the dead back to life, a pretty good twist, I thought. The animation was great, I stayed with the movie, but the ending kind of sucked. I didn't feel like I had closure. It was almost as if they couldn't think of what to do next, so they just stopped it.For me, this would have been a bang up five star movie, if not for the unsatisfying ending. I'm taking away a star for that. Originally, I was going to deduct two stars, but I really enjoyed watching this and maybe they're trying to suck me into a sequel. If that's they case, they've succeeded, because I'll buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie in every way!! a complete mess.","review":"i'll make this short and sweet(? kind of). lol. the 1st DEAD SPACE movie was really good, gory, had a good story and identifiable cool characters. this sequel is the antithesis of that. this was SUCH a huge disappointment. mixing extremely poor CGI with cartoon format was beyond stupid and very jarring. the story is a jumbled mess. just blech. i give this a 1 out of one and i hate doing that. i was SO excited for this movie and it just sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Non-Player","review":"Dead Space: Aftermath is the follow up to Deep Space and based on the video game of the same name. The USG O'Bannon has been sent to Aegis VII on a mission to find pieces of an alien artifact. Only four members of the crew make it down to the volcanic surface. The animation is kind of cheesy when compared to all of the CGI we see in today's movies. The movie follows the four survivors individually and we get a 'Rhoshamon' type of story told by each person.When they find the 'artifact' it seems to have a hallucinatory effect on humans and turns dead people into a type of zombie. People who play the video game will enjoy this, but for the rest of us the seesawing between three dimensional present and two-d dreams flashbacks. For me this was just a waste of my time not understanding the back story and not caring about the front story, and the violence is pretty lame and doesn't add anything except to the gore level. So no joy here.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a poor excuse for a movie. I watched the entire film in the hope that it would actually progress in some fashion. I was mistaken. The animation was poorly done and simplistic. The story, or rather stories, were just rehashes of the individual's experiences from the original movie. There was very little new material. I'm stretching a single star rating here, but if you've never seen the original you might get a tiny bit of enjoyment from this. Terrible. Simply terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan and not a gamer","review":"I thought that I would give this a try since I'm a sci-fi fan. The overall Dead Space story is interesting and quite good I believe but this video put me to slee on a saturday afternoon. (I was tired to begin with) It was a great nap. I kept waking up to more crazy animated gore and violence and would try to get back into the video but eventually gave up. I will give it another go when I'm more awake ad maybe when one of my gamer friends comes by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"I had not played the video game that this story comes from so looked at it as a standalone movie.Decent characters. Decent setting. Decent storyline. The real weakness for me was the monsters. I thought they would be more effective as typical zombies (in space) rather than the way movies often try to portray Lovecraft type monsters as endless tentacles.Not bad to watch on a lazy afternoon, but not a great movie either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a good listen","review":"To compare music and things in general is pointless. There is always something different(better) depending on your own personal scale of what is good. I like these guys. There is an awful lot of European music that I missed when it was released, but I now have the chance to hear it. The 20 dollar price tag will discourage most and I think a more reasonable price would help sell it. Well recorded, especially considering the 1976 release. Give it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found a new drinking game","review":"To show how untalented this band is, we came up with a drinking game.

This is by far the worst cd I own, with out a doubt. I bought this cd because I read where someone compared their sound to professional murder music. How can you compare the two, besides the fact that they sound nothing alike the talent levels are much different. For example professional murder music is the epitamy of musical genius and pitbull daycare is just the opposite. The bands lyrics are so cheesy it is hilarious and the songs sound like they are making them up as they go. I gave the cd a one simply because of track 3, because it shows some signs of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!!","review":"I could only get through half the album it was so terrible.Nothing on this CD shows talent.Just alot of noise with no melody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh...It's still just metal....","review":"If Static X is industrial and Korn is goth, then yes, a great blending of rock, goth, and industrial... But not actually being the case, it turns out this is just metal slightly too uninspired and derivative even for mainstream radio (at the moment). However, if the mindless screaming of sophmoric references to sex and drugs, thrown on top of a sonic bed that's been cranked up to \\"11\\" (in lieu of innovation or originality), is to your liking, then this album will be an absolute blessing. The sparkly production values and \\"spooky\\" cover art will also be enjoyable to some listeners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality tape","review":"I looked forward to receiving this video tape. It contained many older commercials that would have been interesting if the tape quality was better. Unfortunately, the video tape was almost unviewable due to extreme amount of \\"snow\\" and interference. It is tood bad that the poor quality of the tape prevented viewing it at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Poor Quality!","review":"yes, i agree. this tape was of very poor visual & audio quality. don't waste your money on this one folks. i'm not sure who to blame, AMAZON or the company who made the video, at any rate i will be sending this tape back pronto. in addition to that, most of the \\"classic\\" commercials are from the mid 1970's & 80's which in my opinion don't really qualify as \\"classics\\". i was looking for a tape w/ commercials from the 50's & 60's, which this had none of. this was truly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Knee Replacement","review":"I didn't realize when I made my purchase that this book's copyright was so old.

Because I was too busy to get off from work I made that appointment in March so I had plenty of time to get ready.

Written by a physical therapist who had helped hundreds prepare for and rehabilitate after knee replacement also ended up with his own knee replacement and the doctor who did the knee replacement of the therapist along with many more. They definitely had experience in all facets of knee replacement. They have a countdown to surgery telling what should be done to prepare for surgery and then what to expect day by day, week by week, and month by month after the surgery. I have bought this book and given it away many times since I had my knee surgery. Everyone planning knee replacement should study this book !"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ONLY BOOK YOU NEED!","review":"This is THE best book for knee replacement. I bought several similar books before my surgery, and after my surgery, this was the ONLY book I used. I followed it like a bible. I have bookmarks, notes in the margin, etc. It gives week-by-week advice, expectations and exercises. It also offered a direct contact for an exercise ball that was such a simple idea but was a fantastic aid for my home exercises.

A book that everyone about to have a TKR ought to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Dissapointed","review":"The authors hardly discuss knee extension directly. According to my Physical Therapists and Surgeon full knee extension post surgically is the biggest challenge faced by many TKR patients. The word \\"extension\\" doesn't even appear in the index. I am over 8 months post surgical and spend all of my rehab time these days working on knee extension exercises. I have to attach a ten pound ankle weight to my left leg, lay on my stomach and dangle my leg off the bed twice a day for thirty minutes. If I skip doing this exercise for even a day my knee stiffens up and becomes painful. I don't understand why this issue is not addressed and must warn anyone considering purchasing this book to know about this omission. Talk to your doctors and pt's before you purchase or follow any advise found in this book about flexion contracture and see what they have to say. I can't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Knee Replacement Book","review":"I bought this book as I am going to have my knee replaced soon and needed some \\"inside\\" information.

The book is great letting you know what to expect and how to best prepare yourself. One of the authors had both knees replaced and I was hoping there would be a little more information (exercises, tips,etc.) on that topic.

He refers to it on a daily basis for exercises and scar management. Now he is 9 weeks post surgical and he walks with no pain, no canes or braces and he is 83.

The first 3 weeks done correctly make all the difference later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-performance glue, but...","review":"I've found in working with Titebond III that it's very aggressive in tack. Even positioning unclamped workpieces will be a problem half a minute later if you have to adjust things. It self-shims a bit so clamps are a must. With tight-fitting joinery you get one chance to knock glued parts together.From its MSDS, Titebond III is a PVA polymer glue with 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol as a solvent/carrier, the latter being a Listed hazardous substance. As a solvent it passes readily through the skin, so despite what the brochure says, wearing gloves would definitely be prudent. I can attest that the drying glue leaves hands a wreck.The solvent is toxic to fish, so cleanup where rinsings can reach waterways would be poor eco-stewardship. And it is mildly inflammable, so no open flames!The PVA portion is a skin, eye, and lung irritant and should not be inhaled as sanding dust. Use full respiratory protection as you would with any glued workpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"Compares to gorilla wood glue. Price/Value is decision maker.

Afterwards I put a clamp each way around the wood (top/bottom, left-right) and when it sets up the cracks are gone, invisible, and I can drill and run self tapping wood screws without fear of any more cracks forming after it sets up.It still works great with precision cut joints and lots of clamps but right out of the bottle things will slide a bit due to the low viscosity of TB 3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky Good Time","review":"The rhythms are more varied on this one than on most Parliament-Funkdelic recordings.

Since then, they've put out two more excellent albums on an Canadian indie label. Led by the wry musings of singer-guitarist Moe Berg, TPOH used heavy guitars and female backing vocals to drive home its often-amusing power pop. In addition to being a good introduction to the band for new fans, this album is also worth picking up for TPOH diehards (you know who you are) because it includes five unreleased tracks and great liner notes by Moe himself. Hopefully, this isn't the last we'll hear from this excellent band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Passes Over Heroes","review":"In '88 when I first heard a demo version of 'I'm An Adult Now', I knew this was a band that deserved to be heard (if not adulated) as well as seen. Moe Berg's lyrics, and suitably well-enunciated delivery as well as the tight simplicity of the band's chops made it a college band par excellence.And even better, one that wrote hummable tunes, one album at a time.Time passed them by for many reasons, mostly because they never achieved success in the U.S. charts. If they fizzled in Canada, it was because their subsequent albums sounded quite redundant in comparison to 'Love Junk' and it's equally good follow-up \\"One-Sided Story\\". They'd shot their load, but not before we were able to hear so many great power pop singles back to back.\\"I'm An Adult Now\\", \\"New Language\\", \\"All I Want\\", \\"Hard to Laugh\\", there seemed to be no end.

He was constantly looking at my notebook, and he almost forced me to write down everything he said.\\"Though I do not own a copy of the recent edition, it is very puzzling that Barnet now lists himself as first author, followed by the translator, with Montejo's name last. Certainly the work of an editor or translator is arduous, and deserves proper credit. Yet both are distinct from the author's.It's both an irony and a shame that Barnet, who is a white member of Cuba's ruling elite, seems to have appropriated the story of a poor, black slave, whose protests and defiance more than 100 years ago would surely be considered counter-revolutionary today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood to Understood","review":"Great storytelling on a wide range of issues that are often misrepresented about Hispanic society in the Americas from the art of low and slow riders, to gays under conservative Catholic institutional repression, to Hispanic working class culture, to Indigenous Native people's rights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, hot, choking...","review":"When you are living in a stranger Country, maybe the most important work you have to do is to trying to adapt to a spacial social condition.

Tiesto uses vocals as well as intense bass and very emotional sounds to create perfection. This is by far the best CD ever produced by Tiesto, a close second being the 'In Search of Sunrise' series.

Within 5 minutes of it on my CD player I went back and bought everything he made that I could get my hands on. DJ Tiesto is clearly one of the most talented artists in his field. I'm not a snobbish trance fan or even a connoisseur, I just like electronica and trance -- and I really like DJ Tiesto's works. It's true that the \\"flow\\" of this album is stuttered, so I only give it 4 or 5 stars. But it's still a great album. Don't listen to URB magazine about the title track It sounds great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"This CD is almost like the orchestra music soundtrack to a movie. Also, the beats are very amateurish. It sounds along the lines or pushing sound buttons every other beat. Highly disappointed in the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I listened to this before an exam...","review":"I listened to this CD before an exam and I failed. I think Tiesto trance has subliminal messages. Go for live instrumental music instead. Try bossa nova or jazz. They are trippy too. Trance had kept me away from God, and had become my cult. I threw away all my electronica CDs and now I am happy and successful. Beware trance music."},{"rating":"2","title":"un sonido mas New Age...","review":"Sus albumes anteriores son mas bien de mucho movimiento y fuerza, asi como esa fabulosa sincronizacion que hace en sus sintetizadores.Este CD me suena mas bien a un CD de reflexion de DJ tiesto, algo asi como probar un poco a lo New Age, las canciones tienen un aire mas relajado aunque habrá algunas (las de enmedio) que elevan un poco la adrenalina. En general me parece un CD muy bien hecho con ritmos suaves y positivos, quizás no sea la mejor eleccion a la hora de comprar un CD para bailar en casa pero sí para oir y quizás, meditar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average tiesto","review":"I'm a huge tiesto fan - hell i dont think i like any other DJ.This is the latest album i bought of his, although its from '01, I only just came across this in the store, along with In Search of Sunrise (1), and sampled all the tracks in both albums, chose this instead as it was different from all the other tiesto that I have (mostly Magik, In Search of Sunrise s)CD1 has an overall slower beat and is softer. Amazing tracks are Magik Journey, Battleship GreyHowever, i didn't like how he did the key track here \\"In My Memory\\". It pales in comparism to his version in In Search Of Sunrise 3If you did the faster, heart thumping, typical trance-techno-ish tracks, go straight to CD2.I loved CD1 and for this price, two cds are worth every penny i spent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but still good.","review":"Not one of Tiesto's best releases, but its worth buying just for Track 2: Close To You."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prolithic and gifted","review":"Dj tiesto is one of the longest running and most creative trance Dj's to date. this release is another example of his complete mastery of more than a few trance styles and an exploration into musical expression that is often formless for Tiesto. in the track \\"flight 643\\" or as it apears on the cd \\"643\\", he grabs the ears of every producer trying to be the new thing and says, hey, this IS the new thing. it also makes for an awsome underground ... up club frenzy experience. this album is sure to make musical history for trance music and the like."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off of a legend!!","review":"what a ripoff of a legends name and likeness!all it is are a bunch of mexican \\" lucha libra\\" wrestling matches. thats it,no tribute to him or his family at all. zero!, just some mexicans ripping off eddie guerrero's good name for a buck!! disgusting,trashy people only do this!!not worth getting. get the official stuff at you know where..they have all his great matches and comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have.","review":"I heard these tapes first in 1992 when a friend forced tape #1 into my deck as we were driving from Fresno to San Francisco. Twenty minutes later I realized I was listening to a conversation by men, for men, that was critical to my own development as a man. Amazing stuff... way beyond my ability to translate into words. Now fifteen years later, these tapes still hold their value as to my ongoing growth. I have purchased several copies as gifts for men & women... they all value them as I do. If you can find any copies purchase them, and turn you commute time, into the part of the day you enjoy the most. Their value is beyond measure.

Tons of great ideas, easy and fast. Many of these recipes are now staples in my diet.Highly suggest this cookbook, great price for great information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got me started on vegetarian cooking","review":"I got this book when I started college - at the time, I only had access to a communal dorm kitchen and barely knew how to boil water. 10 years of vegetarian cooking later, I've mostly grown beyond it, but there are some great basic-yet-interesting recipes in here. It really helped me grow as a cook precisely because the recipes are so basic - once I got the hang of preparing the dishes according to the recipes, I started to think about ingredients or spices I could add to improve the flavors. If you don't have an intuition for that sort of thing and aren't interested in developing one, I'd recommendQuick Vegetarian Pleasures: More than 175 Fast, Delicious, and Healthy Meatless Recipesinstead - the recipes have a few more ingredients, but tend to need less tinkering. But if you're looking for really simple dishes that you can make in even the most limited kitchen conditions, you can't beat \\"Student's Vegetarian Cookbook.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I love this lil' book! It's got loads of really great and fairly simple and inexpensive recipes! Super great for students (and anyone) who loves delicious vegetarian food on a budget :)The only small downside of this cookbook is the lack of photos. Sometimes photos make dishes appeal to me more than if there's no photo included and I have to imagine what it'd look like! But seriously it's no big deal! As a whole, this book is really really great for just about anybody looking to expand their vegetarian culinary pursuits!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, delicious recipes to please any vegetarian palate.","review":"The recipes in Student's Vegetarian Cookbook are designed for people with not much money and even less time. The recipes use easily obtained fresh and prepared ingredients and each recipe gives preparation and cooking times. The book includes a nice blend of vegan and non-vegan dishes as well as pointers on products and preparation for the beginning vegetarian. Great breakfast ideas, salads and bean dishes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what it's meant to be","review":"This was one of my first cook books that my parents gave me several years ago when I was in college and in my first apartment. The recipes are wonderfully simple to follow, and usually very inexpensive. It even allows the novice cook to venture into more unique foods.It is true that many of the recipes lack much seasoning or flavor, but this also allows the cook to experiment a little at a time with seasoning, which is what I did. (A little garlic can go a long way!!!) I also have so many vegetarian cookbooks that break the bank with one recipe when lots of expensive spices or unique ingredients are called for. This helped me a great deal in learning how to cook, and I still use many of the recipes in here. I love the falafel recipe, and I use it often for groups of friends, who give it rave reviews.You just can't beat the simplicity of these recipes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cookbook, Easy and Cheap","review":"I purchased this cookbook but I am not a student. The title appealed to me - Quick, Easy, and Cheap. Many of the recipes in the book are very similar to things I cook already, things I just \\"throw together\\" and call my own. This book helps me with new ideas for my meals. I appreciate the ease of the recipes, and how they are written. I am not \\"Suzy homemaker\\" so I absolutely hate recipes and recipe books, most of them just make me roll my eyes and tear my hair out.

I haven't tried any of the recipes yet, just flipped through the pages. Looks like some good stuff in there. But I still recommend Starving Students' over this one--only reason why it has four stars, instead of five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not that great...","review":"I bought this book in October - it is now February and I have yet to make anything out of this cookbook. I love vegetarian cookbooks and was looking for something quick and easy, but nothing in this book sounded that appetizing or that filling to me (I am not a picky eater by the way). I'm sure there are other vegetarian cookbooks out there that are way better. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the only vegetarian in the house!","review":"I got away from my vegetarian diet about five years ago... major move, lots of stress. I tried to start back up a few times, but all the cookbooks I had or could find had recipes that were too time consuming to pull off and still feed the other non-vegetarian members of the household. This book has delicious recipes that take minimal time to prepare and have relatively few ingredients. A great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, especially for new Vegetarians","review":"My mom bought me the original book several years ago when i decided to try vegetarianism. I used the book often not only taking recipes as written but I also used them as a basis for experimenting with adding and removing ingredients. The book was lost in a recent move and I missed it so much I purchased this edition as a replacement. All is right with the world again.The recipes are often fairly basic but you will learn some great techniques you can easily build upon to create your own recipes. It is also very budget friendly. Some of my absolute favorites are in the Soup and Stews section. Especially the Lentil Soup and the Moroccan Stew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serve up a whole kitchen of no fuss feasts.","review":"When I moved into my first apartment, I was excited about cooking for myself.

This book contains both excellent recipes and tips and techniques that make cooking easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased, from a new vegetarian","review":"I am a new vegetarian and have never been fond of cooking. I was a bit scared of getting into the vegetarian world with not knowing what to eat and not wanting to cook anything. So, I chose this book because it has recipes that have quick prep time and most recipes are for 1 or 2 servings. This is perfect for a person that lives by themselves, and you can always double the recipe for extra leftovers or for when you have friends over.I'm not a student, just kitchen-inept. I enjoy that I am not overwhelmed by the recipes in this book and due to a fast pace life style, I actually find the time to cook these meals!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Nasty","review":"When I looked at this book in the bookstore I just looked at the titles of the recipes, all of which sounded really good. For example the Pad Thia and Pasta with Greens. The sauce for the Pad Thia was disgusting, it contained ketchup, soy sauce, and sugar to name a few items. Not at all authentic or palatable. The pasta with greens sounded good but it calls for a creamy sauce made from cottage cheese, tossed with pasta and kale. I think the goal of this book was to create recipes that included easy to find and inexpensive items, but the result was not a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple but lack flavor","review":"I tried four or five of the recipes in the book and although they were simple to prepare, they, in general, lacked flavor.The falafel turned out quite mushy and devoid of flavor.The barley mushroom soup took some time to prepare and did not have a lot of flavor. It needed a lot of salt and pepper to be mildly enjoyable.The White Bean Jumble was just OK.Anyways, I just kinda gave up. I am not a professional cook but I do cook 5 meals a week.If you want a much better book try \\"125 best Vegetarian Slow Cooker recipes\\", now those flavors rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic cookbook for beginners","review":"I read only positive reviews of this before buying it and wish I had read some negative ones too which had dissuaded me from buying it so I wouldn't have wasted $9 on it. This is a very, very basic cookbook and is definitely not for the home cook with any experience at all. For example, it has a recipe for pita pizza crust (oil and bake) and banana and pineapple yogurt (combine fruit with pre-made yogurt). I would say this would be a great child's cookbook - and maybe that's the \\"student\\" part. I assumed student meant inexpensive, didn't realize it was for students in elementary school."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I only found 1 or 2 recipes that looked good, most of the recipes look like they would be tasteless and not filling.

I was expecting more variety.There is like 10 recipes for coffee??"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Coroner\\"","review":"To say that this movie is the worst I have ever seen would be overrating it.

I have never seen such low budget movie that is regrettably trash. Like the other viewer said \\"Total Trash\\". I regret buying this movie coz the acting is bad and the way it was presented was really awful. For eg. the part where the lady broke into the house n wants to blow up the wall and the bomb exploded, the wall didnt budge and Longnecker (wat a name) has to move forward just to see that the wall has not ben demolish and she has to move infront of the killer just to get a close look and purposely wait for the killer to strike her on the head, really dumb.

There were moments in this movie that made me laugh (eg: the tennis balls getting thrown at the killer or the boyfriend who is completely clueless) However, there are better horror movies that could meet the needs of those who seek those cheesy horror movies:Try- Slumberparty Massacre, The Granny, Cabin Fever"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear God... and to think that this movie was to be seen?","review":"I saw this movie when I went with my roommate to visit a couple of his friends at another college... Thank God it was a rented movie! This was the worst movie I have ever seen, being even worse than Cliffhanger (which was, needless to say, at least *funny* in its own badly made way). This movie has terrible acting, a stupid plot, is boring, and instead of being scary, it's just downright disturbing at certain moments of torture (i.e. when the wacko bad guy-figure cuts the girl's finger off... now that was just gross, but not scary). I cannot tell anyone how many times I was falling asleep in this movie. Total trash. And what's more, who would want to spend the $50 for it that it costs at amazon.com? I'd not even waste a penny on this movie. Do yourself a favor, people, and forget you ever heard of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's official, this is the worst film I've ever seen","review":"I got this film, as I love horror flicks. I was never so disappointed in my life! There's absolutely no continuity in it, it jumps randomly and without warning. The script is terrible, the acting was horrid, and it left me lost and confused and very irritated. I think they made this as an excuse to show some really badly done quasi-sex scenes, it was just the worst. Jane Longenecker looked embarassed to be in it, poor thing.Still need to satisfy your longing to see a movie along the lines of a creepy Coroner? Try the film Phantasm instead.

I used it the first time to roast some veggies at 450 and it warped. It did pop back to regular shape but the next time I put it in the oven (only 350 this time) it warped again! I can send the pan to calphalon- but by the time I pay for shipping I might as well put that money towards a better pan. I'm looking now at the Chicago Metallic jelly roll pan- it is rated for 550 versus 450. I am very dissapointed.

Looks like the manifest of a scientific church (of course to practice correctly and teach you must belong to the \\"church\\" or you get lost from the correct pat). Anyway,IN MY OPINION, if you are looking for something (very easy, without any effort, absolutely not demanding) that will keep you in a temporary and false \\"state of grace\\" like whatever synthetic commercial new age practice with an nice Oriental flavor, this is the book for you.If on the contrary you are really looking for knowing Qi Gong,well there are a lot of serious and exaustive Books to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send me money now for my Secret Qigong !","review":"This is a pretty awful book for any person who either casually or seriously wants to persue fitness, health or even the spiritual aspects of Taiji or Qigong. I'ts the best example of \\"snake oil\\" I have seen in a long time. There are other examples of course. The more people become aware of Qigong, the more the \\"Do-it-yourself Masters\\" get out there and publish their \\"Own Family Secret Qigong\\". Maybe I should do that too. No prior knowledge of Taiji or Qigong required. This book is a good example of this and is a complete waste of time following the practice and spending the money. Yoga, Pilates, Taiji will do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A short but wonderful book","review":"A short novel, 172 pages in the old mass market paperback version, but packed with more ideas and originality than some novels twice its length.The main character is Parl Dro, a \\"Ghost Killer\\", one who can see and banish the dead from the mortal realm. He travels from town to town until he runs afoul of two sisters, one living, one dead, and a local musician in love with the living sister.The book is quickly read, and can be finished in a spare afternoon or a day at the beach. The author doesn't bog down on details, or spend entire pages on a room's description unless needed. Though some of the starting background may seem a bit generic, the ending is highly original and unexpected, with several twists in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you AMAZON.COM!","review":"All I can say about these books is WOW. I remember reading them when I was 5 and 6(yes believe it or not I could read that well at that age) and loving to fall asleep with them so I could dream of unicorns and other creatures. Reading has been my passion my whole life and I have read more books than anyone I know. These take the cake. They are wonderful for the imagination with their beautiful illustrations. They are also wonderful for the soul with their morals and characters that touch you and make you feel you are a part of their world for a little while. I had a very difficult time finding these books until I found Amazon.com. So I send out a resounding \\"Thank you amazon.com!!!\\" Buy these books....you will not be dissapointed and your children will thank you. Now and forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book!","review":"I loved Cosgrove's books as a little girl- I had most of them in the early 70's.

I would really like to see a complete set availiable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It all begins here","review":"I believe this is the pilot book in the series, and is certainly one of the most classic. Serendipity is in all likelihood a magical elasmosaurus who, after meeting a very special dolphin and walrus, is assigned the most noble task of all...guarding the great seas.This wonderful book has gorgeous illustrations and I remember back as a child wishing I had it. Now, I finally have it thanks to Amazon (...) I read it and I don't regret that I did. Next to my all time favorites, those starring Squeakers the squirrel, this has become a fave, too. Actually, I think I love them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondeful books","review":"I bought fours books of the series thinking mostly on my daughter, I thought my really boy 6y son (who likes Ricki Ricotta kind of books) wouldnt want to read them.

This book makes it seem like he doesn't remember all too much from the glory days, just bits and pieces here and there. There's little continuity in the book, and you get no idea as to how ELP created what they did.Looks like a quick cash-in to me, avoid the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"First, I am a huge ELP/Keith Emerson fan. I've been looking forward to this book for years. In the mean time, I've read some outstanding books on Keith and ELP by Martyn Hanson, Hang on to a Dream: The Story of the Nice; and George Forrester, Emerson, Lake and Palmer : The Show That Never Ends. Then I got Keith's book. Rather disappointing. Not well written at all. I guess Keith felt he needed to put out a \\"tell all\\" type book full of drugs stories, alchohol and sex stories. My image of him as a person has been tarnished, but he is still a great musician and composer. Unfortunatly, the book was put out in haste, the pacing is poor, the style inconsistant. His childhood days are interesting and a couple of funny stories, but that's all. Stick to music Keith; how about a CD set on rare, underground or retrospective music? Get the other two books I mentioned in this review, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"the opposite of ELP","review":"As a teenager, I had been entranced and excited by Keith Emerson's music. As a forty-something - a keyboard player and still a fan of his music - I was disappointed by this book. As other reviewers have said, there is scant coverage of the creative process. Sadly, KE seems to think that the reader will be more interested in what are now banal and commonplace anecdotes about drugs, sex and private aeroplane piloting than about what made his music so special. He might have got away with it if he could write well, but he can't. A big disappointment - for complete-ists only."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy read","review":"Unlike some 'rock star' autobiographies this one may actually be written by the man in the photo on the front cover. If so he's done a fine job as this is an easy and entertaining read.The book starts in 1993 when Keith Emerson had to have surgery on his right-hand, and then goes back to the 1940's when he was born. All the expected topics are covered music, drugs, personal life etc and you can tell from the writing that he regrets some of the excesses at the height of his fame.There are some great musical stories in this book. My two favourites are his meeting with Rick Wakeman (who he considered to be his main competitor as best keyboard player in the 70's), and a whole chapter is devoted to his appearance on Oscar Petersons show in 1975.The 1980's to date are covered pretty briefly, which is a shame, but it doesn't detract from what is overall a fine book."},{"rating":"1","title":"monster round table","review":"If you are anxious to see a Japanese monster movie about Rodan, Godzilla and Mothra having a round table discussion about whether to unite and save the world from Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, this is your film. Director Ishiro Honda delivers just that.If, though, you want to see Honda's GREATEST film and one of the most horrifying and unsettling films of the sixties you should skip the above and check out Mantango. There are no monsters here over six feet tall, Tokyo is not threatened, no buildings are crushed, no tin tanks are destroyed, no thousands of people flee in terror, there is no radioactive breath anywhere and the Japanese army is nowhere in sight.I guess this world is big enough for both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghidorah","review":"The Movie was pretty good.

Still, for the collector, it is the introduction of Godzilla's main foe for the rest of the series of movies right up till final wars, so I would still say it belongs in a collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wait is over...","review":"The wait is over. Classic Media is releasing their 4th and 5th Godzilla DVD's. The last three were amazing and these new ones are gonna be great, too. Keep up the good work all at Classic Media! ;o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four great monsters and Akiko!!","review":"If you like your monsters bruising it up, this is your flick. The battle between Godzilla and Rodan is one of the best ever. VERY dirty pool by Rodan!This great flick also features Akiko Wakabayashi. Some may recognize her from \\"You Only Live Twice\\" or \\"What's up Tiger Lilly?\\". She a fine actress and a real beauty.Go ahead and get \\"Invasion of Astro-Monster\\" (aka \\"Monster Zero\\") at the same time. It's the best pure sequel of any of the 60's G-Flicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"Even if your a casual Monster movie fan, this is among the best you will find. The Masterwork packaging is great ad the remastered prints bring Honda's creations to life. For a classic it is also a bargain not to be passed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy Monster Lover","review":"I love the old monster movies from back in the day.

(Um, who the hell is Dick Clark, anyway?) IDG tries to get you to buy their books by putting esoteric material in layman's terms, along with a liberal sprinkling of jokes. Some of their books are funny and well-written, this one is not. I do not recomend this book. It hasn't helped. I could have spent the money on another golf lesson. I am still reading through it, but it is slow going and painful. I can't afford another book. Too bad huh? Definitely go on a recommendation instead of buying blind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golf for Dummies","review":"I was totally taken by surprise when I received the book - yes, in hardcover - that was no larger than my palm.

I buy a How To book on the assumption I will actually learn something. The up side was that I spent less than $10 for it and it did come with a nifty little golf tool that was some consulation.

I bought it soon after taking up golf again after 30 years, but had I looked at it in a bookstore, would have bought the Idiot's Guide instead. This book really didn't give me any valuable info for picking up the game again, and was liberally sprinkled with McCord's smart-aleck cracks, which really put me off. I just don't like the guy, even on TV infomercials. He needs to get a real job, like the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Golf Introduction","review":"The fourth edition of Gary McCord's Golf for Dummies retains the best features of the previous editions and adds a few improvements. There are a lot of golf books available for the beginning golfer but none are as thorough, enjoyable, and helpful as this one.This book walks you through all the basics, beginning long before you first walk out onto a golf course or take a golf club into your hands. His advice is specific, good, and told in a straightforward way. There are enough photographs to illustrate key points and provide a useful model. And his one-page description of what everyone should do to achieve good performance in anything they do is worth the price of the whole book!Best of all, there's McCord himself. The book is sprinkled with intelligent, amusing, and instructive stories that make it a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny stuff","review":"It's more valuable for the funny stories than it is for the golf tips. For absolute beginners it might have more value. Still, it's a funny book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good place to start learning about golf","review":"This was the first book I turned to myself when I took up golf... around a dozen years or so ago. I've generally found the Dummies books a good place to start when learning the basics in any area. Sadly this one is an exception. It is really not a good introduction to the game of golf. There are many, many golf instruction books out there, and most of them are superior to this one. If you want to stay in the Dummies type area, the KISS (Keep It Simple Series) Guide to Playing Golf by Steve Duno is a vastly superior alternative - it's basically everything this Dummies book should have been and isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golf For Dummies - 4th Edition","review":"I thought this would be a good book to pick up after a decade away from the game (and it showed). I found the book to be laid out in an easy to follow manner that could be read cover to cover or just by applicable section if there were specific areas that needed work. This book was as valuable to me as the lessons I took 20 years ago, whether it was reminders of things I had forgot, or corrections to bad habits I had developed.The instructions are informative, entertaining and easy to follow for hackers like me or those new to the game. The author also provides his views on courses, golfers and on-air and on-line golf related media. I wouldn't use it to replace real in-person lessons, but I think it definitely has value for most recreational golfers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for a beginning golfer!","review":"This is a great book for a beginner or someone not sure if they want to start playing golf. The book gives a brief overview of golf history, an explanation of golf equipment, and lessons on how to build a golf swing, and some tips on how to play the game. Although Gary McCord peppers this book with some corny jokes, his knowledge and enthusiasm for the game make the book a great overview for a beginner.I just recently started playing golf and the book gave me a quick and entertaining overview of the game. Although the lessons to build your swing are well written and informative, I would recommend looking for books devoted to teaching the golf swing, watching videos, or taking lessons from golf pro if you are serious. The instruction in the book is inadequate as a sole source of information for learning how to correctly swing a golf club. Get this book as an introduction, but find something else to learn a great swing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought I was ordering the real book not the miniature.","review":"what a ripoff. the \\"miniature version\\" is stashed in the details, not placed in the title. the reviews are for the full version. and now i feel like \\"amazon shopping for dummies\\". i have absolutely no use for a 2\\"x2\\" book on anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"I was expecting a book with good helpful tips for learning how to play this game. I tired of reading about all the tournaments the author had been in or who he knew in the golf world. Half the book was wasted on golf information that have no place in an instructional manual. Some factoids were interesting, most were trivia. A big disappointment--I would not recommend it to the beginning golfer. Most of the book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff By Smokey Mountain Books - Tennessee","review":"Okay, I have been sucker as many of you have been, or will be. I thought I was ordering the regular book, at least the information made you think it was the normal quality book.

If I were you I would shop elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much non-essential fillers","review":"I agree with the reader from Rockford. I was, too, disappointed with this book, because it is filled with non-essential information about players and tours, about which I care nothing since I am more eager to learn how to play as well as how to ask the right questions. The basic instructions are good, but the photos are a little difficult to decipher. On the other hand, the writing is lucid.A better beginner's guide, IMHO, is \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Golf.\\" I learned more from it than from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golf For Dummies","review":"Good Little book.

What I got was a joke. The booklet is a complete waste of time. For example, the advice on grip says to hold the club in the left hand and then place right hand above it. Are you kidding? I like Gary McCord as a commentator and the Dummies books are usually alright, but this was a waste of money. As for the seven-in-one tool, buy a regular divot tool and throw this piece of garbage away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Look carefully before you buy this book. I thought I was getting a regular dummies book....you know one that is a regular book size and has more than 100 pages. I just looked at the name and the picture and with my knowledge of the \\"Dummies\\" series, I purchased this.I found this product worthless. This is a book that fits in your palm and is only 32 pages long. There's very little info on each page. The divot tool that comes with the book sells for $5.99 at Dicks. So, that tells you how much is really being spent on the book.Be careful and buy the real book and not the small pocket book. I notice that both are listed with the same titles on this web site."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes you want to \\"Just do it\\"!","review":"The only reason I would not give this book a 10 is I have not read all the golf books there are. Gary McCord suggests some other books that I will read in the future. In this book you gain a real desire to take up golf and learn to play correctly. Gary McCord makes you feel that with some work even you can have a good game of golf. You get to feel some of Gary's comical personality in this book. This is definately not a dry technical manual. And not only is it a very good learning tool, you will also find it very entertaining. When you start reading the book it will become very hard to put it down. I highly suggest this as a first book for beginning golfers as Gary has successfully taken the mystery out of golf. - John Holm - \\"A beginning golfer by my own admission.&quot"},{"rating":"1","title":"MINI VERSION","review":"The hardcover version is the mini version.

After 2 years it stoped playing all music CDs. Both mp3 and original audio CDs. Couple of months after that, it stopped playing 50% of blockbuster DVDs. I have a 5 year old $75 samsung player, that still plays great all kind of stuff. I don't think it's just the problem with this one panasonic system. It's all of Panasonic.

The usual educational exposition is a much smoother fit, though it still impedes the story's progress at times, and the dialogue doesn't fully define the older characters' personalities, but the new arrivals bring welcome changes on all fronts and show how far the author has come since the beginning of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cemetery Walk: Journey into the Art, History and Society of the Cemetery and Beyond","review":"For all those who enjoy walking through cemeteries taking in the quiet and the art around us, this is definitely the book for you.

The totally useless 100-page poorly-commented pre-release Java source code for a DOM-implementation in chapter 10 is a particularily good example of this.Another horrible chapter is chapter 11, which contains an explataion of user interface interaction that is so overly abstract but still so extremely stupid that I've used that particular chapter as an example of how a really useless book should be written.Also, early in the book the author explains that the book is amed towards rpogrammers. It's interesting to see that they hardly ever back their examples up with and source code at all.In short.

Further, I prefer to use my Creative Stone Plus to store my music, rather than a multitude of CDs.Enter the Creative 250 portable speaker. I can have my elementary school bands play along with the recordings...something they couldn't do with a typical boombox (volume couldn't compete).I had my reservations, but ordered 3 systems online (one for two different schools, and one for home) and figured it was worth the gamble for the price.Overall, I am immensely pleased with this purchase.Now, for some ideas for improvement...1. The line in cord SHOULD be longer. Yes, you can buy one on your own, but I don't see the purpose for such a short cord (other than cost-cutting).2. Have a digital volume readout.3.

Unlike some other small speakers, at least you know there IS bass on the recording. A very good deal and acceptable/decent sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Value for money? I think not.","review":"They look nice, but that is about all I can positively say. Once you turn up the volume they distort wildly.

I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money,,, I expected MUCH more for $40","review":"I love the looks of this speaker system... but then the fun ends. The audio-in cord is about 8 inches long, which doesn't give you much placement option; the unit is freestanding only, and I had to keep grabbing it while traveling to keep it near the computer; and worse of all, any volume greater than my original pc speakers caused severe distortion... like the speakers were busted already. I listen to a lot of talk, as well as music, which fared no better. I cringed at the sound from these speakers for about 6 hours on a road trip before promptly returning them for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for iPods","review":"I bought this item pretty much for my iPod, as the other reviewer said it does come with a short cord but hey buy a longer one which costs $2 at radio shack. one thing I don't like is that it doesn't come with an AC adaptor.So far the sound quality is pretty good for a little speaker system, theres a subwoofer which is sold seperately so when you do turn up the volume it does get distorted a bit.To me it's great for hotel rooms etc. when traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for an MP3 player","review":"I am only using this speaker with my MP3 player, usually at work. It works really well for playing music at my desk. I don't know how long the batteries will last (no AC power adaptor included). I am still using the batteries that it came with and they have not died yet after about 2 weeks of use at the office. I don't know how much use you will get with 4 AAA batteries, but I guess you can always plug it in if you have an adaptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Touching","review":"Another dated classic.

By including so many topics, the reader actually learns very little. Even a child doing a class paper on a subject in this book would have to draw upon other resources. The book is best suited for people who have little or no knowledge of deserts. Unfortunately, that means kids. But most kids would never pick this book up since there isn't one colored photograph in the book. Even the black and white photos are not the greatest quality. For its size and price, the book was a disappointment.

The reader is captivated by the main character's jorney in facing a series of challenges, and, just as in life, David is sometimes successful and sometimes fails. The reader is surprised by the challenges and alway kept in suspense wondering how David's challenges will next be met.

This includes carrots, celery, kale, other leafy veggies, onions, cauliflower, brocoli & stems, etc. Nevertheless, I have a 20-year old General Electric blender that still does it OK.

I make smoothies, blend pesto sauce, and puree cooked vegetable and blackbean soups. Any blender should be able to easily handle such tasks.I bought B & D because I like their power tools, but I'll never buy another kitchen appliance from them. This is shoddy engineering using cheap components.When I called to find the location of the nearest B & D repair place, Customer Service told me that there are no parts for this model and that to have it repaired by a small appliance shop would cost more than buying a new one!

I was a bit shocked with all the negative reviews here. I don't pay a lot for blenders and this is the best one I've had for the price.

So stay away from other SENNA products, too. (usually labeled \\"Stimulant Laxative.\\")So what works for me? Lots of the high-fiber foods every day. Plenty of raw fruits (except banana) and vegetables (two raw carrots a day works wonders!) Whole grains every day makes a big difference--I especially like brown rice and oatmeal. Apples are yummy: I eat one every day. Eating beans and legumes is also very helpful. Buy some dried lentils--they cook the fastest--and google some soup recipes.

I was bored out of my gourd. The pace is super slow, the narratives verbose. I will admit, however, that this genre is not my bag. It's like most of the classics I've read...it's very dark and \\"Wuthering Heights\\". So I will concede that the style of writing and storytelling is not my preference. If you're a fan of Taylor Caldwell's writing, then you'll probably like the book. Chances are her other books are similar styles.I would give it NO stars if that were possible.

Dan In Real Life???? Are you serious? Martin Lawrence along with several other African American comedians have always made films like this, they have nothing to do with Romance, and warm family comedy. They are suppose to relate to a certain audience and that is it. If you expect too much from an actor, or a trailer....... You will be dissapointed every time. I agree Martin has lost his edge a bit, but he has been doing it for a long time now, and I believe he will be just fine in years to come. If you are a Martin fan, buy the movie, if not do not buy it, it is not going to appeal to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"rosco","review":"very funny couldnt stop laughing the entire time. the characters were funny and exciting to watch. the writing was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD","review":"The DVD I purchesed skips or stops in the middle but continues after stoping and doing a go to screen jump didnt reply to the seller. purchesed several DVDs from diffrent companys so was unshure who the purchase was from and I was out of town when I watched it the first time. havent taken the time to figure out or reply to the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I usually enjoy Martin and Mo'nique , but even these super talented performers couldn't save this snoozer.

I have tried about twelve different ones so far, and all were absolutely delicious, especially the Tuna Masala and the Spinach Kootu.

True to billing on sites like Amazon, the battery lost all its storage capacity in a matter of months (at a fairly low usage rate). Now, 18 months or so after purchase, the unit is dead. It'll turn on, but it simply won't record. I've updated the firmware, I'm using legit storage -- it's simply busted.

I have a lot issues with the mechanics in the plot, like when the kid has to bury his father... he just lets the old man to go off by himself to do it. This might seem like something arbitrary, but from a Vietnamese cultural perspective, the burial of your father pretty darn important. The main character should have at least followed or helped, instead of sitting around the house doing nothing. The fact that he entrusted a complete stranger to bury his father is absurd to me. Also, there's no way the old man could have pushed the corpse overboard along with all the weights, without tipping over the canoe.The film is more concerned about throwing out rhetoric and ideals of aesthetics than telling a coherent story. I find this to be true with other Vietnamese American films like 3 Seasons (Ba Mua) and First Morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"with only 2 garlic cloves, it's hardly worth it. the directions say to do a lot of cloves. defeats the purpose of buying it. how often do you do a whole head of garlic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"Sure, it cuts things, but the blades don't have enough force behind them that it cuts into them and drags them around.

Perhaps this is because I did not expect too much. Nevertheless, I was still underwhelmed. Ellis has talent as reflected through his use of language and his expertly crafted characterizations. What he lacks, however, is an ability to develop new and original ways of using these characters to tell a story that has a point. Also, what of these people in this time and age? Did they learn anything? Are they even alive? He doesn't really make me care."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really didn't like this book . . .","review":"I really think Ellis is over rated. His fixation on cruelty and pain is just disturbing. I think many readers think that just because a book disturbs them, it must be good literature. This isn't right. With 'American Psycho,' Ellis created a character and there was a message to his maddness. Although I hated liking it, I liked it none the less. But The Informers says absolutely nothing and often made me feel just plain sick. Reading a lot of Ellis's work is like watching a talented artist paint something ugly. Well, this book is just ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellis phoned in this effort","review":"As I read \\"The Informers\\", I thought I had mistakenly picked up a really bad copy of a \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\" script.

The book was recommended on NPR as good vacation reading. The characters did nothing, said nothing, and did not interact. All they did was take Valium and Librium because they were so bored. The author did not convince me that their nihilistic lives were interesting enough to waste any more of my vacation time on their boring lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT!","review":"This is by far one of the worst books I have ever read. Could not even finish it, something I rarely do! It is so confusing with the storyteller constantly changing. By the time you figure out who is telling the story, it changes. Makes no sense, awful, just awful. And the book cover says \\"Now a Hollywood Hit Movie\\", huh??? Never even heard of it so my guess it was never realeased or just flopped at the theater. A total, complete waste of time, just painful to read, so I had to finally stop after about 1/2 way through. If I could give this book zero stars I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well . . .","review":"This is the most I've ever been disappointed after reading a novel. Ellis is a great writer, but this collection of stories is terrible. I think I remember reading somewhere that he wrote this in high school; which is pretty impressive, but it's lacking in entertainment value and nothing seems to happen in any of the stories. These are good character sketches as another reviewer has mentioned and could probably be turned into interesting novels if Ellis chose to build on them, but he doesn't and they get boring halfway through. If you're a hardcore Ellis fan you might want to pick this up for the sake of having a complete collection, otherwise you should skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"In a nutshell, I just didn't get it. I found it boring and pointless. It's been a few years since I read it so I don't remember the details; I just remember being very disappointed since I liked Less than Zero and The Rules of Attraction. I think Rules holds up better over time as I've re-read them both. I still find it funny. Zero, while it had an impact on me at the time (early 20's in college) seems sort of pointless when re-read in my 30's. Maybe that's the point. It speaks only to a particular segment of our population. I hated American Psycho on the first read. Liked it a little better the second time because I new what passeges to skip (long, detailed explanations of clothing, stereo equipment and Huey Lewis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellis encapsulates his theme in the proper space this time.","review":"Ellis redoes this theme over and over but in this collection of connected short stories he catches his morally and spiritually bankrupt vision of society in the best package to date. For once the voices vary slightly and Ellis opens up so many passageways for the mind to go which keeps pages turning. Some parts are overdone and the whole violence scheme is worked in but this is Ellis' best work to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted talent","review":"That is the sad thing, because he is a talented writer, but this novel says nothing. Some of the quotes on the back of the book truly amaze me. To say that this is an \\"important book\\" or to compare him to truly great writers like Fitzgerald is simply ludicrous. He has not earned that comparison yet. He has potential, but he needs to really work hard and write something worth reading, not this sad, empty, self-pitying, and egoistic [stuff]. Hey, Bret, here's an idea....write a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for novels about vampires in L.A.","review":"Try Todd Grimson's \\"Stainless\\".

(or hell)","review":"I found this book while searching for something to read on an upcoming flight to Key West. I ended up reading it two days before the day of my departure. Some of Ellis's \\"effects\\" are a bit affected and arch, but the novel was a terrific read. I could see it as a sort of bent Robert Altman movie, maybe. Plot points appear to be lifted from California-decadence movies like \\"Shampoo,\\" \\"The Lost Boys,\\" and even Altman's \\"Short Cuts\\" (not to mention other books by Ellis). Episodic, occasionally insightful, rarely brilliant, but good for a satisfying chill."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Ellis makes A perfect Book!","review":"Well this is just a great book! After read all the other book this is a complete book. It has the violence and the sex and then the same atmosphere as in the others. The small stories makes it even funnier to read and then there is a small connection between them. Well READ THIS BOOK!! This is the one that suits me perfect"},{"rating":"1","title":"Going through his hoops","review":"The Informers is a novel composing of fragmentary stories mixing up characters who are distinguished only by their conformity. They are all rich, all tan, all psychically rootless and morally deracinated, and all dysfunctional. They go through life as beneficiaries of capitalism, with no apparent purpose other than to enjoy pleasure in capsule form, take drugs, drink and discuss and 'enjoy' their material wealth. Ellis has done this theme before in his early 20s novels. Reading it is rather like the sensation when you are hungover or exhausted - you are successfully numbed into a world which is not entirely unpleasant, but you can't do anything constructive.American Psycho, which preceeded this work, was a masterpiece - justly one of the top novels anywhere of the past 20 years. But this novel lacks the arrowing Celine style satirical bite and bats forward cliches of the mindless super rich in capsule form."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lesser Ellis novel","review":"As a huge fan of Bret Easton Ellis' \\"American Psycho,\\" \\"The Informers\\" struck me as underwhelming. Viewed as a series of short stories, the book moves fast, intrigues, and works reasonably well. As a novel, however, Ellis has trouble weaving his characters from one story to the next (i.e. the narrator of one story might be a minor character in another, or only mentioned in passing). And, although it's part of his point in portraying the early-'80s L.A.-set milieu, all of the characters seem so shallow that they don't really grow identities; they all basically blend in with one another.I am, however, very much looking forward to the upcoming film adaptation. This is one case where the various stories might work better in cinematic terms, interlacing the characters in an Altmanesque fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is his worst by far","review":"this book is so pointless, so stupid, so vapid, that it defies one's spending money on it. I love Bret Ellis, but this is an insult, obviously a bunch of cutout narrative packaged together and called a \\"novel.\\" It's not a novel. It's nothing. Save yourself the trouble read Less Than Zero or Rules Of Attraction and then stop while you're ahead"},{"rating":"1","title":"A triumph of style over substance.","review":"This book is good in the same way \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" by Tom Wolfe is. Both were beautifully written in a microscopic sense, i.e. if you only looked at a paragraph, the author's ability to string words together is stunning. Both were somewhat confusing because of the scope of the subject they attempted to cover (Wolfe the degeneracy of the early 80s New York, Ellis the degeneracy of the early 80s LA). But the importance difference is that Wolfe had something to say about that degeneracy. Mr. Ellis simply had nothing to say in this book, and it showed. I may not be truly qualified to write a review on a book about 1985, as I was in 4th grade at that time. But to be honest, I thought this book was everything Ellis cut out of \\"Less Than Zero\\" plus a silly segment about a vampire. If you want to read good Ellis, read \\"Less Than Zero\\" and stop. Everyhting else is just a rerun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watermarked","review":"Unfortunately the product in question arrived in a state that was unsatisfactory, it had some form of watermark through the top of the pages and also some kind of sticky glue substance in a line down the front of the cover.

I would recommend it to any of Ellis's fans or fans of short stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Trash","review":"This story lacks subject. It doesn't have any kind of meaning. Vampires pop up and make racist jokes and have sex, then kill their sex partners. Guys and girls who are all uniformly rich, drug-addicted, bird-brained, big fans of sunglasses, blond, tanned, gorgeous shuffle around doing nothing, perhaps to portray the meaninglessness of life. The plot is horrible. To be honest, it doesn't seem to really have a plot. It's really more a series of horrible short stories connected only by the chracters that are mentioned. It has sex, drug, money, and nothing more. Throughout the book, none of the characters think about or do anything other than have sex, do drugs, and engage in violent activities. I've never seen a more pretentious, shoddy, and badly written book than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad \\"Less Than Zero\\" outtakes","review":"Obviously written before Ellis' first book, LESS THAN ZERO, these stories have little depth or structure. They're mostly character sketches, and very rough ones at that. One of the worst stories involves a vampire that goes to see a psychiatrist (yes, really), with an ending lifted right from Stephen King's \\"The Boogeyman\\". Stick to Ellis' novels instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rules of Attraction","review":"The most interesting aspect of this book is its narrative structure. It combines multiple stories told in the first person by diverse characters, the events narrated are somehow connected although they don\`t create a cohesive whole. Most of these characters are rich elistist, souless and hedonistic people from L.A. who can\`t relate to those who surround them, living vapid lives in a mind-numbing loneliness. There are some good, intense and entertaining moments here, as well as a couple of repulsive ones. The ending result is uneven and, for the most part, as shallow as the lives of these cardboard characters. Some of this material reminds me of Martin Amis\`s \\"Money\\" or Irvine Welsh\`s \\"Ecstasy\\", however those books are a bit better. Still, this one is worth a look anyway. Mildly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Uninformed","review":"This is just no good. Nothing new in this book. If you've read any of Ellis' other work then you will definitely see the similarities here. If you haven't read any of his other work then do not start with this. Less Than Zero and American Psycho, even The Rules of Attraction(to a lesser extent) are far better examples of Ellis' better work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I lost my time","review":"I've just read this book by Bret Easton Ellis and I wonder how come he's so well considered in the new wave of American literature. It was the first book I've read of him but I don't think I'm gonna get over it. The only thing that was in my mind was the adjective \\"impossible\\" because I did not find any of the stories possible or some kind of reality. Does this world exist somewhere in the world?

If you are into the Zen thing, you will probably find some information in this book to be of value. However, I did notice that when the author took a disliking to an individual, he sometimes misrepresented (purposely, carelessly?) the facts to get his disapproval across. Which then makes me wonder, how much of that which I am not familiar with in American Zen history is the author portraying accurately, both on the positive and the negative side. All in all, a lot of territory is covered here by an informed insider, but it is sometimes colored by the author's personal biases."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vision of truth!","review":"Cincinnati is now and has been in a state of racial hatred from the police department for many years (since the 1800's).

Truth be known, there is no justice in Cincinnati for people who challenge the County's practices of racial profiling and the cover up that soon follows!

Kirk all over again), but when I learned that this book fleshed out young Spock's backstory, I decided to give it a read. I wasn't disappointed. Vulcan's Glory shows a side of Spock that is both plausible and surprising, mainly because it focuses on his very complicated love life. The mystery surrounding the gemstone is almost as interesting as the love story. Christopher Pike still didn't do much to set himself apart from Kirk, but I did enjoy reading about his first mate: Number One, a woman bred to genetic perfection.As for the physical book, I found the font to be of a very generous size, bigger than most paperbacks.

So I'm very sorry I purchased these and I would have been happier with another product for this price.

She does try to point out the shadow side but again the descriptors are vague an they are on the \\"UP\\" New Age side. The Buzz Words she uses for the archetypes could be expanded more and maybe divided into levels like physical, emotion and mental.

It opens up with Face Fate, a fast paced thrasher that will leave you wanting more. Man do they deliver!!!! Bloodlust is next.... It will bring you on a journey through a thrash roller coaster and have the sickest screams you could wish for. The other two songs were off of their debut and don't disappoint.

We were even migrating from an old AT&T Wireless (pre-Cingular account), keeping our existing number, and everything went through with no problems. The one hiccup--the setup instructions that came from Amazon with the phone are only useful to the point of charging the phone and putting in the SIM card. DO NOT use the other instructions; in fact, the customer service number given for AT&T doesn't work!! Instead, look for an email that you'll get from Amazon a few days after your order is confirmed (accepted by AT&T). That email will have the toll free number to call to activate the phone (this process is totally automated, thank goodness).

The length of the 3220 also made it amazingly good at getting into rose bushes, and clipping certain weeds at the stem without kneeling on the ground. These are significantly heavier. I might as well just lug around my bigger loppers. My neighbor is a strong man, but he didn't want the 3225s either, and wouldn't sell his 3220 for a lot more than I paid for the 3225s (drat).

If your a big fan and your missing all those old out of print releases, than this release is for you, but for the occasional fan you problably won't find this release all that great (stick with and purchase some of Douglas's best releases like: Brown Book, But What Ends When The Symbols Shatter, Corn Years and even All Pigs Pigs Must Die for example)."},{"rating":"1","title":"For completist mopheads only *sheepish grin*","review":"The cover shows Douglas beating a hasty retreat from irate fans confronted by yet another stop gap album to line his pockets.

For this reason (as well as for Criterion's patented lack of response to suggestion, in this case to the suggestion that they change the packaging so this doesn't happen) I recommend against buying this or any other of the Criterion Eclipse series.

Many that have heard it say the same thing - it reminds them of the Country Music their parents listened to when they were kids.Just good American Music. Not the bland over-produced mush of present-day Nashville - these boys harken back to the days of their heroes, Buck Owens, Faron Young, Ray Price, etc.Good songs, tight harmonies, solid rythmn, and superb guitar work make this a must-listen. I only hope WVH finds an audience. This music deserves to be heard.Three of the four members of West Valley Highway were formally in The Souvenirs, who's sole release was \\"King of Heartache\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Spooky Surfers\\"","review":"Every band-- surf or other-- needs something that makes them stand out from the crowd. Pollo Del Mar's \\"thing\\" appears to be MOODINESS. There's something spooky in the 10 tracks on this CD that inspires nervousness as much as enjoyment. From \\"Annabelle Lee\\" (named after the Edgar Allen Poe poem) to \\"Apache '99\\" (a cover of the classic song by the British band The Shadows) it's one cool recording after another. A surprise for me was \\"The Saracen Gift\\", based (more-or-less) on \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\". THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA is a perfect \\"soundtrack\\" for swimming underwater-- just after your ship has gone down! For more Pollo Del Mar, also check out REEF MADNESS!, which contains \\"Death Valley Daze\\" (not found here)."},{"rating":"2","title":"sorry they are out of print, but glad you had them used!","review":"This is an utterly charming postcard set from the covers of old sheet music. There is something for everyone here from 'Sierra Sue', to 'they're wearing 'em higher in Hawaii'.

If not, and you come across a set, snatch them up.

I also found that the grids and tables were a good source of what each chapter actually summed up.I would, however, have to credit the authors for doing a thorough job of covering the various aspects of globalization- from patterns of global finance to global trade and markets to military globalization.

Usually what happens if the little circular clip where the metal meets the plastic falls off, then there is nothing left to keep the metal part from bending. I have talked to someone, they are going to replace these pieces for me, but it is just going to keep happening.

It is quite amazing how a band decided to melt so many styles into one cd and yet come up with something so coherent.

It's not normally a movie I'd be interested in (political stuff, 'y know?) but since Miranda Richardson has never let me down in her roles I'd been getting quite pepped up about it. (BTW... Mandy played Dinah Pellarin, Blake's wife)The story starts out with an interesting flashback of two little boys playing in a convertible. Then it flashes to the present where Blake Pellarin is giving a speach so he'll be elected governer. Anyway it goes into a huge political scandel when some pornography pictures are found. The man in them looks just like Blake. Of course it's then used to bribe him etc...There are some great scenes in it, I'll probally understand it better if I watch it again.

It was far and away the best book I've ever read about overcoming the difficulties in trying to achieve a high level of success in athletics. It seems the author really battled some tough opponents in getting to the Olympics. Then he won a gold medal with his partner. It was an inspiring book that I'd recommend to anyone who's trying to do something difficult, whether in athletics or life or wherever the test may lie. I have copied out some of the paragraphs and whenever I'm about to do a particularly tough workout I read them to myself and each time it helps my performance.

He died too soon at age 54 but his song remains - here are 25 original recordings taken from the era of the height of his fame. The sound is wonderful but the singer is at his thrilling best.

They're humorous, humble and very informative, as well as being very talented and versatile musicians. Two of their songs struck me that night so much that I made a note of them on my program: Monterey Sunrise and Steal Away. It's great to be able to have those two songs permanently now. The brief liner notes pertaining to Monterey Sunrise fall short of the meandering, funny story David Kamakahi told about how they wrote that song during a jam session early New Year's Day 1997 after two concerts the evening before. His father awakened him from his hotel room slumber at 2 AM and they jammed until the sun came up. Then, they caught a flight back to Honolulu, totally exhausted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great mix of ki ho'alu","review":"A good mixture of different styles of slack key.

This movie can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a gay comedy, a family drama or a road movie, and so doesn't succeed in being any of these. This is obviously a labor of love on the part of writer/director/actor Lionel Baier who stars as the brother (who also happens to be named Lionel Baier), but it fails to engender much in the way of interest for the audience.Good performances by Baier and Natacha Koutchoumov as the sister, but not much else to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An odd hybrid","review":"I decided to watch \\"Stealth\\" after I had read those two very positive reviews posted on Amazon. And? Yet again I had this feeling that I must have been watching another film than those two men.Even if the main plot is quite interesting, I got bored and tired after first 30 minutes. The director seems to be wishy-washy about the way his film should be like. I am not sure if this is a gay-theme comedy or a drama or a thriller (yep, thanks to the music in some scenes). Btw, once you introduce music in a scene, it should help to build up the atmosphere, to enhance it. In this case we have for example a scene where main character talks to his father (about nothing horrific, plain chit-chat), but the music in the backround could have served well in every thiller.In my opinion is one of the movies that you forget about while watching it. Not totally bad, but not good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leather on bag is nice... rivets/strap NOT","review":"I wanted to help potential customers so I'm taking the time to write a review.The leather on the actual bag is very nice. It's a soft buttery calfskin but I'm a little thrown off by how blindingly shiny it is. It's not a matte look like in the photos.The strap is awful... the shoulder pad on the strap is a small piece of tough leather which hurts your shoulders. The strap band itself is very thin and has a cheap feeling to it.The metal rivets holding the handles together are of cheap hardware.All in all, you're paying for the body of the bag. The stainless steel hardware is cheap so I don't expect it to last very long (though they say it's covered by a life-time warranty). The stitching is pretty good. The strap is what makes this a $200+ bag rather than a $300+.

I LOVE LA LEY!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INVISIBLE is their best yet","review":"As a die-hard fan of this Chilean rock band, I have to say that even four years after the release of their most successful album, INVISIBLE is their trademark, and with good reason. INVISIBLE offers that unique blend of songs sung in Spanish, English and French that range from melancholic ballads to a couple of punkish tracks. Their biggest hit from INVISIBLE has to be \\"Día Cero\\", also my favorite. \\"Día Cero\\" besides making the most of a compelling melody and Beto Cuevas' sultry voice, offers a glimpse into the inner-workings of the band through the lyrics. INVISIBLE is a tribute to Andrés Bobe, the band's original guitarist, who perished in a motorcycle accident months before the release of the album.This album was the one to introduce me, as well as many other of their fans to La Ley's eclectic and passionate style. If you had to have just one of their albums, it should be INVISIBLE. Still, I recommend all of their albums. They are the best ever!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Medium size organizer","review":"This size organizer is not for everybody but I like it because it fits into the cubby in my door in the car and it fits nicely into most handbags.

This post 1994 look is important in that it realizes that the Cuban economy is not going to simply collapse any time soon and that Castro and the rest of the Cuban government figures will likely be around for a while.The book gives equal weight to the history of Cuba and today's Cuba while managing to show that the country is not simply a product of its history. The different anecdotes about moonlighting psychiatrists and frustrated economists bring the points to a more visceral level.The mix of statistics in the form of charts and graphs and real world experience blends together into a readable, cohesive look at the Cuba of today. I definitely recommend this book to whoever wishes to learn a little more about the Cuba of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book if you want to learn how to make the best scented candles around.","review":"I purchased this book thinking that, with it's help, I would be able to make my own awesome scented candles - the ones like the new scented oil candles from Glade.

I came home and had to take ibuprofen and put heating pads on my feet, it took two days for the pain to stop after I just put on my old shoes. The company that shipped it is great, got it here in reasonable time. but the product itself is horrible, most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn, thought they would be comfortable since they are supposed to be orthopedic.

You can remove the insole of the shoes and see what the problem is. The insole is just a piece of rubber with some cloth on it. Under the insole is just the sole of the shoe.

The concepts, although fully comprehended by Elmar, are not really that difficult to grasp and could have been explained in much simplier terms. The diagrams are also muddled (as most 'technical' diagrams are) and should have been reworked prior to publication.

We had an older Graco swing that we used with our first two boys, but his little legs dangle in it and he just didn't seem comfortable. So we bought this one thinking that the cradle design would keep him more comfortable and the AC adaptor would help us save money on batteries.When the motor works, he sleeps great. He seems very comfortable in there. We keep it on the low speeds so that there is just enough motion to relax him. But we've only had this swing for 3 weeks and the motor has worked about 50% of the time. We've tried batteries and the adaptor, and about half the time we can't get any signs of life out of the motor.The music and mobile work great, but they aren't very soothing for a colicky baby so we don't use them.FP needs to work out the kinks in the motor and make the AC adaptor available on all their swings. This one is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"When a swing don't have that swing...","review":"We held off on our swing longer than anything else because a friend of ours had recommended getting one with an AC adaptor so we wouldn't have to replace any batteries. Finally, the rainforest swing became available and we snatched it up. It was cute, the colors were great, and it swung great when there was nothing in it.Then comes little Phoenix. Weighing in at a whopping 10lb 10ozs, he was definitely a little bigger than we had bargained for, but there shouldn't be any problem 'cause this swing holds up to 25lbs. Right? Wrong.The swing never got up to a strong swing and would usually peter out about 10 minutes and barely move. Also, after 2 months of using it for maybe a total of 2 hours, the music/mobile portion stopped working. Fantastic.So, my MIL got us a Graco swing that is rated up to 30lbs and it works like a charm. Plus, it's cheaper than this version. Phoenix sleeps in it, plays with his toys in it, and, most importantly, this swing swings. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was good until...","review":"At first I loved this swing, it had the plug in feature it helped my baby get to sleep. Then one day it just went out, I called FP and they sent a new motor, after which it worked perfectly. Then to my horror and dismay a month later my baby was hanging out of it from the top. This is not one of those mamby pamby stories that we sometimes hear abt where the parent is over protective, it was really scary and if I had not gotten to my baby when I did there could have been some serious injuries.

I like that it is high enough off the ground that my Westie can't walk up and lick my daughter (like she'll do if she's in a Bumbo or laying on her play mat.)

I loved the theme and the fact that it plugged in. I was still happpy with it when she first began to use it. She loved the theme as well and would nap and play in the swing. Unfortunately, we eventually ran into the same problem that others have. The motor is puking. It doesn't swing half of the time. This started happening about 2 months after we began using it.I hope that Fisher Price has corrected this problem (I bought it when it first came out) because if it wasn't for the problems with the motor, I would recommend this swing to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Motor!!!","review":"My husband and I purchased this swing for our daughter because it has an A/C adaptor and doesn't require batteries. We had only had the swing for three weeks and with very limited use, and the gear box in the motor kept messing up. We had to swing the swing manually in order to get it to work. We were able to get a new gear box/motor from Fisher Price, and after two uses it is already doing the same thing! My brother told me that he had the same experience with the swing. I wish I had known BEFORE we purchased it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned.....I guess it was defective?","review":"I was so excited to order this swing. My sister raves about her Ocean Wonders Cradle Swing. I ordered this one instead because it plugged into the wall.When I got it I was very pleased with the colors. It looked so nice and the assembly was pretty quick and easy.However, it would barely swing with the baby in it. Since we already have traditional swing from subsequent children I was really puzzled. The highest swing setting was comparable to the lowest on my other swing. Baby was not happy after being used to faster motion.So I boxed it up and will be returning it tomorrow. So far the return process to amazon has been very smooth and easy. Go Amazon! I choose to get a refund as the replacement would have been the same swing and after reading some of these review it might not have been defective after all. I might have to try out my sisters in person before I decide if I will reorder the Ocean Wonders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright","review":"Our twin boys didnt really like this swing until they were 4 1/2 months old...they would cry and fuss to get out (guessing the colors were too much stimulation for them?).

Overall we are happy with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great item, as long as it works.","review":"Bought this as a Christmas present for my new grandson. Did not work correctly from the beginning - sound effects don't play. Otherwise, he loves it. I would give a much higher rating if everything worked on it; at least 4 stars. Bought the aquarium swing 7 years ago and was very happy with it. Like the fact that you can swing either forward-and-back, or side-to-side. Usually the swing will play different types of noise: music, rain, ocean waves, etc. Very soothing for babies. I would hightly recommend. Just hope you get a good one.

When I was reading the reviews on this swing a lot of people complained about the motor being loud.. I didn't find this at all. I guess it would be if you had nothing on in your house but the swing. Assembly was very easy as well and the motor seemed strong enough to swag my son the entire time he used it. We also used it for my daughter who was born two years after my son.I always recommend this swing to friends and family who are having babies. The plug in option is also great! Batteries are just too pricey and they don't last very long... even the rechargeable ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motor seems to work fine for us","review":"My son was 5lbs 9 oz when we brought him home from the hospital. I initially didn't like the swing because I thought it was too powerful for him to swing in. It still seems pretty powerful at almost 8 pounds and 6 weeks old. But both him are enjoying it now.My only complaints are that when it starts up, it makes this really annoying sound until it gets going, which isn't long.

This swing in no exception.Despite the cheap materials (plastic and polyester) we expected the motor to work.I tried the swing with an 8 pound weight and it worked weakly. Ahen with a 16 pound weight and the swing barely budged.I phoned Fisher Price. They told me if the product is in warranty, they can send a motor. If not, I will have to pay $50 for one.I have combed through so many swing reviews on Amazon. Crappy motors are very typical of Fisher Price. Some people have gone through 3 or 4 motors in a year.How many of these throwaways end up in landfills every year? Makes me think they make these lousy on purpose. So you can never actually use a swing with more than one kid.This swing is crap and it is going back.Mamaroo here we come...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally one with a plug-in option!!!","review":"I am so glad we have this swing as opposed to any other swing on the market, because we have used it every day for two months, and have yet to put in batteries! It is the only one we found that you can plug in. My baby loves it and it is not noisy at all. I do wish the mobile had some lights or something like the Aquarium version had, but she still enjoys looking at the animals on the mobile anyway. I would recommend it to anyone that plans on using it more than just rarely."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step back in cradle swings","review":"We bought this a while ago and it is the second baby swing we've bought and we no longer use it because it's not as good as the Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing (a previous generation Fisher-Price swing) which was our first swing (the motor died) and current swing (we found another one used). This swing seems to have all the right features on paper but when it comes to real world use our baby naps longer and keeps herself entertained longer in the Ocean Wonders swing than when she is in the Rainforest swing. I really hope Fisher Price brings back the mechanics of the older swing with the features of this swing (read: power plug) by the time we have another child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow!","review":"We purchased this swing because of the plug-in feature (we were spending so much money on batteries for our Graco swing).

Too bad Graco doesn't make one that plugs in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!","review":"I bought this swing for my two-week old nephew. He loves it, as long as he is snuggled in there (head thing and a rolled-up blanket on each side). He's even started looking at the mobile. The best thing is that it plugs in. The glitch is that the music turns on by itself, but when muted, that's not a problem. It's easy to switch it from side-to-side to front-to-back. The side-to-side is a perfect speed and not too forceful, as the aquarium is rumored to be.

I found them often to be difficult to decipher, and it made the whole story totally unbelievable.

Specifically, there was little or no attention placed on choosing music that was 1) good and 2) beat coordinated to the sets. It is, however, a serious plain vanilla interval workout-although short at 45 minutes. It is shot with some of the guy's students set up on trainers at a homely lakeside setting while he walks around in highschool football coach garb incessantly instructing while holding a stopwatch.Anyone with extensive spinning experience could get pretty much the same thing by choreographing their own workout, turning on the radio and using a stopwatch. There is a reason why music is carefully coordinated into this type of workout: it makes work feel like dance.

The size is great for carry-on, however, the cats started stretching against the sides by the end of the trip. They were constricted, although, that is to be expected.The only complaint is that the some of the windows couldn't be covered.

Also, the Amazon picture shows that it comes with a matching luggage tag. It does not. You are on your own for that. Nice storage compartment for toys, treats, etc. Flaps can roll down to maintain privacy and increase durability in large crowds. Would highly recommend this as your pet bag of choice.

Also, I was confused becaues NO WHERE on the product did it say 'New Native' which was the whole reason I had purchased the product online, due to favorable reviews of that specific product.

Finally, throughout this book, there seems to be a thinly-veiled agenda wherein the authors construe their discriptions of these subject groups of people within their own leftist agenda.Please don't get me wrong -- I did enjoy reading this book.

This kind of stuff has got to stop. Amos Walker gets a rather routine assignment, finding a lost son for delivery of his mother's ashes. Soon we hear about the murder of a boxer many years earlier, and somehow it ties into yet a new murder today.What annoys me are the coincidences that occur in the plot. I don't want to mention them, that gives it all away. But just what are the chances that something could work out the way this mystery does? One in a hundred million maybe?The author is not playing fair here. He sets up something that could only work if somehow the universe was run by a clown who rules with coincidences that are just too great to swallow. If you want a story that actually could happen, if want a story in which the author is not just pulling things together to keep the suspense going, if you want a mystery that actually could be solved without guidance from heaven; this story is not for you. Or me either, for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worst of the Walker series","review":"I'm a huge Loren Estleman fan and particularly love the Amos Walker series. While I'm tempted to give this lower than 4 stars, I can't because in spite of its flaws it's still a good read. Walker is probably one of the most enjoyable hardboiled PI characters there have been and Estleman is a great writer. The major flaw with this book is that the \\"whodunit\\" isn't a mystery. It's fairly clear early on, the only mystery is the why, and that's not terribly fascinating. I recommend reading any of the other Walker mysteries first.

The handle feels very natural and the grip is outstanding in dry hands. I'm not sure how well the grip would do with wet hands, but that's what rosin is for. The sheath is really tight and I like the way the knife is held in the sheath by the notches for the handle guard. The knife is crazy sharp as well. It take some extra elbow grease to get the knife into the sheath on the first try because the straps seem a bit short at first. After you've had the knife in the sheath for a day or two, everything stretches out proper and the fit is perfectly tight enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent cast and an excellent movie","review":"From the \\"poof\\" of the muskets to the attitudes of the common soldier this movies portrays, in my opinion well one little corner of the american revolution. Lancaster and Douglas as always make each other look great while Olivier and the supporting cast shine as they peel away layers of the human psyche.As for the plot many people seem to make the mistake of thinking of this as a revolutionary war movie, that is a very simple conclusion. This movie isn't so much about the revolution as it is about people serving their own ends. The writing and dircecting makes its points with the help of all the characters. You'll use more gray matter than you expected on this picture, but it will be well used"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting cast!","review":"When you have multiple Oscar and Emmy winner Laurence Olivier, along with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, you have a pretty good movie. Though the script is rather odd, the actors have fun with the material. But, like most movies that he's in, Olivier manages to take the focus away from Lancaster and Douglas and surpass them. I really admire Olivier for that. No actor can compare with him. But I will someday -- very soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood getting away with foolishness once again","review":"Hollywood awful in my opinion. I did like to look at Burt Lancaster through the movie (: so that was an up for me. But, overall I found the movie unrealistic and annoying in spots. And then they play games with your head. For a history dumb a** like me who didn't know the difference, they provided a very interesting detail about the war and then cast a shadow on it. Pi**ed me off.

When the author talks about how statisticians arrive at a result he does a really poor job of explaining the calculation for a layman. He presents almost nothing at all, just stating results. The book contains a lengthy list of results from many different fields. Most people want to know a lot more about how the various quantities are deduced, even a newspaper article goes more in depth. Science via inductive logic is a little sketchy, but you get the impression that the author doesn't understand that what he studied in grad school is inductive. One receives the impression that the author doesn't question much of anything at all.This is a book about everything he learned as a post-doc, all the people that he met, and all of their theories. But, I don't think that many people will take anything away from The Journey of Man - it lacks the substance that readers of layman's science books desire."},{"rating":"2","title":"really interesting","review":"I really got a lot out of this book--it's a bit of a dry read at times, and some of the genetic science gets a little bit heavy (particularly in the beginning), but I learned a lot from reading.

The author writes extremely well (one of my more literate friends refers to this sort of highly literate style as being an \\"uber-stylist\\") and even if you don't agree with her it's still thought-provoking. As a biologist, I most enjoyed the chapter on Darwinism, but the others are good too. You might not always agree with her, but the author is a talented cultural critic and she has a great deal of erudition on the history of these ideas.

She follows a rule of avoiding simple English if obscure words may be found. She searches far and wide for such words and finds quite a few for which she may be congratulated, but hardly praised. Substantively, she observes: \\"One need not have an especially excitable or a particularly gloomy nature to be persuaded that we may be approaching the end of the day.\\" Come now, Miss Robinson, that is both excitable and gloomy; it approaches hysteria. Having used nine essays to prove that Man has lost his soul, his way and his intelligence, she concludes with a standard environmental diatribe which focuses on the present-day dangers to the Koala bear.Miss Robinson needs less Calvin and more Prozac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scamps-bored us","review":"I am a grandma who would buy anything my child wanted if I could.

Unable to make it through the entire book, I began skimming before I was even halfway through the story in order to learn the ending. In the end I could have predicted that as well.

Once we actually meet her, I have a hard time understanding how Bailey and MJ could be best friends with her. She is calculating and conniving. She tries to manipulate people by using sex appeal.

Secret Star was the weakest of the weak series. Roberts generally creates such good heroes and heroines that readers will overlook lacks or errors in plot details, but hackneyed and/or unbelievable characters--and, in this installment, a downright silly one like Grace--point out the flaws rather than hide them. Among other things, Roberts needs to better research police procedure and little details like the fact that .38s don't have have clips, but most of all she needs to spend more time executing the game plan for a book and making sure she doesn't make an easy out, leaving readers stuck on base instead of running across the plate of a satisfying read.

I knew there was an anime, so of course, I was very excited when I heard that it was coming to the US.I'm not one of those people who hates anime based on manga because it's \\"not as good as the original\\". But I really did not like \\"Kodocha\\". The first problem was the voice acting. Sana was fine in the English, but Akito's voice was way too deep. In the Japanese, I didn't like Sana's voice very much.My biggest problem was the way Sana was portrayed. They made her way too silly and obnoxious in my opinion, and it's really hard to take her seriously. She was a little air-headed in the manga, but I really think the anime overdid it.Overall, I would advise you to just stick with the manga."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME ADViCE","review":"If I were you guys, I would go and buy the japensese version, and read the english subtitles on ebay.

Seriously.My first clue that this DVD release was botched should've been the company that released it: FUNimation. You know, that same company that butchered Dragonball in its various forms. So I expected a few edits, especially that Sana-chan would likely not refer to her manager as her pimp. Sadly, that seems to be one of the few things they got right.First thing I noticed was the ommission of the original S1 opening, \\"Juu-kuji no News.\\" Supposedly this is due to licensing issues. However, a scene was omitted as a result of this, and the opening they used contains minor spoilers for much later episodes. Also, the Jp audio cuts out in multiple places, which is jarring and slightly painful given the show's frenetic pace.I was unable to get beyond the first few minutes of ep 2, as the sound cut out for the third time and I just gave up. Thankfully I still have my fansubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show. Terrible treatment","review":"I've been a fan of Kodomo no Omocha through fansubs for years, and am happy to actually be able to buy it on DVD. It's a great show, tons of fun.However, the DVD release is horrid.The first thing I noticed was - that's not the first season opening sequence and song. It's from a later season. And that's the attention to detail that carries on.There was a short sequence in the japanese track on the first episode (where Sana meets the singer of the theme song (that no longer exists)) where the audio no longer exists, and there's no subtitles. That's a problem.They put a lot of effort into trying to americanize it for the dub, but messed up on the basics. I'll still buy the rest of the series - but watch it on my fansub versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, elegant addition to anyone's desk!","review":"I buy this calendar every year for my wife.

Installed the scanner again, same problem. Yes, you guessed it I tried a third time. That's it I am returning this product. How could a company sell a product like this. Also, another customer had mentioned that he had Windows ME (2000) and thought that maybe the CD wasn't compatable, I also thought this, but certainly a good company would have updated their software by now.

They give you a rediculous clumsy workaround to install the drivers that has to be redone everytime you disconnect the scanner (that's fun when your're using a laptop!) Bad move Visioneer.

I've complained awhile back about my 8920 one touch not working anymore when I upgraded to AOL 9.0, they wouldnt offer free phone support on this model and when I finally got a fax through to them awhile back they said they would work on a AOL 9.0 fix, well they havent fixed it yet. So check with Visioneer first to see if they will support this machine and if it will work with AOL 9.0. Also my glass is fogging up on the inside. This apparently is a common problem.

Set in 1931 at the height of the Great Depression, this heartwarming story focuses on young Emma (newcomer Jordan Claire-Green) who is shipped off to her \\"aunt\\" when her father loses his job and they are being evicted. Turns out the \\"aunt\\" isn't really blood relation, but a former girlfriend of daddy's. But the story really centers on the little town where dogs have been banned and how Emma and a crusading \\"Dog Lady\\" try to save the dogs. The cast does well with some nice bits from Eric Lutes as the coach turned Christmas program director, Bonita Fridericy as Aunt Delores; and Richard Riehle as the posturing mayor. It's all cliche-driven and predictable, but it's a marvelous movie for dog lovers and Christmas movie afficionados.

And the plot isn't particularly logical. E.g. a parent letting a female child travel on her own to stay with someone without prior agreement, and didn't even write or call to confirm her arrival.I keep expecting the movie to become more exciting but after watching half the movie, I had to view it at 60x until near the end.

Please save your money and buy the book instead of this awful, awful movie !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"glad I ordered it","review":"When I ordered Justice: Crimes, Trials, and Punishments by Dominick Dunne I saw the book, Justice Blind? It sounded interesting (even though it is an academic type book) so I ordered it.Because I am not a student parts of the book were hard for me to read. Overall though it is still worth the money. The author argues that the criminal justice system is a massive failure. His book provides a ton of evidence and is fair.I best like the way the author builds his argument from chapter to chapter. And the book is not written from an \\"expert\\" approach. He sounds like a normal person using normal language. Anyone who votes should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Work","review":"The author shares many of his political opinions that would be more approperiate on an Op Ed page rather than a text book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is junk.","review":"This cd is junk. It sounds nothing like Less Than Jake. It sounds like they put a minimal amount of horns in this album just to keep people buying their cd's. Anthem had less horns than their other albums, but at least the songs were good. Most of these songs sound the same. I bought this cd the day it came out and sold it 2 days later."},{"rating":"2","title":"You people need to GTFO.","review":"I mean the title in the most appropriate way. :] But really... sure, this is WAY different than what Less Than Jake normally does, but I like it... it's not much 'different' than a lot of bands because several sound like this but I thoroughly enjoy this CD to this day... I don't think Less Than Jake should at all look at reviews of this CD and be regretting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is depressing...","review":"You know...as I listen to the GREAT LTJ albums \\"Losing Streak\\", \\"Hello, Rockview\\" and \\"Borders and Boundaries\\", I can't help but think \\"WHAT HAPPENED?!\\". Losing Streak is an album I can listen to from start to finish multiple times without getting bored, there isn't one bad song. Then I listen to this and it doesn't even sound like the same band. Right when I heard \\"She's Gonna Break Soon\\" from \\"Anthem\\", I knew they were heading a direction that was basically abandoning their ska roots and I hate to say that I was right. What a shame..."},{"rating":"1","title":"tisk tisk tisk","review":"Hello Rockview is my favorite album ever! The songs, from Losers and Kings to Hello Rockview have been unique and inpsiring. Borders, Anthem, and B is for B sides were alright albums because they mixed a few great songs with a lot of bland ones. It seems like \\"In with the Out Crowd\\" is made up of all bland songs. Not to quote Vinnie himself, but he seems a bit too formulaic on this album.What happened to them? Were they the brightest bulb that burned out?It seems so on this latest album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye LTJ?","review":"I have been a fan of Less Than Jake since Hello Rockview, and I stood by them even though I thought Anthem was a mediocre album. However, now I'm afraid that this new cd marks the end of a great band; they seem to want to be sold over to the Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, and Panic at the Disco crowds. Goodbye true punk people, hello poppy wannabes... Even as an old fan, I couldn't manage to make it through the whole cd (I made it through track 9). At one time it was Goodbye Blue and White, but now it's Goodbye LTJ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this LTJ?","review":"This is such a generic sounding alblum. It's terrible stay away at all costs. Their new direction is so bland and boring its sickening."},{"rating":"1","title":"hello suckview","review":"I've been a less than jake fan since hello rockview. I think this album is slightly worse than Anthem. I wasn't overall pleased with anthem, but there are 4 good songs on there that I listen to regularly (Welcome to the New South, Short Fuse Burning, Plastic Cup Politics, and Look What Happened[even though the original is still better]). Those anthems are solid and hard rocking. This album on the other hand does not seem to have any standout songs. It just seems watered down with lame choruses and less energy than anthem. Although I don't particularly like this CD so far, it is Less Than Jake, and I will listen to it until I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"IWTOC: A far cry from LTJ","review":"I am not happy to say that this is the most dissapointing album I have ever bought from less than jake, the music on this album is NOT ska-punk, and the 3 songs that actually have Buddy and JR in them are barely enough to qualify. The energy that used to fuel all their best songs is just gone. They call the album \\"In with the out crowd\\", but the music is just so mainstream that the name contradicts the album. I have been listening to them for 5 years and they are my favorite band, but im having second thoughts. They're basically dumping all of their real fans and selling out to the emo crowd, and writing all of their song lyrics as if they were about to die. If you need a comparison go listen to Losing Sreak, and then this. I feel like they have betrayed the fans who have been with them all this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-leze","review":"Less Than Jake have NEVER put out a record I could listen to from start to finish. Usually, we get about 4 fillers, 4 average songs, and 4 killer songs per record. The closest thing to a perfect LTJ record came in the form of B is for B-sides, which had only 2 or 3 fillers, and the rest of the songs were awesome. 'In with the out crowd', though, is by far their worst to date. I actually like 'borders and boundries' better, and I pretty much hated that cd too. Don't expect anything like \\"scott farcus\\" or \\"bridge and tunnel\\" on IWTOC, there are NO stand-outs here. Now I know why I never really got into LTJ. They just can't write a good record from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Unique LTJ record to date...","review":"I've been a huge LTJ fan for years. I've got all the albums and I love each change of sound they've done. No two LTJ albums sound exactly alike, which is awesome. (You want formulaic-go buy AC/DC, every album sounds the same). This album is a complete departure from any of their previous albums. The horns are definitely lessened and the songs are much slower than what they've done in the past. I guess that's been the biggest change that I'm still trying to get used to.Lyrically the album is a little weaker than I'd like. I'm used to them having songs that floor me. While the songs are good, they're just a little disappointing in terms of depth.That being said, this LTJ album is still heads above anything else out there. The production is tight and Chris has NEVER sounded better! Standout tracks for me are: Overrated, Hopeless Case, Don't Fall Asleep on the Subway, Soundtrack of My Life, Let Her Go."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least fav release by Less Than Jake","review":"I'm sorry, but In With the Out Crowd just doesn't have that signature Less Than Jake sound we all know and love. LTJ are just too good at their sound to pretty much just completely abandon it. It's there in a couple of songs, but for the most part, they gave in to the sound that was popular at that time. When listening to LTJ albums, I almost always skip this one. It has some bright spots, but not enough to salvage the album for me. I'm glad they went back to the LTJ we love with GNV FLA. Hope to see and hear another album soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty poor effort by LTJ","review":"Of course LTJ can't really put out a \\"bad\\" album, but this...I dunno, I just find it very boring. The only songs I truly can listen to over and over again are #1 and #3. It's not so much because they're alot poppier (Anthem was very light on the ska but I still loved that disc) but the songs just don't have the same feel anymore. Buy it if you're a big LTJ fan, a couple of the songs won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"punk bands suck. they try to look and act just like the kids outside starbucks, and sing (if you call it that) about their emotional problems. they have poor musicmanship, and they don't write their own material. less than jake is an example of one of these emo bands. i have the displeasure of listening to this garbage while sufing the channels. this cd is bad and you could get through the material in one 1/2 hour sitting w/o wanting to hear more. go check out a real group whether it be, rap, jamband, jazz, or classic rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinnie, What were you thinking?","review":"Am I listening for a poppier Bowling for Soup??? I think Johnny Quest was right but a decade pre-mature when he called you sellouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"It kills me when a band I like does this. LTJ has never been terribly original, but it was their mix of punk, ska, and energy that always gripped me before. I am not at all adverse to bands changing as they grow, but the new album is...well, watered down. Fantastic if you want the generic Blink-182/Yellowcard/Fall Out Boy sound that's ever so popular right now. It's just all so \\"done before\\". If you are looking for ska, I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Energy, Not enough horns.","review":"After listening to less then jake for about 3 years now i have to say this CD is unlike anything i've ever heard from them. It's lacking in energy and i'm finding it very hard to really get into it. How is anyone expected to skank to something like \\"The Rest Of My Life.\\" I fear that the worst has happened and LTJ has sold out to the emo crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychological Regression?","review":"For those who kinda grew up listening to LTJ, it was nice listening to how much it sucked to be different, how much your parents sucked, and how no one understood you... However... 10 years later, I dunno about the rest of the fans, but as I approach 30, the same themes just don't really ring true. I guess for new fans still in their teens that still feel all angry and misunderstood it's an okay album. For me, though, I wonder how old we're all going to get before they start growing up with the rest of us... It's just sad to have to outgrow a band. I wonder how many of the songs are really written from the heart, and if they are, how many more times will they screw up before getting things right... Because, wow, being in your thirties and stil rather lost and ungrounded is kinda sad. But like I said, new fans, sure it's okay. But if you've been a fan for a while, just listen to the old records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this LTJ or Good Charlotte?","review":"This is worthless pop drivel compared to Borders & Boundaries, Hello Rockview, or Anthem. I would recommend all of those highly. This was such a disappointment- cheesy lyrics, all the energy of their previous work simply disappeared, their sound has changed dramatically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not follow commands","review":"I got this for my daughter for christmas. I told her what to tell the toy (sit, speak, etc) but it did nothing. I thought maybe there was too much noise so we took it in a room with absolute silence and still it did not work (responded but not correctly). I went out and bought new Duracells and still no luck. We turned it on and off, tried my voice, my wife's voice, and my daughter's voice, still no progress. If frustration is your idea of fun buy Scamps."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Bomb!","review":"I bought this toy as Christmas gift for a granddaughter and it was such a disappointment! We were able to get it activated but it never responded to any commands. Anything that it did was totally random and it stopped working entirely after a few days. A cousin of this granddaughter also got this toy for Christmas and had even a worse experience than we did. Her first toy never worked and after it was returned, a second still did not do as well as the one that we purchased. The maker should be ashamed for marketing such a poor product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but doesn't walk like Go Go","review":"This toy is fun and great. I'm glad that it can do tricks. But the downside is that it doesn't walk, it just stands there. And does tricks...I'm not sure if it walks though but if it does, it would be great! Just too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Hopes","review":"My niece received a Scamps for Christmas last year and it never worked correctly right out of the box. It moved as it was supposed to but it never had a voice at all. In spite of that my daughter loved to play with it, so I decided to take a risk and buy her one for her birthday last week. Our Scamps worked perfectly and was awesome to play with... for aboout 20 minutes. My little girl barely got to play with him when he completely malfunctioned. Now we have a Scamps that tilts his head and whines once in awhile, but will not respond to any commands or even move half the time. And yes, I have tried changing the batteries. It is a huge disappointment that 2 out of 2 of this product doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER!!!!!!","review":"I went to the store with my mom once and saw this toy. I became in love with it as soon as I saw SCAMPS. Since my birthday was on the same month she agreed I could have it- as long as I did not open it until my birthday. My birthday came and I opened it as fast as I could. I got SCAMPS to do every trick but the adding game. I"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mayhem of Motley","review":"This is a must-read for any Motley Crue fan. It scratches away the tough veneer of America's favorite rock-n-roll band and unearths suprising elements. Tears, heartaches, rapes and terminal diseases--and this is only the beginning--the Crue continue to shock their fans in a way only they have been able to for nearly 20 years. It's almost impossible to put down. Dirty, provacative and scandalous, readers will have more insight than they ever wanted (or needed) to know about Motley Crue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirt Never Tasted So Good!","review":"What a yummy book! I couldn't put it down until I had read every last word. Drugs, sex, partying, and music...even if someone didn't care for Motley Crue much, everyone likes one of the aforementioned, right? Buy it and eat it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an amazing book!","review":"This book exceeded my expectations. I had just finished 'Slash' and thought that this book could not come close to it. I was wrong! It's amazing the lifestyle these guys had. Not only do you get an inside look at all the craziness, but you also feel like you get to know them personally. Awesome book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I laughed, I cried, I cringed. An excellent book detailing Motley's career the past 20 years. Their rise to stardom, their faults, drugs, alcohol. Not for the faint of heart as this goes into extreme detail regarding their escapades.Very well written and kept me page turning throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"If you have followed Motley Crue throughout their career, even part way, then you know what's in this book. There are some tidbits of stuff in there that have not been made to the general public before, and are the only interesting items to read. But over all, this book is beyond boring. Tommy and Nikki slept with every Playboy Playmate in existence. So? Then they married them all, divorced them all, and whined about them all. Sorry, but you get no sympathy if you go through Playmates the way normal people go through paper towels. They had the good life and screwed it up. Royally.Synopsis of the book - woke up, did bags of dope, slept with numerous women, passed out. Turn page and repeat.The true shining light of this book what the chapter on Vince and Skylar. That was truly heartbreaking. No one should have to go through that much pain.Save your money - go see them in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but just a little over-embelished.","review":"This book is a FUN read and I have no doubt that for the most part things went down exactly as described. However I've also read Neil Strauss' other books and while a brilliant writer, he tend to make things larger than life and more polished than they really were (read the Game especially for examples of this.) Some things in the book seem a little too \\"neatly\\" described and he glosses over some of the more negative aspects of Motley Crue (And I grew up with them and obsessively followed their press since I was in middle school.)But definitely a thumbs up. Look forward to reading Nikki's new book for comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected, this book is awesome.","review":"I loved this book from beginning to end. I thought I knew everything there was to know about the Crue and how \\"bad\\" they were, was I wrong! They were sooo much badder! This book is a must read for any Motley Crue fan, or any rock and roll fan in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"....Falling in love with Motley Crue....","review":"I wasn't a fan of this group but this book is just amazing!.....it made me cry.....it made me laugh...........it made me in love with these guys...........one of the best book I've ever read............serious and funny at the same time............and at last but not least.....Nikki is so hot!...... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me angry","review":"I'm about halfway through as I write this...previous reviews are correct in that you simply can't put this book down, mainly because every time you think the band has sunk to the deepest depths of depravity, they surprise you by going further. This is a story of how four people who lived like utter pigs and treated themselves and those around them with utter disdain made millions of dollars with very little talent.The book makes me angry because I hate to see people with no values and minimal talent retire before age 30 with more money than they'll hope to spend in a lifetime. Still, the book is a bona fide page-turner, and I'll likely read it again and again with the fascination of watching a car crash."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crüe","review":"\\"The Dirt\\" is one of my most favourite rock-books. The Crüe gives you a detailed insight in the world of sex,drugs and rock n roll! Sometimes the book is just cool, sometimes it is really funny and sommetimes it is really sad/tragic. It is very well written and should be read by anyone who wants to be a rock star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Nasty yet Eye-Opening","review":"Its got all the sex, drugs and rock-n-roll you want. It's a quick, fun read...The \\"eye-opening\\" is more like a re-remebering that this genre of heavy metal was full of post-punk kids who bonded with music full of angst and rage. It is hard to forget formulaic \\"hair band\\" ... music and its multitude of players, but at its onset it was really touching a raw nerve and actually saying something about the times of these explosive kids. Then the \\"we'll spray our hair and sound like Quiet Crue or Danger Ratt\\" pawns fell prey to the \\"corporate geniuses\\" and washed it all away with teenage dance-marketability and sterile music. The Crue certainly became a victim of this themselves later on, but who could blame them for any decisions they made seeing as how they were very rarely sane. It would have been a wild ride to hang with them at the beginning of this mess, though. Tommy Lee does need to cut down on the \\"Duuuude\\"s..."},{"rating":"2","title":"MC","review":"Love this book.

If you're not then don't bother. If you're reading it looking for an in-depth account of drug addiction or the \\"rock n' roll lifestyle\\" put it down and read Anthony Kiedis' Scar Tissue instead, its much more detailed and much better written.

Better title: Four Horsemen of the Apocolypse.Nothing different here from other rock clones, except the year 2002 brings us true raunch.The only surprising thing about this book is how ANYONE from front to back ends up without a fatal STD.Steaing clothes from a homeless chick- real class,dudes. Without a doubt,self hate exudes from the literary authors(The Crud),and every individual,most especially,the women-associated with these narcisstic juvenile delinquents.

Also some pages penned by their managers, and record execs. You will find this book to your liking even if your not a Motley Crue fan. It will show you the extremes in the life of a rock star.

Sometimes you get 2 three different POV's into the same story. For example; Vince Neil's infamous car wreck which killed Hanoi Rocks drummer Nicolas Razzle is told from the POV's of all for members; where they were. how they remember it. Anyone who's who loves reading Rock n' Roll Biographies, even if you're not a Crue fan would enjoy \\"the Dirt.\\" You won't like because of the book, in fact, you might grow hare them more, but, not without feeling some empathy. The human element is there, and the book itself is an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Band, Great Rock N Roll, Hell of a life !!!","review":"To put it in the most simple way i can, this band kiked but. I have been a fan of the Crüe since 1981. This book brings you to the way they were living back in the day, thrue Nikki Sixx's overdosed and near death esperience, Vince Neil Out of the band, The weddings and divorces, the life style, the rehabs, ect... The book is amazing, it takes you thrue the rock n roll life styles of the early 80's and 90's with drugs, rock n roll and girls, girls, girls, but it also shows you that no matter what these guys made made it and are still alive and they keep giving us the fans the best There Music.any trhue fan of the Crüe needs to read this book it's simply Amazing !!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A BOOK!!!!","review":"This book just blew me away! i have never known a book to ever be like this one before. being a major cruehead this book was such a treat, but like most books you expect it to have boring parts, but this never did not once! it was humour,heratache and passion with raw and rude rnr the whole way thru! it made dee dee ramone's 'poison heart' and david lee roth's books look like childrens books! this is a sure read, take it from me i never have time to read, but i have read this 5 times so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE FOR THE TRUE CRUE FAN!!!!!!!","review":"This book is great!!! These guys are incredible, how awsome is it that they share a look into their lives for us to read about!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A How NOT to...","review":"A must-read for Motley Crue fans and rock fans, but also for any aspiring band manager, because in addition to documenting the band's rise, it's a prime example of what should NOT happen...Excellent background on each band member about what motivated each individual to a career in the music industry--reading about Nikki Sixx's childhood is especially difficult but explains a lot--as well as highly entertaining, too-crazy-to-be-false stories about the band's exploits.For aspiring band managers, the book is an excellent chronicle of each member's individual reaction to the band's fame and fortune, and the factors that eventually drove the band apart.Bottom line: a thoughtful, entertaining, well-written, and useful How NOT to book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As dirty, leud, and rude as you'd expect, hence 4 stars!","review":"I thought it was an interesting enough read. There are parts of it where I was completely disgusted by the womanizing. Other parts, I was inspired. Still other parts, I was filled with envy at how easily things came for the group and how easily they would throw it all away. It is a good story and I would recommend it to be people that are interesting in understanding the weird world of that period. I don't know that it was the most exciting though."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS BOOK!!!","review":"Definitely the best autobiography book that I ever read. Mötley Crüe was one of the most influential bands from the LA scene in the 80's, but they also personified every Rock'n'Roll cliché which was invented by Led Zeppelin, but they put into practice!!. Everything you can imagine is in this book, which explains it all from the beginning and is rich in anecdotes from those wild years. A must read, not only for Mötley Crüe fans, but also for every person interested in those crazy years.

All of them open up about their experiences with being successful music artists, and also about their own personal struggles that led to all of thier drug and alchol problems in a period that presented little knowledge of addiction and rehab. If you enjoy biographies that explain all of the dirt that is both hardcore and explicit, then you will be captivated by this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motley Crue Debauchery","review":"I have a hard time putting this book down.

I love the crue, but they're bright enough to know kids love the Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll thing. They have always exploited, and to some degree exaggerated this. It's still a cracking read, wish we could turn the clock back and do it all again - I'll never forget buying Too Fast For Love on Leathur records...Shame Nikki has a dig at Kiss - without Kiss there'd be no Crue.. Anyway, buy and enjoy. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome couldn't put it down","review":"I'm not a reader by any means. I prefer TV. I couldn't put this book down.

Um, this book is amazing. Not only because the writing is straightforward and you really begin to develop an understanding of the problems that the band members had, but because you also begin to realize that these guys have nine lives.How on EARTH any of them survived all the drug overdoses, random sexual escapades, car crashes, stage accidents, or jealous women is a testament to how much God REALLY wanted us to hear their story.This book is also a great character study. All the guys were totally into drugs, sex, alcohol, and childish pranks. But because they are so honest and open about all the things they did wrong, by the end of the book you find yourself liking them. Granted, you probably won't agree with anything they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most shocking and amazing book I've ever read!","review":"If you buy anything this is the book to buy.

The overall thrust is a step away from the more vital albums he had just made for his own label. The program here sounds a tad influenced by his former collaborator Robert Palmer. The opener, \\"This Is Emotion,\\" sounds more than a little like \\"Addicted to Love!\\" \\"Cold Metal Rhythm \\" and \\"New Anger\\" provide the best tracks here, apart from the brilliant \\"My Dying Machine\\" remix by William Orbit! The latter track really shows up the lesser material here, big time. The mix by Orbit is one of his typically stellar technological workouts. \\"Voix\\" and \\"America\\" provide a strong enough ending but on the whole, this album sounds either like boredom setting in or that IRS was meddling with the sauce.

I played with it for the first three weeks or so. But by then I'd stoped playing with it. I was 11, so mabey it was age. The next time I played it was at a family party, I showed a group of people some of the tricks it could do. It amused them to. I never played with it since. When I put some of my animals up in our attic, I took the batteries out, and havn't put them back in. It's on my self now, but onley because it is a cut dog, it is a quelity toy.

When you spend 500.00 plus on a tool and wait several weeks the last thing you want to do is open a destroyed item, then they tell you it will take another month or so to get a new one.

I comparison shopped and found the similar Sunpentown tabletop oven cost less. So I bought the Sunpentown and it sucks, not cooking food through even after extended cooking time. The Nuwave has 3 heating methods: conduction, convection, & infrared (radiant). Sunpentown only has two, conduction & convection, without the infrared radiant heat which makes tabletop ovens superb. I tossed my Sunpentown and bought a Nuwave, which works excellent! Nuwave makes the very best burgers, steaks, veggies etc. because the infrared heat browns the food like a bbq grill. Also it's quick, easy to clean, doesn't use too much power, and doesn't heat up your kitchen like a range oven. Doesn't smoke up your house like a George Foreman grill either. I should've taken Mr.T's advice from the start. Also, TIMEMagazine.com listed the Nuwave as one of the top 10 infomercial products that work best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reject","review":"This item was delivered with two chips in the base/dome. Packing of the Nuwave oven box and the exterior Amazon box were both unprofessional so I am not sure if this problem is a manufacturing defect or damage from shipping but I bet it was a defect that was deliveed to someone else, rejected and then delivered to me. I think if was a repackaged reject because the Nuwave oven box packing material appeared to have been opened and then put back/stuffed by someone who was not on the factory production line. So I have wasted enough time with Amazon/Nuwave on this, requested a refund and have sworn off acquiring this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so great?","review":"I don't know how everyone raves about this item.

My convection oven does the same thing in less time without having to turn your food over. It comes with a cooking time chart. Got to play around with the cooking times...they are not always right.

We've never regretted the day it reached.We have cooked so many things in the new wave oven, we're practically pros by now. We have cooked broccoli, potatoes, roasted eggplant, chicken, beef, lamb, fish, and we have even baked cakes, macaroni pie, and sweet potato casserole! All are absolutely delicious. The possibilities are endless. and we are still discovering new things we can do with it. It still works as excellent as it worked when we first got it...(about 1 year ago), no complaints at all!It is easy to clean, easy to store on the countertop (it deserves to be there, rather than packed away in the cupboard), and it is quick, easy to use, and efficient.

The first day I tried to cook 1.85 pounds beef roast, it didn't cook. I stricktly followed instructions, When I finsihed cooking , outsize of the roast looks pretty nice, however, inside was still fozen. I didn't have a chocie, I had to cut them to small picese and recook, it became hard rocks. Then second time I tried to use it to cook defrosted beef (0.8 pound), it didn't turn out as I expected. I wanted it well done, after follow insturction suggested time and power, it still raw, I have to add cooking minutes. Then I got it over cooked. Anyway, a big dissapoinment!

It produced so much heat in the kitchen, that the upstairs hallway was hot too. I bought this product specifically because we don't use the oven in the summer and my wife has a number of dinner recipes that require an oven. In addition, the breast (straight from the freezer, as was the other pro NuWave feature) completed the NuWave recipe book time and was raw on the inside. We did it another 6 minutes, and still raw. It was 95 degrees outside and it felt almost as hot in the kitchen. I just don't know what the folks from Arizona and Florida, who were among the Amazon reviewers, were talking about when they heralded the oven as 'wonderful', etc. because it produced no heat. Were these phony reviews? I now wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"nuwave","review":"I brought this Nuwave year 1/2 ago. I used it 4 times and then stored it.

I have an older white convection oven ( similar idea of circulating hot air but no infrared.) I like this product because it cooks frozen hamburger really well. Nicely brown and juicy inside. I seldom cook and if I do, I use the stove or my built in conventional GE oven. During the summer I use my green egg grill. So this product was not heavily used. This year it stopped working. I called the company and they said I need to buy a new head for about $80.00. I paid upwards of $150.00 for this. I will throw it away and not buy a new head. The quality is not that good. In comparison, my old convection oven still works. I am very disappointed with this product's quality.I will not recommend wasting your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I've had a NuWave oven for a couple years now and still use it. It cooks meat far better and faster than a conventional oven. The only reason I don't use it all the time is the clean up - specifically the racks. Personally I find I have to break out the scrubber and clean in between each and every bar, every time. The dishwasher doesn't cut it. This is an age old grilling problem though. Not sure there's an answer other than to use the pan more often. It's a bit bulky too, so keep in mind you need space to place the hot lid when using it. Outside of that, I love my NuWave. It's more environmentally friendly and does a good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but useless!","review":"I should have learned from my Flavorwave 3 years ago.

I tried calling the nuwave and talked to a rude representative. they could not be of much help. I opened the equipment and found that there is a cooler fan which has broken inside the equipemtn and it is lying loose. Looking at the parts and the quality, I am terribly disappointed.I do not think the positive review in amazon is by real users, it could be a propaganda.I also do not think the quality of cooking done by this oven is uniform or having any special significance. The equipment is basically a heater coil with a fan spreading the heat.I will not purchase any future products from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nuwave review","review":"I have had this oven for several months and have tried on different items per the cooking instructions.

On the positive note, It cooks very well and fast, saves electricity, Food is great, tender and tasty. The company needs to check on the quality control on these units. Very poor workmanship and product. What do you want when its MADE IN CHINA. Stay away from this unit unless you can afford a new unit yearly and a new dome every 6 months.. BEWARE......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic oven!","review":"This oven does every thing it calims to do. I've used it several times to cook just meat and to cook meat and vegetables at the same time. The food tastes great and there is very little clean up. I thought when I first looked at it that the plastic would have to be cleaned each time, but since the moisture stays in the food it does not get on the plastic. I like the fact that you can cook for a time then open and turn the food. The oven does not get very hot on the outside and does not heat up the kitchen. I live in Florida so this is important. I am really happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bachmanns N scale ATSF GP-40","review":"I had already had one, but I purchased the \\"Thunder Valley\\" starter set, marked down after Christmas.

Many of the characters seemed like they were being stretched though to bring about the relationship so wasn't very happy with the purchase. However, I couldn't even get through a third of the book before I had to put it down. It got to where everything was really far-fetched and didn't make any sense whatsoever based on the Chinese I know. It's good for a starting point but would not recommend this to anybody who truly wants to get a good feel of what correlations there are between Chinese characters and the Bible. Or for anybody who wants a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong character being translated.","review":"In the first page, the word for \\"Shangdi/Shangti\\" isn't what it's supposed to be in ancient characters. Shang means up or above, but the character being used is its opposite, xia and the second character is something even I, as a Chinese, can't interpret. So, the so-called \\"Shangdi/Shangti\\" is actually \\"Xia something\\" from the first page of the book. \\"Xia\\" means \\"under, below, etc...\\" Here by \\"something\\", I meant I wasn't able to interpret the second character used, which was supposedly \\"ti/di\\", meaning Emperor.It's a shame that people who don't know Chinese are trying to profit from the language that they don't have any knowledge of. Actually the Chinese first used \\"di\\" for the Jade Emperor from Chinese mythology since ancient times.

I really wish I would have had more of them for this trip. I LOVE it! It was very comfortable to wear. The pockets are great, and very secure. I could wash it out in the sink in the evening and it was dry the next morning, even with the humidity. I didn't have any problems with wrinkles.

The skirt arrived today and I took a tape measure to it (after I practically slid it off still zipped) and it is 32 inches. 32 inches!!! I'm sending it back and hoping the size 2 will work.

It was HUGE in the waist and ridiculously long on me. With the pockets where they are, I don't think it could easily be tailored either.

I kept them in the freezer like the directions said to keep them from spoiling, but they tasted spoiled from day one. The texture is akin to oatmeal mixed with molasses. The 'cookies' are very dry and very salty, and are not the consistency of a cookie. There is no sweet taste to them at all, nor any noticeable amount of chocolate. I had one and had a friend try another, and ended up throwing the remaining 22 away after they stayed in my freezer for several months.

Finally the two-timing daddy is attacked by a criminal type and the step-bruddas must align forces to bash up all the baddies and save their daddy.The plot or lack thereof mainly provides an excuse for staging lots of elaborate songs and fights, done in a reasonably stylish way.

The major premise is that an artificial intelligence with DNA computing elements will go through puberty. Snails have DNA too - why doesn't the DNA based computer grow a shell? And it doesn't advance the story - Asimov, Binder, Ryan, Heinlein, etc. all managed robot/computer coming-of-age stories without such stupid gimmicks. The movie Toy Story doesn't make the mistake of claiming that Buzz Lightyear's existential crisis comes because he's made of carbon.The mimor premises are generally bad, too - as an aside, viruses are blamed for a plague, because alien bacteria wouldn't effect people - but that's backwards. Most bacteria can survive without a host - no virus can. etc.If you're in the mood for a depressing book, you might like this one if you know little of science or technology.

Took almost 45 min. to get this to work. Also, the holes in the wooden base are the incorrect size. One hole is adequate but the other is not, which means the barameter is tilted since it won't fit into the base properly.

The elastic in the old briefs is much better and they keep me supported (I still have a few in the bottom of my drawer that are really old -- different color writing and the tags are worn off).

It is a personal account of the author, of the Kundalini phenomenon and some comparison with similar experiences of others. The only idea I get out of reading this book is that Kundalini rising through spinal column and coming back is only of one type, the other type being that the Kundalini energy having reached the top, returns from the front. This book talks about some higher worlds to be reached through meditation. It does not integrate with the thought of human psyche. The presentation and understanding is dualistic. It does not confirm to the highest truths of Advaita Vedanta at least in summary. Of course, to me it is similar to reading a paperback, and not a revelation of final Truth which I AM."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAYYYYYYY OUTDATED","review":"Ok, i dont know when this DVD was really made, but its OLD... the information is un usable.

The musical guests are also great- Jurassic 5, Damian Marley, and Ben Folds are among my favorites from Season 1.Overall, Rollins makes a great show- interestings guests, great music, and his bits are consistently very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"All emotion, no facts","review":"My title really says it all. Rollins has strong opinions but apparently he didn't use any reason and logic to come to them.I agree with many of the ultimate conclusions that Rollins has so I'm not complaining because I don't like his point of view.

The problem is that there is so very little there. There are too many things that this book simply does not cover.

Unfortunately, this book has been very disappointing to me.When read a book on a targeted technical subject, I like to read something which is concise and to the point. Preferably with many useful examples in the text.This book fails on both points.The author often wanders off topic in a very conversational tone and there is an entire chapter on Visual Basic 6, which is not .NET. This would be fine if I was reading a book on a general topic which benefits from anecdotes and humor. But this topic is one where I want to get to the \\"meat\\" of things and move on. I think with a good editor, this book could be reduced by 100 pages!I've also found the example code to be trival implementations of the subject, with almost nothing which could be re-used in a professional environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"It's hard to convey the import of this music if you weren't there. The early 1980's was one of the most rarified and creative moments in the history of popular music. Bush Tetras blended punk, reggae and funk with an edgy New York street sensibility. This music is real. And it's all here, the early singles Too Many Creeps and Dah a Riot, and the seminal Rituals EP. Don't miss this, get it before it goes out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"PJ Harvey with a hint of funk, before PJ Harvey","review":"This is a very good collection of rock music. I know little about this band, but was very impressed when I saw them as a warm up band in 1998 (years past their prime?).It's not sweet, and is tough in large doses on headphones and/or an office environment, but if you can get yourself speakers and a little distance, it's very solid. Like most rock it takes more than a single listen to get what's going on. It's not harsh on the ears, but it is a tad cranky.If you're an alternative commerical radio devotee you may not get it.

All they did is make it a smaller case, a different cover, and took off Haunted History. I love the show and seen the entire series. Matter of fact, they could have released the other shows rather then repackage the same set. Overall, i'm disappointed for dropping 15 for a set I already own.

I returned it and got a replacement, which also appears to be broken. Scoring tool still doesn't work. And, I'm not sure if it's just because my disc is broken, but it only lets me view the test ONCE after I've taken it.

Audio quality is as good as it can be for only 2 channels. DVD quality is fairly good considering the low light conditions. The only gripe I have is Colin's wife Cecilia Nol and her repetitive intrusion of the camera. She seems to throw off the feel of the bands performance by her jerky dance routines. I think she almost kicked Colin in the face during the performance of \\"Catch a star\\". I credit her enthusiasm and support for Colin, but she needs to tone it down on some songs. As for the reviewer with sensitivity of the F-bombs don't play the monologue portion in the bonus features. The concert alone does not contain any F-bombs. Overall a must have for Colin Hay fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't need to see it.","review":"I have seen Colin live probably more than I have seen any other artist. I love his shows. I have seen him before he met Cecilia Noel and I'm actually going to a Hay/Trapper show on 9/8/11. I love the solo acoustic stuff and the band stuff. I much prefer just Colin with a guitar and no band, but a full band rocks too. What I cannot stand is when there's just a few players and Cecilia dancing around. I seriously have to look away or just close my eyes and enjoy the sound. Knowing that she's on the DVD, makes it an easy PASS for me, but then again I live in LA and am fortunate enough to see him often. He doesn't always bring her, but it's never noted... kind of a crapshoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster at best","review":"I'm a dedicated fan of Colin Hay's work, and was eager to own a video to be able to demonstrate to others why I'm a fan, but this one will not do the trick.This is a very low-energy, lacklustre performance. A video of a performance needs to present something worth watching, and while these are all faithful reproductions of great Colin Hay songs, this could just as easily have been a CD, as there is nothing to look at here.The performances are rote, with very little of the engaging banter from the stage I am so familiar with from Colin. The audience is comatose. The venue is miserable. The band is crammed into a corner against a white wall with lighting more befitting an elementary school class performance than a professional artist's DVD release. The venue could have been overcome by a great performance, but that's just not the case here.Colin remains a favorite, but he needs to find a far better performance and producer to achieve a DVD worthy of his talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scorpions: Unbreakable World Tour 2004- one night in Vienna","review":"DVD sound is VERY BAD, sound goes in and out in and out.

Not in terms of the songs, but in terms of the general production. The imagems are, in general, a great big blur, alternating all the time between the drummer and the rest of the band (the new bass player, Polish guy Pavel Maciwoda, is barely shown), in blinding-fast editing moves that will make you feel disgusted with the whole experience of watching this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Although their last studio offer, UNBREAKABLE, was a pleasant surprise, this DVD lacks the quality of its counterpart CD. Edition is atrocious, cutting from musician to musician in less than a second, the whole show."},{"rating":"1","title":"One night to forget.","review":"Due to bad edition, this DVD by the greatest German band of all times is almost unwatchable. The sound is strong and crisp. What ruined it all was edition, by someone called Anna Hausing, something like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"The best band from German of all times delivered a pedestrian package here. The extras contain only a weak doccumentary and one single bonus song.As for the concert itself, it's not bad, but its edition is weird, done at breatktaking speed (the so-called \\"MTV Style\\"), and that destroys a lot of the watching experience of this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed... almost useless...","review":"It hurts me to tell this about a beloved band of mine, but it's the simple truth. What went wrong with this product? There are two MAJOR problems:1) Headache-inducing edition. The sound is perfect, you can feel the band is in top notch form. The only trouble is that you can't watch them! Each frame lasts sometimes less than a second, it's awful, it's boring, you can't watch Mathhias Jabs perform a solo, you can't watch the drummer complete a drum roll. It's not Unbreakable, it's Unwatchable.2) Simply by viewing the musician's clothes during the songs, you can see that they used footage from different shows in the same song!! This is so annoying!!I already sold my copy of this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so DIZZY!!","review":"I sell music DVDs and I have to agree with the 1 star because of the fact the camers would not stop at one person.

This DVD is not as good as those two. The film footage is not as impressive, not as well put together and the footage could have been recorded better but the horrible reviews on here are totally unfounded. The footage still captures the raw energy of the band (the crowd isn't up to par with the show sadly) live and the sound is great (you can complain about the footage but not about the sound). If you are Scorps fan you will like the subtle changes in the Zoo. I have heard a number of live versions (from cds/dvds and in concert) of this Scorpions staple and I really really like this version. Deep and Dark live also sounds great. I would recommend this DVD to a Scorpions fan and to a metal fan. If you are neither, then this might not be for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This book is pretty good. It's accurate for the most part. There are a couple mistakes I spotted,but it's nothing major. It's a fast read so if you're a Nirvana fan on the go,this book is for you. To give you an idea of how fast you can read this,while still absorbing the information,I was able to listen to all of In Utero with the bonus track. That's about an hour, I believe. The pictures in this book are fantastic. All in all this book is worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an updated version","review":"I was under the impression this would be an update of their previous version 3.

Some of the pre-made cards especially the christmas and snow scenes are breathtaking. I'm looking to buy again because I've lost my program disk and I want nothing but this exact program.

Oh well, I'm not complaining. Unlike 2004's \\"Fiction Man,\\" which I'm still a little remorseful over, \\"B&BS\\" isn't just for Robert Pollard die-hards.

This is the glorious Pines of Rome and spectacular Fountains of Rome that I grew up with, but with much cleaner and more dynamic sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive \\"Pines Of Rome\\"","review":"I concur will all the reviewers who said this is one of the best \\"Pines of Rome\\" available. It still is yes. I never heard the third movement \\"Pines of the Janiculum\\" sound so fresh. \\"Fountains of Rome\\" also receives a great reading from the Reiner and the CSO. I'm withholding a star primarily for the mediocre reading of Debussy's \\"La Mer.\\" I'm afraid this piece has been bettered many times since this recording. Boulez, Martinon, Tortelier, and Dutoit own this composition as far as I'm concerned and I haven't heard it bettered by any other conductor.I would say that if you want to hear an outstanding \\"Pines of Rome\\" and \\"Fountians of Rome,\\" then you will find very little to complain about with this superlative recording.Note: I have not heard the SACD layer of this recording, but the CD layer sounds fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible tape","review":"Absolutely terrible tape.

The depth and breadth of the worked that Robinson creates is truly a wonder. Few writers can successfully juggle the complex ideas contained within this book and still present a coherent story.When I started this novel I feared that the level of music theory and physics was going to overshadow the story and make for a dry and boring read. By the end of the third chapter I realized that I was hopelessly hooked and couldn't put the book down. This was not due to an attachment to characters but rather an involvement in the world that I have rarely felt.Let's just hope that no one gets the bad idea to try and make a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book came highly recommended by a respected friend.","review":"I adore music theory, physics, and science fiction, so I dove into this book excitedly. A third of the way in it was a painful slog through and I had to fight to get to the end. So disappointing. A couple of the characters were worthwhile, but the insipid plot overshadows them and I can't recommend this at ALL as a result."},{"rating":"2","title":"a different KSR","review":"KSR seems to have treated this as more of an experimental novel. It is literally more of a tour than a plot, its narrative point of view is a bit everywhere, and it wobbles between science fiction and fantasy. The science is good, typically KSR, and the more fantastic elements seem unnecessary. The \\"orchestra\\", the tour of which is central to the story, is an interesting metaphor but not convincingly so.Perhaps the best part of this novel is the treatment of the Martian settlement. The areology and societal references tap on KSR's contemporaneous Martian trilogy and fit in appropriately in the novel's conclusion.This novel is recommended, although it may be a slow read if you are less comfortable with KSR's writing style. I love his style, and feel I am in good company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never became engaging...","review":"Johannes Wright is the Ninth Master of Holywelkin's Orchestra, a magnificent machine that produces music. Every so often, The Orchestra, with the Master, tours the Solar System to perform. However, during this tour, there are those who want The Orchestra, or the Master, to fail. The originator of The Orchestra, physicist Arthur Holywelkin, may have left behind a legacy that most can never understand.I'm a fan of a number of Kim Stanley Robinson's books (Mars trilogy, Antarctica), but this one really never left the starting gate. The Orchestra always seemed like a weird device in a time of advanced physics. Wright was being chased, The Orchestra was being threatened, the planets and asteroids had their own unique cultures...I expected more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book that attests the power of music!","review":"The concept of creating different mini-worlds around the solar system was ingenious.

A roaring adrenaline rush that races past at breakneck speed; fast, great and hard, but tuneful as well. What's the best punk song on this album? Why pick? They are all mind-bogglingly perfect.Take out the couple of tepid reggae numbers that are planted near the end, and you have one of the best albums EVER! 5 stars? With modern technology, you bet! But take out the punk songs, and you have yourself a short 2-star reggae spinner.If you love rock, you must add this to your collection.

I thought they were so powerful, so fast, so destructive. Now, let's not get this mixed up. The Ramones are an excellent band, no doubt about it. But this...this was something more. I got this CD because I thought it was funny that four Rastas were in a punk band. I put the CD into my walkman, turned it on, and my ears began to bleed. This is the single greatest punk/hardcore album of all time, and I don't care what anyone says. People say \\"you can't understand what he's saying\\" and \\"all the songs sound the same\\" and \\"the recording quality's really bad\\", and I just wanna knock their teeth in. Bad Brains really invented everything that is hardcore and destructive about punk, and this album is the epitomy of hard rock. Give it a chance, and you will come to love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rasta-punkian?","review":"I thought that their first album would be pure punk and was slightly suprised to hear reggae music interjected between groups of songs. It gives the album a nice contrast but I'm not a big fan of reggae. I get the fact that both types of music have anti-authoritarian ideals, but it may be awhile before I decide to buy any more of their albums.Different Class Harmonica"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut","review":"I love the Bad Brains. After I Against I, this is probably their next best album. The only reason why I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the poor sound quality. I've been waiting for years for somebody to remaster this album, and somehow improve the sound. But it hasn't happened yet. Still, the music contained is undeniably great. I don't think any hardcore band has ever matched the Bad Brains when it comes to sheer visceral rush."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest!!!","review":"Not only is this album the greatest hardcore and/or punk album of all time, it is possibly the greatest collection of music ever! Nothing can rival the blitzkreig-like, yet soulful intesity of the fast tracks, or the lush,cool-ness of the slower reggae tracks. Each song delivers, and builds on the ones before it, till you understand, and feel, the message of Love in this wonderful message music. Loud or soft, fast or slow, nothing compares to this cd. It is recommended to those with an interest in punk as a great place to start or end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phew!","review":"Ever wonder where bands like Faith no More or The Red Hot Chili Peppers pop out of? Bands that just revitalize the face of music. Well it's a well kept secret; but this is the band that routed out that stuff: before Black Flag,Minor Threat and Fugazi, before Gorilla Biscuits, Quicksand, Rival Schools, Glassjaw, Mike Patton's craziness: it all leads here: and boy is this side of the mountain sunny!

I am glad I did. Bad Brains sound like a cross between the Ramones and Minor Threat, with a slightly more political twist. This is regarded as their best record. Needless to say, I will be purchasing more.One of the Beastie Boys proclaimed this \\"The best punk/hardcore album of all time.\\" A case could be made, though I could have done without the reggae/dub tracks (I never really got the connection between punk and reggae). Despite that, this is an incredible record, and could very well be the best punk/harcore album to come out of the DC scene, which is a bold claim considering the eminence of Minor Threat/Fugazi."},{"rating":"2","title":"I own the original ROIR (green) Cassette ( well thrashed ! )","review":"This Album has been a favorite of mine for years, from when I first sent away to ROIR in the States for the Tape, Along with \\"Flipper - Blow'n Chunks\\" & \\"New York Thrash - Comp.\\" which came in Green, Yellow & Red coloured Cassettes respectively.

It looks like someone taped it off a vhs tape that someone else taped off a grainy tv channel. Most of the scenes have white bursts of light all over them, as though they were filtered through an image of the stars in a night sky. The sound is also scratchy and almost distorted. Unfortunately, there are no subtitles to even aid in understanding the dialog. I'm not even going to bother describing the movie -- avoid this print at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!","review":"I hated this book. When the authors weren't manipulating the way they presented statistics so that everything was the worst this or the most frequent that, they were asking more rhetorical questions than providing useful information.

If this is what the Ashbury world considers good writing, I shudder to think what the material at their weekend games is like. I can honestly say that after reading this, my desire to drive up and participate in their game has almost completely vanished. Please tell me that all the other LARPs associated with the NERO system are not so insipid, so banal.

About midway through this book the adventure and suspense really turn up and it becomes very hard to put down.

Once you take out the credits it runs about an hour. There's about 30 mins of content padded out to an hour. Probably 2 sets, 6 actors, and less plot than Killer Eye 2. Easily could have been filmed in one day. Makes Gingerdeadman 3 look like Transformers and that was actually cheesy fun. I know Eric Roberts isn't an A lister, but dang he stooped low for this one- Charlie Band must have thrown him some cash. Again, an ending that almost isn't even an ending.

Pei is sent to work in a silk factory where the long hours and the working conditions are described as being very difficult, especially for a young girl, yet the years fly by for her and the readers without any account of the hardships that one would expect in these kind of conditions.

I would have one criticism to the main idea in the book: that of letting your fingers doing the playing and the mind enjoying the music from the space above... this is very dangerous for classical piano. that was how I used to play when I was an adolescent and suffered great mishaps in concerts when the mind kept coming back and forth.. of course he means being completely well rehearsed in order to have the mind float above, but still classical piano requires constant control ...

I was on hold forever to the point that I just gave up and hung up. If you want to place an order you get through immediately. I hate these tactics that companies like this use.

This, I didn't like so much. I couldn't really connect with the characters, I didn't really care about them. It didn't have anything to do with the fact that one of them is an artificial intelligence - I've read numerous other books with AI characters that I liked or loved. This seemed more like an exercise in how many weird things could be packed in one short novel. And there was a lot of sex. Really strange sex.I did very much like the end of the book, but it didn't make up for the rest of the weirdness."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book","review":"This is great sci-fi, intelligent and extremely well written. Easy to read, thought provoking and entertaining. The AI's are more or less benevolent, which is a nice change, and they are intelligent in a very human, though not human-centric, way. The characterizations are excellent and the plot well woven. I hadn't read any good, *new* sci-fi in a while, and this perfectly slaked my thirst.

Nonetheless, when you try to break loose a tough nut - the two sides of the wrench box will start going apart, ultimately becoming wide enough for the wrench to skip to the another set of sides on the nut. In other words, the walls of the boxes on the wrench are too thin to handle any serious job. I ended up stripping the nut with the wrench, but luckily was able to use a regular non-flare wrench on remaining sides to undo the nut."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sleeper but a great movie","review":"It's a great movie about the friendship between 2 Israeli women doing their compulsory military service. At first they start out hating each other because one is kind of a bad girl who hates taking orders and the other is prudish and kind of shy. But by the end of the movie they end up becoming close friends by going through a few hardships together. If you take the time to get into it, it's a great movie. It also shows you don't have to have a big budget or fantastic special effects to produce a good movie. It really is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER TERRIFIC STORY!","review":"I loved this story. The characters were smart and very sweet. Ms. Mason is a fantastic storyteller. She really makes you care for her characters. She writes sensually without coming across crass.

I'm not really sure why the abuse of the heroine needed to be part of the story since it didn't support any central theme of the novel, but other than that bit, the story unfolds nicely and the hero matures without any out of hand physical or mental abuse towards his lady. Overall I was pleased with the flow and cohesion of the writing and the pace of the story telling.

I was so interested in this storyline & the bonus DVD with all 5 Chapters in video was enough to make me run out & snag this one.Listening to TP-3 I really enjoy it all the way through. Some of the highlights are Playa's Only w/ Game, Happy Summertime w/ Snoop, Sex In The Kitchen, Put My T-Shirt On, Remote Control, Kickin' It With Your Girlfriend, Reggae Bump Bump, Girls Go Crazy, Burn It Up & of course Trapped In The Closet 1-5.Overall this is a very good R&B; album...4.5/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Aiight","review":"I mean it just doesnt capture the essence of the Twelve play and TP2 at all its almost like he just ran out of songs...Dont get me wrong there are a few cuts on the there that i like, but keyword is \\"few\\"...Its not like the others where you can listen to the whole cd...Its just too urban in my opinion.

My 7 year old sister writs better lyrics than this man.I saw it on TV and will admit R kelly has made some ok songs in the past but this whole thing is just dumb. Lets start with the lyrics bad bad bad. And as for the ending when a guy comes through the door. Errrr is that supposed to be shocking or something. Get with the times man.I cant believe this has been released or that anyone would even like it. My advice Go out and buy some real music with proper lyrics like Juliana hatfield, the early feminist music by liz phair or any singer or band with original thought provoking lyrics. This stuff belongs in the bargain bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regular Ole Pied Piper","review":"I could listen to \\"Remote Control\\" all day. That song is so soulful for me. I got ready to quit my job, went on break, listened to that song, and calmed right down. That's how serious it is. This cd is a regular ole R. Kelly cd, full of soul, laughs, and freak nasty lyrics (Note: R., it's okay to leave some details out...I really didn't need to know you toss salad). The \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" DVD was entertaining and the guy who plays the woman's husband did a great acting job. The only problem is once you know all five parts, you're really not trying to hear it again. It loses its flair. \\"In the Kitchen\\" and \\"Kickin' it with your girlfriend\\" were great songs too! I didn't care for \\"Playa's Only\\" or \\"Happy Summertime\\"--too cliche. But other than that, this cd is just what I expected--a great listen.On \\"Put my T-Shirt On\\" at 3:51 time frame, I could listen to him do that \\"Eee ee ee ee ee ee\\" over and over again too."},{"rating":"1","title":"R KELLY'S WORST ALBUM!","review":"R Kelly's third instalment of the Twelve Play albums is downright horrible.Listening to this album gave me the impression that he lacked inspiration while he was recording it.Most of the songs are crass and forgettable.The only highlight of the album are the melodramatic chapters of \\"Trapped in the Closet\\".Overall this is a below-average album."},{"rating":"1","title":"TP.3.COM RELOADED NEED TO EMPTY IT'S CLIP!","review":"This is the weakest album in R Kelly's catalog. This album much like many of the reviewers say. It's nothing but a product of pure sex without any substance nor much inspiration. With it's unimaginative sexual themes dominating the album, it feels more like a poorly written erotic thriller or your typical porno movie for that matter.For sex starved teenagers going through puberty, this album will be of interest to them. But for a grown and mature audience, this album is juvenile and immature.R.Kelly need to find some meaningful inspiration and rebound in a major way on his next release. Otherwise he's going to keep making albums like this.Pass on this disc. You can get better smut out of a Playboy Magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only five good songs on here","review":"And they're all titled \\"Trapped in the Closet\\".

This album has its r-kelly moments but he should have chose another title for the album. 12 play and TP-2 were creative albums and had a sex feel to them. this album you actually have to search for it. there are 19 tracks and about 14 you will never listen to after the first time. ovarall as much as i love kel's music i could have saved the money to get a haircut or something.

ALOT MORE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get all the hype","review":"I'm sorry, but I don't see what all the hype is about on R.Kelly's album. The only song I bang on occassions is \\"Playas Only\\" w/Game. The rest of the album is trash to me. The \\"Trapped In The Closet\\" series was old and played out before the album was even released. Maybe if I was a sex addict I would be able to relate to the album more w/ songs like \\"Sex In The Kitchen.\\" WTF? My food is made in a damn kitchen, I would hope no sex took place in the same spot. A know tha Brotha was tryna express his feelings, but damn, calm down a lil bit. For now, i'm sticking with my opionion of the album being trash.

I don't smoke, I ain't a \\"playa\\" and I believe sex is a special thing. Smokin, sexin' etc...is not my thing at all. This CD is not what I thought is was and after listening ...it's not what I think it could have been!!! If there is a follow-up without the \\"Parental\\" sticker, I will buy that one. Until then, this CD will sit in my collection until I get the strength to throw it out. $14.96 out the window!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TP-3 Reloaded","review":"I bought this album last Friday. I love this album absolutely. This album combimes all sides of his various musical personas to create a complex drama of sex and love in the heart of the city. This album is fashioned as a series of booty shaking beats,romantic romps and dramatic flair. This album is naughty fun for the bump n grind crews,sweet love for romantics and high drama for those soap opera watchers. This album will be promoted highly.

This album is just terrible, no other word for it. Monotonous drivel served up by R. to make some more money out of his loyal fans under the guise of another \\"12 Play\\" album. Yeah right!For one making 5 'chapters' of the same song is just rediculous. R seems to be all out of ideas these days and seems to want to insult us by releasing this rubbish. R&B; is in a state and R.Kelly seems to be leading the charge, what happened to all the soul? What happened to somebody actually writing a song that meant something? I'm tired of defending R&B; music and I give up because albums like this just make it impossible. In fact nearly every album realesed these days makes it impossible.

This all shows he wasn't sincere about his spirituality. All the praise and glorifying was just relief of being given a free pass for using the wrong thing as a urinal.I admit I was intrigued and entertained with Trapped in the Closet; but the continuations are just getting more and more ridiculous. To continue to extend the installments until you eventually get to Chapter 100 (which seems to be his plan to hear him tell it) is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Do You Expect","review":"R. Kelly has a one track mind. He is a very basic artist that only talks about sex and really nothing else. Don't get me wrong I like R. Kelly and I think some of his songs are good but the man has mental problems. Yes we all seen him on the award show acting out his play by himself, talking to imaginary people pistol wippin air. I seriously think R. Kelly need some medical attention. His music is good but R. Kelly should concentrate more on himself do some soul searching because he's sick. I'm not even going to touch on his double life. We all have seen the tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool with me","review":"Alright Reginald, you turned an album review from a musical critique to something that had nothing to do with what he was trying to achieve, it's an album meant for some slow grindin not cruisin around up to lookout point. Since I've been listening to R.Kelly I don't ever recall him straying too far from the current style he is using today, and using Marvin Gaye as an example of nothing but romantic music you've never heard Marvin's \\"Here, my dear\\" album.R.

They claim that this is the greatest urban opera since what Micheal Jackson did. Athough I have never actually watched what Micheal did, I know enough about it to know that Trapped in a closet does not compare to it. The next time you listen to Trapped in a closet, listen to the lyrics. They are so bad that it is funny. Literally. My 4 year old cousin could write better lyrics. I, a 13-yr old(didnt bother with filling out stuff)skinny white boy could write better lyrics, easily. Maybe the rest of this album is better, but I wouldn't know(I haven't heard it).

Everyone seems to be looking at this from a prospective that he's some kind of lounge act, or wannabe jazz band. Truth is he's a part of the earliest forms of punk rock music. James Chance encompasses the entire attitude of the adolescent New York street dwellers. He's a symbol of teenage lust, hate, confusion, and jealousy. The idea that his music is horrible makes it so much better, the fact that he can't play sax gives it that flair that seperates it from others. He's bad, he knows it, and guess what? He doesn't care. James Chance is a peek at what the kids of New York were thinking, doing, and loving.

What makes this book seem real, is the fact that the 2 main characters( Jez and Morgead) make you believe they belong together. No offense to the other Nightworld series, but as an avid reader, you have to believe why these two characters should be soulmates. Jez and Morgead have a complex, but love-hate relationship with heated chemistry. In the other books, (even though I love them) you don't really see the chemistry between the characters. This book seemed real enough to look at these characters' love for each other. Now what is taking so long for Strange Fate to come out?

This is the first of the 'Wild Power' Night World books. In this one, Jez has to search for a Wild Power and to do so has to rejoin her old gang who have evidence of a sighting of one. This book has a great surprise ending and Jez is a brillant character who really comes alive. The only thing I don't like is her soulmate, Morgread. He doesn't suit her.

She never rises above her circumstances; indeed she spends much of the book feeling sorry for herself. Readers want a protagonist they can identify with, somebody who makes the best of a situation and tells her enemies how wrong they are. Instead Mokie just wallows in self pity.

I installed another 128MB of SDRAM, now I'm happy with my computers performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"McAfee Office is ...","review":"I installed McAfee Office for my Window ME, 1 Ghz, 60 Gbyte computer. Nothing but trouble. Since I installed it, my computer won\`t start. It feezes since right from starting the computer. I tried to uninstall it, but because my computer freezes right from the start, I have a hard time with it. I spent so much time to figure it out. I even couldn\`t do my homework because my computer won\`t work at all. Now I am using the computer in my school library. I really want to let you know, do NOT buy McAfee. I will try to get Norton instead. And when I get back home, I\`ll try to do recovery for my computer, which is that I have to delete all my program files and install everything from the beginning again. See if my computer will take to start the recovery software. If not, I will have to find a technician to do it. McAfee is ...!!! I am very mad.

Despite this sounding like the primal hero's journey of Joseph Campbell, in actuality this is nothing more than an extended quest for Tadaka to do silly, lethal hat tricks. He befriends natives of the Shadowlands, the hellish locale where Junzo lurks, but they somehow prove inept at surviving their own front lawn. When Tadaka finally catches up with Junzo, the leaps of logic simply pile up. Then, magically, Tadaka is transformed into something EVIL. No mucking about here; Tadaka goes from an obsessed, but good, priest to a demon-worshipping man who murders his best friend.Sound bad? That's not all. No fewer than four other major protagonists populating this book.Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight legs","review":"Not as good as the sturdy units I ah purchased from BB & B, whcih has sold looking frame instaed of this one with \\"thinnish\\" legs.

When it is folded up, what is holding the straps in place is a single heavy duty staple on each strap. It you are storing the rack where it is visible when it is folded up, it looks ugly and cheap because of this. I also question how effective this will be long term -- a staple -- instead of the straps beings sewn together. If the box wasn't gone already, I would return it.

Both of these works are now about 30 years old, but they sound new.One caveat: although Lerdahl's first quartet stands on its own, his second quartet is related, connected to it. It would be good for the two quartets to be released together on the same CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Starting Point","review":"I knew my family name, the county we hailed from, and that WB Yeats was the worst thing to ever happen to Irish culture. But I knew nothing about actual Irish history. So I hopped on this site, compared titles and reviews and picked this.It's general, and easy to understand. No mythology except for a few short recountings of ancient battles. It can wander a bit into High School text Book territory, but it's informative and well organized.I reccomend this as THE place to start when you want to learn about Ireland. Best thing I learned is that the Irish were the only society to successfully repel the Romans and trade with them. Cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aimed at the American nostalgia market","review":"This book bears little relation to the TV series, being more the author's personal travelogue than a useful survey of the archeaology. It is probably better aimed at the American nostalgia market, rather than anyone with a genuine interest in Ireland, historical or modern. A small book - the size, but not the thickness, of a paperback - with few pictures, I felt it was poor value for money. I would, however, strongly recommend the 3-part TV series which it accompanied, which successfully combined academic rigour with stunning visuals, and delightful vignettes of modern throwbacks to more ancient ways of life (DVD Region 1 only, alas)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps the \\"famine\\" lie alive.","review":"In Search of Ancient Ireland compiles in a popular way what has been promoted for the past half-century. This includes its description of the 1845-1850 Irish Holocaust (or genocide, or extermination) as \\"famine.\\" One of McCaffrey's spokespersons recently responded to my objection to her perpetuation of \\"famine\\" regarding Ireland by accusing me of not having read her books. But in this book she refers to it exclusively (and falsely) as \\"famine,\\" and does so three times (on page 52); therefore it can hardly be said that she is a dependable historian even if she eschews the \\"famine\\" falsehood in her other books and contradicts in them what she wrote in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs editing!","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It fails for two reasons.First it has been downloaded without any subsequent editing. For example words beginning with \\"R\\" are written as \\"B\\"s - so we are told of the Boman (Roman) Empire, Dalraiba (Dalriada), Bussia (Russia), baided (raided). The Book of Kells is frequently referred to as the Book of Kelts. Words are frequently hyphenated for no good reason. Spelling of the same Irish names are spelled many different ways - some very obviously wrong.Second the book is meant as a companion to the PBS television program and does not work well as a stand alone.This could easily been a much better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview","review":"Overall this is a good overview of ancient Irish history. Since there is a limited amount of material from which to draw in the prehistoric era, the author has to overcome a lack sources and still present the information in an informative way. This is accomplished by relating personal anecdotes from his journey across Ireland. He attempts to make people long dead come to life for the reader by presenting archaeological evidence of their homes and music. He then presents the history of Irish kings and heroes and their struggles for power which results in the English invasion and reshapes the destiny of Ireland. But if you are looking for something highly detailed, this is not for you. This is a good read that presents a nice overview of ancient Ireland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and well written","review":"I just got this book as a gift and practically read it in one sitting. I could not put it down. It gives such fine details about the origins of the Irish and the earliest Irish history going back to pre-historic times. I learned more from this than from the Cahill book which disappointed me. There is much more detail here about the actual day to day life in the Irish monasteries plus the new archeological evidence on the Celtic presence in Ireland. Much recommended as a great read for anyone interested in how the Irish developed and what Ireland was like prior to the English invasion. BTW this is the first time I was able to see written out clearly - and understand - the events that surrounded the invasion by the English in the twelfth century. Excellent scholarship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic repair kit","review":"Like a dunderhead I ran over some roofing nails with my kubota tractor and the tires kept going flat every 2 days.

Can't say what it'll do for a car, but the tractor weighs more then a ton itself so I have confidence that this would perform well on an automobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important Information!","review":"I got a flat and called my motorcycle mechanic to check and see if I could/should use the Slime plug product. He said, \\"No\\", because I have a bike with spoke tires, therefore I have a tube in the tire, and so slime won't work. He's just gonna change out the tube. I'm new to motorcycling and don't know stuff like that. So I hope the info helps. BTW the tires on my bike have the words \\"tubeless\\" printed on the outer sidewall, but my mechanic says that all Japanese bikes with spoke tires ( I ride a Suzuki Savage) use tubes. So apparently I have tubeless tire shells with tubes on the inside. More good information for a novice. Lastly, I only rated this product a 1/5 stars in the hopes that it would catch people's attention with this important info. This might be a great product for tires that are compatible.

Even worse, the description also says: Buy Dog Houses and trade them in for Big Bones. Before this arrived I purchased extra houses and bones on e-bay because I had read that there isn't always enough houses. At one time the parts were apparently better than they are now. Now it includes wooden beads like you would string on twine for a pre-K craft project instead of dog houses and and tiny wooden bones. Even the dice are made of wood and you can barely see the dots.

The winner is determined by luck, there is no skill involved in winning this or any game of monopoly. The game hardly fits into a single evening of play, and for a few unlucky players who exit early that means either sitting around watching or finding something else to do (This may be a blessing if it means not playing anymore).So to anyone who is buying this to play it (not because you are a huge dog fan and must own everything that has a dog on it) I recommend that you look into a better product.I would start by going to Google and searching on \\"board game\\".

Would not hesitatein recommending this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, terrible","review":"I have difficulty even giving this pan one star. My old cake pan was shot & my daughter bought me a new Calphalonpan to replace it. The first angel food cake I made not only got too dark, but I ended up taking the cake out inpieces & throwing them away. It stuck worse than any pan I've ever used. I subsequently bought a Wilton aluminum pan & it is wonderful by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undecided","review":"Just received my pan. Has a small sharp dent in side of pan.

This tube pan is now in my trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but...","review":"I have had trouble getting orange sponge cakes to release on the bottom. They cook perfectly, taste good, but I finally had to grease around the tube-base and around the outer edge of the bottom (definitely doesn't work if your grease the entire bottom... the cake collapses). I tried switching toChicago Metallic Professional 2-Piece Angel Food Cake Pan with Feetthinking that I could cut the bottom out after separating the tube/bottom from the sides... but that pan definitely doesn't work, IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed with \\"angel\\"","review":"I was so excited to receive this pan, but find that it bakes the cakes too brown when following standard instructions on cake mix box. And the cakes are always very dark on the top, and although the cake doesn't stick to the pan, it really makes the pan hard to clean. Need to bake at a lower temp. on the top oven rack, if your able to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness for frosting...","review":"The first time I used this pan, I was baking a black and white angel food cake for a dinner party last winter. The pan cooked evenly and the cake tasted wonderful. However, the cake stuck to the pan terribly. You can slide a knife around the sides and the tube, but you can't do that along the bottom of the pan. I spent an hour trying to get the cake out of the pan, and when it finally came out, it sure wasn't pretty. Frosting saved the day, because after twelve straight hours in the kitchen, I certainly didn't have time to start over.I've tried it a few more times since, spraying the pan with non-stick spray, baking shorter, baking longer... nothing helps. The pan sticks, and since it is all one piece, there's no hope of the cake just sliding out.Do yourself a favor - skip this one, and buy a regular two-piece pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect cake pan","review":"I had reservations about buying an angel food cake pan, all in one, as opposed to two pieces. But after baking the first cake, I am hooked! Perfect! It popped out with no trouble...I'm impressed with the sturdy metal, it will not ever bend and leak (as the 2-piece did). Thank you Calphalon.

I won't waste time w/ details, but if you are looking for serious or somewhat believable scenerio with an intriguing plot, pass on this. The animation and Eng.

But no, no no, not one single element interested me, boring characters Long winded dialogue about carbon credits and economical fail. Some people will Problibly love this and thats great. I hated what I saw to the point if there being no reason at all for me to even continue truging through more painful watching. What point us there after all when one finds absolutly no entertainment in the first 6 episodes. Thats a fail in my notebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading level of the book","review":"The text is of medium reading level, although sometimes the extensive introduction to terms is unavoidable in introductory texts.

In Part 4 (Chapter 18~20), Current Microeconomic Issues, the authors address important topics that have recently emerged as major economic issues, including health-care reform, immigration, urban problem and crime, and welfare reform. All this, together with those Issues and Debate boxes, may greatly facilitate our attempt to make the course more attractive to the principle students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music from Europe!","review":"Feel like in the bullring!

This recording ofthe Berlioz Symphonie Fantastique from Munch and the BSO from1954 is a classic! Charles Munch and the Boston Symphony recorded many of Berlioz's best works for RCA Red Seal, this and the Requiem are some of their best efforts. Munch's 1954recording is really a romp, at just over 46 minutes you get a really fast performance, but you never get the feeling of being rushed. As icing on the cake, RCA includes the Love Scene fromRomeo et Juliette Op. 17 as a filler, and what a filler! Some of Berlioz's best music. Now perhaps the RCA people will fufill my next wish and issue Erich Leinsdorf's Living Stereo recordingof Mozart's \\" Don Giovanni\\" on SACD. Along with Maestro Leinsdorf's recording with the BSO on Richard Strauss's \\" Ein Heldenleben\\" . As for this SACD If you don't already have a recording of the Symphonie Fantastique this is a good one to add to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better than this!","review":"Charles Munch's performance of this old warhorse to me cannotbe outdone. I have read many glowing reviews of Davis/Concertgebouw,but have never heard it. Maybe someday Iwill break down and buy it,but Munch just seems to have theright idea. I like the sound of the bells in the 4th movement.Someone told me years back that they were crafted for Munchper his specifications. With the DSD remastering and SACD theexcitement is even better. Shame on RCA for taking so long toreissue this treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not the best.","review":"When I first heard this recording on CD it did not impress me at all. I had already owned the 1962 version by Munch and the Boston symphony on a 1988 gold labeled RCA Victrola CD which had far superior sonics (and performance). The remastering for this SACD has greatly improved the sound - but not enough to displace '62 performance which still sounds better and I still like the performance better. For me the only advantage this cd has over the '62 is the sound and use of the bells. From the March to the Scaffold to the Witches Sabbath the orchestral playing is more intense and visceral in the later performance. The brass in particular in the '54 recording is anemic by comparison but this may be a problem with how it was recorded rather than the performance itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The febrile incandescence!","review":"The close relationship between Charles Munch and Hector Berlioz, was much more a happy coincidence. The narrow affinity aroused due the sumptuous and elegant baton of this Alsatian conductor, who always knew to depict a gallant and incandescent Berlioz, conferring an aura that transcended the arcane vision of the inflamed Romantic composer, bewitched by his flaming love. This Fantastic remains among the most expressive and refulgent ever recorded. Besides the fact we are talking the Boston Symphony is additionally another important factor to take into account. The European taste emanated by this one thousand carats ensemble and those expressive and radiant strings section was obviously a determining factor that even accented with major blaze the enraptured state of mind of his febrile composer.Don' t miss this superb version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminisce","review":"Great - soft, easy listening.

It helps young (and old) lovers focus on the realization that the honeymoon doesn't last forever; eventually reality steps in. Love doesn't conquer all, and better to discuss the problems before the marriage rather than after the divorce. The book is written in a wonderful manner which encourages dialogue on various situations which may affect the union at some point in the future. Obviously the book cannot anticipate or address every possible event.
