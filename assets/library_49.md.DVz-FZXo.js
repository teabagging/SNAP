I had lesser expectations for the Scooba, and it failed even them. The remanufactured Scooba simply didn't work, straight out of the box. I knew about the need to prime the pump, which I did, but I kept getting the blue light which means that you need to check the tank, etc. I checked the tank about 18 times, reprimed, etc. Finally, after fooling with the thing for about 45 minutes, it started to move around in a spiral. After about 2 minutes, I realized it wasn't laying down any solution, so AGAIN I primed the pump. At that point, the Scooba went back to the blue light, and I gave up (after another half hour). So, I sent it right back to Amazon, and they were great about the return.

After months of trying to find reviews saying anything about laminate floors, I finally found one. The truth is, scooba leaves a trail of water behind it as it goes, but it dries in less than five minutes, and it has made life so much easier. I highly recommend Scooba (and Roomba)!! I especially recommend them for pet owners whose pets hate when they do housework (like my yorkie who barks at any form of housework, especially mops and vacuums). They do a great job of cleaning up, and even amuse my puppy!Also don't be worried about the \\"remanufactured\\" irobots they're great, no problems and they save you money in the process.

I did everything as the manual said, and finally it worked when I poured its cleaning solution. I thought the solution was so important so I purchased a dozen. And then I used it for couple months, the battery died. I only used the Scooba once a week when it worked and it's not over a year yet since I purchased.

One worked reasonably well. (It completes a cycle, and sucks up about half the water it puts out. I'm guessing that's roughly expected behavior). The other, sucked up none to just barely a tablespoon of water every time we ran it. Additionally, this defective scooba would *always* run out of battery before finishing a full cycle (it never went into the drying mode where the cleaning light flashes, and every time there was nearly a half cup to a cup of liquid left in the clean tank).Considering we followed the manuals to the letter, and one works and one doesn't, I doubt this is user error.For the price, I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bluetooth Applications Developer's Guide","review":"This book contains an introductory overview of Bluetooth, followed by an assortment Bluetooth topics.

This book does NOT accomplish that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic for developers","review":"As a Bluetooth baseband and applications developer, I found this book too basic to make much use out of. The only thing that I found useful is that they give some performance numbers here and there. My advice to you is to borrow this book for a quick thumb through and throw it away. The other Bluetooth book by Jennifer Bray, Bluetooth connect without cable, is even worse. You might as well read the spec itself, which is more precise and informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy's Best","review":"This CD rates as Jimmy D. Lane's best effort to date. Stevie's band Double Trouble brind out the best in Jimmy. The playing is tight and Lane's voice has never sounded better.

If your a fan of blues rock this one is worth spending a few $'s on."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 STARS PLUS","review":"After reading the reviews I bought a copy of Jimmy's cd and I agree this is a gem. He has great tone and excellent vocals, he's just a great blues man. Tommy and Chris do a great job backing him, this is very clean and well produced.

Donny Fenn is a great addition to Swagger. Julie is the girl back home that every boy in \\"Nam\\" kept in his mind. A great story that kept me on the edge of my seat! A man like Swagger can never rest easy, he has too many demons that will not let him rest...long live Swagger! All of Mr. Hunters books are great, but the Swagger saga is an American classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sniping is NOT a good thing...","review":"Stephen Hunter's attempt to keep the hero worship of Bob the Nailer going is tired and overblown. Hunter manufactured outlandish plot devices in this book in a vain effort to maintain interest. Black Light and Point of Impact were taut, credible, and compelling, but A Time to Hunt was just one book too many. Enough of sniping, Mr. Hunter - time to come up with something new!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks depth, lots of implausible happenings","review":"This wasn't up to his Point of Impact & Dirty White Boys.

I'm not done yet, but too many things are stretched way too thin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting Tale of a Sacred Killer","review":"Somewhere in this book a character refers to hero Bob Swagger as \\"a sacred killer\\" -- someone who kills for righteous reasons. Which is a most accurate description of Swagger in this irrestible book which scoops you up at the beginning and doesn't release you till the last page. Of course, Swagger is a superman: larger than life. Fallible, but too much or too often. This whole book -- as the title accurately describes -- is all about a hunt, but Hunter drops in so many surprises along the way that it keeps you interested. It's not a perfect book, however. In some places things get a little silly and as in any Hunter book, the technical details about guns and shooting can overwhelm you. I found it the best of the three Hunter books I've read so far (the others: Point of Impact and Dirty White Boys). All in all, it's a very good book which will keep you enthralled throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I know.","review":"What I liked about time to hunt was it tied alot of things up from point of impact.

If you have read any Bob Swagger books this is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Hunter's novel but not the last one","review":"I am far frow being addicted to war novels.

What a storyteller. I usually read a few pages around bedtime but was up until 2:00 am the night I finished it. The ending was great. I hope when they start making Swagger movies they start here and work back. How 'bout Tommy Lee Jones. This is also the best look at Viet Nam I have seen to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter is the master!","review":"Well, this book was yet another glorious installment of the Bob the Nailer saga. I dare to say that Hunter is the best thriller writer in the business today. His books are just pumping with action. The battle of An Loc when Swagger and Fenn takes on the NVA battalion may be the best battle scene in print today. Seriously. When I was thinking about what Hunter should do with The Nailer now that he is getting on in years, I thought about what Clancy did with Mr.Clark, bringing him back to his Vietnam/Vigilante days. Without Remorse is probably one of Clancy's best works, rarer and rarer nowadays, and a Swagger in Nam book might just work great. Let's see how he racked up the numbers and got his name! I was a little disapointed to discover that Hot Springs will involve Earl Swagger, but I have no doubt that Hunter will come up spades!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunt this One!","review":"Once again, Stephen Hunter has put together an amazing novel of both literary cohesion and action. I loved this book and all of its predecessors in the \\"Bob the Nailer\\" series. Each book gets better than the previous one. I cannot wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sniper vs. Sniper","review":"Stephen Hunter really brings the tension in this Bob Lee Swagger installment. I frequently found this book to be stronger than some of the earlier titles in the series. If you're into snipers, this book delves deeper than its predecessors into sniper strategy and technique. There is a lot less good vs evil vs really evil and more characters driven by dedication to mission, which I found refreshing. We don't see the Russian sniper as a necessarily bad guy-- in fact we frequently see parallels between him and Swagger as men on the opposite ends of geopolitics who share an intense sense of duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time To Hunt","review":"Although the author was never involved in the Vietnam conflict it is obviously that he did a lot of research and interviews, for his detailed descriptions were extremely accurate. Stephen Hunter has the ability to make the story read like non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st read in Swagger series","review":"I stumbled across Time to Hunt looking for a military/thriller book, and am happy to have discovered this author and the Bob Lee Swagger series. The prose is not great, and Hunter is no Pat Conroy, but he does provide good context, locale, and character development.For me, the story flow is pretty choppy, and one has to follow back and forth in time and place. The author does create plots and subplots, a little intrigue, and some reader confusion and questions about \\"what's what?\\" But, he gives interesting context about weapons, Vietnam, and our men in the war.If you like military or police books, Dan Brown, W.E.B. Griffin, or James Webb's Fields of Fire and like to see a hero kicking a**, this one's for you. I liked it a lot and am buyingI, Sniper (Bob Lee Swagger Novels), now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never A Dull Moment","review":"In the prolog of this book, there is a very startling development. Bob Lee Swagger is shot in the chest by a sniper while out horseback riding with his wife and daughter. The reader is drawn into the following story, eager to discover what led to this devastating outcome. The story centers on the war in Vietnam and the peace demonstrations in Washington DC. Then the scene shifts to Washington DC and the post-war political intrigue. Bob Lee Swagger is looking for answers while his life is being threatened. There are several twists and surprises in this story. Just when the reader thinks he has it all figured out, the story takes a whole new direction. Things aren't settled until the very last page. A lot of edge-of-your-seat suspense and well-plotted action. Never a dull moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"What makes Bob Lee Swagger tick","review":"As the third and it would appear final Bob Lee Swagger novel, we learn of the situation which took the life of his Vietnam buddy, Donny Fenn. In a great plot which spans nearly 30 years, Hunter ties up the loose ends from his previous novels 'Point Of Impact\\", and \\"Black Light\\".Bob Lee Swagger is a true American hero who operated in the black cloud of an unpopular war. Stephen Hunter has brought the Vietnam vet to the literary front with dignity and honor. I love these novels and have hoped that there might be another Bob Lee story in the wings. This is action fiction with international intrigue and a meaningful backstory of the strength of family in an impossible situation at its best. Hunter is king and the action thriller is his realm. Long live the king!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard to put down thriller.","review":"This is the first book by Hunter I have read. I found this to be an intelligent thriller that was hard to put down. You find yourself pulling for swagger throughout the book. I will make it a point to read more of his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter High","review":"Having four hours and a late red-eye to Vegas, along with two chagrined adjacent passengers, Stephen Hunter's latest is a page turner. Not only does he continue to expand the anthology, but he pulls in my other favorite reread of his, Day before Midnight. Yeah, its thin in spots, but it brings together past of Gunny Sgt Bob Swagger with his legend. We forget Viet Nam War went on both shores and both are forever intertwined. I wonder where the author goes next, but I'll be reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to HUNT","review":"I;m 13 years old. I've always wanted to be a Marine sniper. I've been reading similar authors like T. Clancy, J.R. Garber, and D. Brown, but this book is at the top of my list. It's the first I've read by Hunter and he's the best. Bob Lee is not one of those pretty boy action heros that always wins. He has his own share of personal problems. If you haven't read anything else, read the following: READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I almost quite reading before I got to the better parts.","review":"This book is a slow starter and its beginning is a lot to swallow. It gets more interesting and much more believeable once we arrive back in Nam but the whole thing was a little too contrived. This is one to many \\"Bob the Nailer\\" books."},{"rating":"1","title":"no credibility","review":"There's a reason authors are supposed to do research. It's so readers who have familiarity with the things he touches on will be able to continue to suspend their disbelief. Mr. Hunter did fine with me until he moved the setting to central Idaho. He must think no one in Idaho is taught to read and he was too lazy to find out anything about the town where he set the climax of the book. This was the first of his books I've read and the last because his credibility is so shot full of holes with me that I couldn't possibly take anything he writes seriously now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat out boring","review":"I selected Time to Hunt after reading the thrilling reviews I read here. Boy, was I in for a thrilling disappointment. Though I forced myself to finish reading Time To Hunt; I found the story to be flat out dull, boring, if not moronic in the descriptions used for the characters. I found nothing interesting, nor thrilling about Time to Hunt, it was just a complete of my reading pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIME TO HUNT IS A NO-NO!!!!!!!!!!1","review":"This is the ninth Hunter book I have read. This is theworst one of them.Ihought Tapestry of Spies was bad but at least I finished it. in Time to Hunt I finally hung it up after reading 109 pages. The prologue was great and I thought, this is going to be anothergood one. The next 109 pages were all about Donny Fenn. Nothing else about Bob Lee Swagger. I guess he showed up later but I figured after 109 pages and no Bob I would leave it be. I still think Master Sniper, Point of Impact, Black Light and others I have read were very, very good. Time to Hunt was just bad, bad, in my humble openion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definate must-read!","review":"Like everyone else, I also thought it started a little slow, but once the storyline actually kicked in, it was really worth it. The details of the time spent in Vietnam was awesome! I fell in love with the character of Donny Fenn, and Swagger was at his usual heroic self. I recommend this book as well as Point of Impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too pro-peace movement","review":"The \\"peace\\" movement protestors come across as being so much smarter and more aware and more humane than the \\"dupes\\" who served in the military. As soon as the draft ended so did the demonstrations against the war, demonstrating that their primary concern was for their own selves not for the Vietnamese or our military. As in so many books about Vietnam, the fact that we were fighting International Communism, an ideology that was responsible for over a 100 million lives is lost or forgotten. Strategically, we were right to be in Vietnam. It was the tactics of the politicians and the military leadership that lost the war. The \\"Peace \\" movement was comprised of useful idiots and communists who contributed to to the advancement of one of the most destructive forces in world history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare Early Appearance by The Concert Jazz Band","review":"The Swiss label TCB has made available much of the live concert jazz recorded for local radio broadcast in the 1950's and 1960's. This performance found the band in fine form. Dig the frenetic, yet swinging, solo on Mulligan's \\"The Apple Core\\" by Zoot Sims. Ben Webster's \\"Go Home\\" is particularly pleasing with fine solos by Gerry, Zoot, Bob Brookmeyer, Jim Reider and Mulligan again. Duke's \\"I'm Gonna Go Fishin'\\" became a head piece for the band. Don Ferrara, Reider, Brookmeyer, and Mulligan highlight this swinging performance from Montreaux.If you're a big band jazz fan, you should have at least something from this somewhat unusual 13 piece pianoless group. This would not be a bad place to start - although several other titles are currently available. Incidently, this performance is more inspired than the Paris-Olympia concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"It at least teaches how to read instructions, I suppose","review":"When it began at the end of the seventies, the Lego Space range started as inventive and highly flexible - you could build all manner of things out of even small sets. This high quality progressed throughout the eighties and early-to-mid nineties. But in recent years lego space sets have become very tacky and gimmicky. There were the hologram stickers and the red/blue filters of the Exploriens sets, which were fair enough. But more recently space sets have employed the use of big specialized pieces which limit scope for alternative building and often make the sets look ugly and clunky. The eyes, pre-printed wings and light-and-sound box can really only be used in Insectoid sets, the insect-person minifig looks ridiculous and the use of magnets to hold those two little ships in place makes the whole thing far too wobbly and unstable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did nothing for my eyelashes","review":"What a waste of time and money.

Started using it on DOS, have purchased most upgrades and loved them all BUT 2003 Premier is terrible. I was using Checkfree to pay bills electronically and was forced to upgrade Quicken AND change to Quicken Bill Pay as Checkfree has some altered relationship w/ Intuit. It seems a main objective of the program is to advertise Intuit services and get you to go online-not keep my books in my house. The reconcile feature is terrible--cursor bounces all over, impossible to use the keyboard to scroll, blocks of entries become checked or unchecked at random.It is so bad that I am going to look for an alternate program and this from someone who has over 10 years of personal and business data on Quicken."},{"rating":"1","title":"not ready for action yet","review":"I have used quicken since 1996, for the most part i have like it.

It wastes both money and time to use this software to track capital gains."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems for me!","review":"As a long time user of Quicken, I almost didn't upgrade from 98 basic to 2003 because of shaky reviews. However, it handled my old data transfer just fine. I've not had a problem....basically jumped on and started using. I'd give it 5 stars, but I haven't done that much with it yet. I have set up a new loan and worked with checking & savings accounts (data entry to reconciliation.) So far so good!

Quicken 2003 has adopted a Microsoft-style \\"do it our way\\" format that makes their product harder to use.This user unfriendly version takes away user control of the desktop, and much of the intuitive navigation that made earlier versions winners.2002 was a vintage year for Quicken, but the 2003 version should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the breeze it used to be","review":"I have always loved Quicken programs, but no more. Having installed 2003 Basic on my new computer a few weeks ago and hating it ever since, I am literally throwing it away and going for something new. When I said I wanted Basic, that is what I meant. Instead, the register page is so cluttered with extras, I can barely see the register and there is no way to hide the extras. The program prompts me to connect to the internet constantly and there is no way to get it to stop. It uploads, downloads, reconfigures, gives me messages that says my account balances don't match those on Quicken.com. huh? How did they get my account balances? Intuit has no real support. For example the support department is closed on weekends. I don't know about you, but that is when I balance my finances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated in Seattle","review":"I read the comments from the 2003 users where people suggested buying the 2002 version-I did buy Quicken 2002-and it[s bad] too! I can't imagine how bad the 2003 version must be that people thought this was better. From what I can tell, Quicken Basic is just a tool the company uses to sell you more expensive software that might be useful and [pull] you into using their financial services. IT IS A MARKETING TOOL FOR QUICKEN-NOT SOFTWARE YOU SHOULD PAY FOR! Anything you try to do, Basic will tell you can't do, unless you upgrade to Deluxe. In addition, my overall impression is that Quicken despises their customers. I cannot imagine using a company with such low morals to handle my portfolio. This software won't do anything your bank's Internet site can't do, other than put all your information in one place. You will be disappointed if you actually pay for this software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different product instead","review":"I'm afraid I have to agree with Ivan Thompson's review. This product is not ready for action. Or maybe it's Intuit that's not ready anymore. I've used Quicken for more years than I can remember, have upgraded frequently, and have been happy with the choice. However, this 2003 version installed badly and did not allow me to register the product, which in turn meant I would not be able to use it to retrieve bank and credit card transactions from the Internet. There was no help to be found at the Intuit site, and no way to contact the company in a way that would evoke a response to my specific issue. Therefore, I'm going to have to go over to the other side -- i.e., Microsoft Money -- as much as I regret doing that. Intuit: Go back to being the friendly, supportive, and competent company that you used to be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quicken 2003 is a downgrade","review":"I've used Quicken for a number of years, and it generally worked OK. The interface was always a little quirky and you had to learn that certain operations never worked quite the way it seemed they should. However, I spent a few years overlooking that, until I decided to start using the online banking option. I bought the new version, Quicken 2003, and couldn't be less satisfied.My only serious gripe is that over half the time I select \\"Update Now\\", to download new transactions and upload new bill payment orders, Quicken crashes! I religiously patch it, load a web page first to make sure my cable modem hasn't gone to sleep, I stand on one leg, but to no avail: I invariably get a popup with the text \\"An OLB error has occurred in the last task ..\\" I press OK and it crashes.

I bought it knowing that if I did not like it I could return it within 60 days for a full refund. Well, I did not like it; the user interface was very complicated and difficult to navigate (I am a technical writer by profession), so I decided to return it. After sending three requests (via their website) requesting a refund, each request resulted in an automated email stating that I would receive a response within 48 hours. A month later and still no responses, I contacted American Express and asked them to take care of it. When I finally did get a response from the company, they reimbursed me for the incorrect amount.I've since tried Microsoft Money 2003, and love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No","review":"Intuit's attempt at putting advertising in a product that you are paying [$$] for is unacceptable. I have been a loyal Quicken user since the DOS versions, however this sneaky attempt by Intuit has made me re-think my loyalties. I ordered Quicken and promptly returned it upon learning of this unwelcome feature. If you are a current Quicken user, CONTINUE USING YOUR CURRENT VERSION. We can all tell Intuit to stop this invasion by boycotting their products until they remove the advertising or at least give us the option of disabling all advertising. As a result of my experience with this product, I will even discontinue my purchases of their Turbo-Tax software."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, enough with the yearly versions","review":"Getting a little sick of this strategy. The level of advertising associated with you using this product should more than offset treating the yearly upgrades as simple updates instead of having to pay for a whole new version. It's a great product, but hindered by advertising overload and an overly ambitious sales program. You really don't need this version, 2002 works fine. (As does 2001, 2000, etc....).

I have an ad taking up a good portion of my screen, and I cannot make it go away. It is inteferring with my ability to use my own financial records.I am also concerned that Quicken is uploading my personal financial information and/or installing spyware on my computer. Remember, Quicken is owned by Intuit, which also owns TurboTax. Before you buy any Quicken product, take a look at the reviews on TurboTax.Intuit used to make good software. They made a good product, and we paid a fair price. Now, they have turned their substantial talents the dark side. Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the 2002 version.","review":"I bought the 2003 version and was appalled by all the changes just so they could call it a update. It means you have to learn the program over again. They also denied my rebate because I didn't jump through the hoops just right. By the time I found out about not getting the rebate, it was too late to return it. I've used Quicken from version 4 for DOS, but will not buy again unless they change their greedy ways. So get a 2002 version instead, it's cheaper and better. I saved the quicken.ini file in the Windows directory using notepad, calling it quicken.txt. If I have to reinstall Quicken, I copy the paragraph under [Registration]from the original file and paste it in the new ini file. This allows full use without having to try to register it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Do Not Upgrade!","review":"They say that part of maturity is being able to admit mistakes. I was using Quicken 2000, and because of all of the great promises on the packaging I purchased Quicken 2003. I made a huge mistake.The upgrade does little that Quicken 2000 didn't already do, and 2003 is full of bugs and glitches. It crashes, freezes, and if it doesn't do that, then bizarre error messages pop up. Quicken customer service is terrible (when it isn't non-exisistent). Many of the on-line features either do not work or are completely useless. Worst of all, their are ads all over the place, and, of course, there is no way to remove them.Please -- save your time, money, and aggravation, and avoid this product at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm tired of the problems","review":"I'm tired of the problems with this software and the charge for customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use the $$ for an Upgrade to buy your wife dinner","review":"I had Quicken 2000 on an older machine and when I purchased a new one, I thought I might upgrade.

Old timers who have suffered through endless \\"upgrades\\" only to discover dropped features and bugs will be better served waiting for 2004.Unfortunately, I tried migrating to Money this year only to get a nebulous message stating that it encountered errors converting the Quicken data. What data and how many were not specified. Since I have stock transactions going back to 1987, I can't risk losing the data (unless I'm prepared to lose the ability to track investment performance and have access to basis information for future stock sales.)I won't bore you with a list of lost features or bugs, but a question for you euphoric reviewers: Can you cut and paste address line info from the Check Writing window?

There are so many ways to set up the screen that you can't find anything or do anything without searching through menus to see where it is. It is not intuitive at all. I've used this product (and Quickbooks) for years, so I'm familiar with the program. Now I get lost. Besides the unpleasant design of the software, it's also buggy.

Stay away from this software until they fix the interface and stabilize the bugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moved to Money","review":"I am glad I moved to Money. I highly recommend trying it out.

There are memory leaks that prevent using the product for over 8 hours on my computer before hanging and having to reboot (Quicken99).

My bank, however, just switched servers so that I can no longer update my transactions with two clicks of the mouse. Thanks to these reviews, I'm not going to waste my money and aggravate myself by buying 2003. I can still use the old method of downloading a .qif file and updating my bank transactions that way.If Intuit wants to sell me a new piece of software, they had better have something much better -- meaning a simple interface and NO advertisements! -- to offer in 2004 or 2005, when I'm willing to consider it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"pay money for ads!","review":"Opt for any Quicken edition (even the expensive Premier) and get inundated with ads.

I speculated that the people who wrote those reviews just never found the 'turn off the ads' option like Quicken 2002 had. It turns out the option isn't there.

Being a tenacious optimist, I keep updating the program in the hopes previous bugs would be fixed. THEY ARE NEVER FIXED! Quicken 2003 Deluxe is just as full of bugs as ever.

Last year I purchased Quicken 2002 Suite which included Quicken Deluxe, Turbo Tax, Quicken Lawyer, a free state and elec filing - all for $$$. What happened this year... no more suite, more Ads (from what I hear), and a dumbed down interface that isn't as flexible.

Good service leads to profitability and it sounds as if 2003 fails in that regard. (Please note, I have not tried it, nor do I intend to now. It sounds like a waste of money.)When I see customer comments that Quicken is doing the job it it supposed to do, and it is clear they have cleaned up the idiosyncracies, I will consider upgrading.

When you've got a problem, you might as well try contacting the man on the moon.As far as I can tell, \\"upgrade\\" to the folks at Quicken means to add some tail-fins and call it \\"improved\\". Well, I'm mad as ... and I'm not gonna take it any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I was going to transfer from an EOM version of Money 99 to Quicken 2003. There were too many problems switching, plus you CAN'T TURN OFF THE ADS! I returned this item and got Money 2003, which is great, and YOU CAN TURN OFF THE ADS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great, worth upgrading","review":"Pros: The new interface is clean and intuitive. Intuit has seriously rethought the product's design and they got it right. Quicken 2003 delivers a lot of information without cluttering the screen. Fantastic investment tools. Upgrade process went very smoothely.Cons: Too many ads. Don't like Accounts and Calendar listings popping up in child windows. Don't completely understand why the 'Banking Center' is now the 'Cash Flow Center'. Can no longer do online updates in the background.Verdict: With Quicken 2003, Intuit has redeemed itself after its shoddy 2002 product. Still the best personal financial management tool out there. Lots of nice enhancements. I'm glad I upgraded. Current Quicken users should seriously consider upgrading to 2003. Money users who track investments should also switch over to Quicken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a usable upgrade","review":"Upon installation, Quicken 2003 converts your old data to its new format. This worked fine for all my accounts except checking. Clicking on the checking account to view the register produced an error that made me close and reenter Quicken. It did it each time: there was no way to make it work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled about 5 times to no avail. I refuse to pay for tech support for a product that does not work, and their chat support never responds. I went back to the 2002 version. Even starting over with the checking account and reentering each transaction for a year produced the same results. This product does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"slooooow","review":"I have been a loyal Quicken user, but this product has been a disaster. I have plenty of memory, according to its requirements, but that doesn't seem to matter. The program is achingly slow. A previous reviewer wrote that it takes three seconds for a pull-down menu to appear. I wish! It takes 15 to 20 seconds for me. Imagine how long it takes when I try to do something more complicated. Also, many of the new features are not intuitive. I've had enough frustration to switch back to try to switch back to an earlier version of Quicken--or to Microsoft Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I used earlier versions of QUICKEN for years. Putting in this version was a big mistake. Not only is it buggy (it has totally messed up previously reconciled entries), support is totally non-existant.

Like many of you guys, I struggled a bit and we couldn't figure out how it would open. Then I remembered, we bought these jar opening silicon pads from a dollar store (this is another amazing, handy product). I used one pad to hold the metal part, and with another pad, I twisted the lid (just like how you'd open any jar). And in a fraction of a second, the lid was out :)I was almost going to run it under hot water and I thought I was the only person having a problem :PTry these jar opening pads, they work with ANY container!"},{"rating":"2","title":"liked it after I figured out how to fill it","review":"I loved the look of the salt/pepper shaker and the idea of two in one. I had a problem figuring out how the fill the salt. The reviews helped me, but I used a grip (plastic square to open up a jar). You have to twist the clear plastic a little and then pull it up. It doesn't hold that much salt, but I like it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to refill salt","review":"The product is beatiful, and it is very practical to have the salt and pepper in the same enclosure. However - refilling the salt can be mission impossible. It seems to me that the product was designed for its beauty and to be easily assembled, but nobody in Trudeau ever tried to open it.Do not buy this product unless you want to spend hours trying to refill the salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremayne does it again","review":"While the mystery itself is not as complex as some of Tremayne's earlier novels have been, The Haunted Abbot provides more character depth than others. He splits the investigation between both Sister Fidelma and Brother Eadulf, allowing them to pursue the mystery together. The atmosphere is cold and dark, along with the December setting, which adds to the suspense. Fans of Eadulf and Fidelma's relationship will not want to miss this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly and phony","review":"I would give this book no stars if I could. The main character is supposed to be youngish, and yet she calmly make wise pronouncements that even the anti-female, old, stubborn characters stop and listen to in amazement before deferring to her. She is also supposed to be in love with the male lead, but there are no words or gestures of affection beyond that of a not-too-close friendship. The mystery itself was a disappointing chase that ends in an anti-climactic confrontation. Last but not least the male lead is an idiot who blunders along after Fidelma and accidentally stumbles upon answers that he doesn't understand. I finished it in the desperate hope to salvage my time spent, but I wish I hadn't. I read extensively, and this is one of the only books I have ever had such a hard time getting through from sheer boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holds Your Interest But Very Predictable","review":"Par for the course with a Michael Plamer book, Miracle Cure will keep you reading. However, what is also becoming all too true is that Miracle Cure is another in the line of books written based on the \\"Palmer formula\\". If this is your first book by Palmer, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. But, having read all of Palmer's books,which have now become all to similar in terms of plot development and solution, I was pretty much able to guess the ending of Miracle Cure well in advance of getting there. While I enjoyed reading Miracle Cure, it is too predictable if you are an expereinced reader of Palmer's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent medical suspense novel","review":"Having discovered Dr. Palmer's work only recently, I'm working my way back through his novels and have not found a one that I didn't enjoy. Many readers may not appreciate how true-to-life some of the cardiac dramas he describes are, nor recognize that the scenario of a doctor trying to rehabilitate his career after becoming dependent on prescription pain-killers is probably being played out more often than you might think in our country. This early work by Palmer is certainly well worth investing the time it takes to read it--and you'll find yourself reading faster and faster as the end approaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"absorbing","review":"Great book - it kept my attention and thankfully was devoid of gratuitous sex, violence and bad language. I love Palmers interest and expertise in the medical field and in adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miracle Cure","review":"When I say I'm \\"reading\\" this book; I'm actually \\"hearing\\" it on audiotape while torturing my body on the treadmill. Finding audiotapes is difficult which is the only reason I'm continuing. If Audiotapes were easier to find, I'd pitch it in a heartbeat (pun intended).The book is a heavy dose of political propaganda--same old, same old, recycled villains: Republican Senator, drug companies, doctors trying to clean up. The heroes are just as predictable: struggling recovering addict MD, African-American Chief of Staff, wonderful Democratic president, regulatory government agencies protecting us from the evils of capitalism (wonder how much Palmer has squirreled away) in this case the head of the FDA. I don't like the protagonist -- a doctor who steals a drug he believes is beneficial is reprehensible and should be put in jail, not made a hero in a novel. Palmer is an MD; he should know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"wimpy protagonist","review":"This book started off OK, albeit the whole premise was a bit of a stretch. Someone who is a cardiologist who lost his license over drug abuse would have no difficulty finding a better job than working at a carwash. Overlooking that, the first part of the book was relatively interesting. The protagonist, however, was such a stupid wimp that it was harder and harder to believe he could be a second year medical student, much less a cardiologist. He could pull off heroic medical exploits -- but was too stupid to come in out of the rain. By the end of the book I was hoping someone would just shoot him in the head -- he deserved it. Not worth a read in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great medical suspense!","review":"After I read 'Side Effects' I was beginning to think that Michael Palmer had lost his touch. Then I read Miracle Cure and my opinion changed right away. This book was interesting right from the beginning. This book was rich with character detail and storyline and medical suspense. A must for any Michael Palmer fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you need a new medicine?","review":"As all these kind of books you will think twice before you go to a MD. Albeit everybody think that a doctor must have some human thoughts the reality is very different and many of them just don't care about healing or harming someone.The book's story will keep you reading but the surgeries are a little bit boring and the end of the book is very predictable but that doesn't mean that is a bad end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good, fast read -- definitely a page-turner.","review":"Miracle Cure was a nice way to spend an afternoon, definitely a page-turner, in the quest to find out what's going to happen. The biggest fault I saw was believability: that the situation got as far as it did without anyone noticing anything was wrong with the drug or the test cases; that the hero just happened to be a cardiologist and just happened to get a job in time to get involved in the release of the medication. It was at best contrived. The end had a twist that I didn't suspect, but not enough redeem the faults in the plot. Generally good prose and dialogue; characters are developed minimally and are stereotypical."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the worst receiver ever!!!!!!!","review":"I have two of these receivers and I hate them.

The only way he knew how to get to her however was to go to her as a man. Only to realize after he had broken all the rules, for one making himself appear as a human and number two, making love to a human. V'Adian wasn't to feel emotion or love but after he made love to Erin, all that changed.V'Aidan and Erin's story is very sweet and I am so glad they ended up together.

The only thing is that the Iron board is really to small and not comfortable. There is no place to put the Iron on the side, and finding a place at the right height to hold the board was a tricky task.If you are obsessed with Ironing this is not for you, but if you use it just once in a blue it's great since you can store it very easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wedding cake topper","review":"Saw this on a picture of a cake.

I had high hopes and was unpleasantly unsatisfied. There were no real new insights and techniques were scarce.I really gained nothing from the book. I have an unsettling feeling that he is one of those crazy preachers that stands on sidewalks and universities and scare the light out of everyone and yells at the \\"homosexuals and fornicators\\" and damns them to hell. And this is basically the exact technique he suggests in this book, after a few magic tricks to reel a crowd in. I wouldn't trust this pastor/nutjob.

He has good support too in his friend, Ralph (maybe a Latino Hawk?). I even liked Tres' Mother, and his cat. What I didn't like was tres having to take a 4-year old on surveillance. This was a job for which Tres' boss was getting paid, even though the 4-year old is adorable, this was too cutesy. The worst thing in the book is probably a minor detail to most people but it really bugged me. The fact that Tres is constantly being threatened with various punishments for working without a license. Mostly in ths book he is working for his friend, Milo, a lawyer. Unless Texas is different from most states, One does not need a PI license to investigate for a lawyer.But it is not clear that Milo is licensed in Texas. Anyway this is a minor glitz, if any, since surely Tres will have his license in the next book.... If you like PI's this one is pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Award winning?","review":"Riordan has created an interesting and original character in Tres Navarre, and I will trust other reviewers' claims that the local color--an important part of any private eye series--is right on the money; however, I find it difficult to believe that this book and its predecessor, Big Red Tequila, won awards for anything. The plots, as other reviewers have noted, are suspect at best, fouled by loose ends that never really get resolved. Many of the secondary characters blur together. Often Tres's motivation is difficult to fathom. And the dialogue is the weakest part of the series (if Ralph, Tres's Hispanic sidekick, said \\"vato\\" one more time, I was prepared to douse my paperback copy in gasoline and set it afire). Did this novel really enjoy the attention of a professional editor? I've read much better--how are these \\"awards\\" determined, anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great characters but slow starting.","review":"I started out really liking this book because of the way Riordan creates characters. I liked the dialog and the way he built up a description of each person. Then, the character descriptions began to drag a little and the plot - well, there didn't seem to be enough of one and it didn't get going fast enough. I think Riordan has great promise, but I'd like to see a little less emphasis on character development and more emphasis on plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been Longer","review":"Tres is a great character.

This second attempt compounds the problems of the first. If possible, it is clumsier than Desire and Duty, more plodding, and less readable. Superlatives all, but insufficient to explain the depth of dismal writing to which this nonsense sinks. It would not be such a crime, were the authors not attempting to tag their awful efforts on the saleability of Ms. Austen's name and talent. She cannot defend herself. Hopefully her discerning readers will not fall into the trap I did. I now have TWO books in 48 years that I have returned to a bookstore. How SAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanity it certainly is!","review":"Both this book and the previous one could very well have been written by someone who hasn't got past ninth grade--the language is sophomorish, the vocabulary stilted, and Austen is probably turning over in her grave.There is simply no virtue in writing novels like these that purport to be sequels to Austen's stupendous work, and to ride on the coattails of her fame. Perhaps the authors' next book should be titled CEASE AND DESIST.It all seems like vanity in any case--who or what is Revive publishing, certainly not a publishing house I have heard of, and the copy I borrowed from the library (Hah, unlike the other reader who bemoaned this shabby work, I get to return mine easily) is not too elegantly put together. Sounds like a VANITY press to me--perhaps even the authors' own press?What, did not reputable publisher, independent or otherwise, want to publish these novels?

As for the rest of the cast,they're obviously having a great time in their old roles.Of the films themselves, Reunion was like a true family reunion with the sight of the entire cast(including an obviously ill Denver Pyle) picking up perfectly from twelve years ago. Hazzard in Hollywood was the more action packed fare as the cast is removed from Hazzard into a different locale.Five years later a big screen treatment of TDOH was released which lacked the series warmed and fun and replaced it with toilet humor.For fans of the series, these were the true Duke movies and a better way to end the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dukes of Hazzard Movie Collection","review":"My kids love these movies.

I thought I would be fine with it thinking, \\"oh it can't be that bad\\". Both sides are uniformly convex as if they are produced from the factory with about 1mm from peak to trough. You have to sand off 1mm of stone to flatten this sucker. If you're fine with this then go ahead and buy it because everything else works fine.The 8000 grit side produces a mirror finish on your blade but I haven't gotten the best results from the 4000 grit side which could be because I didn't flatten that side perfectly. Also, you can't sharpen your blades in the case/stand the stone comes with unless you cut off the top cover. The cover just sticks up too much and obstructs your movement across the stone.I recommend the King stones instead of the Norton stones but each stone has its disadvantages.

Okay, \\"The Testament\\" is fiction, but too much exaggeration makes the story loose credibility. I also thought that the end could have been better elaborated.

I kept turning page after page, amazed myself of how fast I was going through the book. After every chapter I would read the first line of the next chapter only to find that i couldn't stop. As Mr. O'Riley was trying to find Rachel Lane, the greedy childre, ex-wives, and lawyers were becoming more and more anxious to find where the money was being placed.

The book tells of the struggle to find her and of the battle to keep the money out of the greedy hands of his other children. The ending of the book will suprise you and makes the 533 pages all worth while. I would recommend this book to anyone who can read at a high school level."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book.","review":"John Grisham makes a great description of a family rotten by excess of money. The first character in the book is Troy Phelan, excentric 78 yr old millionaire who committs suicide leaving a handwritten testament in which he leaves noting to his sons, obviously spread amongst different families of his multiple marriages, and spoiled by himself. Despite the eccentricity of the character of Troy Phelan, or the many defects of those who follow the plot as the testament gets to be questioned by his son's to get some part of his fortune, Grisham uses a great description. This creates round characters most readers could identify themselves with in the way they percieve the world. This gets the reader fully entangled in the plot, making it an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham's Testament","review":"Loved it. Hard to put it down. Sequencing of events is fun and keeps your attention and anxiety to find out what happens next. Very cleverly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Grisham classic","review":"While I really enjoyed this book, I would have enjoyed it slightly more if it had been writen by a different author. It was a wonderfull book about values in life and money, but it lacked the legal suspense that I read John Grisham for. I had expected more of a legal aspect. I also was surprised that the will was revealed that early in the plot, because I had expected that it would have been concealed until later, to add suspense. Still, it was worth it, and I didn't put it down until I finished it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE ALL JOHN GRISHAM BOOKS BUT THIS ONE","review":"JOHN GRISHAM BOOKS ARE MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE. I HAVE READ EACH AND EVERYONE. I HAVE FOUND HIS LAST TWO BOOKS, THIS ONE ESPECIALLY TO BE FLUFF. WHERE IS THE USUAL GRISHAM SUSPENSE AND PLOT TURNS? I KNOW I'LL GO ON READING HIS NOVELS BUT I WANT MORE ACTION, BETTER CHARACTERS AND FOR GODSAKE MUCH BETTER ENDINGS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY good read!","review":"This is vintage Grisham. A set-up of the story line and then he \\"sets the hook\\" very quickly. I found THE TESTAMENT captivating from the start. Grisham's research to writing this novel results in a special treat and is a must for your reading pleasure. This makes a wonderful addition to my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended and worthwhile","review":"A terrific book, not ashamed to treat religion and values seriously. The Phelans represent what can happen when enormous wealth is not accompanied by maturity and responsibility. Nate O'Reilly's humanness evokes sympathy and empathy, and I found myself cheering him on every step of the way. I loved the ending! A book truly worth reading--a real page turner--NOT filled with sex and violence. Thank you, John Grisham!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joseph Conrad is spinning!","review":"Boy, does this book stink. Grisham has lost his touch and is just going through the motions to crank out cash. He insults his audience. Heart of Darkness meets The Man In Full. What a disappointing meeting. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Testament\\" is quite a disappointment.","review":"I have to admit that I'm a big Grisham fan. But \\"The Testament\\" is a big disappointment. I found myself turning the pages for the sake of finishing the book (having already bought it). It started out promisingly enough, but as the story progressed, it slowly borders on silliness. Imagine a multi-million dollar law firm sending a drunk into a South-American jungle on a case that could potentailly be worth millions-very clever... If you absolutely must have this book in your Grisham collection, wait for the paperback. Otherwise, wait and hope that his next wouldn't be so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appreciate the effort, but needs more maturity","review":"I can appreciate Grisham's attempt to break out of his usual genre with \\"The Testament,\\" and the story is not without its charms. As usual, Grisham's writing style kept me hooked from the beginning, but by the end I couldn't figure out why.The problem is this: Grisham seems to not have the sophistication to fully describe the lead character's fight with drug and alcohol dependance. That tension is the lynchpin of the novel, and I didn't feel it.Though the sections in the jungles of Brazil were well-writen, the descriptions only served to divert the real focus of the book - Nate's fight to stay alive and, in the process, find himself.I just kept thinking: A man's salvation has more depth than this. Doesn't it?And by the way, if you were looking for a legal thriller stop right now. This isn't one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I listened to this book toward the end of a long, long drive. It had me captivated and alert right up until the last mile. Then I listened to the end of it the next day on my way to work. Are you kidding me? I've never felt so cheated in my life! Try writing the ending again, please! It's like he got to the green in two strokes then decided not to putt. I want my six hours back. With interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible letdown","review":"After reading books like \\"The Firm\\" and \\"Pelican Brief\\" I was expecting to be able to pick up any of Grisham's work and be impressed. I must say \\"The Testament\\" was a bomb. It might have been a workable plot but the characters were far too weak and dull to sustain it. I kept turning the pages hoping in vain it would get better....unfortunately it never did. Save your money and leave this book on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham gets a F on this one.","review":"The book was very unrealistic. The main character, a drunk lawyer, is unable to solve his drinking problem by the use of spiritual principles suggested in 12 step programs; however, he solves his problem by merely accepting some trite religious dogma which has consistently failed to work with drunks.Do your research John!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The homonym title hints at the evangelical message","review":"Take every irrational conversation you've ever had with emotionally charged Gospel preachers, every \\"Jesus loves you\\" poster, pamphlet, and TV special, and you have the underlying theme of \\"The Testament.\\" As a storyteller, of course, Grisham does an excellent job. However, the books proper distribution channel should be through a church. Grisham does a terrible job of intelligently conveying the trite message of the materialism of modern society. At some points in the book you wonder if Jesus will make his return then and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Grisham turns preacher","review":"I think John Grisham has decided to use his fame to preach to his readership so we all are \\"saved\\". If that is what you want, go to church because the story isn't worth it. It lacks the excitement and suspense of his other novels. The story is about a man just out of rehab who is sent to the jungle to find a missionary who leads him to God. He then proceeds to change his life and the story preaches to you over and over. Not at all on par with his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disapointment","review":"This book was a thorough waste of time. Not only did it not have the pull of Grisham's other books, it appears that the author simply bored of writing it and hastily procurred a lame ending.Spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take the money and run!","review":"I could almost see hear Grisham's editor pleading for more pages...so drawn out and BORING were the endless descriptions of unimportant details. I must agree with an earlier review that the book starts out with promise, however the character of Nate seems hollow, generic, and I could never really buy any of the characters in this book. I happened to take it down to the Caribbean with me, and after plodding through all but the last five pages, we had a hurricane, and I had to leave the house. I looked at the book and decided not to take it--at that point I simply didn't care enough to find out how it ended! Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone edit this?","review":"As I read this latest Grisham product, I kept wondering whether it was something he'd written in high school and come across while cleaning out the attic. The plot meanders, the characters are very thin and dull (the missionary chick is a dolt). Clearly no one read this book prior to publication, including probably Grisham. Just set it and forget it; crank out a few hundred thou. This would have been rejected by my high school English teacher. It contains numerous misspellings, continuity errors, and repetitions (how many times must we be read that Nate threw up in the shower -- often inducing it himself to get it over with?) It is very annoying to pay $20 bucks for a book (at Safeway) and be unable to read it without being jerked around at every turn by the intrusion of piddly-ass and irritating errors. Forget it! Not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was one of my favorite Grisham books.","review":"I enjoyed The Testament because it had you hooked immediately. Troy was a crafty character. He was in control of his fate even after his death. A lot of Grisham's books are too wordy and could tell a good story with less description. His wordiness in this book was appreciated because it took me somewhere unfamiliar. Reading the jacket cover you learn that he has visited the places in the book and is trying to make it real to the reader. I was not disappointed to find towards the end his typical negative attitude about lawyers. It seems his style to make some lawyer the bad guy. My favorite to date has been A Time to Kill. The Testament is running a close second. I wanted a sequel. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to the characters. I read the book slowly which is unusual for me and a good book. Good going Nate in your transformation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For a law-thriller the book has no action, no legal questions. no real characters.Grisham is not delivering the goods."},{"rating":"2","title":"When's the Next Book?","review":"A classic Grisham opening, and an enjoyable read throughout. Perhaps we dwelled in the Pantanal a bit long, but who's complaining. I can't say that this is the best Grisham book, but middle of the road from him is quite alright with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great many meanings","review":"Grisham does another great job. His story line of one who dies and leaves his will to an unknown heir is amazing. Grisham's in depth description of the lead characters journey through the rain forest was amazing. I think that he had messages that he wanted to convey in the story. Faith, religion, and consiousness of our world and our environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric","review":"Exceedingly thin plot containing exceedingly thin characters, and a writing style that would shame a community college english student. Grisham had better go back to practicing law - maybe it will give him some fresh insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham does it again","review":"I enjoyed this novel, and found it to be done with the tradtional Grisham style. He ties you in so deeply to the plot on the first page, and keeps you tied in till the very end. In this particular novel I found it less to be a court room dram, but an adventure story. I enjoyed this novel a lot as much as the Street Lawyer. He is truly one of the best authors in his field. I highly recomend this novel if you are into adventure and thrill ride of your life until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"dis-a-POINT-ed!!!!","review":"Read all the others & enjoyed. This one did not have much suspense and very little of the legal details and thrills of his previous books. Characters were interesting, but then he didn't do much with them--the relationship between Nate and Rachel was so shortlived and flimsy that the rest that followed just wasn't believable. Early in the book, so much emphasis was placed on Troy's genius and his desire to outwit his despised relatives (even from the grave), that throughout the entire book I kept waiting for some surprise to be revealed in relation to the will/testament, for Troy to somehow win/outsmart them all. Not much substance, though as always, well written. I'm sure he'll get millions for the movie rights, but I sure won't be shelling out for a ticket to this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"I really enjoyed this book because one of the main characters really changed his life around in a matter of a few weeks. This book was really hard to put down; suspense and the words \\"what will happen next?\\" seemed to run through my mind the most often. If you want a good read and you really don't want a horror or romance story then this book is for you. Although not one of John's greatest books, it is a good addition to all of those books that are lined, or shall I say: shoved in, those bookcases of yours!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to other Grisham novels.","review":"I've read all the Grisham novels; I preordered this one because I've enjoyed everyone and had trouble putting them down. This one was boring and I actually skimmed some parts to \\"get on with it\\". The author didn't develop the characters well; the alcoholic was totally non-believable. It seemed he was trying to fit too much into one book; I would have loved to see more character development, especially of the wealthy family...there was a gold mine there. I won't rush out to buy his next book...its back to paperback for Grisham with this reader!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and slow movng","review":"I have to say that I'm very disappointed with this book, it moved much to slow and I just didn't enjoy it like I have the rest of John's books. I'm anxiously awaiting John's next novel and hope it is better than this one was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather dry...","review":"This book started with a lot of promise, and then went down hill from there. I kept expecting something good to happen but was sorely disappointed. The only reason I finished it is because it was in audio version which meant I didn't have to force myself to turn a page. Better luck next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"I ignored a negative customer review of this book when I should have paid attention. I stayed up half the night to finish the book--only to be done with it, not because it was that interesting. A big disappointment coming from John Grisham. The characters were boring, the plot was not believable by any stretch of the imagination. I found it a waste of my money and time. All Grisham's previous books, with the possible exception of THE PELICAN BRIEF, were fascinating, very readable. This one was just too far fetched. Perhaps the author needs a vacation. He's too good a writer for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that goes nowhere","review":"Big Deal! The author captures our attention with a couple billion dollars and a suicide but there is no finish. The book slides down to a flat conclusion. Grisham goes to great length to paint the surviving family members in a bad light, so couldn't they have wreaked some damage in the interest of suspense or just plain villany? Save your money. Or better yet, read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" by Ken Follet, or for a good laugh, \\"Gold Coast\\" by Nelson Demille."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was the worst he has written.","review":"I have read all the Grisham books and this one was the worst. The story is long and drawn out and the ending was so predictable. I am a well read person who has enjoyed all of the Grisham novels, but this one was very dissappointing. There was not enough action and intrigue to keep me interested. I had to force myself to finish it, which I have never had to do with his books. I am very glad that I didn't buy the book, just borrowed it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Well, we're now 8 books into Grisham's writing career, and the bloke still can't write an ending to save is life. Rather than the bloody court room battle that we all know should ensue over Troy Phelan's will, Grisham gives us an underwhelming--not to mention legally questionable--miff. He spends hundreds of pages worrying about a non-existent legal issue, allows his main characters to commit malpractice at least once (which is slightly ironic), and then doesn't bother to engage in the real fireworks. It's a cop out and a let down. My advice, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I've read most of Grisham's books; this one is the worst. The first chapter was great, but then I found myself skimming through many chapters trying to find the action. I think he needs to take time off to get his creative juices flowing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"insulting at the very least","review":"not having read all of grishman's books, this one by far was cut and pasted together for really no apparent reason. ch. one was an excellent attention getter but the rest of the story was a mere extension, lacking depth, and real character analysis. One recommendation to grisham: please don't insult our intelligence by creating illusionary plots followed by insignificant description. Any intelligible author would have seen this coming. save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sermon from Rev. Grisham","review":"If you thought his last book (\\"Street Lawyer\\") was just a long, boring sermon (and I did), you'll find \\"The Testament\\" more of the same. Poor Mr. Grisham has obviously gotten tired. His books are beginning to follow a pattern: opening drama, followed by several hundred pages in which nothing happens except for the sermon from Rev. Grisham. The plot in this one is so predictable that I was able to guess his surprise conclusion a hundred pages before the end of the book. And the sermon is pretty much the same as \\"Street Lawyer\\", except more heavy-handed. The man obviously wishes he were a missionary. My advice is: \\"go for it, John. You've ceased being a writer.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"My first dissapointment in a John Grisham book.","review":"I am a major fan of John Grisham books but this one was a real disappointment. Did not keep me gripped to my seat as his past novels have and I have read every single one of them. I found myself wanting to skip past the in-depth and tedious descriptions of some very boring subject matter. All I can surmise is that he was under a book deadline and just kind of spit this thing out haphazardly. When I got to the end I thought at first that maybe I was missing some pages, that there should have been more, but alas, no. Hope the next one is much better. I do however still look forward to the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, silly and dull","review":"Grisham has been going down hill for some time now, it seems to me, and this is a new low.

This story is truly his best in years. Captivating plot, a keen insight into the legal system. Gripping, absorbing, thrilling, unputdownable ! A must for any Grisham fan, and a cool chance to become one for the uninitiated readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realism Sense","review":"I like this John Grisham's newest book, and give it 4 stars. Like his anothers book, Grisham showed a realism sense again. It's sense, however, always bring the readers to flow in his story, and drive us to ask \\"what more happens?\\" But sometimes I asked my self, why Grisham always write a law story? If he write another genre, I think - with his realism sense - he can build more greateful tales. Like we ever know, in A Time to Kill, Grisham explored the facts so realism. It continued in his coming books, expecialy in my oppinion is the best, The Testament. More, he bring us to the world of laws, lawyers, and firms. No just a story, but it was like an encyclopedia of laws. Grisham self, like a prof. in his jobs. In other word, 4 stras are enough for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"I have read all Grisham's books up to this one and have been so diappointed with the last two. The Street Lawyer and the Testament are real yawners. Usually I keep my Grisham novels, only loaning them out to trusted friends, but these two I quickly gave away. The Testament dragged on, the characters were very flat---either good or greedy with no interesting nuances."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredibly intense, amazing read","review":"John Grisham does it again...but much better. If you don't think it is possible, then read this great book. It leads you half way around the world and back again. It takes many unexpected, but interesting turns and it keeps you guessing until the very end. Don't wait another minute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"overall a good read...","review":"\\"~The Testment was a good read overall. It show's how greedy lawers get. How rich heirs act dispite their financial problems. There are a few parts of the story that can be left untold. Everyone knows buy reading the inside cover, that Nate O'Reily goes into the Amazon. Now, Grisham has been there several times, and really wants everyone to know what it was like. Fine, but, some of the details can be left out.\\"~ happening back Stateside, and I was more interested in knowing more about what was happening there than in the Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been shorter","review":"This book could have been 125 pages shorter. The middle chapters seem to be self-indulgent. Sharing with the reader the excruciating details of the undeveloped portions of South America - as if he just came back from an expedition and wanted to share everything that happened. The overall concept was interesting. I just skimmed through the chapters describing the landscape and inhabitants in order to get on with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's worst","review":"I have read a number of Grisham novels and this one is by far his worst to date. The storyline is weak and so are the characters. The ending is predictable and too many questions are left unanswered. Grisham's strong point is courtroom drama and writing more of it would serve him well. If you have not read this book don't waste your time. The only reason I gave this book 1 star is because I could not find a 0 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to the John Grisham I knew?","review":"Not even close to his other books. What a disappointment. It looks like John has fallen into the trap of pumping out books in record time (probably due in part to his contract with the publisher) and resting on past laurels to sell them. Thank heaven I borrowed this one. It's a shame to forsake one's principles and talent for the almighty buck. Please John, give us some of the mystery, intrigue, and intellectualism of your earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"shockingly poor written book","review":"Contrasting to the books written before by John Grisham (I read them all), this book is of such a poor quality, i.e. lack of plot, lack of suspension, lack of thrill and lack of vivid characters. I definitely think the media has built up too much expectations for readers prior to the publication of the book. It does not derserve. Sadly, it seems to me that the book was written in a such rush, with no literacy values. it is a pure commercial book, meant to make a quick buck, rather than to entertain readers. I was very disappointed and will have a second thought on whether or not to buy/read his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"I am disappointed that John Grisham could keep me so captivated with others like \\"A Time to Kill\\" and leave me so uninterested with this one.

That was what made the whole thing come together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected, but...","review":"...it was a good read. I was expecting something a little more thrilling, a little more intense and exciting. But the slower pace of this book still kept my attention. Grisham has a good writing style and had no trouble getting me interested in the story, the location, the people. Parts of it were like a travel documentary, but surprisingly I found it all interesting. I was never at the edge of my seat, but never wanted to put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost is the \\"quagmire\\" of the jungle!","review":"Starts out well but soon gets lost in a lengthy and seeminly never ending description of a trip to find a missionary in a remote part of the Brazilian jungle. Aside from the story of a very dysfunctional family who are heirs to their fathers billions (which he wills to his illegitimate daughter...the missionary) and ensuing fight for the money is the dysfunctional lawyer, who fights his own demons and somehow manages, it seems, to have a \\"spiritual awakening.\\" The story does not pick up again until the last chapters and then in short measure seems to finish off leaving one wanting something more. This story was definitely lacking something for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual John Grisham","review":"When I read a John Grisham book, I expect to be entertained. The Testament did that, and more. This book is a story of great success, terrible failure, wasted lives, and finally redemption. Grisham carries this off in such a way that you feel better for having read the book. That's more than entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Grisham masterpiece","review":"This book was great from the first word. Grisham was able to drive a number of emotions with this book. I had the feeling I was right there in Brazil with all of the danger and at the same time I was back in the states hoping Troy's family would somehow dig themselves deeper in debt. Like his last few books I would have liked to see a happier ending but this book kept me excited all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally entertaining from beginning to end.","review":"From the reader to the text, I was completely captivated by this book.

There was a great story line, but there was minimal character development. I had a hard time relating to them because of their shallowness. The novel drags too much to have hooked me. All in all, I think The Testament was poorly written compared to The Chamber and A Time to Kill. Watch the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring!!!","review":"I own and have read all 11 books by John and personally feel this was far from his usual standard.Perhaps the pace of a book a year, ala Danielle Steel is too much for many writers -- even a great one like John Grisham.

As a non-native speaker of English, I'm a fan of his masterpieces. The elements of the adventures in this book made me foget to have a lunch break. The ending of the story is what you might expect to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a decent read.....","review":"The book started off very quickly. The first night, I read about 100 pages without stopping.... However, the story slowed down. It was still very interesting, but there was a lot of information that really had no relevance to the underlying plot. The end of the story was predictable. Thankfully, the final part of the book was only 25 pages long and ended swiftly. As with nearly all of his books though, it is worth the read. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent descriptions of rural Brazil -- well-written","review":"While this book measured up to Grisham's previous ones in terms of suspense, his placement of the setting in Brazil was really a welcome change. His descriptions of rivers, people, weather, and more were not just right-on-the-money, but so descriptive that you could paint a complete mental picture. Folks, that's an example of good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent writing style but dull as ditch water","review":"John Grisham is master of the fast paced, all action thriller, or so I thought. But somewhere among the line he has undergone a transformation. Starting with 'The Street Lawyer' he became pedestrian. Why does he now insist on writing books with non-existent plots? I thought it might just be a one off, but with 'The Testament' it has become a regular feature. In his defense he is a competent writer and the opening of this book is impressive. It's just that after the opening, it falls off a cliff.Please, Mr Grisham, if you read this, address the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best read I've had in a while","review":"After reading Johns work for many years I was growing tired of his work, I almost bypassed \\"The Testament\\" but I am so pleased I didn't. It's something where the reader can see the authors own experiences coming out clearly, and what wonderful experiences John must have had on the Pantanal, Brazil. I would seriously recommend this book to anyone that can read! It has certainly put me back onto Johns writting & can't wait for the next to become available."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent and highly readable novel","review":"This is probably not John Grisham's best novel but it is my personal favorite.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, intriguing, and just great!!","review":"This one is my favorite of Grisham's so far. I really like the plot and the way the story was written. The Testament is about an old man who was very rich. So rich, infact, his self-made fortune was 11 billion dollars. Now, the whole story is about who his fortune will go to. The old man's name is Troy Phelan and a few minutes before he dies, he re-writes his will, naming the sole-heir of his fortune Rachel lane. No one knows who she is and Troy's 6 children are furious when they find out! Josh Stafford, Troy's lawyer needs to send someone to find this Rachel Lane. He finds out she's living in the jungles of brazil and sends nate O'Riley, a lawyer who was in rehab for alcohol addiction. Now, Nate must go to Brazil and face alligators, anacondas, and tropical diseases to find Rachel Lane. Excellent book, except the ending was a little fast and he could have slowed it down a little but other than that, excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent tale of repentence","review":"This isn't your typical legal thriller. A billionaire commits suicide in dramatic fashion, and leaves his fortune to a surprise heir, who is serving as a missionary in the jungles of South America. Our hero is a lawyer on the mend from substance abuse, who is seeking redemption and trying to turn his life around into something more meaningful. The adventure of hunting down the heir turns more into a spiritual journey frought with dangers. This book reads quickly and didn't disappoint me one bit in the way it turned out. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where There Is A Will, Grisham Finds The Way","review":"After 'The Partner' & 'The Street Lawyer' I was fed up with John Grisham' s flat formulas. Someone loaned me a worn paperback of 'The Testament' on a long flight and it revived my interest and trust in Grisham.'The Testament' is rich in setting and character. I particularly liked the in-depth perspective of the main character, Mr. O'Reily. He was flawed, but more real than many of Grisham's more recent catalysts. The legal matters in DC provided decent tension. The ending and satisfaction were better than most Grisham epics where the author can't usually finish stories.The river descriptions get a bit tedious and Grisham is continuing to be preachy - an unfortunate trend that began in 'The Chamber' and reached a peak of misery in 'The Street Lawyer.' In total I enjoyed 'The Testament' and I may buy 'The Brethern' rather than borrow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS WAS A GREAT STORY","review":"This was a quick read for me. I loved this story. I get the feeling Mr Grisham is trying to branch out in other the directions in this story. What a grand idea for the character to show a more human face. The main charcter look for the daughter of a recently died Troy Phelan; a self-made billionaire. But get this, the daugther does not want her money. She chooses to give her life to God and walk away from the mordern world and .... You got to read it for yourself. This is a remarkable adventure. Score another one for JG. This is a sure 6 or 7 stars if possible. I wonder will the recently book release, The Brethren, be this good. In my book the PARTNER by JG is as good as the TESTAMENT. Get your copy today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and powerful read!","review":"I have read every Grisham novel (usually within a couple of days of their release). This one took me longer to get around to, but am I glad I did! Thank you so much, Mr. Grisham, for not portraying the Christians in your book as wild-eyed Bible-beating lunatics, but instead portraying them as human beings following a different path. I highly recommend this book. While it lags a little in the middle, it is all in all fabulous - much better than Street Lawyer. I'm looking forward to the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham finally gets away from Southern USA","review":"Finally Grisham writes a novel that is based elsewhere, in this case Washington and Brasil. The storyline is interesting - excentric spiteful billionaire wanting revenge one last time on his ungrateful children and ex-wives. However, there is a lack of tension in this story, which seems to end a little too easily and with apparently no conflict. The winning side in this case is clear right from the start. The story has some interesting elements to it, but I found it overall disappointing in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller........","review":"All of John Grisham's books have been bestsellers. This novel is a most definite page turner. I like the ways he describes how the Brazilians live. John Grisham definitly wrote this book with an intriging plot that will get and hold your attention. In this book there are many twists and turns and everything else that could possibly happen. This book is very fast paced. Over all this book kept my intrest. Don't be fooled by the title you don't know what it means until the end...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I'm disappointed. I finished reading The Testament about twenty minutes ago, and I'm still waiting for it to get interesting. I've read all of his other novels to date, and this one is the dullest. A Time To Kill and The Chamber were simply amazing...The Runaway Jury was incredible until the very end (could have had a much better finale, in my opinion)...but The Testament was simply disappointing as a novel coming from Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best for Grisham!","review":"I have read most of John Grisham's novels, and they are very good. But I felt that this is one of the best so far. The book moves along easily, and the story line from Brazil gives it a nice change of pace from other Grisham books. You feel that you really came through an ordeal with the \\"hero\\", and when the last page is turned, you'll wish there was more."},{"rating":"2","title":"More is not always better!","review":"I'm a John Grisham fan, and although I loved the intrigue of The Testament,(the trek through jungles, the anacondas, the fevers, the flirtations between characters, etc.) I did feel as though I was watching a slow-moving soap opera at times. I have read most of his books, and though they are all good, I often feel that Mr. Grisham attempts to crank out too many books without too much thought at times. I have recently wondered whether he has \\"ghost writers\\". Hope not, as I have been a fan for so long.Having said that, any one of the Grisham books is well worth reading. My own favourite happens to be Runaway Jury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell me more...Tell me more...","review":"This is the first John Grisham book I have read. I am sure there are diehard fans out there who say I should start with The Firm or something. The point is that this is as descripitive as Dick And Jane. I feel nothing for any of these characters, and what could be entertaining scenes skip by in three sentences. He doesn't bring you into the story. He just lets you look at it like a fish in a fishbowl. And just as entertaining.The first Chapter pulls you in to the possibilities of the outcome, but after that it's just a simple mindless read. He is definitely a writer second and a lawyer first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best!","review":"I've always enjoyed John's books but this one definitely falls short. In fact I wasnt even half way through I quit reading. I can't remember the last book I didn't finished,even if it was bad! This one was too slow,boring and repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Grisham experience was not a disappointment","review":"I simply loved this novel. I had never read Grisham before, but now I believe his books will make their way into my library. The plot was great and the characters unforgettable. I don't want to say too much or I'll give away the story, but I wanted to send my congratulations to John Grisham for writing a story with Christian values and principles in it. People will not like him for this. Some of you reading this review are thinking that you will never read one of his books again. Well, Mr. Grisham, you may suffer here on earth, but your reward is great in Heaven. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"The Testament isn't as bad as Grisham's last two books, but that's not saying very much. The characters are one-dimensional at best, the plot is non-existant, and, worst of all, there's no real suspense. If you want a decent Grisham book, try The Rainmaker. If you want a decent novel of personal redemption, search for a copy of Island, by Charles Abbott. But don't bother reading this book unless you feel driven to read absolutely everything written by Grisham. The publishers are obviously aware that there are plenty of people in that camp, at this point..."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst Grisham yet.","review":"A fascinating beginning that drops off into what appears to be Grisham's effort to show the world that he's been to South America and has an eye for detail. There are some very interesting parts to this book, but overall, very disappointing for this Grisham fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was the best book he has wriiten.","review":"I was so shocked at the subject of this book. It was by far the best written book by this author. I have throughly enjoyed all of his work. The ending was a total surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book and \\"The Chamber\\" are Grisham's least likeable","review":"I've read each of his books, liked all of them except for The Chamber. This is the worst of his books. I kept reading with the hope that it would get better. The plot in unbelievable, there is MUCH TOO MUCH monotonous writing about riding on the river in the jungle, then the end cuts off quickly and doesn't really make much sense. I will be more cautious before buying another one of his novels and am looking for another favorite author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic Work Designed for Hollywood","review":"Grisham, like Clancy, now churns out formulaic novellas that are pumped up with predictable big plot twists that Hollywood would like. There are no heroes in this novel, just a bunch of greedy idiots and third-world bumpkins treated with equal indifference by Grisham. If this book was written by an unknown author, it will be rejected by almost all publishers, due to lack of merit. However, Grisham is now internationally famous, so he can sit back, relax, and churn out knock-off of his earlier and best efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given it 0 stars if I could...","review":"This is perhaps the worst legal thriller I have ever read. I enjoyed Runaway Jury & Rainmaker, so I have liked some of Grisham's previous efforts, but this has to be the 1) lamest, 2) laziest, 3) most boring, 4) most sodden ending (yes, sodden is the perfect word) effort I have ssen by a major writer in a long time. Grisham should retire. This novel would not have been published without his name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRY READ","review":"This latest novel by Grisham lacked much if any excitement shared by his previous works. I would pass on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if...","review":"I love to read, but yet I was extremely unsatisfied with this book. It was the worst book I ever read. It was quite boring, no action worth reading, and based on money. If you really like legal stuff and money based books then this book is for you. But if you are in for a good read, thrill, and action, don't buy and waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work, but...","review":"...finally Grisham writes a novel that is based outside the southern USA, in this case Washington and Brasil.The storyline is interesting - excentric spiteful billionaire wanting revenge one last time on his ungrateful children and ex-wives. However, I found that there was a lack of tension in this story right through to to ending.The story has some interesting elements to it, but I found it overall disappointing in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Story","review":"Thank you John Grisham for giving me such pleasure in reading this book! I think it is one of you best. I am a christian and it was so refreshing to see Jesus and Christianity displayed somewhat realistically. Your writing skills keep me wanting to turn the page. Being from Memphis, I relate to all of your books on some level. I would love to see \\"The Testament\\" as a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull book that's a drag to finish","review":"frankly, i have not been able to finish this book. i stopped somewhere in the middle where the drunk lawyer was out in the wild looking for the heiress. odly enough, the book begins with a fast and exciting pace. then it drags on for the next 200+ pages and counting. the only reason i give this book a star is because my man grisham has to be worth at least a lil something. but seriously, grish, you have to snap out of your slumber. your last 2 books: testament and brethren (another bore to read) have been very, very, weak. at 25bucks a pop (paperback), you gotta give a bros his money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch The Movie","review":"I'd heard the Grisham name so often, in book stores and movies I'd seen. The books premise was interesting I decided to take the plunge and bought this one. The characters are shallow and poorly developed. It is written at the level of a talented, wordy elementary school student. Grisham is the exception that proves the rule \\"The book is always better than the movie.\\" Wait for the movie. It will probably be better. A decent cast can help flesh out the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Grisham yet","review":"I've read all of his books and this one is the best yet. The storyline is great and the ending is totally unpredictable. I had to read it twice because I couldn't believe my eyes. It's definitly one to add to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither a good travel nor a good legal story...","review":"I have read other books of Grisham, and this one is not up to his usual standard. Apparently he has been to the Pantanal, and this so impressed him that he thought he should write about it. The story is predictable and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing . . .","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book and found it to be so slow, boring and predictable that I couldn't finish it. Very disappointing when compared to some of John Grisham's other legal thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham forumula works again","review":"Once again it is another good read by Grisham. It is hard to think what my will would be like if I get over a million dollars. I cannot see leaving it to a woman in some remote southn american jungle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, but mostly disappointing","review":"I enjoyed the first chapter very much. However, things deteriorated fairly quickly for me.A book peopled with characters whom it is hard to identify with or like. The main protaginist is a boring drunk who finds religion. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, thought-provoking with surprising ending.","review":"As is common in Grisham's novels, this book was a fast and enjoyable read. The extremes in character types creates a balance against which the reader can assess his own thoughts as to the meaning of wealth and even life itself. The book's surprise ending is another Grisham trademark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written intrigue.","review":"This is a master piece. Though not as fast paced as The Rainmaker, this is truly one the year's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than his others","review":"I read this book after seeing Mr. G. interviewed on TV. Lots of people you love to hate and several you want to love. Starts out very strong and lures you in. Towards the end it would seem the author realized his book was getting a little long so he quickly wrapped it up by killing one of the main characters and giving the other a new life. When this becomes a movie (which it probably will) you can bet Mel Gibson or Harrison Ford will take the lead with some no-name, starkly beautiful actress. However the movie will probably spend more time developing the characters of the dysfunctional family and less time on the river swatting bugs. Generally a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine mix of two worlds","review":"Actually would have liked to give this 4.5 but it's not on the list. Only a bit off the usual storytelling of Grisham. So often he takes you inside the legal world of many shades. Here he takes you into shaded tropical jungles as well. The contrast between the two worlds is compelling, especially Grisham's sensitivity to the plight of the native population. Descriptions are quite fine, story-line is great but could have been shortened, I think. I think characterizarion could have been stronger - more on some of the peripheral characters and one the reluctant heiress to keep interest - you do get a bit tired of our jungle travelling, alcoholic as the only big character. However, as the first Grisham I read (and I have read five others now to compare this to) it was fine enough to send me hurrying to Amazon to buy everything else he ever wrote!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Testament","review":"From the moment I began reading it, I was spellbound. I could not put it down. I usually turn in early, but for some reason I could stop reading. Th characters seemed so real. Nate was a gem. It was nice to see him really try be be a decent human being after all the pain he had caused. The book showed another example of how greed can turn some people in to monsters. The Testament is one of the best books I have read in ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Testament","review":"I recently finished reading the The Testament and enjoyed it very much. I found it to be very intriguing and different from Grisham's previous books. He was faithful to his old style of revealing how many in the legal profession operate , but he also unfolded a story which was unique and uplifting in that morals are actually raised to a higher level - too bad the legal profession is so blind to their manipulations and devious ways. They ought to have to sign a lawyer type of Hypocratic Oath to protect the public from their profession and their greedy ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Testament","review":"\\"The Testament\\" is a uniquely written book. John Grisham has decifered the true meaning of life. Rachel Lane is one of the main charachters that Grisham uses to show the theme. She is a Christian who is in South America spreading her faith. Meanwhile her ligitiment father has commited suicide and left Rachel with millions of dollars. Her father's lawyer hires an ex-lawyer to find her and deliver the good news. A big suprise hits him, Rachel doesn't have any desire to have the money. Afterall money isn't everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What I Expected, But Great Just The Same","review":"John Grisham's books have always succeeded in entertaining me, and The Testament is no exception. This story doesn't take place in the typical Southern setting, which was kind of a nice change. Rather than focusing on some complex conspiracy or riveting courtroom drama, this story deals a lot with basic human nature, particularly greed, which is equally interesting. There is also a distinct relgious element to the story. I am not a religious guy, and I was impressed at Grisham's ability to deal with religion without sounding \\"preachy\\". The Testament is a good example of the fact that Grisham is not just a \\"formula\\" author, and I would recommend this book to anyone, whether they are a Grisham fan or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Grisham book","review":"Characters that are interesting as is the norm for Grisham but it's really a story about redemption. My favorite Grisham book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picturesque......very well written","review":"The Testament is yet another classic: John Grishams novels hardly ever fail to impress (perhaps the possible exception being The Street Lawyer). The fact that the story has a number of characters, and a number of settings, from the everyday houses of the heirs to the very unique Pantanal in Brazil, calls for a very good imagination on the part of the reader. Nate O' Riley is very likable, and Grisham has once again proved that the protagonist need not be a perfect individual.The ending is excellent. Unlike some readers, who suggest that Grishams endings tends to be rather flat, i personally believe that he is rather imaginative. He leaves the reader in suspense, giving him or her something to think about, even after the story itself is finished.The Testament does drag a bit at times, and you want to skip a few pages to get to the interesting parts, but these occasions are rare, and the book is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, Grisham gets away from Southern USA, but...","review":"Finally Grisham writes a novel that is based elsewhere, in this case Washington and Brasil.

This is John Grisham in his signature style. (as opposed to the Innocent Man, which I didn't care for) I'd like to give it 4.5 stars, but that wasn't an option. It was hard to put it down and kept me interested all the way to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Testament","review":"John - time to hang up the pen I'm afraid. Let real authors like Scott Turow and Richard North Patterson write the lawyer books. The Testament was one long bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"take some time off, john!","review":"I have been a Grisham fan for years, I loved all of his \\"early\\" books, but over the last few years he has become predictable and formulaic, writing only what will sell. The Testament fell right into those lines, making it extremely obvious that Grisham needs to take a little time off and try to figure out exactly what he wants as a writer, and stop writing for the money. The Testament is, so far, the worst of his books. It was overly predictable, boring in some parts, annoying in others, and the ending left me feeling like I never wanted to read another Grisham book again. Lets just hope that his success with a Painted House has given him a little time to rethink the way he has been writing the rest of his novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great weekend read","review":"I grabbed 4 novels to take with me on a weekend trip to Las Vegas. I'm glad that the one I chose to read was The Testament. I wanted a book that I could start and finish during the trip. This was the perfect book. It's a fun, fast, and emotional read. It's fun to fantasize what you would do if handed $11 billion dollars (before taxes). I disagree with those who thought that the ending fizzled out. Let them come up with a better ending! Grisham never disappoints. I'd like to read the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. Aimless, ridiculous and uninteresting story line.

Buy the book quick - this is surely something for you: no difficult words, simple yet totally unreal story, the hero turns from very baddy lawyer to a very gooooddie one in a couple hundred pages. This is another example of Grisham's new style of work: turn a bad guy into a Robin Hood type. Hooray! If you're not American then spend your hard earned money on something else or at least on Grisham's first 4 books - they were 1000% better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad amazoner","review":"This book came in horrible condition even though it was labeled \\"very good\\" When I contacted the seller his explanation was \\"what do you expect?\\" I expect the book to come in the condition it was described or at least a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate John Grisham","review":"Standard left-liberal anti-capitalist formulaic rant that proves what behavioral economists are saying about herd behavior.

It is an exiting book and while it is not john grisham at his best(The Chamber is) it is a great book. I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story Line confusing and disjointed not his best work","review":"The beginning of story was very interesting, and I thought it would be a spellbining story. However, the plot deteriorated as the story progressed. The degenerate nature of the main character was overly developed compared to the \\"new guy\\" he became after he met Rachel Lane. The author seemed to be exploring new territory as he attempted to delve into issues of spirituality. I am usually a fiend for Grisham books, and will read the next one. But this one was not his best effort. He should re-write the story using the skill, passion, and finesse he employed when writing \\"A Time To Kill\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Reading Vacation","review":"I enjoyed the book. I don't have time to read novels very often, so I took a three-day reading \\"vacation\\" to read this. I really liked the transformation that took place in Nate O'Riley. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending was a little too neat, but, who likes loose ends? And really, if you understand the mindset of a missionary like Rachel, the ending was perfect. I appreciated the way Grisham presented God and His true nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is definitely not a \\"have to read\\" book.","review":"Although I found the part of the story which took place in Brazil interesting, I found myself leafing through pages just to make the effort to get through the book.

Hope Mr. Grisham can create a more interesting book in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of Predictble, but Mesmerizing Nevertheless","review":"Grisham's novels are becoming more predictable, but his writing style is captivating, nevertheless. If you follow the \\"good guy\\", you already know the \\"who\\". Because Grisham's style is mesmerizing, you let it carry you to the \\"how\\".

However, my husband and I listened to the book on tape while traveling, and I predicted to him halfway through the 6-hour recording *exactly* how the story would end. I was absolutely right.I am convinced that either John Grisham did not write this nonsense, or someone else far more talented helped him write the previous works with his name on them. I am only relieved that I did not spend a dime of my good money to hear this pathetic excuse for a story, and urge anyone who is considering buying the book to reconsider. Borrow it from the library if you must subject yourself to it. But Grisham is obviously FAR too rich already if he'd dare put his name to such an excuse for literature.Forget another big-screen blockbuster. Even the Sunday night made-for-TV scene is far too good for this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham phones it in","review":"This book is a complete disappointment. Grisham knows he will have a best seller, regardless of what he puts on a page. As a result, this weak attempt at a whole novel is laughable.

Truthfully, I couldn't even finish it, which is unheard of for me. But, Nate's journey to find Rachel just seemed to drag on forever and if that wasn't enough, I really had difficulty reading about the nasty \\"heirs\\" to the old man's fortunes. They couldn't ALL be so horrid, could they? Very boring-I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disapointment","review":"Having read all of Grisham's previous works, I was eagerly anticipating The Testament -- especially after hearing an interview in which the book's author talked about his religious convictions.However, I lost interest in the book's characters and the plot quickly. This is the first John Grisham novel I have quit reading. It just didn't grab me."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word, YUCK!","review":"I am an avid reader and with an undergraduate major and a masters degree in English I have read many a novel. Without a doubt, The Testament is one of the all-time worst stories I have ever had the misfortune of reading. I don't want you to think I'm saying this because I don't like Grisham's style. Some of my all-time favorite books have been written by John Grisham; but about half way through this one I almost stopped reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring and pointless.","review":"I have read and re-read many of John Grisham's books, I love the fast pace and the wonderful characters in his previous books, but 'The Testament' was a big disappointment. No pace, no chase, no suspense, no interesting courtroom legalities, no interesting characters. Just floating in a boat in the jungle."},{"rating":"1","title":"No characters worth caring about","review":"Troy Phelan's plot to get his last testament executed the way he wanted it was mildly interesting, but there were hundreds of pages left after that. No suspense thriller, this.I've read all the reviews and have to wonder: Many of the 5-star raves sound like they were written by Grisham's publicist or publishing house. I'd advise readers to take these online reviews with a grain of salt. I loaned my copy of The Testament to other Grisham fans, all of whom were 1) disappointed and 2) relieved they hadn't bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Am I the only one who wanted to read more about the greedy heirs than Nate's adventures in Brazil. I found myself dozing off when during the travels in the Pantanal. I think we've read enough about South America and barefoot boys playing soccer in the streets. It's time to get back to the basics, Mr. Grisham. More books like the Runaway Jury would be nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and monochromatic","review":"An attempted journey into the Heart of Darkness that sinks.

Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets","review":"The opening chapter of this book does an excellent job of drawing in the reader, but the bulk of the story is an unspeakable disappointment that left me wondering whether anyone with a fraction of John Grisham's intelligence could possibly have written it. It is a contrived, predictable, thinly-disguised piece of religious propaganda that left me so cold that it will take more than a little convincing to ever get me to pick up another of his books, let alone pay good money to own one. Words cannot express my disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Testament","review":"Superior book as are all Grisham novels.

That about a tenth of the book. Unfortunately after that it gets long-winded and then it gets really looong-winded. I kept wondering when the plot would thicken or something interesting would happen, and then I eventually finished the book and was still waiting. Its also a bit of a downer book - full of sickness and insect problems. Oh well, I guess every Grisham book can't be a hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Start, but.....","review":"This books has a fascinating start. But once the will gets read, it slips slowly down hill. Half the book -- a trip through the swamp -- is quite boring. The best character - Josh - never gets developed. Once again, Grisham makes a legal blunder: a witness admits in deposition that 4 attorneys paid him $500,000 to testify -- yet, no one files a bar complaint? John, wake up, you are a good writer but no one will buy into that scenario. This could have been a great book, with a different direction. I did like the Christian aspect, just didn't like how we got there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fairly decent read","review":"I have to say that I began to stray from John Grisham around the time when he wrote The Chamber. I decided to pick up The Testament. The cover didn't hypnotize me, I was desparate for my weekly reading fix. Well, I couldn't put it down. I felt Nate's pain. I cried with him when Rachel died. Maybe Grisham caught me at a vulnerable time. I thought this was one of his greater pieces of works. It ranks up there with The Firm. You GO John. Can't wait for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard characters and a strained plot","review":"John Grisham seems to be spending less and less time writing his novels, and the plots and character development show it. A Time to Kill and The Firm are well-plotted with several characters that are more than cardboard cutouts. But once he quit lawyering and writing part-time and started writing full time, his books have grown increasingly flat. Yes, he'll still sell thousands of copies and probably wouldn't sell any more if he were to spend more time at crafting his works. But it's disappointing that he is unwilling or unable to realize his potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham inspires us with his story","review":"I enjoyed reading this very different Grisham book. I see an author with character. His wife and family must be proud of his accomplishments and his moral integrity. It shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and dull","review":"This may be Grisham's most disappointing effort yet. I finished the book out of a dogged curiousity to see if it might take off somewhere with anything even remotely resembling a Grisham plot, the answer: uh-uh. For better plotting, characterization and ability to hold your interest, try the New Testament. While I can certainly get behind the idea of an alcoholic, workaholic, sexaholic lawyer having a come-to-Jesus experience in the jungles of Brazil, this book doesn't even come close to being convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Grishamnatic","review":"Forget the futile arguing. Millions of readers like myself have read this latest work by my favorite author and loved it. There are millions out there who have read it and don't. We are all entitled to our opinions and what we consider good and bad. I just want to know why my previous review (on Feb 2nd) is apparently gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probate law can be entertaining!","review":"Grisham has fashioned a modern morality play for American society. There are lessons here for all of us, not merely the lawyers. The setting for Nate O'Riley's meeting with Rachel Lane Porter is straight out of Conrad. In order to cleanse your soul, you must first pierce the heart of darkness. Grisham's tale does, and holds a message of redemption that we all can benefit from. Finely written and a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow read.","review":"For the first time I thought of quitting a John Grisham novel before I finished reading it. I'm glad I didn't but the first half of the book was extremely hard to get through. There was a definite pick up in the second half of the book but The Testament was my least favorite book John Grisham has written. If it hadn't been John Grisham I probably would have put it down after the first 3 or 4 chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Grisham's better books.","review":"I think Grisham is back! I am glad. This is an enjoyable book with believable characters. I really liked the human aspect and that not all worked out \\"perfect\\". Good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought the book was excellent, but at times boring.","review":"The Testament is a great book to read if one can uncover the meaning behind the text. For the people who cant or do not want to, i would not reccommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: BORING","review":"I usually like Grisham. His contempt for the legal profession is amusing & there is some of that contempt here. This book starts off really good & quickly turns in to an adventure down a river. BORING. If I want a travelogue/study of other cultures thing, I will go find Michener"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too religious...yawn","review":"Yawn...too ridiculous to believe. This is a book about lawyers? How? Searching the jungles, getting sober...yawn. Not a bad book overall, but definitely not a John Grishmam type book. Has John found religion all of a sudden?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, John Grisham!","review":"As a Christian, I found it refreshing to read a novel interwoven with the message of hope and salvation. Truly God's hand is evident in Mr. Grisham's writing, and what a blessing to all of us. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham doesn't know squat about Canada.","review":"This novel contains an exhaustive description of the Panatal region in South America, yet John Grisham refers to a woman in the story being born in an igloo in Newfoundland, Canada. How can Grisham know so much about one area of the world, and so little about another? Try doing some just basic research on your friendly neighbors to the North, John. You may just find we live in a modern society, and that igloo's are what American's only think Canadian's live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a fiction writer that doesn't slam Christians","review":"I definately would suggest someone read this book. For me it was a page turner from the start. Grisham does an excellent job of creating Rachel Lane, the heir, as a strong, confident Christan. Many writers are unable or unwilling to do that, and I applaud Grisham for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books. The Testament is my least favorite, largely because it lacks the compelling story line of his previous works. Furthermore, the character development is not nearly as thorough as you might expect of Grisham. As a result, it is difficult to feel \\"in touch\\" with any of the characters. Also, the book tries to deal with too many complex issues -- alcoholism, greed, the environment, probate -- and as a result, not one is fully developed. While the book is by no means \\"bad,\\" it did not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another anti- climatic Grisham ending","review":"I keep giving a Grisham novel another chance to revive my hope that I one again will be entralled, like i was with, A Time To Kill, The Firm even with The Partner, but AGAIN, i am dissappointed, Actually the book wasnt so bad, it had an interesting concept, a exotic locale (Brazil), but ANOTHER uneventful, boring ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another beautifully written story by Grisham","review":"Grisham's is an incredible writer, and this story was a great read. It was a bit slow at times but the overall storyline was very interesting. This novel was quite different than his previous ones because the main focus of it was not in the courtroom. I mean that in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book John Grisham has ever written!","review":"The Testament is a very good book. It show's that money to some people is not everything. And what is so great about the book is that people who have a lot of money get awful greedy at times. It is a good read for any one that needs a wake up call."},{"rating":"1","title":"not wonderful","review":"Mr. Grisham's last two books have left me with the same feeling. He's writing, telling not a half bad story...looks down and sees that he's got enough pages written for a book. Regardless of where he is in the story line, he wraps it up and calls it done. I won't bother reading another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Testa-What?","review":"I am shocked at the impotence of this drama tingling novel.My life was spent watching Johns Books go from hero to zero.I wish I could change some of the chars around.Slow read.Nice Plot.Give a four because Im old fashioned.5 is the lowest on my scale , therefore 4 is pretty low.Give this book a chance , John might tame your tiger."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't go on anymore","review":"Maybe it's a good thing that I only purchased the audiotape of The Partner and that the Street Lawyer was loaned to me, because I can't spend another penny trying to make it through the stereotypical characters (100 zillion people in the law firm all stressed out, boo hoo) and predictable plots.Sorry Grisham, but fulfilling your book contract doesn't have to be this painful. But I did love The Firm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Grisham we know and love","review":"I found The Testament the least enjoyable of Grisham's books. It is as if he \\"got religion\\" and wanted to share the word in good missionary form. Some of the book was informative, however. His description of the Pantanal in South America was interesting. For this reason I gave the book two stars. I generally pass on the Grisham books to friends but won't be recommending this particular one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dull","review":"Boring, Boring, Boring! It was all I could do to finish this book. The first couple of chapters are really good, but it goes downhill from there. It's all too predictable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Pabulum","review":"It amazes me that Grisham's books keep selling on the top of the charts when he continues to crank out such incipid trash. His first few books were great, but its time for Grisham to retire. The Testament begins with an interesting proposition -- a good \\"hook\\" -- but look forward to baby food all the way to the end. The only reason I finished this book: I was on a transcontinental flight with nothing else to do ... and I left the book for the plane cleanup crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEEDED MORE DEPTH","review":"I enjoyed this book but felt the characters needed more fleshing out. I didn't particularly like anyone person in the story with the exception of Jevy. I feel the ending leaves things open for a sequel (which is not Grisham's style) but it's an idea. What will Nate do with the trust, how will he spend it and how much of a fuss will the spoiled brats make when they find out the whole story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry. I thought it boring","review":"Grisham is the master of the unnecessary detail. He pads out his story by telling us more than we want to know.I guess I'm in a minority, but I found \\"The Testament\\" a colossal bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great by Grisham","review":"I just finished reading this book and I have to say it kept me on my feet. I enjoyed reading this book though before I even started the book I thought it wasn't going to be that great but since it was a Grisham book I gave it a chance and I am very happy that I did. It was adventurous it went from the courtroom to a search in Brazil. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like Danielle Steele than Grisham","review":"Though a Grisham fan, this book was a disappointment. I felt he must have had to dash it off in a hurry. None of the intricate twists and turns. No real great characters. I thought it was more like a Danielle Steele book (and that's not a compliment), something he wrote to meet a deadline, than the usual good plot and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be re-titled \\"What I did on my vacation.\\"","review":"I have read every Grisham book and this one simply does not measure up. I skimmed long stretches of plotless descriptions of Brazil."},{"rating":"1","title":"is it really worth it?","review":"I truly thought it was poorly written and doesn't deserve all the publicity it is getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring----like slogging through the jungle in cement shoes","review":"The first 50 pages were entertaining and promising. Once the trip to South America began, the book became less entertaining than a trip tp the periodontist. The characters were wooden..a poor takeoff on RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Please skip the intervening 300 pages and read the last chapter....if you even care enough to find out what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know what you'll get!","review":"We know what to expect from Grisham -- more mind numbing stuff for long flights. And more suspense followed by no plot or climax.Will he have had the respect to his readers to have the book edited? Doubtful -- we'll be subjected to the same repetitive phrases. Will he have had the courtesy to have it proofread for the simplest misspellings? Doubtful -- he's too busy cranking out pulp for cash.Supposedly this book has only the barest of physical descriptions of the characters -- don't want to spoil things for the Hollywood casting people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Testament is even worse than The Chamber.","review":"This has to be Grisham's worst outing yet. The story about the search through Brazil is so tedious and boring that I nearly threw the book against the wall. I finished it merely out of a morbid curiousity. I was surprised by the ending, however, in that it didn't have the requisite Grisham-read-like-a-screenplay-and-fade-to-black quality. I am a true Grisham fan, but I would not recommend The Testament to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It made my head hurt","review":"This is the worst piece of Grisham trash yet!!! Every book is about a southern lawyer, Doesn't he understand that no one likes southern lawyers?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"This book started out great with the surprises about the will but once it started with the trek through the jungles it just dragged so much that I couldn't hardly stand to read it. I couldn't put it down because I kept expecting some kind of surprise or something of interest to happen but it didn't. That was the surprise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't B Buyin' This One!","review":"I have been a Grisham fan since A Time To Kill. Before every body got on the bandwagon with The Firm (still Grisham's best work to date). His recent work has sucked. He has gotten lazy. I will not be buying this one ( but I will check it out at the library). Notice how all the reviews are good BEFORE the release then SUCK after the release? Take a hint from a fan, save your money! Let's send 'ol Johnny a message with our wallets to get his tail in gear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Read","review":"Grisham puts to words a story to remind us the depth of this world. This book was incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Grisham's finest hour","review":"A derranged billionaire, bickering losers buried in debt and a fanatic hiding in the ends of the world for heirs of an enormous fortune. That is the Phelan Legacy. A study in failed marriages and addictions with rabid sharks willing to go to the verge of disbarment in exchange for a fat commission. The Piranhas were not swimming in the Pantanal River, they were backstabbing each other in the courtrooms of Washington D.C. It is a page turner all right. I could not wait to see the end of it and put this miserable story to bed. Not to mention that the end was absolutely predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother nature hates emptiness - This book is empty","review":"I am so sorry I did not pay enough attention to the negative reviews about this book. Not even worth the paper it's printed on. Please think twice before buying it, and only buy it if you're to offer it to s/o you don't like. John Grisham used to write unputdownable books. Reading The Testament makes you feel as dead as its main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks!","review":"If I had walked into a publishing house with this manuscript I would have been kicked out but because John Grisham's name is on it, it (unfortunately) got published. This book was duller than a rusty butter knife. NAte makes his first uninteresting foray to the jungles of Brazil that takes him about 300 pages. His second journey remarkably takes less than 3 pages. There was no suspense, no drama, no romance. A few anacondas and alligators thrown in here and there was apparently supposed to keep readers on their toes. Hardly. The ending was so pointless that I actually felt mad that I had wasted a few hours reading this. So the heirs only got 50 million instead of a billion. Boo hoo hoo. Am I supposed to feel justice was served? Their is no justice in this book, only injustice at the waste of time and the fact that it cost too much. Thnk goodness I borrowed it from a friend who, if she was a friend, would have saved me from reading this utterly horrible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"The Testament was a great book, in my opinion. Like all Grisham books the start was better than the finish. The end was rushed, but isn't it always. I would hope everyone would read this on. One of Grisham's finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"It was hard to read the entire book. I kept waiting for the story to 'grab me' but it just never happened. Could not identify with any of the characters(nor did I care what happened to any of the characters!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Read","review":"I was discouraged from purchasing the book earlier on by some reviews posted here that stated it was not up to his usual standards. After reading the book, I disagree. The setting in Brazil is a little unusual for Grisham, but that is a good thing for the author. Just like all of the Grisham books, I was unable to put this one down. He has a knack of keeping the novel flowing rapidly and your interest hightned. The characters are well-developed and the ending is a real surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very interesting plot","review":"I really enjoyed this book - it was my first Grisham and I was skeptical, because I don't like to run to the best sellers as soon as they're out... I wait to hear friends' recommendations. Well, a friend loaned it to me and I drank it before bed every night late into the wee hours until it was done. A very interesting plot, with characters you either admire of despise.Made me consider looking at other Grishams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Excellent","review":"Some of Grisham works require a love of the law to really appreciate but this is a down to earth page turner. It is well written and although a stretch on the plot plausibility, very entertaining, inhabited by real life type characters. Definately worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is the first book I've ever read of John Grisham, therefore I can not compare this to his other bestselling novels. But I can say this, I could not put this down once I started reading it. The characters were very real and I found myself rooting for Nate throughout the story to overcome his problems. Another great part of this book is that is opened up a whole new world to me in the explanation of the Pantanal, an ecological region of Brazil that I had never heard of before. Thanks John, you just got yourself a new fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Grishams best by far !","review":"A friend lent me the book to read and though I have only read a few of Grishams novels,(mostly earlier ones)I was mildly disappointed in THE TESTAMENT. I did not care for the story line and it seemed to far fetched to believe. I guess once in a while,a dud comes out and this is the ONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An under-rated book","review":"I read all of Grisham's books and look forward to his new release in February. Several friends told me The Testament was not as good as his other books. I disagree! I really enjoyed it and had trouble putting it down. It is different from his other books but still great fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Testament","review":"I have read every John Grisham book from \\"A Time to Kill\\" through \\"The Testament.\\" I must say that each successive book has shown less creativity and imagination, culminating with The Testament. The alcoholic and/or drug addicted misfit, working amongst the vultures of the large corporate law firm, that suddenly discovers his values in time to save the day is becoming a tired theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books, and I enjoyed this one, although it dragged in some places, and there seemed to be too many things happening at once. I enjoyed the character of Nate, since practically everyone can relate to his flaws in some way. I liked the \\"spiritual\\" aspect of the book; however, I was disappointed in the ending. John Grisham's books never end the way I want them to, and I wish he would keep women and their love of romance & happy endings in mind from time to time. I wanted Nate and Rachel to get married and live happily ever after in the jungles of Brazil being co-missionaries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The main disappointment was due the the books by Grisham I had read previously. This one is so inferior - I felt I was reading something rushed, too commercial. This doesn't prevent me, though, from remaining a faithful Grisham reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing","review":"I've been a Grisham fan ever since I read A Time to Kill. I've read all of his works, and enjoyed many. However, this latest entry into his collection of novels was by far the least enjoyable of anything he's written. His writing style has become incredibly dull, and if I weren't a fan (less of one now) I would not have finished the book. He's gotten away from his style of old, and opted towards a newer, more dull and politically centered style, which I found completely boring. Needless to say, I do not think that I will be purchasing the next Grisham book, since he's declined to a new low with The Testament."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy","review":"Big Disappointment! The story had no thrill or edge. I read through it only because I was on vacation and had nothing else to read. I will give The Brethern a chance only because I have loved all his other books (except The Street Lawyer only earned 3 stars from me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"As usual, a very good read.","review":"I really enjoyed it. It was difficult to put down. It even entered my dreams in an intense sort of way. It was a very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aimless journey into avarice and the Brazilian jungle","review":"I was very disappointed in this novel. Although I applaud Mr. Grisham's attempt to get away from superhero lawyers and the streets of Memphis, he did so without any direction. The characters are poorly developed and flat. They are either evil and greedy, or drunks. Even the protagonist only changes his ways when he is led to do so, either by his therapist or this faultless \\"angel\\" in the jungle. The various subplots do not fit together very well. And, in the end, the hero of our story just capitulates to the slimy offspring of the writer of The Testament. I kept waiting to care about someone or something in this book. It never happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly spiritual novel","review":"I've always loved John Grisham (The Partner was my favorite until reading The Testament), and I was pleasantly shocked to find such outright spiritualty oozing from Grisham's pen. I saw much of myself in the character of Nate (though I'm neither an alcoholic nor twice divorced), and was only disappointed that we aren't able to see how his spiritual journey progresses. What this story does show us is how readily grace is available to us all. When we are at our worst, we can still be used to accomplish something bigger. God has faith in us -- he's created us to do big things -- and all we need to do is learn to lean on his strength rather than our own. Watching Nate come to this conclusion was one of my favorite aspects of this book. This is a truly satisfying read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention Reviewers","review":"Please, bear in mind that people read your reviews in order to decide whether or not to buy a certain work. When writing reviews of these books, please remember to not give away the entire plot of the book. If that's what we had in mind, we would find Cliff's Notes. Thank you for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant start, but no idea for the rest","review":"Another story from Mr Grisham about the volunteers fighting for the idea and about the lawyers willing to give up their millions for this idea and I will never buy his book anymore. Great beginning with the old millionaire creating his intrigue, but then... big disappointment - there is no intrigue at all (exactly like in the \\"Street lawyer\\"). No idea how to develop the plot. Looks like Mr Grisham has just fallen in love with the Brazilian forests and wanted to write something about that. I was reading it and waiting for something to happen and suddenly... I got to the end. Where is the plot, intrigue and suspense from the \\"Pelican Brief\\" or \\"Partner\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grisham's best","review":"This was an okay story - I was just expecting GREAT things after reading numerous reviews. Took this on vacation to read at the beach and it ended up more wet and sandy than read! I have read every Grisham book and have really liked most of the others, but this one was just not as good. I always feel that these books move along really well, have great characters and great stories and then just seem to fizzle to an ending. Is this just me? Worth reading, but truly not the best work by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book so far!","review":"I love this book, and have dubbed it \\"my favorite\\"- however, I do have a lot more Grisham to read. But, it still is an amazing book. I really got to know and develope a love/hate relationship with the characters. The tempo of this book is steady and even, and is definately a page turner- I could not put it down. I highly recommend it to people who are new to Grisham, it's an excellent example of the tone and pace that is prevelant in many of his novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Grisham scores again","review":"In the midst of the fast-paced world of litigation, this book provides us with a glimpse into a less cluttered, more serene lifestyle where none of the former matters. The main character's life is transformed by his contact with a young woman whose simple, selfless existence is in direct contrast to his own. John Grisham has a definite talent in making the reader feel as though he wishes that he knew the characters personally. This book is one of my personal favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story with exotic setting","review":"I recently started reading John Grisham again, and I'm enjoying his novels. This one combines an interesting plot about a billionaire's will with the exotic setting of Brazil's Pantanal region. Like all of Grisham's books, it reads fast and the characters are flawed but endearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Grisham, need I say more?","review":"Troy Phelan is very rich and very old. And dying, or so it is said. His family can't wait for him to die. They're greedy and can't wait to take a share of his 11 billion dollar pie. And the will does give them all an even share. Or so they think. Because even from the grave, Troy knows how to make them all squirm in there Armani suits. He leaves all of his money to an unknown heir and illegitimate child, Rachel Lane. And where is Rachel? Of course, she happens to be one of the hardest people on the planet to get in touch with. Nate O'Riley is sent to inform Rachel of her father's death and also that she is now the richest woman in the world. Nates journey will take him deep into the Pantanal, where the dangers he may face are dangers he hasn't even thought about yet.It grabs you at the beginning, sends you at flying speeds right until the end where it gently sweeps you away. This book does not disappoint. But then again, Grisham rarely does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Grisham winner.","review":"I am still reading this book but so far it is as good, or even better, than other novels by Grisham I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique.","review":"Unique background in South America.

Not enough however to keep me glued to the end and wished it would go on longer. I would thoroughly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Testament","review":"Was very good, but slow starting, once it got going it held my interest through the end. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I count on John Grisham for a good read when I need an escape from my life. I found myself reluctant to bother finishing this one, though I never lost hope that it would get better. It didn't. It read like an ad for a born-again Christian church and what little was resolved at the end wasn't worth the effort. I couldn't help wondering if Grisham phoned this one in, or indeed if he wrote it at all. I understand that publishers continue to publish under a best selling author's name long after he/she dies. Maybe Grisham died and no one told him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy, but uneventful, read","review":"This book was a very easy read, and it did keep my attention. I kept waiting for something to happen, which never did. This story would have had much more substance to it without all of the insignificant, unending details. Instead of detailing the smallest, irrelevant event, I would have like to have seen better development of the characters, mainly the family. I feel that the majority of this story was done just to fill in the pages. All in all, it's worth a read as long as you don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just as you should not judge a book by its cover...","review":"...you should not judge a book by its first chapter. I have seen and enjoyed the Grisham movies, so I finally decided to buy some of his books. I have two and have yet to get beyond half way through either of them without falling asleep. He always starts off with a bang and a good idea and somehow loses it from there. So far, from what I can see, apparently the Hollywood screenwriters buy his stories and fix them up from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun read - dull ending","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, primarily because I was in the mood for a fast and easy read after the holidays. The book starts out with a bang, and the story was fun to follow. But, my main criticism of almost all Grisham books continues to be that the author doesn't seem to know how to end something. Everything gets wrapped up too neatly and easily, and that's it. I wanted more - after the great beginning and interesting middle, I felt cheated with a cop-out ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great lawyer novel from the master","review":"Troy Phelan, womanising billionaire, commits suicide leaving his fortune to an unknown daughter, Rachel. She is hiding from life in the Pantanal wilderness area of Brazil and wants the money even less than she wants to be found. Meanwhile, Phelan's other, more or less legitimate, children are joined together in a wild legal battle for their late father's fortune. Phelan's long-time lawyer wants nothing more than to honour his client's wishes and sends Nate O'Riley to find Rachel and bring back her signature so that he can defend Phelan's testament.A fast paced novel that leads to an almost perfect conclusion. I was a tad disappointed with the ending but wouldn't change it. This novel also provides early evidence of Grisham's growing softer side evidenced by Skipping Christmas and Bleachers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action, Please?","review":"Wow! What a stunning DEAD END! This book is a serious mark against the Grisham that America has had the privilege to enjoy. Gone are the days of fast-moving, action-packed, page-turning suspense thrillers from this author. Don't get me wrong, THE FIRST 100 PAGES WERE GOOD! After that, though, save your time and do something more important and exciting, like laundry."},{"rating":"1","title":"testament to junk","review":"Grisham has not, in my opinion, written a decent book since A Time to Kill and The Firm. I gave up books ago but decided to try The Testament. Big Mistake. Trip to South America is less a plot issue than one to fill space. You hate the major principals at the beginning and their development is razor thin. And, of course, we have the typical boozing outcast attorney (or fill in the blank) who will change clothes in the phonebooth and turn into Superman. Grisham is now off my list - permanently. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one....","review":"My feelings for Grisham weren't the same after his books were turned into movies. What truly got me was how the quality of his writing went from writing for readers and great suspensful novels to writing with the image of Susan Sarandon playing his leading lady. I became disenchanted and stopped buying his books. Well, in July I picked up \\"The Testament\\" as reading material for my 11 hour flight to Hawaii. I probably should have opened a hatch and chucked the book somewhere over the Pacific. What a waste of time. I kept with the book only to be completly disappointed with his unimaginative, unfulfilling ending.The jungles of the rainforest may look provocative on the big screen, but in print, this book is dull, dull, dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very disappointing","review":"This book is very disappointing, and not merely because a multibillionaire apparently in good health, not having a brain tumor, kills himself. That was only one problem for me, and not the most serious, in a story populated by too many one-dimensional descendants, all bad, which could lead one to question whether their problem is not genetic. Worse, and a real sin for a novel, the plot drags as slowly as the boat Nate takes thru the Brazilian swamp. I am having trouble getting through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing ending!!!","review":"I thought the book was very good up until the end. I was very disappointed that Mr. Phelan's children got anything. And to have Rachel die in the end, what was that about? Very disappointing! I was hoping she and Nate would get together and do good things with the money. The brain tumor made more sense, why would someone that healthy, rich and powerful spend time in an unneeded wheelchair and then jump to his death. I could understand with the brain tumor but without it, WHY? I'm a big John Grisham fan, have read all his books but this one was a disappointment.

Probably very appealing to the devoute but does not offer much for agnostics, atheists or those looking for an interesting read. Unlike earlier novels, provides little information (even on the religious level)and a trite plot. Though Rachel's character, such as it was, held some appeal the \\"hero's\\" and his redemption were reminiscent of dirty cotton candy - sacharine, sticky and insubstantial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Unlike John Grisham's first two books, A Time to Kill and TheFirm, which were impossible to put down, The Testament leaves thereader wondering why this book was written. It is a obvious plea to \\"save the rain forest\\" (Pantanal) of South America. The reader has a hard time identifying with any of the characters and really couldn't care less of the outcome to them. The fact that Grisham takes over half the book building up the readers dislike for many of the characters just to have them make out in the end, does NOTHING to redeem this waste of time.Grisham has written biting,spellbinding,cutting edge books. Unfortunately, even the low price that Amazon charges does not redeem this book.Suggestion: If you are a Grisham fan and read all of his books, wait until Amazon has the paperback. If not, choose another of the 1 million books Amazon sells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"Not witty, interesting or entertaining.... It's only a dull plot, leading to the lawyer's convertion thru religion, not very likely.... It's sad to see a good writer lose his imagination and sense of wonder....

Grisham doing an imitation of Paul Theroux?","review":"Except the first chapter, the rest is totally uninteresting, all those tedious details of a drunk traveling in a Brazilian jungle, what's the point?

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's written better","review":"I've listened to most of Grisham's audiobooks, and this is the worst yet. The South American adventures are boring ... but the legal twists are fascinating (particularly the first chapter). Get out of the jungle, John, and go back to the courtroom!

I can't wait until the movie comes out for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Usual Grisham","review":"John Grisham is one of my favorite authors.

Now I know why. Grisham leads us to believe that it would be little or no trouble finding someone lost deep in the jungles and waters of Brazil.

I gave an extra star because I like books that read fast and this one does."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULDN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN","review":"EXCELLENT BOOK! WELL WRITTEN.

His first few books were great, fast-paced adventures and after that Grisham wrote books for the money. The only reason that I bought The Testament was because of the great review in USA Today. I was hoping to find the Grisham adventures that I once loved. Wrong! This book was the best sleeping pill since college Geography. If you feel you must read this book to see for yourself -- go to the library or wait for the paperback and save yourself some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring after 1st few chapters","review":"After the first few chapters, I thought this was going to be an excellent book. The rest of the book completely disabused me of that notion. There were large sections where nothing at all was happening-- yes, he has an amazing talent for describing details, but I'm not interested in 50 pages of it at a time unless it actually has some bearing on the plot. I agree completely with the reader that said this could've been written in 100 pages or less. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"No suspense, no drama, not up to Grisham standards.","review":"I was hoping that his last book, The Street Lawyer was an aboration. Unfortunately, it wasn't! Mr. Grisham wrote so many suspenseful and interesting books, I expected more of the same. I was very disapointed with this book and his previous book. There was no courtroom drama. There was no suspense. I could not connect with any of the characters as I could with The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The pelican Brief, etc. My Grisham shouldn't write a \\"book-a-year\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Testament is Minor League","review":"Reading The Testament is like watching Micheal Jordan play minor league baseball. You just pray he'll get back to his true calling soon. The detour started with The Partner and has continued with The Street Lawyer and The Testament. Grisham's heart and soul is the Deep South and it's complex issues and compelling characters. When you add the expert legal drama it's magic. The Testament has no magic. The plot is strained and sometimes preachy, and I never liked or sympathized with any of the characters. The only saving grace is the interesting legal manuvering which Grisham never fails to deliver on. Hopefully sometime soon he'll release a new book that says \\"I'm Back!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"FAR from his best","review":"This is not the same John Grisham that kept us gripping the book 'white-knuckled' in The Client and The Partner. I was spoiled by Mr. Grisham's earlier books, but since Street Lawyer and now Testament fell flat - I think Mr. Baldacci is #1. Thanks for the memories, John."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is fair. He has written many good books","review":"The book starts out running, then jogs, then walks, then crawls ad infinitum. Then starts running again, slows down and just loses it. Grisham seems to write his books in great detail and then he seems to tire and decides to just end them quickly. I like his books but his endings don't justify all the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travelogue for Brazil with boring characters","review":"How much payback did John Grisham receive from travel agencies in Brazil to write this trite, uninteresting,shallow book?

I ended up hot and itchy from weather and insect descriptions. A good Calamine Lotion advertisement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grisham's usual suspense filled book.","review":"The first three chapters were funny. It trails off and becomes boring.

It feels like you are in the history personally.Easy to read also,even if you are not a lawyer your self. Lawyer language is a special language,and Grisham describes the testament document easy even if you can not read lawyer talk.Over all an interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like a travelogue than an adventure","review":"This is the first Grisham book that took me a week to finish. The plot was dull and predictable; the characters sparsely and hastily sketched. Just because he took a trip to Brazil doesn't mean it's fodder for an adventure novel.I miss the twists and turns and tension I found in his last books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"I am a big fan of John Grisham. I have read all of his books. I will agree that some are better than others. I think that this one is one of his best. I think too many people are comparing it to The Firm, though. It is a different kind of story, and until you accept that you probably won't like it.

Skip Street Lawyer also."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dead book","review":"an old guy jumping out of the window seems to be the only interesting character in the book, it would be better that the other characters were looking for the window to jump out of.

A pity because Grisham was a good read up to now."},{"rating":"1","title":"The downward spiral continues","review":"John Grisham no longer writes novels--he's cranking out screenplays now--and boy are they preachy.If you thought The Street Lawyer was bad, wait until you get your hands on this one.

No offense meant for the writer who just found a gold mine writing this type of books (he might be very good, but we'll never find out...) but this is empy \\"toilette-reading\\" that competes with the likes of Playboy which, at least, does not pretend to be any more than it is.The story was not only boring but soooo empty of meaning. The only value added I see in this book is the opportunity it gives us to practice our reading ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented as a mystery novel","review":"The Testament disappointed. I have enjoyed most of Grisham's works but in \\"The Chamber\\" and now in \\"The Testament\\" he fosters his opinions on capital punishment (Chamber) and born again religion (Testament) on his readers who are expecting a good legal/mystery thriller. I felt cheated and was upset with time spent reading The Testament. If he and his publishers were more candid those who like this type of book can choose it and the rest of us will pass. Grisham is a good writer, but I do not wish to be preached to by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"why i would'nt reccomend this book","review":"The book, The Testament by John Grisham is not a good book in my opinion. The book is a little hard to follow because of the point of view. It jumps around on characters, it goes from first to third omniscient.The characters were not explained well enough in my opinion.The only character that felt explained enough to me was the main character who killed himself.The conflict was not hard enough to solve in my opinion. All the man had to do was fly to Brazil to find this daughter he had that no one knew he had. All in all its just not a very good book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book, very entertaining","review":"This is one of the best books that I've read this year.

Must have for anybody who enjoys these types of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outstanding 1st chapter, plummeted to low ground thereafter","review":"This was a book that promised to deliver. The reviews have been way out of proportion. The first chapter was certainly catching. Thereafter the book moved slowly with a mindless ending. After a good read I always feel as if I have been part of something. Ater this book I felt as if I had been cheated of time I could have spent in more worthy endeavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start, but gains speed into a cyclical mystery","review":"Reminds me of the Rainmaker. The main character, has a need to fulfill humanity and to include philanthropy in his life. Slow to start, but has ehtical and moral undertones, which include themes of life and the journey therein. Moves methodically and ends with a surprise (if you are not familiar with Grisham's prose techniques)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another solid piece of work.","review":"Again, John Grisham can take the same old hero, in the same old situation and make it interesting. I told myself that I would not read another Grisham book that had a lawyer in it. I'm happy I gave him another chance. This was a page turner from the start with an ending that most writers wish they could develop.When can we expect another piece of work... I can't wait!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a mediocre effort among in an otherwise stellar list","review":"This book had promise. I found myself completely engrossed in Mr. Phelan's life and his vindictive but brilliant plan to screw his deadbeat family. Once they started going to the foreign country to find Rachel, the book became boring. I had a hard time keeping interested to finish it. The end was so anti-climatic. It was a great start and he should have expanded on the effects of his will with the deadbeat family and less time about the rainforest search for Rachel. Hopefully, his next book will get back to the brilliance of The Client, The Firm and the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"another gread read","review":"This book, like many others of Grisham's, is excellent. Like The Street Lawyer, there is heavy action in the first few pages that gets your attention. However, unlike the street lawyer, in The Testament the action continues strongly throughout the entire book. This book read extremely fast for me, and was very very interesting. If you enjoyed any other of Grisham's books, you'll love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good summer read","review":"This book was a good summer read, full of vivid descriptionsof the Pantanel and the people there, while addressing spiritualissues that often go ignored in fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham se ha vuelto autocomplaciente","review":"Grisham me gustaba, y no me resigno a dejar de pasar buenos ratos con sus libros. Espero que el pr��ximo suponga una vuelta a una estupenda historia que te deja sin aliento, como The Firm, o a un hermoso e inteligente alegato contra la pena de muerte (The chamber). The testament naufraga precisamente por sus buenas intenciones: Grisham quiere decir algo, pero no se atreve del todo, y no es porque no sepa hacerlo, seguro que no. Lo que ocurre es que los hechos que narra se comen la trama, es decir, no llegamos a saber exactamente qu�� quiere decirnos el autor. El final es excesivamente simple, y tal vez demasiado r��pido, como si Grisham ya se hubiera cansado de escribir la historia. Por otra parte, hay que decir, a su favor, que es una novela entretenida, en la que destaca sobre todas las cosas, incluso m��s que la belleza de los parajes brasile?os, la personalidad de Nate O'Riley, el protagonista."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read!!!!","review":"I loved this book from the very beginning. I'm a big fan of grisham, and this was definitely not a dissappointment. I can't see how anyone could not enjoy this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First John Grisham Experience","review":"This was my first John Grisham novel. Wow! I cannot believe what I have been missing! This novel hits home to me. We live in modern times and this book shows how greed for money can make you do some unbelievable things. I was hooked from the first page of the book. We can be so selfish as human beings and this novel shows many examples of that. It is unbelievable that some people put money before family or friends. I do not want to give away anything about this book. If you have not ever read a John Grisham novel, you will not be disappointed by choosing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Testament","review":"John Grisham's book The Testament is a fine novel. Its well defined characters and fast moving plot make it an instant favorite for anyone who enjoys reading. From the scheming ways of a lousy father to the selflessness of his missionary daughter this book is a great read. The settings change rapidly but with good cause and the multitude of circling lawyers changes direction in the blink of an eye making this book one to watch out for."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't stop reading","review":"what a fun book to read.

I almost cried when the book ended - I could read this one forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Testament Redeemed","review":"Testament is John Grisham's testament to the power of redemption and the strength of unselfish actions. The story is also an old fashioned adventure tale, as the hero travels into the wilds of South America. The old vices of avarice and greed of one group of heirs, along with their unethical attorneys, are sharply contrasted with the virtues of compassion and unselfishness of a missionary-doctor heir. Both are the potential heirs of an estate worth $11 billion and hence the title, the Testament, which refers to the last minute holographic will of a warped and wealthy testator. But in the end, there is also a deeply religious side to this story, as the protaganist arrives at a spiritual redemption for his life and frees himself from the pain and destruction of alcohol addiction.This is a great story and like all Grisham's novels, the characters are fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"The book kept my interest and it had excellent values. I would recommend that anyone who likes Grisham's books should read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-popper!","review":"Grisham always surprises his reader! His plot is unpredictable you find it difficult to put the book down! Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick to read -- but not worth the time","review":"You'll read this book in one night, and hate yourself in the morning. Grisham has, as usual, created a compelling plot line. But the characterization is too quick and stereotyped, even for the character we get to know best, Nate O'Riley. His conversion to Christianity is almost casual in Grisham's hands, handled in paragraph long cliches, and as a result unconvincing. The plot is predictable (and the text, at times, repetitive). Despite all this it will hold your interest; it's a fine beach read, if that's a compliment. But at the end you'll wonder what you might have done with the time you just spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly","review":"The Good:Good character development with regard to \\"Nate\\", the protagonist, who deals with his own demons while simultaneously having to trudge through the wilds of South America. The story moves quickly and keeps you reading and Grisham does a great job of describing the Pantanal region of South America and working it into the story.The Bad:There are too many poorly developed minor characters (exwives, kids, lawyers, etc.) to care about or keep track of and it tends to make things a little confusing.The Ugly:The book centers around an epic legal battle in the making that ultimately ends in a quick, uninteresting and unsatisfying whimper. I can think of 10 endings to this particular plot line that would have been better.Overall:This is the first Grisham book I've read and it's worth reading for the story, but don't expect a big climactic finish or you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining.","review":"I'm not a huge fan of court-room dramas and after reading Grisham's enjoyable THE FIRM years ago, I always assumed that the rest of his novels were more of the same. (In part because of the legal sounding titles.) TESTAMENT is more than that, however, and opened my eyes a bit. The story of a dying mogul and his greedy offspring was very entertaining and very suspenseful. I couldn't wait to see the reprehensible heirs get bamboozled with the will. The protagonist is a washed up alcoholic lawyer who must find the true-- and secret-- heir who is a missionary in South America. He finds a beautiful and self-less woman that forces him to confront his own self absorbed, tortured existance. Entertaining, humorous, and thought provoking. A good read with surprising depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent \\"adventure\\", but . . .","review":"While the book was well-written, and there are certainly some exciting sequences, the book never really arrives anywhere.Phelan's heirs don't come across so much \\"evil\\" as they do as victims of circumstances (a man who, rather than give his children care and love, just gave them $5 million each when they turn 21; he then took pleasure in seeing them waste it). Rather than making the children the villains, they become (not quite) innocent victims--robbing the book of much of the conflict one might expect.Moreover, the last 100 pages peter to a close, without any real sense of urgency or drama.I read--and enjoyed--\\"The Pelican Brief.\\" Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about \\"The Testament.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Redemption","review":"I found this to be a very profound story of redemtion. I really like how this story evolved. It was interesting how Troy and Nate were similar; except, Troy new how to save money and Nate didn't.

The characters were uninteresting, and the plot was boring and dull. He spent numerous pages on an unexciting portrait of an alcoholic, even more pages on unentertaining details about the Brazilian jungle, and I found myself skimming or skipping pages altogether.

I almost put the book down before I finished it. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment. Weak story and weak characters","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books. This one, in my opinion, is not of the same caliber as previous books. The characters are weak. There does not seem to be a clear direction for the story line. It is like the author has been \\"reborn\\" and this is an attempt to incorporate these beliefs into a best selling novel. I will certainly wait before purchasing his next novel until readers have shared their opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's worst in a long while!","review":"Forced myself to finish this weak effort from one of my (otherwise) favorite authors. You really have no sympathy or interest in an entirely one-dimensional group of characters. The main character who ventures into the wilds of Brazil is a pathetic waster who nevertheless braves a gratuitous set of calamities to stumble across the person he's seeking in a classic example of finding the needle in the haystack by sheer random walking. You just pray for a crocodile (gator? cayman?) to get him and get it over with. Grisham needs to stick with his knitting! Wait till the paperback, if at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did John Grisham really write this drivel?","review":"I really doubt that John Grisham wrote this. The plot is trivial and unconvincing, the sentence structure is monotonous, the characters are one dimensional and boring (I didn't care if any of them lived or died) and the style, with the little smart-arse comments, is very annoying. I also found that it trivialised the plight of the indigenous South Americans and their environment. It is one of the few books of its type I didn't finish on holiday because I couldn't be bothered wading through anymore to find out what happens. Think I can guess anyway! Maybe the fact that I'd just read Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy had something to do with my reaction. Now there's someone who can write!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise with no conclusion","review":"You know from reading other John Grisham novels that he knows a lot about Memphis. And after reading this that he must have vacationed and been impressed with Brazil. All well in good. He convinced me that Brazil is a lot more than a square on a map. But what the hell happened to the story. The book has a great and typcially terse worded exciting beginning. From there on it is all downhill. In fact practically nothing is tied together and answered in this disappointing novel. The premise is great but what happened to the rest of the story. Maybe this is the 1st part of a series of over-blowen short stories. Mr. Grisham can be forgiven this one because of the great entertainment he has provided over the past few years. But he might consider taking a little more time and thought on the next one..and maybe someday he will write the finish to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grisham's Best effort","review":"I usually like Grisham's books, but was disappointed with this one. He usually spins out a great tale of courtroom drama, with turns and twists in the cases along the way. That wasn't the case with this book. He spent too much time on safari and not enough time in the courtroom, where he is usually at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Grisham Book Yet!!!","review":"Testament is a trek with Nate O'Reilly, a lawyer who has been to the top and found nothing there. As Nate reaches the bottom, he finds himself on the adventure of his life in the Brazilian jungle. Through his adventures, Nate finds the true meaning of life, while other characters strive for the pinicle from where Nate reached the top and fell.I Loved this book! Grisham's readers (audio tapes) have always been of great caliber; however, the reader of the Testament surpasses them all. You must hear the unabridged version on audio tape for the full flavor. I haven't even finished hearing this book and I can't wait to talk about it.Testament is a departure from Grisham's other books and yet it shows how the author has matured in his writing. The characters are more defined, fuller and more human and realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his better efforts","review":"I am a huge fan but this book was definitely not one of his better efforts. I thought that there were too many characters and that he should have just picked a few of them and really focused in on them. I wanted to understand Rachel better and read more from her viewpoint and not just speculation of her feelings. The first few chapters were excellent but things went downhill from there. I only continued reading it because I wanted to give it the benefit of doubt and hope that it would get better. It didn't. The ending was very disappointing. I hope that the next book is more like his older ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st 75 pages are terrific..downhill from there..unsatisfying","review":"This book is a stunning disappointment from a terrific trial lawyer, whose previous books always held the reader's interest. The first 75 pages of this book are intriging and keep you on your toes, however the lenghty and totally unbelievable treks to Bolivia are verbose and I tended to skim. None of the characters, including the main character, Nate O'Riley, are interesting. Incidentally, the remaining characters, including all of the respective attorneys in this book (of which there are many)have no redeeming features. All of Grisham's previous books presented a character worht rooting for; not here.

This book was pathetic - and I loved A Time to Kill, The Firm, and especially The Pelican Brief. Grisham can do much better than this book. The characters have zero depth, and you don't get a chance to care about them - even the hero and heroine are pretty weak. Many good story lines within the book are never explored to their fullest extent. The jungle portions of the story went on forever, I thought this book would never end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Testament to a dying plot","review":"At time of writing, I'm the 610th reviewer of this book. SO , I wont be long in judging it. First 100 pages: 5 Stars, brilliant desciption of most members of the Phelan clan Cue to Brazil: 1 star, A sub tropical yawnathon Climax: 2 stars, so predictableWill I read ever read Grisham again ?

No enemies in pursuit, no stunning surprise. Yawn.Nate O'Riley was likeable and the descriptions of Brazil were colorful. This is good beach or airplane reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a waste (of time or money)","review":"Waited to buy the paperback after hearing bits and pieces of the hardcover version on Radio Reader. I agree with the reviewer on 12/13/99 who called it an \\"Exquisite Little Parable\\". Grisham is not as profound as Graham Greene, but he's more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Grisham's best","review":"Grisham stayed out of the courtroom for most of this book, and as usual, had a good main character that you could relate with and feel for. One of Grisham's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked it","review":"I really liked this Grisham even though it was not as suspenseful as some of the others(Pelican Brief is my fav). I liked the characters and hated some of them. I thought the story was interesting and real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put it on your booklist! It's Grisham's best yet!","review":"The Testament is a must read for all who enjoy great suspense and mystery. I have read all of Mr. Grisham's work and consider it to be his best and most compelling novel to date. I thought it would be difficult to be better than A Time To Kill, The Firm, and The Partner - but it is! His suspense filled character and plot development is set in a literary cadence that makes it impossible to put down. Everything that I have read since The Testament has been in wait for his next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of suspense, but conclusion predictable","review":"I have read all of John Grisham books and this one is the best! I like how he formed the characters put on the shelf and came back to them with substance and meaning. This is a book that I have recommended to several people.Comment:I am concerned that he doesn't make mention of African American Attorney's in his books(One charater in Street Law). True this may be a reflection of the American Legal field, but this is fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my favorite authors, John Grisham, strikes out.","review":"John Grisham, one of my favorite authors, has struck out with this one. I really had to force myself to keep reading until the end. I hated being mired down in the dreary effort the main character went through to attempt to meet his ultimate goal.A few months later I read \\"The Codicil\\" by Tom Torpor written in 1993, which is a superior book in every way. I would give it 10 stars! Same premise as \\"The Testament\\" but much better done.I will, of course, read Grisham's next book. Maybe he just needed to take a breath and build up some steam."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prodigal Son, or maybe a lost sheep","review":"Like many others have stated, I enjoyed the plot of a fallen and lost man coming to find Christ. However, Grisham has got to work on his endings. I've read five of his books now, and the last three (The Partner, The Street Lawyer and The Testament) have just had the most ridiculous and unsatisfying endings. They are so inconsistent with reality, not to mention many of the people in his books remove themselves from character in the last 20 or so pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be surprised by how much you enjoy this book","review":"I began The Testament at 11:30 PM on Wednesday night thinking that I would read myself to sleep. At 5:30 AM I finally had to put the book down and napped for a few hours before class. After class on Thursday morning I dashed home and finished the book. I have also read The Pelican Brief, A Time to Kill, The Street Lawyer, and The Firm. In my opinion The Testament is better than all of those books except perhaps The Firm, which was also really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yucky!","review":"I haven't read Grisham's books for a few years, so I was probably 12 or 13 when I read the likes of \\"The Firm.\\" I loved his books back then, but I found this to be generally a boring book. It's written for a reader with below-average intelligence or reading skills, the characters (mostly the heirs) are flat and boring, it's WAY too long. Besides some interesting parts (like in Brazil), it's generally just not that good. If I'm reading a book I really like, I'll finish it in a few days. But this book took me almost a month, not because it's hard, but because it almost felt like a chore. I wanted to finish it, but I didn't really want to sit down and plow through it, after about the third day. Don't waste your time. And that Publisher's Weekly review is dead wrong. If he's following in the footsteps of Dickens, the world is a sad place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaw","review":"How could a dead man write? John (Mr. Grisham), your first two chapters of the old billionair's autobiograhy has a flaw. When did he write this? I assume he must have written it after his death then because he wrote his last sentence \\"Without looking below, I lunge over the rail.\\" from a 14th floor. And he was obviously dead. And so, how could a dead man write? John, you must check with your editor on this. It seems no else on the Amazon review list so far notice it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsess Much?","review":"John Grisham has written a novel with almost no sympathetic characters. There's a huge amount of money to be divided up by an eccentric billionaire...all of his relatives are greedy, almost worthless human beings. Nate, the guy sent to find one last heir, is a recovering alcoholic/drug addict...I personally didn't care who got the money, but John Grisham really seems to be obsessed with large amounts of money. Grisham's books are typically page turners, but this one was a tough one to plow through."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks @$$","review":"This book is very disappointing. It has NO climax. I don't know how an author can write a book with no climax, but I guess J.G. thought he could. I just wasted my time and money on this book and it really pisses me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin plot, thin character development","review":"I normally find his books, if not particularly good writing at least entertaining. I found this piece to be particularly thin with the plot structure and the character development. I had to work hard to complete the reading of this novel. I did not know enough about the major characters and therefore did not develop any interest what happened to them. I also found all the characters to be very one-sided, either very good or very bad and that to me is not good writing. What captivates my interests are characters who a little of both, because that is what makes them complex, and that is what makes them interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters and not a good story line","review":"I was very disappointed in this latest novel by Grisham. It just dragged on and you got to the point where you didn't even care who got the money. Although there were many characters he never really built any of them up, you only got bits and pieces of each person. It was a waste of time to read. If you are new to Grisham try his earlier books, The Client, Time to Kill, The Firm, The Pelican Brief because that is when he was at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Wait to Put It Down","review":"Three quarters of the way through Grisham's latest, I could not wait to be finished with it. The plot was totally predictable. Unlike his previos novels where unforgetable characters take the reader throught a plot full of surprises, this novel takes the reader along a path of how a drunk lawyer who has nothing left but the promise of yet another drunken crisis, finds God. After reading three fourths of the book, frustrated, I scanned the remainder.....and, indeed, it was as predictable as I had imagined. Not even a good surprise ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE FIRST 100 PAGES","review":"THE OPENING WAS A GOOD IDEA FOR A STORY. I WAS VERY INTERESTED.

NOT UP TO PAR FOR THIS WRITTER."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Testament","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read! It is a very slow read with characters I could not come to like and/or care about. I usually enjoy John Grisham novels, so I kept reading in hopes of a twist, a burst of action, an interesting character...anything to turn around the reading experience....but it continued to be a bore the entire way through. I believe Mr. Grisham put some words to paper just so he could write-off a trip to Brazil, a major setting in the book. I only gave one star because the system forced me to select at least one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"BORING\\"","review":"This is my seventh Grisham book and by far the most boring book I have read in a long time. So slow that I have decided to quite reading and I am almost finished. (I have never done that before) I am bewildered to all the 5 star ratings it has recieved. The Partner was a 5 star book. The Street Lawyer was a 5 star book. This is boring, slow and I did not enjoy this book. Sorry John."},{"rating":"1","title":"so uninterested","review":"What a sad bunch of characters and if you don't like them there is no novel, no plot to speak of.

I loved his first three books. I had my doubts about The Client and was really disappointed with The Chamber. It never really got better after that. Good beginnings of the books, but the endings have been a real anti climax ever since The Chamber. The Testament is better than the previous two or three books of which I do not even remember the titles. I guess it isn't a coincidence that his books haven't been made into movies after the first four books. Or were the movies even worse than the book. I do not think I will buy the bretheren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very marginal effort","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I think John Grisham has reached a point in his career (like Steven King) where he realizes that he can sell books without really putting a lot of effort into them. This book like Steven King's Bag of Bones could have used a lot of editing to cut out the \\"filler.\\" The problem with that is if the editor had cut out what really wasn't really an integral part of the book, there would probably ahve been less than a 150 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was a great and interesting read.","review":"I really did enjoy The Testament and I will have to go out and read his other books. I would love to see this movie on screen. I loved the characters and how they lived their lives. The Phelen children really did fascinate me with their greed and avarice lifestyles and not to mention how they just couldn't believe what the father did to them. Nate, the lawyer was an interesting character as well as Rachel Lane. I loved this book and will be the first in the theater when it hits the screen. Sigourney Weaver would make a great Rachel ."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"This was the most boring book written by John Girsham that I have ever read and I have read all of his books. I skipped most of the pages wehre character Nate was in the jungle. I could have done without all of that description. I hated the ending. Without giving the ending away, I thought the settlement was unfair.I have read everyone of John Girsham's books and was inspired to complete law school. I was disappointed to read The Testament. It was nothing like the rest of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"i have read all of grishams books and i think this might be my least favorite...it is certainly not the action adventure that the pelican brief and the firm, and i acknowledge that you don;t necessarly want to keep reading the same formula kind of book, but this one seemed to drag on and did not have much interest...even a time to kill which was not the typcial action adventure, seemd to hold my interest more than this one...it seems to me that this is a contrived story about an idea of soemthing and will not be carried in my thoughts for a while like his others...i guess it was good enough for me to read, and finish, however..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"This will probably be the last Grisham book I will ever read. I do not appreciate an author proselytizing to me about the Christian religion in a legal thriller. After the first chapter I had to force myself to read the tedious plot. Evelyn Wood method comes in handy. Ugh"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable Sop to Fundamentalist Christians.","review":"Even though, it's not great writing, the plots are usually interesting and entertaining. But this was an astonishingly, embarassingly transparent effort to sell books to logic-impaired Christians. I'm sure it will sell books, but Grisham should be ashamed of himself. YUCK."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Testament","review":"The Testament starts out very well, with an excellent idea: an old man, disgruntled with his children, makes a will giving his 11 billion to a illegitimate child who lives in the jungle. The lawyers for the children of the recently deceased all fight to get money out of the will. Meanwhile, Nate O'Riley goes into the jungle of South America. Unfortunately, I like the law more than I like escapades into the jungle. It just took too long in the middle of the book to keep me interested in the law part. I grade books by how long it takes me to read them and be interested: this one took me 5 days. Every other grisham i have read took me 1. I think this is his worst novel, but he made a strong comeback with The Brethren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"Very dissapointing. The book is nothing like the book jacket predicted. No conflict, unlikable characters, I just keep thinking it could have been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start and Finish, the center is a little stretched.","review":"This book started off like no other. There was so much twisting in the first 2 chapters I was thinking \\"if this is the start, what will the rest of the book bring?\\" I was hoping for a lot more. I was dissapointed as some of the really predictable stuff was described as only Charles Dickens could have done. I am not sure how I managed through it. The book ends with a smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anticipation!!!","review":"John Grisham continues to write books that not only inform you of the law, but he makes it interesting.I had just lost my father when this book was released. So it was funny, reliving some of the same emotions shared by the characters in this story. You never know why the dead leaves things has they do, but there is always a good story behind them. That can only be told from the grave. I love this book, find out where the inheritance was hide, who took it, and who got it in the end. Try to figure out, where it all came from. Why it was never utilize? Questions that can only be answered when you read the book! Buy it you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but left questions?","review":"The first part of the book was very exciting and made you want to read more but then things got a little confusing. Like the fact that there was nothing wrong with the man and no-one ever found that out wouldn't that have had something to do with the will? I could be wrong but also the fact that it was a stated point in the book to make sure the autopsy report was made and was then never even brought up? The ending was a little disappointing also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh Look at Grisham's works!","review":"I'm just a teacher, not a literary critic; however, I've read all of Grisham's books and I find this one enlightening. His characters were hilarious and I know some rich heirs that act just like he stated. I also have a tremendous amount of faith in God and when Rachel Lane teaches Nate to pray - chills overcame me. I do believe that people who have been through rehab four times can change. Once again the ending was very unexpected like The Partner, which is one of my favorites. I hope you liked this one as much as I did. I thought Josh Stafford was a great, trusting friend. I hope I am that lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham's 2nd Best","review":"The Testament is just behind The Runaway Jury. Though some would argue The Rainmaker is good as well, but I don't like its ending with an unexpected murder. What I guess is for the past couple of years Grisham has been trying hard to change his stories. No longer it's dominated by a courtroom, but the chain of events are leading the readers to a broader concern instead, from social security as described in The Street Lawyer to missonary work and a common chaplain so often neglected by his congregation as found in the Testament. It's a nice attempt. After all who will be in a better position than Grisham to try out something new in a courtroom novel. Another change in his books is that he now puts in obvious efforts to begin the story with a bang, a move perhaps to prepare for a stunning movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Predictable!","review":"Neat opening and a concept he could have done wonders with! But alas after the first 50 pages, the book just loses all its substance. It then becomes an extremely predictable narrative of what's already on the back cover. More like reading a bloated version of a newspaper article! You really don't miss anything if you skip through the 200 odd pages in the Brazilian forest. Certainly *not* the riveting page turner, some reviewers claim it to be. Way below Grisham's caliber. In fact, its not even in his class!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm","review":"For me, John Grisham runs hot or cold. Testament is \\"Lukewarm\\". I did not find the behavior or character of the \\"heirs\\" to be believeable. A disappointment after \\"The Street Lawyer\\" which I loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost interest quickly...","review":"John, what have you done? This book started off great with an awesome plot. But after about 75 pages I couldn't take it anymore and stopped reading. This is my 3rd Grisham novel, and it is NOT a good representation of his other works. I have also read The Street Lawyer and The Client. Those two were 150% better than what I read of the Testament."},{"rating":"2","title":"The View of an Upcoming Lawyer","review":"John Grisham really out did himself when he wrote this novel. The book really gave me a look at how hectic and unpredictiable life in the law field really can be. This novel was actually recommended to me by a friend, and let me tell you that once I started reading, I could not set the book down. It's truly a work of art that grabs your attention in the first few chapters. John Grisham's style of writing is truly absorbing, and believe I that at least 92% of the people who have read this book will agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"The TestamentThe book,The Testament. Is good book it gives what the reader wants to here it has stuff from the jungle to the courtroom and a good all around story.

He must sign the will and be proved that he is in the right mind and not insane.

Nate O'Riley makes the story accessible and light. (You can connect with this character easily.) You also learn a little about probate law. John Grisham's writing style is consistenly pleasant in The Testament."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, fun, and a little religious.....","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. As advertised, the first 50 pages were interesting and exciting. I kind of browsed over much of the Brazilian wetland descriptions. I did not need that. But, I burst out in laughter where I was not expecting to. The missionary was one of the more beautiful people I have met in print. I would have hoped for a different ending......like her walking into the final will courtroom battle and her confronting her half brothers and sisters....or even marrying Nate. Overall, thoroughly found the book to be entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"This is a excellent book filled with action and a gripping story-line. I reccomend this book it is one that you can't put down and don't want to put down. A wealthy old man leaves his fortune to an heir that has no need for it.

I want Mr. Grisham to entertain me, not to instruct me. This novel is spoiled by an alcoholic lawyer who meets a missionary, then travels the long, long road to god and redemption on the reader's dime. If I want inspiration, I will seek it out. The book did not give me the wonderful reading experience that the first three did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good writer--a mediocre book","review":"John Grisham has written some terrific books. This is not one of them. The plot fizzles and the characters do not have the complexity of those in his better novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ending with implication","review":"This is the first novel I read from the author. English is not my native language, but I could feel author's satirical sense to many things people honored in this world. The author picks up a top hot topic in secular world: money; a top professional in our society: lawyer. They secure at least a success for a genre fiction. Most readers than also expect a satisfactory ending: justice is totally done or a sort of \\"happy family\\" ending. But author goes beyond the routine. Its \\"surprising ending\\" implies author's deeper thinking in a popular work: for good (the majority goes to charity) and for bad ( those greedy children and lawyers got their money ), money should and could be not a ultimate issue. The important thing is the peace of mind (in the case of what Nate realized here is his moving by God and a higher kind of life). I think this as more valuable aspect than a stereotype ending. Certainly, it adds the credits to the author in his seriousness and sincerity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Testament","review":"Did not care for this book at all. Plot was slow, not interesting, put book down, never did finish reading it, skipped to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressive","review":"This is a simple story. It has his usual rapacious lawyers, the alcoholic hero, and a fight over a will. The characters are one dimensional, the story line lacks any tension to make it interesting. He adds a nice travelog, which could be found in any travel magazine. This is not impressive writing, nor is it veryinteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again and again, Mr. Grisham does it","review":"There is always something very special about opening a new book by John Grisham. He has this \\"magic touch\\" to dig out subjects to a legal thriller nobody can imagine. The Testament is a great example. A crazy old man, greedy relatives, a drunk burntout lawyer and 11 Billion USD, this book has it all. Ok, it seems like Im writing for the publisher, b.c. the plot seems a little thin at the beginning, BUT...Grisham is the master of storytelling, and he makes even a dullest matter interesting, simply by putting his pen on the paper. This is certanly a must read for all thriller fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Testament","review":"I have always enjoyed reading or listening to John Grisham's books. I was excited when I found this one which involves two totally different worlds: the world of money, greed, success and failure and the world of love of God, caring for others, and concern for the lost. These worlds clash when an eccentric father bestows his wealth on his only known daughter born out of wed lock. The drama unfolds between two extremely different worlds: both jungles. But, in the midst of a heavy battle for money, truth wins out in a strange sort of way, lives are changed forever, and life is better because of it. I recommend this book for anyone searching for meaning in life. Though the storyline is fiction and excellent reading, the way life happens makes it all the more exciting. Good job, Mr. Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"God and Lawyers don't often mix - Grisham hits a home run!","review":"Few books touch me as this one has. I have read earlier Grisham novels with generally mixed results. I was reluctant to read this book based on that history but had read glowing reviews and the plot description intrigued me. The juxtoposition of the fast-paced style of the lawyers with the simple life of the missionary cannot be overstated particularly in our secular society. Regardless of your personal views, this book should make you think and reason...to me that is an excellent recommendation for a book...Now I may go back to some of those Grisham books that I have passed up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christians Understand","review":"After reading several of Grisham's books, I was pleased to read this new book that unfolds the spiritual side of the master author. I will assume that this will be one book that probably most fans will not enjoy nor understand. Until someone has experienced the Grace that Jesus Christ has to offer will they comprehend the religious concepts in this book: Money doesn't matter. Callings on Lives. Purity and Happiness. Eternal Value of Life and Works. Faith in Jesus. Grisham has created a classic that will appeal to those who have met Christ as their personal saviour. Still, I recommend this book for Christians and Non-Christians alike. It is well written, and although it drags in some places, overall, it's a winner. A life transformed by Jesus is not a flaw in character development. It is a true reality that millions know about. Life with Christ is an endless hope. Life without Christ is a hopeless end..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflections of Hitsville USA","review":"This was the latest book that I have read and I must admit, it was the best account of the infamous Motown Records.

I have used both brand new and used Jar Lids with the sealer and generally have had great success. The hose with adapters came with my seal a meal and the trick is make sure your lid is clean and unbent and that your jar has nothing on the edge. Then after sealing, remove the hose 1st, otherwise you'll lose your seal. I have had to try more than one time to get a seal with both the wide mouth and regular jar sealer, but they generally work very well and I'm filling my pantry with dry and dehydrated goods. I've also used to extend the life of my extra, commercially canned Rotel tomatoes and diced tomatoes.

It is build well and easily hooks up with a vaccum devise. I would advise using a electric pump and not the hand pump unless you want carpel tunnel. Flour, rice, pasta and salty snacks could all be stored using this devise. It is made out of plastic and doesn't have any moving parts that could break. Just put your idems in the jar, place the lid with a seal and apply the jar sealer over top the lid.

The device is used with the standard canning lids and is then removed so you only need one of these products. The jars are cheap enough that we do not limit vacuum sealing to long term food storage but use it for coffee and cereal as well.We found that our dried food would sometimes puncture the plastic material of the bags when sealing, which is not an issue with the jars. I have bent a couple of the lids when I put the sealer attachment on the jar, so a bit of care is helpful, but it is really easy to use and very versatile."},{"rating":"2","title":"vacuum jar sealer","review":"works excellent.If you take care when opening jar, lid can be revacuum-sealed many times.

I can't say enough good things about this. buy it, u will save so much money with it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just like it should","review":"Not a lot to say, it works exactly like it should. Nothing complicated, put it over the jar/cap and put your hand held pump over the hole. It does a nice job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I have seen the complaints that the sealer pulls off the lid when you remove it. The only thing I can figure is that the people are not using it correctly:When you seal a jar, you hook up the hose, activate your accessory port on your vacuum sealing unit, and let it run it's cycle. Once it finishes pulling a vacuum, you have to disconnect the tube so that air will enter above the lid and seal it to the jar. You have to do that BEFORE you try to pull the sealer off of the jar.Just like in canning, it is very important to make sure that you have a clean lip on the jar, and the lid seal is clean. If either of those have debris on them, the lid will not seal.I have sealed several cases of quart sized jars, and not one has failed to seal on the first try, every try.I would deduct a half a star if I could, as the seal ring in the cap has a bad habit of coming out when you pull the sealer off of a jar, but that is a minor annoyance.Overall, this is a wonderful product that I am happy to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little device!","review":"I purchased this and also the one for narrow mouth jars to use with my FoodSaver.

You know all those empty canning jars you store between growing season. Well ,now you can put them to use and without a pressure cooker."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has been a great investment","review":"I highly recommend using the wide-mouth jar sealer verses the regular. It seals the lids every time. I have found with the regular mouth jar sealer you need to heat the lids (for the first time use) in order for them to seal. Which adds to your time. I use them with the half gallon mason jars mostly. Great way to store ingredients that you only use once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little fiddly but gets the job done","review":"I've used this a couple of times now. It seems to work fine, but it doesn't like just any lid. I re-use old lids for storage (but not for canning) all the time. I could usually tell which one of my recycled lids wouldn't work. They were the ones with visible blemishes to the gasket or were somehow dented around the rim. It did take me a couple of tries with some of the good lids though. All in all, I like this device. Just be patient with it. Sure beats using disposable plastic bags all the time for storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hose included?","review":"Does this wide mouth jar sealer come with the hose, as shown in the photo?*UPDATE: I purchased this directly from Foodsaver and it did come with the hose. After using it for 3 months, I love it. I've purchased cases of the wide mouth jars for storing spices, coffee, nuts, leftovers for freezing, etc.The amount of vacuum created by a Foodsaver is about 90% of what one can manage with an inexpensive manual vacuum pump (I've tested it with a gauge), which probably doesn't make much of a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing device.","review":"I was thrilled to find this item by chance.

The production is off-beat and tongue-in-cheek, with the inimitable Carol Channing taking the part of the cat and Eddie Bracken as the writer. With often jazzy music to set the mood this CD relates the nostalgic love affair between Archie the Cockroach and Mehitabel the Cat. I first came to know Archie and Mehitable on a Columbia LP in the late 1950s or early 1960s. As soon as I learned it had been released on CD, I knew that I had to have a copy -- right away.

If it's a mystery you're looking for, you figure out what's up around page 50, although I admit to not having a sick enough mind to figure out the relationship amongst the hero, heroine and the \\"father\\".The author turns philosophy and religion into trite, pompous pronouncements; she stands history on its head and has her characters racing around England as if they owned their own personal bullet train. The characters don't eat, don't sleep, and are about as angsty as any I've met since \\"The Breakfast Club.\\" And the first review above is correct: the writing is clunky.As with a couple of other reviewers, I gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly unrealistic","review":"I actually purchased all 3 books in this trilogy BEFORE reading the first one. Being an avid horse lover & owner of an ex-racehorse, I was excited to get them. However, the store is completely unrealistic and obviously written by someone who truely knows nothing about horses or racing. Continuously repetitive and boringly \\"perfect\\" characters who always win and don't seem to have much for negatives in their lives. The negatives they do face they use their outragous fortunes to buy out of. I never can seem to put a book down though, always hoping it will get better, but this one didn't. I eventually went to just skimming the pages, since it's all repetitive anyhow. I'm working on finishing the final book in the series (which isn't any better) and then I doubt I'll look to this author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I normally do not read this type of story.

His list of characters is long, but interesting, and very well interwoven as he brings them together and details their inter-relationships.Starting with the murder of Richie Walters and his cheerleader girlfriend Elaine Murray, who have just agreed to go steady, the plot developes into a multitude of experiences from Esther Peglosi's key witness role, to her seduction by a police officer, to her hypnotic episode, to a lawyers eye opening revelation, all of which lead to a totally acceptable story-tell ending with the deathbed confession of the true murderer. Cleverly written, fast moving, entirely believable, and well worth the time spent in reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page-Turner","review":"i have read everyone of Philip Margolin's books and Heartstone was the first one that i read. this book is a MUST-READ.

Indeed, I am wondering what the fuss is about this author -- but I'll give him another try -- someday.So what's wrong (or right) about this book? Basically, I realized about half way into the book that I really didn't like any of the the characters. Part of the problem is that there are way too many characters so there's no chance to develop a sympathetic protagonist (or even a crook). The book also bounces around between all of these people and lacks any sense of flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can't all be great","review":"In a fast trip through previous Margolin books, Hearstone was the first one that I found lacking. The characters were not as well developed as they are in other Margolin books and the plot took too long to get anywhere. If this is your first one, keep reading. Gone But Not Forgotten and The Last Innocent Man were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this one","review":"This one was difficult to get through, although it was a good plot and I've enjoyed others of his books. But there were just too many disconnected characters introduced early in the book and not resolved until much later. A hundred pages into the book, I was so confused that I had to go back and re-read from the beginning to keep track of all of the characters. At no point did this book really grip me in a can't-put-it-down way, and the hypnosis sessions dragged on forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT !!!","review":"This was the first book that I've read by Phillip Margolin.

Best book I have ever read that was written by a male author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed!!","review":"The first book I read by Mr. Margolin was Gone but Not Forgotten. Perhaps that was my mistake. Gone... was a fabulous book. I would rank it with my top 10 favorite books. (I will write a review for it as well to be fair.) I couldn't wait to read another book by this author. I made the grievous error of picking up Heartstone. I would rank it with my top 10 least favorite books of all time. Now, I'm afraid to pick up another of his books. I want the thrill of Gone... but if I wanted to be put to sleep by a book I would read a nursery rhyme. Little Red Riding Hood had more suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that great...","review":"The book itself sounded interesting, but after I've started reading it, things started to get confusing. Too many characters appeared all at once, and half-way the book I couldn't understand what was going on at all.

I don't care how much sex you put into a novel; the only thing it does is drag an already laborious and tiring plot out and thicken the binding.

Think again. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Abridgement...","review":"The soundtrack was IMHO really the only appealing thing about this. Marc is an excellent interpretationist, however, Random House gave him little to really work with regarding this abridgment. For instance they cut the entire scene with Jacen and Ben in the munitions tower in the opening. They cut some of the dialog between Han and Leia prior to the entry of the family and friends. Basically they were opting for the action and drama and left the light moments by the wayside. As well as some critical plot points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well that was depressing.","review":"WHOA THERE. UH UM.. OK. Stutter, Gulp & Yuk. The only thoughts I have about this book would be massive spoilers. If you loved Star By Star you'll love this. In Dark Empire, Leia saved Luke from the dark side, so it can happen. But I fear history may repeat itself and balance is about to be restored.. again. This is not why I read Star Wars novels.Quoting Robert Mc Adams - It is rather depressing how the Star Wars universe is being portrayed right now, and frankly, if this series continues on the arc it is going -- it will have killed the universe I have loved to read about for so long -- leaving me with no reason to continue reading about it.Hope or Hopeless - We will have to see where they take this story arc.

Is he afraid of her?). Craig Seligman is an excellent writer, but only a so-so critic. He draws the reader in with his enthusiasm for his subjects, but leaves the reader dangling...

Following up the awful remix album, \\"Nu-Mixx Klassics\\", they couldn't do much worse but that doesn't really say much. This live album is supposed to be from Pac's performance at the House Of Blues but anyone expecting to hear Pac's infamous declaration of war against Biggie from that performance should know that it hasn't been included. Also, the opening track is actually a medley from his perfomance on Saturday Night Live in 1995. One of the tracks is falsely advertised as \\"Heartz Of Men\\" when it is actually just a seven-second interlude. All of this might not have mattered if \\"Live\\" were a quality attempt to bring a live Pac concert to our speakers but in the end, the audio quality is just slightly better than a bad bootleg recording. Clocking in at under 45 minutes, \\"2Pac Live\\" may leave most Pac fans feeling a bit short-changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO @#*$% SHORT,DAWG!!!","review":"1st things 1st, I have to agree with some o' the other critics on this one. There is NO remastering, there are joints on here as short as 7 seconds long, and to add my own 2 Redd cents...this album doesn't feature 'Pac's GREATEST live performances(many of the joints are incomplete and unrehearsed). On top o' that, the album's only about 40 min's long,mayne. GIMME A BREAK!!! When I 1st got word of this release, I was expecting it to be Pac's greatest hits-LIVE, featuring some of his tighter, more memorable live performances of Dear Mama, I Get Around, etc...but instead, we have snippets of All Eyez On Me, 7th Day Theory:Killuminati, and Tattoo Tears from 'Pac & Outlawz. However, the album does capture the energy in Pac's live shows and the life in his character...but let's face it, this is yet another example of how desperate Tha Row is to get a quick buck. 2Pac,R.I.P."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootleg Garbage","review":"Do not buy this album. It is trash. If you want a 2pac live album buy Live at the House of Blues. Both albums are from the same concert, however this one (suge knight/deathrow's version) is horrible, and i mean horrible, quality. It is an audience recorded bootleg. Meaning someone was in the audience with a tape recorder and recorded the concert, and deathrow put it on a cd and tried to sell it as a live album. Live at H.O.B. however is the same concert, except much, much better quality. The recordings actually came from the front of house mixboard for that album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD sucked","review":"This is sabotage rather than a tribute to Tupac. This doesn't do him justice. Listening to this CD, I thought of \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" - the part where they have the miniature version of stonehenge, and everyone is looking around thinking \\"what the hell is going on?\\" That must have been how Tupac felt at this show. The part of the CD where you can actually hear someone flipping through \\"all eyez on me\\" trying to find the right song...that was when I knew this CD was crap. Tupac put great pride into the quality and sound of his work. This is an abomination. Well, what more can you say? Death Row needed a little extra holiday bling, I guess....My recommendation - don't buy it. You might as well just listen to All Eyez on Me and sing along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound","review":"2pac's production perfection is one of the many attributes which helped establish his sound and respect. He surely wouldn't have approved of this novice sounding recording. It is impossible to judge the concert from a crowds perspective,purely because of the rubbish recording. Was 2pac on fire? who knows. The backing vocals and beats are higher on the mix than 2pac himself. He sounds like he's in the bathroom backstage. Deathrow had to be aware of the poor recording and still decided to release. Why?. For the money?. Even so why not release something more professional, it must exist. This is a amateur sounding release expected from a crowd recorded bootleg. Unless you are a hardcore 2pac fan looking for some kind of artifact rather than a pleasurable listening experience, hold on to your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy","review":"i thought to myself as i listened..\\"suge knight should get knocked out for selling this horrible audio quality cd\\". ha, i got my wish. this is a terrible reprsentation of pac live. dont waste a cent"},{"rating":"2","title":"short, but worth the money","review":"If you're a 2Pac fan, you definitely need this CD. If you're not a huge fan, stick with the stuff he recorded in the studio. My only complaints are that the CD is short (13 tracks and most only have 2Pac's verse) and the sound quality isn't great in some parts. That isn't a fault with the CD, but a fault with the sound system when he performed these songs. There are a few spots where the mic sqeaks.It's cool to hear Pac live though. He's just as good as he is in the studio. That's not surprising though, because I heard he rarely did more than one take when recording a song. Also cool are the few songs that were unreleased at the time of this show (troublesome, tattoo tears, and never call you [...] again).This CD is worth the money, but I'll be disappointed if this is his only live performance that was recorded. I hope there's more out there...maybe even some video for a concert DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, only for Tupac completists","review":"I don't really know what this live album is supposed to accomplish, but I believe it has failed on all accounts.

From the first dark chords bursting into Saga it gets you hooked. Then it becomes a vast and very solid sound of heavy and technical guitar sounds. Grody's vocals are grinding and harsh, but still catch emotion and melody, screaming and sometimes softly talking his poetic lyrics into the songs.A true sign of Will Havens progression is Fines Our which is to me the hidden gem of the album. The calm build up and distant sounds just pull you in as the song bursts into conclusion.Now the downside. It can get a bit repetitive at times. The riffs are excellent, but sometimes go on for just a bit too long. There's a couple of tracks which lack an individual sound. It is distinctive Will Haven, but it's not a distinctive track.Besides that, this is an excellent album which actually makes me look out to the next one even more. I'm sure that will take some time, but these guys are only getting better. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"This book is very limited.

I guess it all depends on what you look for in a science fiction book. It left me cold. Barton's writing style was too terse and austere for me - often starting a paragraph with a sentence fragment, and blowing through scenes with too little detail (unless there is anything sexual in it, which he never fails to mention). There was too much of the weird and surreal for my tastes, and I felt too emotionally distanced from the characters, especially the protagonist, to care much what happens to them. There were a lot of good ideas in here, but not all of them work well together and the presentation left a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took it scuba diving","review":"I buy the swim goggles and love them. I was surprised when I found they made a free diving mask. I tried it free diving and it is the best mask ever. Low volume and wide field of view, No pulling on the face from the air. I have never found distortion in in the swim goggles or the full face mask. I tried the mask on a 25 foot scuba dive and it worked great! Not sure if I want to take it deeper without a backup. I just love the field of view and low volume. Maybe they will start making it with tempered glass?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I use this mask for scuba, against the recommendations. It is so comfortable I don't know I have it on. Clarity is excellent as is field of vision. No it is not very stout and you have to hang on to your snorkel when you jump in from the boat as the strap is minimal (I had to chase my snorkel the first time I used it when it fell off and headed for the bottom). As for scratching the lenses, for the low cost and great comfort, if it gets that bad I'll throw it away and buy another. Store it in the case it comes with (which is way too big and takes up a lot of room in your dive bag) and scratching shouldn't be a problem. I have had at least six different quality and expensive masks and I like this one the best hands down. I didn't buy this on Amazon. The last $100 poorly fitting mask I bought online and paid the price of not fitting it in a shop before I made my purchase, not Amazons fault but try before you buy, you may save yourself a bundle."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I use","review":"Great low volume mask. Right price. No need for overpriced freedive gear, just get the basics. Great fit. I treat it rough and no problems.

I have a narrower face so Short of buying kids masks I have a hard time finding a good mask to wear for scuba that won't leak to some degree. This mask is perfect, never leaks, doesn't fog and the low profile of it give me an amazing range of view. If it didn't keep me from breathing through my nose I might forget I was wearing it.It is a little flimsier than scuba masks normally are (since it is designed for free diving) but so far I haven't had any issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for freediving!","review":"Excellent view, very small, reduced air space, perfect for freediving or spearfishing!

Cassady is a born storyteller, as is evidenced by his energetic and exciting letters; however, it becomes evident that he is not a born writer, and as exciting as his letters are, they say quite little. Regardless, it is obvious how Cassady became a new archetype of American modern literature, and fans of the Beats would be remiss not to check out this wee tome. Note that after his imprisonment for distributing \\"tea\\" the volume drops off considerably. Was it prison, life or LSD that lessened the latent genius' writing? We'll never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Muse","review":"The first thing that surprised me about these letters was how fine Cassady's vocabulary was; and how well-read he was. The letters really show why he was such a profound influence on Kerouac and Ginsberg. Also, these letters weren't written to be published, so they are unforced and natural. How about that sexual exploit on page 77? My goodness! Can we, in the year 2006, forgive Neil's use of the \\"N\\" word in the year 1948...in much the same way as Mark Twain's use of that word? I guess that's up to each reader to decide. Anyway, I find this book to be a superlative example of a modern muse in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bradley Smith's own \\"book\\"","review":"Bradley Smith revieved this book and didn't remember that his own\\"book\\" about progressive rock is just stupid collection of reviews of prog records and videos.In the matter of fact most of the records in his \\"book\\" are not progressive rock and almost every record is better than the previous one and vice versa. He doesn't seem to have the slightest idea of for example italian/french/scandinavian (and so on) progressive rock genre from early 70's. I liked K.Holm-Hudson's book just because the writers are professionals and not bad reviewers like B.Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book Stinks","review":"If you want to read one of the most pretentious books on progressive rock whereby the writers try to sound smart discussing a wide range of social philosophers completely out of context then this book is for you. I would recommend not wasting your hard earned mony and picking up a classic like Armando Gallo's I Know What I Like or Sid Smith's Court of the King Crimson. Both amazingly enjoyable and unpretentious reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Cover","review":"I thought this book would be mainly drawings similar to the cover, individual drawings that could be reproduced. They are not. MANY of the pages are china designs (patterns around the edges of teapots, plates, etc). The drawings are not reproduced flat, making them difficult to use. In some cases, I felt the drawings were a little dark as well. I was thinking they would be a little more like a coloring book style - outlines or solids so that the pattern is clear(much like the objects on the cover), but that's rarely the case. Some of the drawings are quite nice, but I would check this book out in person before purchase to ensure it is what you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"great recipes","review":"Some great recipe ideas in here.

Suddenly her \\"comfortable\\" life blows up in her face, and she is whisked away with what is left of her family to save herself and mankind. An always, Iris Johansen captivates her reader. There is a mix of science fiction and suspense. The novel is, as tami Hoag puts best,+AH4-+AH4- \\"Intense, hold-your-breath suspense.\\"Suspense+AH4-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Waste of Time","review":"This is the first book by Johansen that I've read, and it will be the last. This has a disappointingly ridiculous plot, with characters that are extremely annoying. They are forever doing the least prudent thing in any situation. A killer is after them, but they go about exposing themselves to danger at every turn. The main female is a nasty tempered nag. That two men would find her attractive is baffling. I wanted to stop reading half way through, but I hate giving up on a book. I finished it and am glad it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like all the rest","review":"I thought this book was ok. They all seem to be the same though. The author never really does anything new, it is almost like you are reading the same book over and over with different characters. I would recommend reading \\"The Ugly Ducking\\" and then moving on to another author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"The book had some exciting moments...but it was way too complicated for me. The characters seemed two-dimensional, and the plot kept jumping around. I think the book would have been a lot better, and certainly more suspenceful, if it had stuck with just two alternating viewpoints, Kate Denby's and Ishmaru's, who is the madman assigned to kill her. Ishmaru was a very interesting villian...he would have been great in a John Sandford book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly characters, not easy to follow plot","review":"I'm struggling to get through this book now, although I'm not sure why I just don't put it down. The kid, Joshua, drives me nuts; a totally unbelievable personality and comments from him. Kate is supposed to be this strong woman, but she usually has no idea what to do, easily is bullied and manipulated, and sappy. I guess I just don't like the author's style (sort of a blend of Barbara Cartland, Danielle Steele, and Sidney Sheldon), so will avoid her books in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !","review":"This is an excellent book in my opinion. I totally enjoyed it. This is only the second book I have read by Iris Johansen, and I was just as impressed with this book as I was with the first one, (And Then You Die). This book was full of great suspense, and kept a good pace. (I also didn't want it to end.) I would definately recommend it to anyone who likes a good suspense with a touch of romance thrown in."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"This is the third book that I have read by Johansen and I think it was my 2nd favorite. I love her writing, it always keeps me thinking. I couldn't put any of her books down. The reason I only give it 4 stars is because I wasn't to impressed with the end. I wanted to read about the wedding. I wanted to know what happened with RU2 and if it was allowed in the states. I was curious as to if it helped Kate's father. I really wish there were a sequal to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but...","review":"It is the kind of book that you can't put down, but I couldn't forgive Johansen for what she did to Noha. I thought that maybe she didn't have to kill so many people during the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johansen is obsessed with showers","review":"The characters in this book are forever taking showers. When they're not taking showers, they are either planning to take a shower, wishing they could take a shower, or telling each other to take a shower.Why in the world does she make the main character, Kate, a scant *29* years old?? It's ridiculous. Not only does she have an MD, she has at least one PhD. And she has managed to reach the top of her field by 29. But wait, there's more! She also, during all this achievement, managed to squeeze out a baby at the tender age of TWENTY, and then raise it. Uh huh.Why does Johansen not just make Kate 39, and be a bit more realistic on all counts? There is a hint early on when Kate muses that Benny, her ex-husband's new girlfriend, is only 23, which makes her so much more attractive than elderly Kate. ARGH! Clearly, Johansen does not think a woman can be attractive at the advanced age of 39. *snore* How ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintriguing ScienceGoneWrong Story With Boring Protagonist","review":"Much of this book has our \\"heroine\\" gazing down at her son fondly & thinking \\"Oh, Joshua\\", with which we're supposed to be touched or possibly relate. She had all the punch and complexity of June Cleaver at Sunday services. The male characters were comprised of pure ethnicist cliche, and of course they were all impressed with our 2-d \\"heroine's\\" good looks. So in essence the plot goes like this: a vapid and attractive widowed mother gets embroiled in some shady technology drama which her husband had been involved in. She helplessly shrieks and maternally frets for her son and falls in love with the good guy, so predictably that I wanted to cry for the trees that needlessly died to make this MadeForTVMovie style of a novel. Definitely one of the lamest piles of pulp I've yet encountered."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS BOOK!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!","review":"This was the 1st book by IRIS JOHANSEN that I have read and it blew me away. I am a seasoned reader. I have very high expectations from the material that I read.

It came into my possession around 1990, when my artsy aunt was purging her book collection. I confiscated her copy from the trash and consider this book among my prized possessions.Native Flash and Funk captures images and stories of truly creative and talented artisans and crafters.Truly, you MUST look at the images to appreciate the artistic skills of these artists. I have a great attraction to the wood-carved doors, if I could find one, I would very quickly save the money and have one installed! Secondly I am in awe of the embroidered shirt (a young woman created the shirt while serving time in prison, the nuns taught her to embroider and she became a true visionary with skill). Not to mention the beautiful batik clothing, and touching stories.

The pictures are amazing but the writing is better. The author treats you like a close friend, as if you were part of the scene around the Bay Area in the late 60s/early 70s. She openly tells you one of her designs came to her at orgasm and another artist works in the local hash pipe factory. There is nothing to hide!

It was the second book I read by this author, and I was amazed at how well she could create characters so close to me in attitudes and likes. I love working on cars, and I have experienced the prejudice that comes with that as a female. I was fascinated at the author's ability to create a believable character within this premise. Yeah, if you are a true mechanic, you may find a few flaws in some of the repairs. Still, most of the information was impressively accurate. I picked up this series thinking it was going to be cheesy, but I found some books I could really sink my teeth into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appearances can be deceiving","review":"Looks aren't everything.

She's totally helpless, which goes against most of what we know about rich people: they have money because they can do things (or sell things) better than others.

But what is far more shocking than its toilet-level content is acclaimed actress Charlotte Rampling's involvement in the cringe-inducing proceedings. This is a career-suicide project causing one to wonder precisely why Ms Rampling would debase herself in such a very public way. Furthermore, it does nothing but tarnish the achievement of her cultivation of a rare cinematic mystique combining intelligence and sexuality. Hopefully for Ms Rampling, the book will disappear quickly and she will come to her senses. As for Teller?

Dr. Thurow and his discredited brand of 3rd way political economics never fail to make for embarrassing reading(read 'Head to Head' to see what I'm talking about). The good Dr. has chosen a safer topic in this book, replete with a numbing littany of buzzwords (knowledge based economy) and lame intellectual metaphors (the pyramid on the dollar bill). This book added less to my understanding of our economic milieu than a recent copy of Wired!, but was more expensive and boring. Save your money and time readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duh","review":"It is shocking that a professor who teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has chosen to write a book whose footnotes are not included therein. A quick examination of the footnotes exposes how incredibly lame most of the book's sourcing is. Thurow quotes himself a number of times, as well as The Economist, The New York Times, Fortune and The Boston Globe--and economists from commercial brokerage houses like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Very few academic sources are used.All that would be fine if Thurow came up with some earth shattering conclusions. But he doesn't. Listen to \\"Rule Thirteen: Luck is necessary. Talent Drive, and persistence by themselves aren't enough to get wealthy.\\" For this I paid $27.50? You've got to be kidding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great jacket cover, but....","review":"I was disappointed with this book. It is not an easy book to read and keep you motivated to read more.

He then goes on to explain this statement further."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's OK, but he's no Krugman.","review":"This book is a very fun read for those who are interested in economics. However, Dr. Thurow seems more intent on thrilling the reader than basing his arguments on reality. This book would be wonderful if he could back up more of his arguments. Still, it's fun to pick through Dr. Thurow's mind and see what he sees in the future of world economics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzz","review":"I purchased this book hoping to gain some insights into the workings of the 'new economy'.However, while the pop-economics style of Thurow might lead to easy reading, I did not find the book particularly informative.

No surprises here. An unrepentant socialist attempts to salvage his boyhood Marx for the post-industrial information revolution. The New Deal welfare-state predictably remains the supreme social achievemnent for Thurow, only now it's going to be \\"knowledge-based\\". (At least Marx could envision beyond the Prussian state he was born into.)If you want deeper insight from an economist on the coming information revolution, do yourself a favor and read some Hayek.

Although none of them contains formulas for such purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the humanity?","review":"Very good book outlining the prospects of a global economy and what it takes to succeed on a global and individual level.Yet I did not find a thing in Lester's book regarding the human element. He describes how downsizing and moving factories to cheaper-labor nations are huge benefits for corporations. But there isn't a mention of the effects this has on people. To Thurow, it seems that profits and new products/services are the only important things in the 21st century. In the book, one can be lead to believe that Thurow is advocating Happiness=Wealth. The answer to that, however, is relative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad, doesn't take reality into account...","review":"I got a third of the way through it, and decided that he wasn't expaining anything new and his reasoning lacked reasonableness. I don't have too much time to waste on this so I'll describe the book as: contradictory, biased, unrealistic, similar to his other works about the collapse of the US in the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long term investment verse short term consumption.","review":"While my views are generally favorable to letting market forces decide who is the fittest I think it is important that we do not close our minds to the different influences that shape the ecomomic landscape. After reading the customer reviews it struck me as ridiculous how opinionated some of them were. I found the book at minimum to be an objective view of what constitutes wealth and what is needed to build the foundation and the structure to achieve it. Wealth cannot exist unless we have a strong educated middle class that is accustomed to changing without sacrificing what they have earned everytime they do so. Thurow gives an excellent blueprint of what is necessary to achieve greatness as a country, profit as a company and achieve security as an individual. Therefore, it is paramount that we take a long term view on investment so that we can shape the very market forces that we could be in the best possible position to benefit from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting: But Any More Useful Than His Other Books? No.","review":"Having read other Thurow books, and recalling particularly \\"Head To Head\\" from 1991, I'd say despite his authoritative writing and recognizable name, we have no particular reason to think he'll be right this time. Look at \\"Head to Head,\\" in your local library and see how well this talking head predicted such things as Japan's economic collapse and the U.S.'s continued global competitiveness.

Instead, it's really more of a PR piece for (perhaps) the chamber of commerce with lots of profiles of local companies and essays about what a great place Portland is. It looks like something that should've been given out to companies that were thinking of setting-up shop in Portland.What it does have about the airport is pretty generic in nature with no diagrams and not much in the way of great photos.

I pity anyone who paid full price for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and Offensive","review":"This book attempts to generalize Muslim women.

We need to ask ourselves when we are going to stop dishonest portrayal of Muslim societies. I can also list all the ills in the Western society and blame it on Christianity like rape, teenage pregnancy, high rate of divorce, infidelity, adultery, AIDS and other STDs, promiscuity, birth out of wedlock, domestic abuse etc. The freedom of women in the western world has nothing to with Christianity. The progress and enlightenment in the Western world evolved from anti-religious secular ideas. Democracy, freedom, and liberty all originated from non-Christian thoughts which are certainly not un-Christian or un-Islamic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good cleaner","review":"Looks very thin, like water.

The production of video, camera angles & sound are great. They have one teach & the other the opponent. The teacher tells you what moves they use & why as they do it in slow motion, and then show you normal speed. Then on tho the next combo. There is no excess chatter or dragging on to fill content.

The dialogue is flat and the characters are so unbelievably boring it's a struggle to get past the first 30 pages.The printing appears to be done via a laser printer, running low on toner, with the fonts jacked to a very large point size(presumably to inflate the page count of the thing). The illustrations inside are worse than laughable...I have no idea if the author was really in the military or not, as his bio claims, but this reeks of someone just cashing in on the latest fad (military special operations).

Really really bad! If it wasn't for them looking like GWAR I would never have got this cd. All the songs are really lame and sounds like something you would hear from the 50's or 60's as far as the words but the music sounds like copper but much much gayer.

These songs, however, are SO rocking, SO in your face, SO dripping with passion and intensity that the fact that they so brazenly adopted this (well)done-before monster theme (and no, I haven't forgotten about the guys who started it all: KISS) makes what could easily have been considered borderline plagiarism an all-the-more BALLSY statement.

However, I found the movie itself to be lacking. First of all, the content of this movie could have been narrated in 15 minutes; as a result, the movie seems to repeat the same concept over and over again therefore being very predictable in where it is going.Second of all, the movie was very obviously designed to be watched in 3-D. The effect is just not the same in 2-D as fish swim towards the screen in 2-D and objects awkwardly jut towards the camera. While I'm sure this movie was engaging in 3-D, watching at home in 2-D was actually rather boring and non-engaging.I've thoroughly enjoyed other National Geographic presentations on Blu-ray such as Relentless Enemies, however this one seems to be short on substance and designed for color 3-D delivery which is not really possible on Blu-ray yet.

I hate Superman and most of the DC characters in general, but everyone was saying that it won't matter once I start the comic so I gave it a shot. It was simply amazing!

You've got a spy story mixed with the right amount of adventure, back-stabbing, violent plans, and assassination attempts, all combining to form a very good book. The novel can be quickly summed up by saying a retired CIA operative is recruited to stop a world-class terrorist from killing the President. But by limiting yourself to just that you miss a lot of the intricacies that are so much a part of Ludlum's novels. There are always twists and turns in his stories which help to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Although, I must say that other Ludlum novels that I've read before always seemed to be more complicated than this one. It had its twists but not as many as I remember other novels having. Either way though, Ludlum is still a master at weaving intricate spy stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Started out well setting up the characters of Tyrell Hawthorne and Amaya Bajaratt pursuing one another around the Caribbean. A potentially good story then falls flat with overlong narrative which makes the readers out to be stupid. Ludlum here instead on concentrating on the main two players throws in an over complex narrative with subplots that just seem to go nowhere and distract the reader. The military element in the book is also poorly researched. Supposedly tailor-made for the 1990s, it belongs in the 1970s - an era when Ludlum was writing his best material. And then he also falls for the trap of awful dialogue -overuse of the words 'darling' and 'my love' like a dime-store pulp romance for bored housewives! Cringe. Let us not forget the other cliche - constant references to TV, actors, personalities to bring out a characterisation or plot device. If you're new to Ludlum, avoid this one. Read THE MATARESE CIRCLE or THE BOURNE IDENTITY first."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Ludlum's worst","review":"I have been a fan of Ludlum's books for many years. However, it seems like he has lost the ability to write a concise storyline in his recent books. The plot of this book was terribly convoluted and overly complex.

I wanted it to tell me if I was ovulating for sure. All this watch does it calculated your expected days to ovulate based up on the number of days in your cycle. Had I not had it for over 30 days I would have sent it back. Do not buy this thing!! Use the free calendars and ovulation predictors online...much more valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"The watch worked as expected the first two days, then watch kept saying \\"Not Reading\\" or \\"Skin Too Dry\\". I followed the troubleshooting instructions but that didn't resolve the issue. This watch costs too much to have to \\"troubleshoot\\" every month. I don't have time to waste on this product nor do I want to feel the resulting frustration. I am returning this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible product","review":"I was really hopeful about this product. I knew it had mixed reviews, but my cycle is very regular and ovulation is pretty consistent, so I thought it would work. However, the screen was very dim from the moment I opened it, and the watch was not comfortable to wear. I went through a sensor within 10 days, and now the next one is drying up. I have followed all the directions accurately, including its storage, and it seems that the battery is dying. Ridiculous, after 10 days! I am grateful for Amazon's return policy, and when I get my money back, I will purchase something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Had one of the sensor packs die on me on Cycle Day 8, which meant I was out for the entire month. The next month, it told me I was entering my fertile phase two days AFTER my ovulation... that's right - fertile time had come and gone for the month. I had a 28-day cycle that month, too. OvWatch will mess with your hopes and lie to you outright!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work for me","review":"This product seemed to work fine for the first month, but after that it didn't detect ovulation properly. The second and third months it detected ovulation a week late! I had to use an ovulation predictor kit to verify if the OV Watch was working correctly, and it was not. I received a surge from the OPK and the OV Watch didn't detect ovulation until much later. I was very disappointed with this product and the company only has a 30 day return policy. It takes more than 30 days to determine if this product is working for you. I wish I bought the Clear Blue Easy Monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"It is very difficult to put on. I have normal skin yet it always tells me my skin too dry. You can't put lotion on to moisten your skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temperamental and Disappointing :(","review":"Was so excited by the testimonials and had been trying for 7 months when I first started the OvWatch - been using it for over 6 months now - no baby! On top of that, the last 3 cycles it has been malfunctioning and saying 'not reading' and the screen is going dim. Will just have to start using another method and go see a fertility specialist. And OvWatch's guarantee sucks - only 30 days!!!I wouldn't rely solely on this method - use ov strips and/or BBT along with it to be sure.It's also bulky and uncomfortable, and very expensive to maintain (especially when you get nothing in return!!!!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont get it!!!!","review":"It doesn't work!!! It told me I was fertile and I wasn't even wearing it. It actually just goes by your cycle, not the sweat on ur skin. I work nights so I wore it during the day, when I got home from work at 8am on day 11 it already said \\"fertile\\". Don't pay the money for a watch to count your cycle!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OV Watch didn't work","review":"I used the product like the instructions advised and still didn't become pregnant. I think this was a waste of money and will sell mine at a generous discounted price just to get rid of it and not be reminded I bought into a gimmick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I used the watch according to instruction. Wore it every night starting with cycle day 1, kept it in the plastic container when not wearing it. On day eight, it read no data. Testing it showed it was no longer reading! Apparently, at day 8 the sensor was no longer reading. I have to wait to start a new cycle. What a waste of a cycle! I am going to return it ASAP within while I still have the 30 day window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"What a waste of money. This might work for someone who ovulates every month on the 15th but I don't. Thought it was funny that my chart & OPK's agreed I ovulated on cd 23 but the watch gave me the \\"typical\\" cycle days as most fertile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt seem very scientific","review":"Im sure there is a lot of science behind this product. However, it missed my ovulation consistantly. It almost seemed as though it would just subtract 14 days from the end of my last cycle when calculating when ovulation would occur. I have a 25 day cycle and ovulated three times around Day 9. The OV watch kept saying that I was ovulating on day 11."},{"rating":"2","title":"OV watch works","review":"I was very skeptical about purchasing the OV watch due to the price but after 7 months of trying to conceive we decided to give it a try. The watch was awesome! After one month of using the watch I got a positive pregnancy test. Baby is due June 5th."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predicted ovulation 7 days too early - worthless!","review":"I was also temping while using this - the BBT identified my ovulation on the day it occurred (my period started 14 days later) and the OV watch said it happened SEVEN days before the temp rise! I would have given up and missed ovulation completely if I had listened to this useless piece of technology. DON'T waste your money!The refund policy is useless - it will take more than 30 days to know whether it's working. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alchemist STOLE JayZ beat???

The story given contradicts the plot of the original Nightmare on Elm Street movie. The actor who portrays the lead cop is a horrible actor. I realize this is a tv series from the 80's and did not have the same budget as the movie, but I was grossly disappointed by this tape. Especially in the scene where they show Freddy's murder by the town's people and when he kills the guard. Even if you are a fan of the movie series, this tape will disappoint you. This movie is to be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"3-Season? Really?","review":"I was told by a backpacking friend who has completed the Appalachian trail that for a general purpose tent for the occasional family overnight or scout trip I want a \\"3-season\\" tent. The description for this tent said that specifically so I ordered it based on reviews. Got it a day early and opened it up. The sides of this thing are large screens with nothing to cover them up. Tomorrow night it is supposed to dip into the high 30s here. We would freeze if we tried to do the overnight in this tent! Apparently, there is a difference between a 3-season tent and a tent good for \\"3-season hiking\\". Wish I had known that before I bought this thing. Without any time to order something decent I am off to the big box stores to by the wally-world brand. Buying a decent tent is an activity reserved only for those who know what they're doing. The rest of us novices should buy from a place where you can see the tent assembled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for breezy conditions","review":"The rainfly on the Tetragon 8 that I received was the problem. It has two shock corded short poles to hold the rainfly above the doorway, and above the rear window. By Day 2 of a 7 day camping trip, after a brief summer storm with slight wind, the poles had broken out of their little sleeves and torn small holes in the rainfly, causing the doorway overhang to fall over the door. The back window situation was a little better in that the poles didn't completely break through. That said, the tent did not leak, which is the only reason I'm even giving it a 2. The tent is useless to me now, and I will not make the mistake of purchasing another Eureka with such a flawed design. I am a veteran camper, and have other tents. I was hoping the Eureka, as a lightweight tent, would offer me a viable and economical alternative. It did NOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"met our expectations","review":"My sweetie and I were quite happy with the first time out with the our Eureka Tetragon 8. Our maiden voyage with the tent was a three night wilderness canoe trip. First night out we had to set it up in a light rain. Stayed completely dry. We had light rain and some wind the rest of the trip. The tent continued to be a dry haven. It is easy to set up, the gear storage system worked well for us. It is definitely a three season tent. With the exception of the back window,the screened windows have no way of closing off to colder weather. But for what we needed, it worked well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor poles","review":"This spring our Troop was upgrading our tents. We looked at several tents high and low dollar. We are replacing some Eureka Alpine series tents that are about 10 years old. They served us well. We purchased 4 Tetragon 8 for our boys and some Nenergy 1210 ( they were marked down to $75.00 )tents for the adults. The adult tents have done well, but the Tetragon 8s are dissapointing. Within two campouts 3 poles have broken. Two fly poles and one main pole. The two fly poles broke right at the coupler so we were able to shorten the poles 1/2\\" each but the main pole broke in the middle of the shaft. I know for sure that no one was even in the tent when the pole snapped. We are now looking for more tents as the troop is growing. While it would be nice to have the same tents for the boys, Im afraid to buy any more Eureka tents. I have not, nor will I \\"Apply\\" for warranty for these tents.

I wish I could return it & get another full novel book."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to life stories about the holidays","review":"What a great collection of stories. I have never read any other Maeve Binchy books, but this one was recommended to me because, well, Christmas has not always been my fav. The stories are all around the idea that the build up does not equal the end result and that sometimes the holidays are just yucky. Some characters have experiences that are better than their usual, just not the picture perfect ideal. I thought they were well written with great characters and interesting situations. It wasn't depressing, just real. A few stories were actually inspirational to a person like me who knows that perfection does not happen just because you wish for it. Sometimes there is just movement towards better. Really, a nice collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a downer!","review":"My mother buys me a Christmas book every year around the holidays. I've always loved a good uplifting Christmas tale ever since the first time I read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" when I was about 13.A few years ago I received this book. Being a fan of Maeve Binchy I was looking forward to reading it. Wasn't I surprised to find that only 2 or 3 of the 15 or so stories were uplifting and even those were borderline? Most of the stories were filled with every kind of downtrodden character you can imagine performing every kind of unsavoury act.The two stars I give this book are only for the writing which is not bad. For content and sentiment I give nothing.If you want a good Christmas story - get yourself a copy of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by Charles Dickens.

The second album is almost as good as the first one.A curious fact: their makeup is said to be the origin of Kiss' makeup. The story told is that Kiss' manager saw Secos e Molhados playing live and got blown away by their stage presence and perfomance and took the idea of painting the musicians to Kiss.

The fin should work in theory if tension is high enough and the buckle feels tight and snag on your foot. I had to catch one fin once when I was swimming with them for the first time. I see it as a design flaw. The fin should never be able to slip off the foot, even if the strap becomes loose.

I can confirm the total accuracy of the authors assessments. The book both confirmed and provided illumination as to what I had seen with my own eyes and heard from the communities depicted. This remarkably accomplished work deserves to be read by everyone with an interest in the Middle East.

Anathema began making the transition with what I consider their masterpiece: \\"Eternity\\", and then went into exploration mode of other musical directions, some of which were not appealing at all, however, with \\"A Fine Day To Exit\\", they maintained the essence of Anathema while doing something totally new, and you can hear the doom and gloom roots in their sound, it's not like they departed and attempted to just sound like an Alternative rock band.I can't say it's better than \\"Eternity\\" or \\"Crestfallen\\", but it is very good in its own category, with this album I felt like I was hearing a new band, and I truly enjoy it time and time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Fat Their Best...","review":"I have been a fan of Anathema since \\"Alternative 4\\", and have bought all of their albums since, but I still wasn't ready for \\"A Fine Day To Exit\\".

From the moment you pop this sucker into the C.D. player you are going to be addicted. Though a somewhat mellower album that their past albums, songs like \\"Release\\", \\"Panic\\", and \\"Underworld\\" (arguably the best Anathema song ever) are absolutely enthralling and a masterpiece. I don't have one gripe about this album except that it should have been longer. Damn, if only the album could have extended for hours upon hours, that would kick [butt]. Untouchable.

The basic premise of each story is interesting, but there is very little plot development. Just paragraph after paragraph, page after page of mind numbing descriptions of the \\"horror\\" NW Smith is facing. This is followed by more description using about every adjective in the book on NW struggle to overcome the horror. Then the story ends.It seems the author needed to have a certain number of words in each of her stories, so instead of coming up with action or dialogue to carry the story she just tried to describe the \\"indescribable\\" until she either ran out of adjectives or hit the necessary number of words.

There's really only 245 MB on it - which makes me wonder where the remaining 11 MB went.It's a good player, worth the price, but the fact that it doesn't hold as much as the package says it does bugs me quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the money","review":"A little tricky to get started with it but once you get the hang of what button does what, it's a pretty smooth little unit. Doesn't need any kind of software to install on your PC- that is, if you have Win2000 or XP- which everyone should have by now? Swapping music files over is really simple. Plug it into a USB port and Windows simply recognizes it as an extra drive. Copy and paste all day! I recommend this as an inexpensive alternative to an Ipod etc. Not all the bells and whistles but for playing music, what more do you need? My only gripe is the headphones it came with- to me, they were kinda on the weak side- I like my music -LOUD, so I bought some more powerful headphones with a sensitivity rating of 106db(for $7)and I was good to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with wma","review":"Plugged it into the USB and downloaded songs I bought offline, unfortunately the songs would not play on the device.

You see, it has three buttons. One is the volume control. That is self explanatory. The second is the play button, which also operates power as well as starting and stopping music. The third is the slider button that selects thru menus. Not that hard to figure out, really. The down side is that I cannot run with it until I devise some sort of armband for it.It holds about 65 mp3 files, and more wma. I especially like the flash drive capability of it as well, and it can go places a lot easier than my other mp3 player that is built as a hard drive instead of a flash drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mac Vision 256MB MP3 Player","review":"This is a great MP3 player!

There's nothing like an Ipod - when I get a new one, I'll give him my old one and throw this Mac Vision one in the trash!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicates everything further","review":"Well, this book didn't work for me at all. Everyone I know who have read this book all say \\"well, good book but I never really got into practicing the meditation-stuff\\". And that is understandable. It is so complicated and I doubt very much that it will give you more than a temporary, superficial recovery.

Sub-sections get only terse coverage with very little supporting helpful information. Unlike the rest of the book, every chapter of the championing section left me wanting more. It is as if the author lost energy for the last part of the book or has to cut material to make a publisher happy.Would be four stars if not for the weak championing section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Book","review":"Once you start reading this book you can not put it down.

Simply put, this just is an excellent book.The illustrations by Ken Marschall are absolutely amazing. Hands down, they are the best that I have ever seen in regards to the Titanic. His use of color is so extraordinary that sometimes I seriously had to take a second look to make sure that it was not a photograph.The writing is also quite good. Don Lynch gives heroic voices to the crew of the ship, something that was missed in the smash hit movie. His language is very candid, and it allows you to feel as if you are actually there experiencing the voyage.This book is, by far, the most descriptive and informative recap of the story of the Titanic. It is one magnificent journey and a terrific book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Titanic Centennial","review":"This book while a beautiful pictorial is both informative and compelling in its historical data. There have been many many books written about this ship and her fate but this one is best for a collector or a model ship builder. I bought it for my model ship building partner and he was thrilled with it. He completed his 5 foot model last year and gave it lots of detail. When he sees inaccurate models of this ship he gets annoyed and some people think it really doesn't matter but to those who know the history, it matters a great deal. This book, received after the build, was a welcome addition to his Titanic collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Titanic Book","review":"This is my favorite Titanic book. It includes everything to a dinner with Bruce Ismay discussing his idea of 3 olympic class ships, to try and try to beat out the Cunard Line to how it affects us now.

The first 2 I got free and this one I bought. The three books, believe it or not, says something different about this marvelous vessel each. I love ships anyways so of course I have to read up on the titanic. The book is over 200 pages and basically tells the story of how this ship came to be and how it all ended. As it says in the title all the pictures you see are mostly drawings that are very well done. I have read this book twice so far cover to cover and plan on reading it a 3rd time soon. And yes I also have the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like you're really there!","review":"This book has so much detail to it, that at times it's almost overwhelming! The pictures that come with it are also very colorful and detailed. I loved the pull out cross section poster of the Titanic; I found it very interesting to look through and read about all the sections of the ship. This is a great book and I suggest it to all that enjoy reading and knowing about the Titanic."},{"rating":"2","title":"More pictures please","review":"I wish there had been even more pictures. We get no daylight bird's eye view, front or rear view and the nearest picture to this of the whole ship is obscured by cut outs of inside the ship. Excellent book but still leaves me begging for a few more views of the great ship - just some external views."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scamper","review":"Me and my Best friend Betty Milldred just love watching this movie,it has really helped our friendship grow.Scamper the penguin is an interesting movie about a community of pengiuns who learn valuable lessons. Metiphorcally Speaking the movie could use a bit more altitude.For children who dont quite grasp concepts as well this could be a confusing movie.Also make sure your children know what a mop handle is before they watch the film.There is a bit of violence in the begining, having to do with hitting one self. But over all there are many positive lessons to learn while watching this movie, Children will learn the important values of friendship,Working together,and responsibility. Th movie give educational bonuses to , by learning about different spicies of penguins like the maccaronie penguin.

The ends that aren't covered are very vulnerable to leakage and they do leak. I didn't have a problem with the seams but water coming through the material, and no nothing was touching the sides. They need to redesign the fly to fit more like the 1210. I traded up for the 1512 and am very happy with the new tent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tent for good weather","review":"Inside of the tent is great. Spacious, lots of ventilation, etc. The rain fly sucks. Most of the tent isn't covered, so I'm highly skeptical of people staying dry in a decent storm. Also, our fly ripped when a dog with bad eyesight ran full speed into one of the ropes that tether the fly to the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Tent","review":"We just used the tent for a camping trip this past weekend.

The tent is in excellent!!! shape (Always had tarps on the ground and inside on the floor). Recently, the waterproofing has started to break down and the fabric has become sticky. I contacted Eureka and they will not replace or recoat the fabrics as they said it is part of the natural breakdown of the fabric's waterproofing. Their warranty makes reference to not covering wear and tear and exposure type defects but my tent has been \\"stored indoors in the original bag\\". Ahh, says Eureka, the tent has been stored in it's original bag and that accelerates the breakdown hence they are not responsible.Bottom line, great tent but don't expect much from their warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"This would be a good tent for casual camping in non-inclement weather. The rain fly tore in the area of the tie down string during a minor wind storm. The string was not too tight, but the added stress of the movement caused the whole seam to tear away. Also, I doubt 9 people would fit in this tent. Find a better tent if you plan to camp in weather and find a bigger tent if you need to fit a lot of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value.","review":"I've used this tent for 5 years now, has held up season after season of camping. It's fairly easy to setup once you've practiced a few times. Very sturdy construction it has survived many storms. If you need a large tent that will last and not fall apart after a few seasons this one is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tent","review":"Me and my fiance purchased this tent for when we go camping. We like to take our dog (we have a border collie) so we were looking for something that could fit us our dog cage and a few friends if we wanted to. This tent is extremely spacious and well ventilated. It's easy enough to put together by yourself, although having someone there really helps. We managed to set it up in about 15 minutes in the dark after only putting it together once in our appartment prior to using it. It is definatly worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid family tent","review":"This is a great light-weight tent -- have always been happy with my Eureka purchases. Fits 6 plus their \\"stuff\\" comfortably (more will fit, but we like to have duffle bags and room to stretch). Performed very well in wind and rain (I always seal all the seams on my tents -- no need to risk trusting that manufacturer did an adequate job sealing; so this was no \\"bathtub\\" as another reviewer had suggested).Only thing I could possibly complain about (and this isn't much of a complaint), is that it does take a while to get all the stakes/guy wires in place for this tent. I think I used 18 stakes altogether (which added stability, but also setup time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Eureka product is of very poor quality. And zero customer service.","review":"I bought the tent, Eureka, because of its high quality and reputation. To my surprise the flytop tore during its first use. When we woke up the flytope was torn for no apparent reason.My major disappointment is not just about the quality of the tent nor that a tent, costing $220, only lasts a single day.For me the most incredible and frustrating aspect of this affair is that I have written more than 15 emails to the email address camping@johnsonoutdoors.com asking for the guarantee, asking them to sell me another flytop, and I have sent photographs but I have not received A SINGLE RESPONSE. NOTHING.Fifteen days have now passed and no-one has responded to my correspondence.The Eureka product is of very poor quality.And ZERO customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"no reinforced bottom","review":"This is a large tent, very easy to assemble, very airy inside, zips and unzips easily without snagging. The only downside is that it does not have a reinforced bottom. The bottom is the same fabric as the sides so it wouldn't do well on rough or wet terrrain. We put a tarp underneath it which worked fine in dry weather, but tarps tend to pool water so if it's raining this tent would not fare well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Labels are fine.

Flynn writes in an intense, gripping style that allows for a fast-paced read. The entire time I was absorbed in the book, I felt like I was reading a novel for pleasure. However, for nonfiction junkies, this book gives the detailed facts of the Kursk disaster, even discussing how the sailors died and giving a personal history of Dima Kolesnikov. Flynn delves into the nuances of the Kursk itself, describing its behemoth size, structure and naval intent.Overall, I was blown away by this book and Flynn's evocative writing.

I would have liked a beefier bass (there are three pre-settings for treble and bass) but over-all the 'control panel' is intuitive and easy to use. I especially like the volume control--a dial that turns up and down (sometimes old-fashioned & simple is best)! The double cassette decks, which open at a subtle touch to the corner, means one can record from one tape to another or from one of 3-CD R/RW and AM/FM radio. A snap to set-up.

If Franco had left-wing academics to advise him he would not have lost the African Colonies but then he was morally inferior to wish to keep them.Left-wing attrocities were understated as usual.

Based on notes he made in the field during World War II, the author spends too much time revisiting his every thought instead of describing what was going on. The book does provide a fairly good perspective of a well-educated infantryman in the war if you are willing to skim over page after page of annoying \\"holier-than-thou\\" philosophizing.

The book description is a bit misleading - Gantter arrived in Normandy in November, and so while bodies were still 'washing up from teh invasion', the implied combat he saw there was no-existant. Still, that gilding of the lily is hardly the authours fault.He writes very well, and the the immediacy of it all (the book was finished by 1949) comes through loud and clear.It's a good book for details, too, if you read betwen the lines.

It changed my opinion of murder mysteries entirely. I have read a few, from such authors as Michael Connelly, Johnathon Kellerman and Patricia Cornwell, and this was easily the best, especially in terms of believable plot twists and fast-paced action. The story takes place in a small town in Arkansas, jumping seamlessly between the 50's and the 90's, focusing on the plights of a state trooper and his son, a highly-decorated marine sniper. The characters are realistic and engrossing. The best thing Steven Hunter brings to this book are the seemingly effortless twists throughout. He frequently adds a twist to the plot not by introducing new evidence, but through a subtle change to the view on existing elements.

I'm actually reading \\"Black Light\\" for the second time, now knowing a little bit more history from all the previous swagger books.

Again I hate giving anything away in books and movies so I will not give out to much story. Anyway they get together and the action begins. First going through the story of Earl and a conspiracy. Then to Bob and Richards adventure and findings. Finally some tasty gun fights. That's about all I'm saying. It's really good and I say its worth the money.

I found no point in the prologue. The characters in that chapter never returned again and you don't know who else dies, or what happens to them.

BUY IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crackdown","review":"While I did enjoy playing this game the first time around, I found to my sheer and utter disappointment that I cannot start over and play it again. This is a MAJOR design flaw in the game. If you do not have Xbox Live, you cannot download the update to reset the city's crimes. I have done substantial research online to find a way to reset the game so I can play it again, but every single post, including posts from the game designers at Microsoft, state that you need Xbox Live (Gold membership) to get the update. They even boast that the update brings more features to the game, BUT once again, you need to purchase the wireless network adaptor for ONLY $100, not to mention a GOLD member subscription. I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with this answer. I do not have Xbox Live nor do I see a need for it, especially at the price they want you to pay for it. I will never buy another Microsoft made video game again. Sorry Halo 3 - but I don't trust your juvenile group of game designers anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overpriced Halo 3 Beta patch","review":"This game is just another bad shot at trying to attempt to make a good GTA clone.Storyline is boring. Not really any story at all. Just stuff that looks like a story to make up for an excuse for all the excess violence.Graphics felt like they more for the PS2 than the Xbox 360.Also like another person commented on. Too many Live Marketplace content that should have been included into the game disc. Sorry, Microsoft, but please start shipping us the \\"WHOLE\\" game instead of taking stuff out right before release so you got some download content on Live. At least make it free if your going to insist on taking it out of the game disc. Some of us gamers don't appreciate getting nickeled and dimed to death with bogus Live downloads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy game all around.","review":"This game is just all around cheesy from the story line to the game play, the objectives are not clear, and there are just mobs of enemies every where but you just don't really get any sense of satisfaction from completing missions they just don't feel like they have any deep meaning.

Once the game is patched, they insert all sorts of extra things in to the game that you can't actually play, they only take you to a screen where you can BUY the gameplay. It's annoying, it breaks up the regular game, and there's no way I've found to turn it off. I played the game for about 6 hours in 2 days, then on the third day I got the patch, played for 15 minutes, and haven't gone back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated, does not live up to the hype","review":"I was hearing how incredible this game was, how it's way better than saint's row or grand theft auto. So, I borrowed the game from my work and I decided to play it. Wow, is this game overblown. Only fun the first couple hours and then becomes terribly repeative. Once you max out your guy, what the hell is there to do? Plus, enemies constantly respawn, so most of the time you get shot off of a building and die. I'm at the end of the game right now, fighting the WANG guy and I screamed out in protest. I've beaten Gears of War on Insane diffuclty, but this game is just downright stupid. Plus, there is no storyline, you can get all of the achievements within about a day or two, and the graphics that everyone is raving about is not even on par with better games like Gears of Rainbow Six Vegas. Don't believe the hype, this game isn't all it's cracked up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game ever made?","review":"This has got to be the worst game I have ever played. I played the first Crackdown which was entertaining.Being able to jump over buildings was great fun. There were the obvious limitations: it's a bit too arcade-ish;there's no real progression; you can explore the Crackdown world but there's zero story.Crackdown 2 however is awful, just awful. The opponent AI is pretty miserable. Killing them becomes repetitive.Worst of all, the aiming system is so bad that it's difficult to aim at the right person. Often, I would be trying toaim at an opponent only to have the aiming system focus on a nearby car. There's no way to cycle through targets.This is just an awful game. Also, the orb collecting gets old after awhile and it takes too long to level up.I am glad I rented this game. This really is the worst game I have ever played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those peacekeepers need your help agent!","review":"This game was obviously created with having a good time in mind. To be so short (all the bosses take something like 12-15 hours to kill unless you try to max out your stats first) and utterly storyless, this game stands out as one of the most fun; most replayable game in recent memory. The cel-shading is mostly well done and only starts to look bad in really close-up camera angles that will probably screw the camera up anyway.The only real problems I have with this game is that sometimes a boss will inexplicably not be where his map marker says he is and although the criminals' banter is quite funny, they never shut up, even if there is no one around. Also the announcer continues to train you in the basics of playing the game no matter how long you've already been playing.Minor problems aside I totally recommend this game to anyone who like to play games that offer lots of mindless blowing stuff up."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL","review":"This is a really cool game. The only thing I don't like is that it is supposed to be in a ghetto futuristic city. I wish it wasn't a ghetto and was like a super cleaned up shiny city. Single player campaign is ok, it's kind of ridiculous when you have to take on hordes of gangsters and they're all shootin at u and that gets obnoxious, but the co - op is excellent.

You can scale massive skyscrapers, drive sports cars and SUVs, and leap incredible distances, all while leaving a path of destruction in your wake. As an agent of the \\"Agency\\", a last line of defense against gangs that have overrun your city, you're esentially a steroid-built killing machine who can level up skills by offing the bad guys in as many different ways as possible. The game offers excellent opportunity for 2-player co-op adventures, and has a lot of fun achievements for XBOX 360 Gamerscore adicts. While it looks simple, the game offers quite a challange at it's hardest difficulty level. Finally, what could be more fun that throwing a car at a posse of gang members, that whipping out your rocket launcher and blowing it up as it falls on them? Not much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly underrated!","review":"Crackdown is fantastic fun! I was not a fan of the XboxLive demo but found the full game to be simply wonderful.

But this game ditches the gangster cliche' for a clone with super powers. This game basically asks you to raise hell in Pacific City because you are armed right at the beginning with an assault rifle, a shotgun, and 8 grenades. As you perform good deeds like killing gangsters and their bosses you get upgrades for your powers like developing the ability to pick cars and large objects, getting powerful kicks and more. If you like GTA you should play this game especially for its art style, mission variety, cool powers, and your ability to destroy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crackdown","review":"I originally bought the game for the Halo 3 beta and didn't really look into playing Crackdown much. A friend on XBOX live told me to try it out and to my suprise the game was actually good. It is quite easy to reach the maximum skill level, but it takes time.I really ejoyed being able to jump building to building and lifting huge objects. The one thing that could have made the game better would be more vehicles. Yes I know you can buy some online, but what a waste of money. They could have included a helicopter or a motor cycle in the original game.If you ask me, is the game worth $60 bucks, I will say no, but 30 to 40 dollars is a good price. Thats how much I got it for. Hopefully if there is a sequal there will be some new vehicles, and maybe a way to walk into every building."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun third-person shooter","review":"Robocop meets Superman. Crackdown is a lot of fun offering a wide variety of weapons, vehicles, and special abilities to use, master, and exploit. The scope of the game is impressive taking you across three islands and from sea level to several hundred feet in the air. Jumping from the top of the Agency will take your breath away.My nitpick with this game is the fact that the extra content available via Xbox Live Marketplace is expensive. Also, the re-playability is somewhat low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game - Great to just pick up and play","review":"The best thing I like about Crackdown is that is fun and I don't have to think a lot while I'm playing it. If I die - I just start over at a supply point and I don't lose any of the things I have already accomplished. The auto saves are great.I'd give it 5 stars if you had more combat choices. When I want to hit someone all I can do is hit the 'B' key till they go down.

This is one of those exceptions. You are given a city in the near future, run by 3 gangs. Your job is to wipe out the gangs by eliminating thier bosses and leaders, but who cares about that? The real fun is exploring and jumping on building-tops. This is one of those games where you can go anywhere you want, destroy anything you want, and DO anything you want.

He kidnaps a woman and her son, possibly placing them in danger, certainly causing the woman much torment and humiliation, and this is supposed to be a ROMANCE novel? Get real! I expected Hawk to grab the heroine by the hair and drag her back to his cave! Ms. Brown is great at romance; her novels are always very steamy. But get with the program! Woman who read \\"contemporary\\" romance novels aren't happy with this type of \\"hero\\"! I read this book several years ago, but it still irks me so much that I had to submit this review.

I liked her style, so I ordered a few more books which she wrote earlier one of which was this book. It seemed to me that she changed her style from ten cent romance novels to romance and mystery, and I was quite disappointed in this book.Too much repeating, too much unnecessary explaining of details and too much cursing.

Some chapters have absolutely no relevant substance and the stories presented are quite dull.Secondly, the spelling style is incomprehensible. This has nothing to do with the ideas presented.

Often they seemed little more than self-indulgent stories seeking a place to park themselves.

If you want to understand something, dividing it up into smaller and smaller pieces is not the way.

One recognises the type - the bluff and hearty ci-devant Feynman for whom anything that hints of mathematical sophistication is strictly for girly-men.Well, anyway, the worth of a scientific program can be judged only by the results to which it leads. In this case it has led Laughlin and his unfortunate co-workers to a theory of black holes which is so patently nonsensical that it has seriously damaged the scientific reputations of all concerned. So the verdict is already out. I am reminded of the definition of \\"vicarious embarrassment\\" --- it's when you do someone else's squirming for them. Laughlin is so pompous that it is easy to resist performing this service for him, however.

If you can stay alive long enough to get a good shot in, then you had better run back to cabin ASAP...because this is when they really go beserk. Consider that you can take down 3 or 4 attacking pack animals and then have the 4th or 5th one take YOU down... again, and again for the 30th time.

It is, in a word, terrible. The characters are not believable, the dialogue stilted, illogical and incoherent. The plot line beggars belief and the planned attack is so ridiculous that any amateur sleuth can see it is totally impossible to carry out let alone succeed. There is no attempt at any semblance of logic in the plan and no recognition of technical reality. To be honest I kept reading just to see how bad it would get. I wasn't disappointed - it got worse. Not recommended unless you are marooned on a desert island somewhere and this is the only book available. It was disappointing to realize how far Lublum had fallen from his early writing. It is hard to believe this novel would be on anyone's best selling list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst book I've ever read","review":"I made the mistake of picking this up for a recent vacation (where I couldn't purchase another book in the middle), and was therefore stuck with it while my wife read her own book.I'm a BIG FAN of suspense/thrillers, especially those with some link to World War II.

The plot moves swiftly, and is carried by the dialog. However, there is a conspicuous shortage of descriptive prose.

Neonazis (neos to Bob) are everywhere, no one can be trusted, there's the second coming of Hitler, a plot to poison the water supplies of Paris, Washington, and London and dozens of innocent people caught in the crossfire.

But this book was so dispappointing that I will never again touch one of his works. If an author concocts a story about Germans - good or bad - than he should try to give the impression that he has looked into the subject. Mr Ludlum is not even sure about the German language. His characters use words which are either antiquated, misspelled or simply imcomprehensible. Which makes it a funny book but not a good one. The story is naive and the book is absolutely \\"putdownable\\". I didn't do that because I've never before put a book down.

So it was with great anticipation that I opened the pages of this one. What a diappointment! After 150 pages I was still waiting for the book to improve, but alas, it was not to be. The main character/ \\"hero\\" Drew Latham is so wretched conceived that if stupidity were an Olympic event, he would rate a perfect score of 10 from every judge. He simply isn't believable and neither were any of the other characters.

His attention to detail and plots have deteriorated to the point I think someone is ghost writing after Mr. Ludlum develops the plot. An example is the scene in the Rhine River - no thought whatever to the constant barge traffic which would have interfered with most of what is happening. I've bought my last Ludlum book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inept Twaddle","review":"I had never read Ludlum before so I picked this one to sample him. If this is representative of his writing, I am totally at a loss as to why he was so popular. The writing in this book appeared to be unedited and much of the language was unintentionally funny. The character development was haphazard and uninteresting. All the characters were cliched and the action sequences contained no effective build-up and were extremely unexciting. I resolved to finish the book although it was an excruciating 700 plus pages. All I can say is this book made Tom Clancy's writing seem like Shakespeare.

What makes me mad is that I have gone through about three of them because he gets some much good press. I find the writing wooden and he just does not hold my attention. I also did not like the location descriptions. It may have been different when the book came out, but I find the plot tired - so many times has it been done well that I did not need this version. To be honest I only got about 175 pages into the book. I just thought there should have been something, anything, to keep my attention. The story just kept going on and on with not real light at the end of the tunnel. Maybe I just have a mental block with him and the movies will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Apocalypse Watch","review":"One of the least exciting, most poorly written \\"thrillers\\" I've ever read. Up until this point I've been a huge Ludlum fan -- killing many a long flight or day at the beach reading such classics as the Bourne Identity and the Parsifal Mosaic.

The King secretly engages the boy to train his daughter as well, as she is getting out of hand.

Grandma doesn't have room for a crib, so the swing is the perfect portable location for a nap during the day when Mom has to go out. She outgrew the old swing and it wouldn't move any longer. This swing is great for the older or larger child. It is very soft and comfortable, and her feet don't drag on the ground. It will keep her happy for several more months, I hope! I obviously don't need the mobile accessory, so I can't comment on that part. The five point harness is great. I don't have to worry about her climbing out of it.

Well I finally got the batteries in there the swing made this loud sound as it was on that the music you couldn't hear unless it was all the way turned up because of this loud sound the swing made when it was on. Then the mobile baby would need to look almost all the way behind him to see it. I don't have the box anymore but I hope i can still take it back and exchange it for a better swing! I would not reccomnd the swing to anyone! I hope i don't even have to keep it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat of One Minute Millionaire?","review":"Hearing David speak made me buy this book. The book reads like an autobiography and takes the reader on the journey how he found 100,000 to repay his debts instead of running away from them leaving his creditors unpaid (His first thought). I gave 2 stars as when finished reading it, it reminded me of being a duplicate of One Minute Millionaire by Mark Hansen where the 'fictional' character of that story uses wealth principles to find $1,000,000.00 in 90days whereas David takes just under a year to achieve his goal using similar vehicles to obtain results.

I have seen several videos on this subject, and this is the most compelling and well-researched of them all. Living Hope Ministries also has another DVD entitled \\"DNA vs. The Book of Mormon\\" which is also quite good, though not as excellent as this one (it refutes the Mormon claim that Native Americans descended from Jewish ancestors.) And to second the motion made by prior reviewer E.

If you are an LDS member, please know that this film sifts and weighs the words directly from the Book of Mormon.Faith and reason go hand and hand. Regardless of which historical event a person is investigating, the event itself is just that, historical. Therefore, the event should correctly reflect the historical setting.

This book, on the other hand. I didn't enjoy. Aside from my unlikeable character gripe that I have with See's characters, this just didn't do it for me. It was slow, it was boring, and somehow the end of the mystery was both predictable and too far out there.

But yet had few relaxing hours with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did that come from???","review":"I found the plot twists to be pretty darned forced. The characters would react to sudden revelations as if they were extraordinary conclusions to previous circumstances.

The seqence about the teeth in this book is totally ridiculous, as are several other plot devices. True, there are unexpected twists, but the twists are only unexpected because they're implausible and downright insulting to any reader of intelligence. Plot holes prevail, and the author writes sex scenes as if she's still a virgin. I only finished this novel because I paid full price for it at the book store, which was a mistake. BOOOOOO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book!","review":"Holy Hell is very nearly a perfect book.Holy Hell is funnier than anything I've read in a year.I'm awestruck by the talent of Elizabeth Sims.Far and away the best series debut ever.I laughed, I cried, I sent out for pizza, but I never put the book down until I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"Matt is awesome.

He is a great preformer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Howie or John but still worth your while","review":"Recently we have all been blessed with some tasteful music. It seems slowly we are merging away from studio polished bands that don't write their own music, and are heading more towards an acoustic singer/songwriter type of music. Noteable contributers to this group include Howie Day and John Mayer who both in my eyes put together incredible pieces of music and are explosive on stage. From these two artist who I gave 5 stars I learned about Matt Nathanson, another singer songwriter with his own unique blend of vocals and acoustic melodies. You have to wonder at times why he is not huge yet like Mayer and the soon to be Howie Day, but I wouldn't doubt you hear more from him soon. By that time his range of vocals will have improved and his songs will get better and better. He isn't Howie Day or John Mayer by any means, but he is deffinetly worth checking out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MATTS AWESOME!","review":"Hey, I dont have any of Matts CDs, YET!

I had never heard of him before, and now im like a MAtt Junky! lol!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Matt is fabulous in any form.","review":"Though I must say I prefer Matt live hands down, his studio cds are good warm ups for the shows. This particular one is lots of fun, with great lyrics and catchy tunes. They're all heartfelt, personal, and touching - and when you see him perform live, you'll instantly be converted into a massive fan. He's hilarious on stage, and also extremely passionate - making an unforgettable experience.He's also not a \\"kid\\" - he's been around for years, making numerous amazing records on independent labels. You really believe him when he sings, he's got conviction and credibility. He's mature, experienced, and amazing. Check him out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An early 90s curio, paranoid yet goofy","review":"As far as I know, this is a film, not a book, so I am unsure why Amazon is listing it this way.Baldwin's films (and this was his first, made when he was a student) are almost entirely comprised of \\"found\\" or stock footage. In this case, Balwin weaves together a number of bizarre (and popular) conspiracy theories - from the JFK assassination to the United Fruit Company's dealings in Latin America to alien abduction - to make a cogent whole. Baldwin's tongue is firmly in cheek; even the most committed conspiracy buffs will have a hard time taking his breathy \\"Secret Agent X\\" narration at face value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"Like most others, I do feel this and other self-help books can be useful. However, the effectiveness really does depend on the state of your relationship, your partner's receptiveness and your own mindset at the time. I read this book and practiced much of what she instructed but it requires alot of work to simply change yourself, change your thoughts and your own behavior. Although I'm sure it can be rewarding when her advice works, it can be extremely frustrating when it doesn't, especially when you feel like you've been the one trying, working and giving in the relationship in the past. I ended up feeling as though I was repressing my own feelings, becoming relatively submissive and subservient and there was a blow-up when things didn't go as planned. It can be frustrating when over a period of time one person feels they are doing all the work. Not for the faint of heart - be warned it can backfire unless you have a receptive partner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my marriage","review":"I really didn't believe that I could change my relationship, by only working myself. Boy, did Susan Page show me I was wrong. Take note, this book is not for the lazy or the faint of heart. She has \\"exercises\\" that you must actually DO, many of which involve writing about yourself and your partner. She requires that you do some hard and sometimes painful analysis of your situation. It's not always easy, it's not always fun. But if you are willing to do the work, you will find that you CAN bring you and your spouse together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deserve one star","review":"If you are buying this book in hopes of saving a failing marriage, you might be disappointed. Only couples actively working together to improve their relationship might benefit from some of this advise. If your relationship has disintegrated to the level where just one of you is trying, you're not in a relationship at all. Following Susan Page's strategies under these circumstances might do you more harm than good. There is no such thing as a relationship that works on half power and this is exactly what is suggested between these pages. This could be catastrophic for partners in a verbally or emotionally abusive marriage where they are blamed constantly for everything already.The title of this book is deceiving and maybe even a little irresponsible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"If you are frustrated with not getting enough effort out of your partner when it comes to getting a derailed relationship back on track this book will help. I can't say it is the best written book ever, but the ways it tells you to cope and take charge are enough to make it a worthwile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love them!","review":"I had seen these shoes in person but could not get my size.

The author impressively argues that the Peace was not in fact a Diktat in practice, but largely the outcome of precedence and geo-political and social necessity. Likewise, the author rightly in my mind faults the Allies for abandoning France in terms of the enforcement of the peace, debunking the notion that Gallic torpidity and passivity caused French leadership to crumble at the onslaught of Facism. As insightful as the discussion of the war, its causes and the social aspect of the conflict, I think that his final chapters on peace and aftermath are truly revealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Done but Boring","review":"Stevenson's analysis felt too dry for my taste.

Why are there only classical illusions and not the profoundity of the wealth of knowledge for which Mr. Grant is widely known? Surely it was not Mr. Hyatts fault for such a poor plot, dullness of characters, and ineffective use of sentax. The first two chapters are good and the conclusion is one that every Christian should take to heart, but having read other books by the authors I know they could have done far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST","review":"The worst book I've ever read. The writing is poor. The plot is sophomoric. The book is pedantic, small-minded dribble, pseudo-profundo babble, a tour de force of mindless musings and Christian-right blather. I found particularly absurd the diatribe in which Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini are, combined, less evil than Margaret Sanger.This book is so bad that it is funny, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a tearful and side-splitting laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage! Read the original Y2K novel instead.","review":"I can't put into words how awful this book is. It goes to show that a nonfiction writer has a terrible time tackling fiction. This story is really just Hyatt's \\"The Millennium Bug\\" retold with a few fictional character names. I'm a techie guy and even I was bored stiff with the lengthy explanations of Y2K's intricacies. Give me a break. If you want lengthy explanations, read Y2K nonfiction. If you want a great story with a believable plot, read \\"Y2K: It's Already Too Late.\\" It's the original novel on this topic and it's a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible book! Don't waste your money","review":"Michael Hyatt wrote a very good nonfiction book about y2k. I bought this book thinking it would be good, too. Wrong! It was boring, predictable, and the entire plot fits on the back of the book. (In fact, that's what they did) This book doesn't even deserve 1 star. This was the WORST book I have ever read, and I like most books I read. DON'T get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature, pseudo-moralizing","review":"The authors have used Y2K to stuff their pseudo-moralizing Christian religious views down the readers' throats. All philosophies other than Christian are discarded as \\"hoaxes\\" and \\"junk\\". A very conceited, typically Christian view indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This JUNK at all costs!","review":"This is a perfectly awful book. The writing is horrendous. To say the plot is weak is to be kind. It appears that the author thought Y2K would be an excellent opportunity to get on his soapbox and shove his shallow, worthless philosphy down the reader's throat. I feel suckered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative--As good fiction should be","review":"It is interesting that the reviews of this remarkable book are entirely polarized--they are either glowing or glowering. That indicates that this is a provocative work of fiction. And indeed it is. It will make you think, which apparently some folks are loathe to do.

I highly commend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naive religious diatribe with few technical insights","review":"This is a poorly written, shallow, naive, moralistic diatribe on a serious technical and cultural issue, contrived by two right-wing religious fundamentalists who dare to compare Margaret Sanger to Adolph Hitler and Josef Stalin.

This set showcases a wide variety of styles including western swing which has been missing from recent George albums(finally we have Take me back to Tulsa on cd).

After cutting out every commercial skin product I use, cosmetics, even sun-screen, to no effect, I tried going off the lotion tissues (yes, I know, it should have been obvious given the location of the rash...), and within a week the rash cleared up. I gave them a second chance, and the rash came right back. I have sensitive skin, and for lots of people these will be a great product, but there are a lot of chemicals in these tissues, and for me they caused a pretty nasty little problem.

My reasoning was that I have a very nice four-color laser printer and figured maybe the alignment issues mentioned in other reviews were due to misaligned heads or cheaper printers with lazy feeders. Wrong. I have the same issues with alignment. One page will print fine and the next will not, this is really due to the fact that even off-set presses have alignment issues but are corrected in the trimming. Trying to print within such exacting parameters on every page just doesnt work well at all for single sheet fed printers.

There's very little plot and after awhile every page seems like the one before it. Sure, there's the occasional funny part, but overall this book is not worth reading.

I was hoping a political satire would make the endless wait endurable. I even thought the concept of the Al Franken's political career, though not unique (Allen Sherman wrote this 20 years ago) was worth a read. Admittedly I found the first 100 pages a bit witty but the humor only lasted for so long. Noting this kind of sophmoric humor can easily be found on thousand of Internet sites. I can only compare it to taking a 10 minute comedy skit and stretching it out for two and half hours. If you get great enjoyment from Beavis and Butthead sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism. This is the satire for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Franken has a hilarious go at the political process","review":"In this book, we see Franken not as his usual politically-outspoken self but rather as another persona - a ridiculous candidate running for president, and winning in what turns out to be one of the most disasterous 100 first (and only) days of any presidency. Those who disagree with Franken's politics will appreciate the book for making fun of all ends of the spectrum in a way that generally sends up the ridiculous nature of a presidential election. Those who agree with Franken may be disappointed that he mocked everyone. However, reading the book with an open mind will probably cause a great deal of mirth and enjoyment.The book contains a bunch of sources of Franken's fictional presidency (including fictional press clippings and doctored photos). Even though the second half of the book is not nearly as funny as the first, overall, still a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads so quickly, it's like an audiobook!","review":"Al Franken has a knack for making his books read themselves for you. With a robust blend of lowbrow humor and Harvard-esque political jabs, one cannot help but wonder if Franken shouldn't be the 44th president of the USA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest books I've read!","review":"Al Franken is a humor god. This book is in different forms, but the funniest part takes the part of a diary in which he describes daily ocurrences while on the campaign trail for the New Hampshire primary.

For Democrats, Republicans, everyone","review":"I listened to this on cassette, somewhat abridged, read by the author,with some other voices and some sound effects. The Gore imitation is pretty good.Good satire. Franken's other political books struck me as more hate than humor.This one can even be enjoyed by Republicans. Political junkies will probablylike it more than most others, but anyone that has been bothered by the behaviorof politicians can get some laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the funny Al Franken go???","review":"I was a great fan of Al Franken during his SNL days. I bought this book hoping for some flashes of that comic genius, however, it's not to be found in this effort. The ATM fee angle gets real tired and the whole work lacks the subtle wit that we were treated to in his glory days. Maybe his work on Newsline should have been a clue, but I recommend skipping this one. My advice: save your money and watch SNL reruns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost funny.","review":"An extended joke that fails to sustain. The idea is funny enough, if you buy the idea of Franken as a celebrity, but he doesn't have enough to sustain much more than a five minute comedy routine. Some people find Franken terribly witty. Then again, some people find Howard Stern to be an brilliant talent. Who can explain why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and imporant book by (hopefully) Senator Franken","review":"One of the funniest books I have ever read. Makes you think as well as giggle. And the fact that Franken actually wanted a political career while writing this amazing work makes for a better story. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Needs an Editor","review":"There's a nugget of a good book here. Franken can be very funny, and there's lots of material in a fake Presidental memoir. But the few good bits--character sketches, amusing mishaps--are buried in the format. Press releases, a Time cover story, diary entries; it all gets overwhelming and repetitive. Had this been written as a straight memoir, it might have been delightful, but the jokey format brings it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"For anyone used to Al Franken's sense of humor, this is a great book. Written from the sense of Mr. Franken actually running for the White House, it follows him through the primaries, general election and beyond. Although it can be bizarre at times (Mr. Franken has that habit) it also provides some interesting insights into the great marathon to the presidency. If you are a serious conservative or die-hard republican you will probably find this book hard to read at best and offensive at worst. For all others, this books' irreverant tone is enjoyable. This is very good political satire, as long as you are not the target."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruel and malicious, pointless mockery! I am outraged!!","review":"As a person who suffers from a condition of unusually long nose hairs, I have been mortified by the sustained attack upon me and my condition from page one until the very end, which I haven't read yet (having fallen asleep for reasons unknown). I was given this book as a gift, a cruel, cruel gift. Mr Franken, do you realize the idea of transforming someone like me, with long unsightly nose hairs, into someone like you, with glasses and nice shirts, is not appealing!!! I would not vote for you!! Neither will my nose hairs!! And we are registered, too, Mr. Franken. This book is about running for the presidency, supposedly, though it is in fact about mocking victims of circumstance, and the victims of victims of circumstance. (For the record, I have not hurt many people with my nose hairs). That said, every word about Brokaw and Brinkley is laugh-out-loud wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for insiders, dull and obnoxious for others","review":"This would be the LAST place I would send someone to get a taste of Al Franken. The first half of the book makes the same jokes over and over and over and over again, and throughout, you really need to know a lot of Washington inside stuff to get the jokes. In some ways a sharp expose of our political and media system, and in other ways far, far, far too long with the general feel of a train wreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny for those who know about CFS.","review":"He has chosen to ridicule those who have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and for those who are afflicted with this disease it is NOT funny. Hey, I lost my job -- isn't that a scream? And I had to spend all my savings to survive -- I'm laughing so hard the tears are running down my face! And I had to apply for food stamps -- isn't that just the funniest thing you ever heard? This book is a disgusting abuse of real people who are suffering from a very real disease and who do not need to be ridiculed by this unfeeling moron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slap-dash Slapstick","review":"Franken's book is sophomoric, boorish, sloppy, disorganized, and pointless. While he makes a very few insightful points about politics, the majority of the \\"jokes\\" are stale, played-out riffs on violence, drinking/drugs, and hookers. In light of the turbulent aftermath of the 2000 election, Franken's blithe cracks about that race come across as particularly un-humorous. One of Franken's previous works, \\"I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People like Me!: Daily Affirmations by Stuart Smalley,\\" is a great piece of humor writing which manages to be both funny and insightful. \\"Why not me?\\" is neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to think Al was funny...","review":"I've always found Al Frankin to be funny until he decided to make fun of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (now known as Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome). This disabling disease with the horribly inadequate name afflicted hundreds of thousands of people including myself. It disgusts me that he finds my physical (not mental!!) suffering to be comical material."},{"rating":"1","title":"why not me?","review":"A huge disappointment! Al Franken's zenith was on Saturday Night Live just by saying \\"Hi, I'm Al Franken\\". It's been mostly downhill since. Why not me really implies an inability to grasp political/comical thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's Why Not:","review":"I don't know how Al Franken (whose work I usually love) stayed awake to write this. \\"Tedious\\" is the most polite word I can use to describe the diary-of-a-candidate format he's chosen this time. Typical Franken hilarity in spots...but good luck keeping your eyes open long enough to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the humor, stupid.","review":"Something is funny the first time. The second time, it loses some. By the 200th time, it's mind-numbing. Al Franken tries to make his brother's drinking, Al's frolicing with prostitues, and ATM fees funny. After twenty pages of this, it becomes mind-numbing. The only thing worse than reading about the campaign is reading about the 100 days of the Franken presidency. Luckily, his presidency is short; unfortunately, the book is about 270 pages too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some things still pertinent","review":"This novel of political satire by now Senator Al Franken was published in 1999. Looking back from 10 years later, it is interesting to see how things turned out. There are some politcal positions of the \\"fictional\\" candidate that still apply and could be quoted, perhaps showing some prescience, such as \\"...America is the world's only remaining superpower, and with that comes some responsibility. We have to remember that the world is still a very dangerous place. Even a single war is one war too many, but we have to be prepared to fight on two fronts...\\"It is not necessarily a great book, but might offer a little insight into the thinking of a person who is now a senator, intermixed with the fictional satirical tale of the rise and fall of a president. Senator Franken is obviously more than just a comedian/writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al Franken does it again!","review":"Once again, the brilliance that is Al Franken has created a book even more hilarious and entertaining than his last. This time, Franken gives us a fictional, yet totally politically savy account of the \\"Franken presidency.\\" I highly reccomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting piece of fiction.","review":"Although it's not the scathing piece of cynosure that was Franken's last book, it's decent. Franken providing his semi-raison-d\`etre for the executive office. Anyone of these Republican whores (or liberal, like Franken) need to be slapped across their collective faces with a dose of reality. For example; how did free trade conseqently benefit our once sovereign country? Thanks GOP! Actually I'd like to thank both these crooked parties for slapping down a bunch of junk laws that are completely out of touch with reality. (What am I saying? The American people deserve this.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stand Al Franken but...","review":"I read this book and laughed my A$% off. I am a libertarian and disagree with nearly everything he says except ATM fees but I'll admit this was a funny book. I did feel that the resolution and ending was extremely rushed but otherwise very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the bad reviews and get a copy! This CD is FUNNY!","review":"This books is FUNNY.If you HATE Al Franken you'll love this book. No other character in the book is as despicable as Al. He runs a prostitution ring, cheats on his wife, is insanely stupid, condones violence against political opponents, takes insane amounts of drugs, turns psychotic and is probably the least moral character in modern fiction.And it's FUNNY.If you love AL you will hopefully get that it's all a joke. If not, you may not actually AL, you might just think you do.The book on tape (or CD) will make you laugh often and heartilty.-Tom"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looking; I really liked the fake Newsweek.","review":"Silly writing; I laughed a little.

Franken's delivery and writing are a joy to which to listen. While I don't agree with Franken's politics, I take my hat off to his even handed attack on both parties and politics in general. This is the best work of audiobook political humor since Parliament of Whores by P. J. O'Rourke."},{"rating":"1","title":"uneducated","review":"Anyone who states (and jokes) that chronic fatigue syndrome is depression is uneducated. I guess he knows more than the CDC.

My only wish is that you keep it coming. You have shown me how pathetic some of Rush's and his dittoheads word's are. Your latest book has shown me by all means why aren't you president.

Of the 21 chapters only 4 relate to the exam. My biggest complaint is the practise test which specifically excludes the 4 chapters in question even though they are shown on the cover illustration.

But the great thing about this collection from the UK, is it's inclusion of Why, We Have No Secrets (a classic!), and Angel From Montgomery, three overlooked gems that are often forgotten. Something else great about this collection is that the songs are straight from the LP's, not the radio edits, so you have the whole songs. At the same time, being from the LP's, they are not remastered, unlike Reflections, which is remastered. But another way to look at that, is Reflections uses the radio edits. Both collections have their pros and cons, but each are important. If your planning on buying only one Carly Simon CD, you could easly go either way. Or just do both! Being a huge Carly fan, that's what I did! And check out that cover!

So this import, with the exception of its price tag, was a welcome sight. Warning: it drops \\"Attitude Dancing\\" (but so does the box set) and \\"Night Owl\\" from \\"Best Of\\", but it has all the Arista hits through 1995's \\"Angel From Montgomery\\". Also included is 1982's \\"Why\\", a hit in England and in dance clubs but ignored by U.S. radio. The only other big hit missing I can think of is 1980's \\"Jesse\\", which is available on one of Rhino's \\"Radio Daze\\" CDs. Sound quality is fine.

I enjoy the CD Mostly because when I was younger I liked Carly Simon. That makes me Bias to begin with. However the Carly Simon box set sells for ... and it includes all of her songs. It's a better value for the money. You may want to consider this before buying. However if you do purchase this CD you'll enjoy the music. Very high quality.

I like something that can fit into the briefcase, unlike the Covey and Daytimers. The real benefit to me is there is a two page view for each day. The left side is to schedule, a to-do list and a phone log, and the right side is a whole page for notes. Since I need to document the substance of conversations with each client, this saves going to the client file to make notes on short conversations. Any meeting notes can usually be summarized as well. There is enough space to note mileage and expenses. The major downside to the planner is the necessary comprimise of having only 100 days covered by the 200 pages. I figure if I don't enter weekend days, I will be able to get by on two of these in a calandar year. Also, the contact directory list in the back is unlettered, and will need to be duplicated once the planner is full and a new one acquired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I wish it would have made it clear that there are not 200 pages of actual daily planning.

There is an enormous amount of superfluous material, bringing this book to 800+ pages for a \\"lightweight\\" protocol and requiring constant filtering on the part of the reader.

And then for the audio they added the music from Tangerine Dreams 1975 album \\"Ricochet\\" which in itself was a collage of various live recordings and some studio overdubs.Had I known what this DVD actually was before purchasing it I probably would not have bought it, at least at the full list price. Since I had no idea and expected at least a proper concert video from my favorite period in this bands long history I feel more then a bit ripped off.

I got it at Tower Records in Tokyo, for about 3500 JPY (just about everything is \\"rip off\\" priced as such), which is pricey at best. Then, lo and behold, it's not a live performance, the music doesn't go with the live footage, and it's not really a complete performance of ANYTHING. Dammit, I am pissed off about it. This Tony Palmer guy should be whipped for ripping off TD fans. What I want to know is this: what happened to the live performance that this is supposedly based on? Does the musical performance even exist? (Of course, it would be great if it did, even released as a CD like Soundmill Navigator.) Damned disappointing. Impulsive buy, risky at best.

I know it's a product from Japan...but that had the nutritional info in english on a sticker that was placed on the package so I was surprised that the directions didn't get the same thing.

Perhaps most interesting is the historical parallel he draws between the difficult decisions the Clinton and Bush II administrations faced prior to 9-11 and those faced by the Johnson and Nixon administrations. The author does a tremendous job of reinforcing that terrorism and U.S. efforts to combat it are nothing new, and that policymakers often find themselves faced with the same difficult decisions and repeating the same mistakes as their predecessors.

It wins a \\"5\\" on timeliness, \\"4s\\" on content and writing, down-graded mainly because of puny policy recommendations. It was especially valuable to me in pointing out how vulnerable we are during the periodic interregums, as new Presidents and their minions attempt to put their own stamps on government. It was more valuable pointing out the difficulties successive Presidents and their staffs faced in trying to get authority to conduct the kinds of operations that seem to be necessary to fight terrorist acts. The tension between freedom from government scrutiny and the freedom from terrorism posed insurmountable obstacles before 2001.

The white piece in the top of the neck was customized by myself for it and works nice. The sound of this strings is quite that metallic sound that always have mr Harris, and they are designed for that kind of music. Tapping with this strings is really hard.

The towels leave behind lint when cleaning glass and mirrors. I called the company to complain that they stick to microwave food. For example, the pre-made breakfast sandwiches in the grocery refrigerated section direct to wrap the sandwich in a paper towel and microwave for 45 seconds. The towel will adhere to the sandwich leaving you to pick stuck paper off your food. At times, removing it immediately works, but not always.

They lack all the subtle tones that are in real colognes. So they simply smell like one thing. I own Ferrari Black and Ferrari Red. Ferrari Black is definitely the winner of the two, but that is not saying much.Do not buy these colognes. You are better off just slapping on some aftershave or using some really strong shampoo or bodywash. If you like smelling like you bought some little kid cologne, go ahead and use this. Otherwise you are better off with a designer brand. No one is going to smell it and say \\"Ah you smell like Ferrari!

This will probably show up in future books and add a lot of fun to the series as well. The characters are believable, though, I would have done differently in some situations. The plot is classic Animorphs with, as I said, a new twist. And, though Animorphs seem to be in the league of Goosebumps and Babysitters, they provide a good story filled with action, suspence, humor and sometimes a little romance. A good buy.

This book has the template of this series' earlier entries - the weaving of plots past and present, a cast of characters tied together in a murder investigation and Gemma and Duncan balancing police work with their personal relationship and children. What is blatantly absent is a gripping story line. There are love triangles aplenty, more than enough information for this reader on the distillery industry and plenty of conversations about food but the murder mystery never gains any traction.

The bad white people are vicious, venal, murderous and stupid. Like most dull novels, there is also a contrivance which makes our heroes almost invulnerable.I was initially attracted to this novel because it takes place in 1792 upstate New York, but other than there being a lot of trees and lakes, one never gets the sense of colonial America. At least, one never gets the sense of colonial America beyond what one has already learned from grade school texts.

'Tis a pity an unremitting political correctness distracts from the story.Any time a character who is a person of color is introduced to the story line, the reader can predict with close to 100% certainty they will be preternaturally wise, possess an altruistic streak to make Mother Teresa a piker by comparison or have motives as pure as Ivory soap.By the time I was halfway through the book, I found all the noble Native Americans and selfless blacks insufferably boring.

I thought that the characters were poorly developed and the story lines and characters that were interesting were glossed over in favor of the less interesting plotlines in this long road to nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Gabaldon fan that was sorely dissapointed!","review":"I can't believe all the hype about Donati's first book. Like so many other people, I only read it because of the comparisons reviewers have made to the simply amazing Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon (which I simply adore!). I never got the feeling that I could relate to the characters, the plot was sooooooooo incredibly unoriginal, and it lacked the extensive research and creativity that made Gabaldon's books such a great read. Don't read this book if you're expecting Gabaldon-style writing because you'll be in for a huge dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long, too flat, too boring","review":"After getting half-way through the book, I decided I'd go back to the reviews which prompted me to buy the book. I guess I should have read more than the 5 star reviews. When I read the 1 star and 2 star reviews, I realized that I wasn't alone in my opinion of the book. I say \\"amen\\" to all of those reviews. I won't add anything--they say it all. Except that I regret the hours that I spent reading and waiting for something to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a sequel!","review":"Sorry, I am just too skeptical, but this book is *not* a sequel to James Fenimore Cooper's novel. It's more a sequel to the movie of the same name which starred Daniel Day-Lewis and which depicted a completely different story from the novel. Donati invents a marriage between Hawkeye (whose name in the novel is Nathaniel \\"Natty\\" Bummpo--a.k.a. \\"La Longue Carabine\\" and \\"Hawkeye\\"--not Daniel Bonner...) and Cora Munro (who DIES in the novel...therefore could not be a mother to anyone!), and invents them a son as the hero for her tale. I suppose the book is OK in and of itself, but it shouldn't be billed as a sequel to Cooper. I'm not sure why she made use of Cooper at all--which is the same thing I always wondered about the Day-Lewis film. If you're going to depart substantially from an earlier author's work, why not depart completely?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff","review":"I read the sequel first and ran out to get this one. Hope she writes ten mmore!I hope nobody comes looking for me with a rifle when I say this, but I liked these books better than the Gabaldon stories. Time travel just isn't for me, I guess. But it was a good joke to run into the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"good effort, good descript.,poor plot, poor characterization","review":"Things I liked: 1. Description of nature, I felt as though I really were there. Those who appreciate these things will definitely appreciate this book. 2. The grits and determination it takes to even attempt a historical novel. Bravo to those who can do it. It keeps readers like me entertained. 3. The 20th century Elizabeth who rules the roost. WINK -not typical for those times, but it's only fiction.Things I didn't like: 1. The storyline (not terribly engaging) 2. The characters lacked depth and humanity. They ranged from stock characters \\"Julian\\" and \\"Richard\\" to near perfect protagonist \\"Nathaniel\\" and \\"Robbie\\" 3. The constant description of nature. Some of those description could have been better used in developing the characters, refining them, breathing life into them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, breath taking, passionate, realistic,engrossing,","review":"when i saw this book was recomended by diana gabaldon i knew it had to be at the very least passable. when i realized it was the continuation of last of the mohicans i could barely hand it over to the clerk to pay for it. but when i started to read it it was beyond my wildest expectations, dreams or fantacies!!! the first 200 pages are so passionate that i found breathing difficult. my \\"good sister\\" will curse me for saying this but into the wilderness was/is better than outlander! if anyone knows of any book that can tide me over until MS. donati publishes her next book i would appreciate the suggestion! if anyone knows where Ms. donati is signing her book let me KNOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great yarn","review":"I grew up on the Sacandaga River and this really took me back home.

Maybe it doesn't read like some other book (that seems to have got some folks here upset, but who cares). This lady has spent some time in the bush, that's clear. The kind of detail she's got in here you won't find in books. She's taken the Daniel Boone legend and done good things with it. Even the love story was kind of interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this novel!","review":"I was introduced to this book on audio tape thought Books-on-tape. I really like it. I did not know there was a connection to Last of the Mohigans or Pride and Prejudice. Now, I have to re-read the first novel. I liked the story and thought that it was interesting. I was not as thrilled with the sequel, Dawn on a Distant Shore, but bought it anyway. I am ordering the third novel through Amazon.com and am looking forward to reading it. These novels are worth a try if you like historical fiction and romance.

However, after reading Into the wilderness I've become in love with the history and landscape of America and would love to make a journey there. I hardly slept during the days I was reading the book, I couln't stop reading and am looking forward to the second part. Sara Donati has done a good job"},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm.....No","review":"I was so excited to read this series. I ordered the first two books in hardcover because I thought they were going to be keepers. Now I'm trying to figure out who I dislike enough to give these books to. I am only 200 pages into the first book, but I think I should cut me losses and stop torturing myself. I do not like any of the characters and at this point, I couldn't care less if the main charactes get together or just drop dead. I always finish books. It is almost a compulsive thing with me that I have to finish a story, but this is one of the rare occasions where I am going to have to make an exception and just call it quits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good saga","review":"Similiar to Diana Galbadon, but not quiet in her unique league, Into the Wilderness was an enjoyable read. I did find that the first third of the book was a bit slow; then suddenly the story took off, constant action etc. It seemed like two different authors. I enjoyed the read and characters and recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Gabaldon? Good.","review":"What in the heck is with all this whining about this not being a Gabaldon novel? She writes time travel. This is historical adventure, and well done historical adventure. I suppose you'll give Will Shakespeare one star because he's not Gabaldon either. I for one am looking forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT CAN'T COMPARE TO OUTLANDER","review":"I FOUND IT A BORING READ, AND ACTUALLY RETURNED IT WHEN I HAD READ ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PAGES.

THIS WAS HER FIRST HISTORCAL AND VERY WELL WRITTEN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it end","review":"It just goes on and on. The more I read the more I disliked it. Something is missing. It should be exciting, but even during tense situations, it was dull. I guess this book is for the real fans. I actually gave up about half way through which is rare for me. Oh well on to the next book. Of course it's personal, some I like and some not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the hype","review":"I was disappointed with this book. It was so highly praised, especially by so many Outlander fans. I was constantly wanting more character development and a less predictable plot. It is nothing more than a romance novel. I wanted more of the history, more character depth and therefore it fell flat for me. Towards the end I found myself skipping quickly through the pages because I wanted something profound to happen, which never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much","review":"there were way too much stretched complications. i wasn't able to take this book to heart. it was just not worth reading or spending my time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like \\"formulaic\\" romance, this one's for you!","review":"I was excited to read this book but my anticipation soon turned to disappointment. Instead of the historical fiction I was expecting, this novel turned out to be a predictable, formulaic romance novel with few surprises. The characters were typical as were the conflicts. Don't waste your time or money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a disappointment.","review":"I was fooled from the beginning! The inticing cover and the flap \\"blurb\\" led me to believe this would historical fiction. In fact, this books is nothing more than a thinly disguised \\"bodice ripper\\". I think the idea of the book had potential, but it never came close to what it could have been. Instead, it became a book about how and when the main character would have sex! I would not recommend this book to anyone who might be looking for plot or developed characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the most part","review":"I love to read historical books from this time period. I fell in love with Nathaniel. We need more men like him. I enjoyed every page until the last few charters. It seems to be setting up the next book and was drug out somewhat. All in all I am waiting for her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, heart-stopping suspense, laughter and tears.","review":"I never thought I would love an author's writing more than D. Gabaldon, but I was wrong. The plot weaves character after character into an intricate, well-balanced story that makes you feel involved. The ending dropped off too soon, but I'll just buy the next one. Intelligent and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"This One's a Keeper!","review":"There are books you buy, you read, and then give away, or sell because you just don't feel a connection. WELL THIS ONE ISN'T ONE OF THOSE! Into the Wilderness is a keeper! You are immediately immersed in the lives of the characters. You come to care about them as if they were old friends. I've read this book twice, and am planning on reading again. Can't wait for the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Wilderness","review":"I happened to come across this book one day while in the book store and must say that it one of the best finds I have ever made. I loved the story and the characters. I havent read all the books in the series yet but have bought them all. I loved the connection the author made to Claire Fraser from Outlander, in the book. This is a excellent series to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and Emotional Journey of Epic Proportions","review":"I couldn't get enough of Ms. Donati's Romantic Advenure. I bought this as it was recommeded for readers who loved the Outlander series and I was not disappointed. I am now halfway through the series and already mourning it's end. These books are rich with adventure, spiritual growth, community and romance. Very worthy of all the praise. You really feel the period and grow so close to the Bonner family that they come to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first book in a series!","review":"Reminds me of Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series but Donati has her own way of writing and is quite good. Didn't put the books down until I finished the whole series. Very good read for people that like historical fiction with a little romance, action, humor,etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed!","review":"It really is a great read, though it could had been 200 pages shorter it still a fantastic story. But what I liked especially was the the special care Donati took to write the surroundings in the book with such realism and being from New York it was even more fun to read a book based in New York! I also loved the way she wrote Nathaniel and Elizabeth as a couple, as real as you can get in what happens between couples sometimes even loving ones! They argue, they fight and they do say things to each other that every couple goes through in the real world, but overcome it. I'm tired of reading books that have couples so \\"hoochie-koochie\\" with each other that it becomes unrealistic. Their relationship was a breath of fresh air and real! I'm looking forward to the sequel very soon! Bravo, Sara Donati!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written copy cat!!","review":"I was fooled into reading this book by reviews that the \\"Into the Wilderness\\" series is like Diana Gabaldon's books... this is not true! I'm not even 100 pages in and I'm sorely disappointed. So far,scene for scene, she is COPYING J.F. Cooper, whom she thanks (in the author's notes) for \\"inspiration\\". ...and the truly disappointing part about all of this, is that she ruins all of Cooper's characters (many of which she never even bothered to change names for), making them flat and predictable-If you would like a nice series of books to read, I recommend the original Cooper series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable!","review":"This was a great romance/historical fiction book. Good summer read! I am not generally a fan of books that are not written in first-person style but Donati pulled it off. I'm looking forwards to the other books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book...","review":"I never read Outlander (it's on the TBR pile) so I don't care about the appearance of Clare in the book.This was a good historical, covering many years and many people. It was easy to follow because of the list of characters at the beginning of the book though, so don't be intimidated by the number of pages.The story centers around the son of Hawkeye from The Last of the Mohicans movie. (BTW, it does help to have seen that movie before you start to read). It is all about his finding love and keeping his land.Very enjoyable read and I look forward to reading the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent story - but not a traditional 'romance novel'","review":"I really love this book and I do think the whole series is likely to appeal to those who love the Outlander books. This is the book most frequently prescribed for Outlander lovers, so I have to say I was a little bit surprised that it was based in the American wilderness. So few historical romances hail from this time and place. It's a long book, so plan to spend some time. If you enjoy well developed characters and storylines and aren't in it for the smut (because there's none), this will be a great romance for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything it promises, and more!","review":"As an avid fan of Diana Gabaldon, and one who is breathlessly awaiting her new novel, I found INTO THE WILDERNESS by Sara Donati everything it promised to be. There was, indeed, a mention of several of my favorite characters, and that wasn't the only reason I would offer to read this book. If you are as fond of historical fiction as I am, this is a must read. I found out that I didn't need to be totally familiar with Hawkeye and his family, because Miss Donati did a great job of picking up where THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS left off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift for Gabaldon fans!!","review":"Already a huge fan of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series? Then Sara Donati's into the wilderness is a perfect fit for you! I love historical romances and this, like Gabaldon's series is a cut above the rest! Such well drawn characters (that you feel like you've known forever) and excellent fast paced plot makes you feel like you are watching a an epic movie- but it's even better because it lasts longer and you can cast your own actors on your imagination! One of my favourite books ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Music was very boring. The so-called \\"concertos\\" did not meet my expectaions as a classical trained musician.

I also did not care for any of the characters or anything that happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book on model R/C airplanes","review":"I do not recommend this book to anyone who is trying to learn to build or fly R/C airplanes. While the information on the basics of flying is pretty good, but all of the equipment shown is very dated, and the information on available equipment isn't very good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"The book is like a general introduction to Model Airplanes.

DO NOT waste your money on this book unless you are studying extremely high level calculus. For those of you who only deal with practical and applicable calculus, this book is not for you. Life is not about theory and proofs, it is about being able to use what you know. If you share my theory then please don't support this man by buying his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A necessity for all editors","review":"Every copy editor (and many who think they're copy editors) should own and faithfully read and reference this book. \\"Lapsing into a Comma\\" has the same wit and humor previously found on Walsh's Web site The Slot, and keeps things in a clear and concise fashion that anyone (and by that I mean non-grammar people like myself) can understand. The book answers several questions the AP Stylebook just doesn't cover, and clarifies several things the stylebook does cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderately informative, modestly funny","review":"Walsh makes many fine points about style in writing, particularly writing for a newspaper. But his smartypants humor wears thin very quickly. He seems to think he's really cute - wink, wink, nudge, nudge - when, to this reader, he's simply tiresome. In his subtitle he calls himself a \\"curmudgeon,\\" but I suspect he really is a frustrated stand-up comedian.I don't know who his audience is. Surely this book is not to be used for reference: imagine having to read the same jokes over and over. And it's also not for the 'grammar for dummies' crowd: it's generally too sophisticated for them.If I were his editor I'd suggest a rewrite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strunk and White and Walsh","review":"At last, a worthy successor to Strunk and White! No, I have not abandoned my loyalty to those old masters whose THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE retains its utility and authority after 40 years (however badly I may apply their lessons in practice), but we were sorely in need of an update. Language is alive and usage shifts. The basics may endure for years or decades, perhaps very occasionally for centuries, but change is the only constant. Bill Walsh here offers an invaluable update. From advice on how to use common sense and a dictionary, to punctuation, quotations, headlines and the new electronic media, Walsh pulls together the lessons of 19 years of editing and offers useful, witty and thoroughly rational guidance on usage and writing. A winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"I chose this book from a list of recommended writing sources listed on \\"Daily Writing Tips\\" and gave it to a friend who has a fledgling magazine titles \\"Legacy Quarterly.\\" He was very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Resource","review":"This book is helpful for people who write, proof, and edit.

Good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible scans!","review":"Like one of the other reviewers, I bought the Canon after a Visioneer USB scanner failed to work with my laptop. The Canon was easy to set up, and it does look great, but the scans are terrible. They have a reddish hue and are very blurry. Forty-five minutes with tech support did not lead to a resolution. I'm hoping to cut my losses and send it back. I've heard of several reports of incompatibility with Win98 but in my case this problem was not readily correctable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scanner despite a few problems!","review":"All in all, I'm happy with how this scanner works. Unfortunately, the set up in Windows 98 was not as easy as I expected. My first scan came out with an extremely red tint. I called Canon about this problem and the first person I spoke with barely stayed on the phone for two minutes and his solution did not work, forcing me to call again. The second person suggested calling the software manufacturer (Adobe), which I did to no avail, they wouldn't help unless I paid $2 per minute. So, I called Canon again and spoke with someone who knew what they were talking about, and the problem was solved in about five minutes. So, if you purchase this product don't be surprised if it takes more time than you anticipated. It still is a good price and worth a little aggravation. The scans come out great, and I find the scanning takes relatively little time. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hardware, software has flaws","review":"This is a pretty nice scanner, it's main advantage is its small size. I found that there was a problem with Win98 where the ScanGear driver could not communicate with EZPhoto, causing Adobe PhotoDeluxe to freeze. For help with this go to adobe's website support page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Hardware, Lousy Software","review":"I purchased this scanner for its small size and its reportedly acceptable scan quality. After installation, I could not scan into the included Adobe PhotoDeluxe 2.0 on my Windows 98 system, although I could scan into other applications and import the photo into PD2 if necessary. I later installed PD3.0, with disastrous results--scans into all of my image editing programs are now grossly discolored. Now entering round 2 of time consuming, annoying communications with Canon tech support. If you do not have many hours to spend on such nonsense, I do NOT recommend this scanner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scanner for the right price!","review":"I've been looking for a scanner that would fit my small work space. This scanner is sleek and has awesome scanning capabilities. You can scan up 1200dpi. Very easy to configure and setup. The only negative is it scans very slow for higher dpi scans. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner scanner","review":"Was somewhat more difficult to set up than I anticipated. I had a few problems configuring it with Windows 98. Once setup was complete, scanner is easy to use and a great space saver. High res scans are slow, but all scans are clear and colorful.

Woof!","review":"What a dog. It is difficult to become engrossed in a book where there are about 10 major characters that are all badly underwritten. The plot, regarding a mind-control ray, had some promise, but the author didn't bother to take any twists along the way to the obvious conclusion. The personal stories - troubled marriages, career issues, child raising were uncompelling. Maybe I'm a stickler, but I expect more from my airport-bought, paperback, ghostwritten, serial novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Grasp!","review":"Once again a Tom Clancy book has bottomed out. The book had trouble getting from A to Z. The computer insanity business had a nearly good concept but it even failed to take hold. The idea of a child throwing a boomerang has no place in an adventure book. The villains were indeed evil but they failed to come through and make this a good book. I just had trouble taking this book very seriously. The plot,the characters, failed to get this action off the ground. I wish Tom Clancy would stopusing ghost writers. They are starting to ruin his good name.Come on Tom, write one yourself next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"fragmental story line","review":"I think that the authors tried very hard to rush out this book. Many details and sections are not connected. For example, it talks about Tyrone is good at hacking computer codes and a good friend of Jay (a computer guru), but that is it! There is no follow up in the story. My wild guess is that, Mr. Clancy and Mr. Pieczenik wrote each of their own sections and later on tried to piece them together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage Ending","review":"This is a typical Net Force novel, with developmment of the characters of Alex and Toni. They finally get together at the end, but the ending is so out of character for Toni. For conservative men over 50, it will satisfy. For everybody else, it will frustrate. I never thought I'd say it, but it's not worth your time. The neat VR internet stuff is minimal, and the lessons are ones that were already learned many times before. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to be negative . . . but","review":"As a recording, this is really pretty awful, and I am a fan of all kinds of musical theater, be it a live recording, studio, whatever; but be warned, this recording is not worth the price being charged. It sounds like someone in the audience made a bootleg recording of the show and, for some reason, a record label decided to distribute it and package it to look like a proffesional recording. You can hear shuffling on the stage (or maybe it's just the guy who recorded it moving), the voices are nearly inaudible and echo as though back round noise to the orchestration. I'm sure the show is quite good and the music (from what i can hear) seems to be quite nice - the one star is strictly a reflection on a horrible horrible recording with awful sound quality that costs more than most double compact discs you're likely to come across."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"The chopsticks came with a sticky label, removing which also removed some lacquer around the middle.

I just don't think anyone should spend several hundred dollars for something that must be replaced every 2 or 3 years. I'm willing to spend more just need to find something much better. I use mine 5 or 6 times every day. Tea drinkers in the house as well as using for cooking. Checking on Rheem my husband says they are very respected and a 2.5 gallon tankless for under the kitchen sink has a 10 year warranty. Might get that one but still checking.Update As I said I was 2 months outside my warrany. After reading the reviews I called. They are sending me a replacement at no charge and a 25 dollar gift card. Woohoo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement Tank","review":"This one now seems quieter then the model it replaced. I hope the tank lasts longer then the previous tank.

However, the knob was difficult to turn if my hands were slippery in any way and my husband couldn't use it with his reduced hand strength. Moreover, it leaked within three years. I did not contact the company until after I replaced it and at the handyman's suggestion, I emailed them. Of course they would have nothing to do with it now that it was removed from the sink. Our handyman took it apart and ascertained that there was a design flaw - the hot water goes through a plastic piece in the bottom which melted over time. When I contacted Emerson customer service about this, they ignored me. I have written to someone higher up. We will see what she says."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!

This unit ruined my cabinet and, of course, the company takes no responsibility for repairing it yet they have been aware of this issue for how long? Way too long. Do not buy this product.

We will do just that next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails too soon; Good support","review":"I have three of these units, one in each sink, and have had them for several years.It's a good product, but fails far too quickly. If your's is more than two years old, put a bowl under it and watch for leaks periodically. Otherwise you will eventually find everything in the area soaked when the tank fails.Two of these bought only a few years ago have now both failed. Calling the support phone number, the company volunteered to send me a replacement tank even though out of warranty (based on s/n manufacturing date). That's nice customer support. Just wish the unit would last longer.Other reviews mention product improvements; I hope these result in longer service life for this otherwise nice product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works reasonably well though I didn't find it to be very hot and it breaks after about 2-2.5 years","review":"I'm on my third. It works well but be prepared to replace it after a couple of years. It's pricey and is sold on the basis of durability, so that is a surprising to me. My advice is to buy it with a credit card that extends the one-year warranty to two, so you'll at least be covered if it dies un under two years.

But IMHO InSinkErator' s heaters are junk. They simply don't last more than a few months beyond the end of their warranty, and when they fail they drench the inside of your cabinets.On a positive note, they have simplified connection so that you can replace a unit in less than a 5 minute job. But then, you get lots of practice replacing leaking units if you buy this product!To other plumbing product suppliers, here is a great product opportunity.

InSinkErator used to have a good name for excellent products. Now they build junk.Read the above review about denial of warranty because a plumber didn't install a unit. Not only do they build JUNK, but they are THUGS with hidden terms and conditions for warranty. How hard is it to push three hoses on to the top and plug the unit in? I really don't need a $120 plumber to do it.Now I'm committed because I have a high-dollar hot and cold dispenser, else I would never buy another thing from this company.

Unfortunately I do not have my purchase receipt, and Insinkerator as much as said I am lying about how long I've had the unit. From other comments on here, it appears they are tightening up their policy of replacing leaking units.

I called Insinkerator to ask them what they could do for me. They are sending me a completely new unit-no questions asked-free of charge. Frankly I was surprised as they didn't really have to do this. I've read all of the negative reviews regarding their product and their customer service or lack there of but that was definitely not the case for me.

Plumbing suppliers that I contacted informed me that 7/16 polyethylene pipe is no longer manufactured. When I contacted the distributor I was told that this unit can only be used with InSinkErator faucets that are sold separate at a price of approximately $200.00.I really wanted this unit to work so I exployed numerous suppliers of polyethylene pipe and found that size 7/16\\" is non-existant.

The filters are changed every 6 months or so and can be readily purchased for a competitiveprice on Amazon. The tank price was a good buy as well on Amazon.

My old unit failed due to a leak. When I took it apart, I found a $0.50 piece of tubing split lengthwise. So I went to the local hardware store, and purchased a replacement tube. Now, I have a back-up unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poor product","review":"We agree with the many negative reviews of this particular product. After three years our unit sprang a leak and water dripped down to the unit below ours damaging a kitchen light fixture. As has been noted elsewhere, when we opened the unit we found that the piece of plastic tubing running out of the tank was blackened and brittle. My wife, who is very health conscious, who won't even drink cold water from a non BPA free plastic bottle, was horrified. We will try the silicon tubing fix that was mentioned in another review.In any case, even despite the criminally poor design, we would buy another unit because we're hooked on the convenience of instant hot water. In the future we'll keep a bucket under the heater and check periodically for leaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good poduct","review":"I heard so much bad stuff about this product that I was afraid to buy it.

Now, about 14 months after the second replacement, I tried to use it this morning and, what else, it started sputtering. No leak, yet, but I have placed the requisite bucket underneath to catch the eventual drip. Looks like now I will have to purchase another, or shop for an entire unit from another maker. Like everyone else, I have replaced this tank again and again because the plumbing matches up with the expensive faucet that goes with it. There should be a special place in a netherworld for a company that puts out a product like this. It would have to be a very big place, however, given that KitchenAid, Whirlpool and Kenmore would also be crowding in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not give it 0 stars: Too bad","review":"In the 3 years I've had it, it has been replaced 11 times (all free from insinkerator), good customer service but i really want a good product too. 8 of the 11 times i had dark rusty water come out of it and 3 of them the heating element stopped worked.

Now, after 15 months it has sprung a leak. The warranty is supposed to be 5 years on the \\"bronze tank\\"--time will tell whether InSinkErator stands behind the product. I hope that they do, and that they improve the issues that others have reported.However, between my own experience and that of many other people on the site, I cannot recommend this point-of-use kitchen water heater at all, due to the leak we're now experiencing.I DO however recommend these things in theory, as having the instant hot water for making coffee, tea or cleaning has been awesome.

This one is the 'new & improved\\" version. The tank is stainless, so hopefully it will outlast the two others. They each started leaking after 7 or 8 years. This one was very easy to install, however as my old spigot had copper lines i did need a kit from Insinkerator to convert over (the new unit uses slip on silicone hose instead of bolt on copper). Insinkerator sent me the adaptor kit for free. Their customer service was GREAT. Took less than 2 minutes to talk to a person, and this was a weekend NIGHT.The only drawback to this unit is that there is some noise from it as the water boils when heating. UPDATE 12/13/2011 After THREE years and ONE MONTH (almost exactly a month after the warranty expired) I came home to find the darned thing leaking! I will call Insinkerator in the morning to see if they will be flexible on their warranty!

Luckly the model (SST-FLTR) was still under waranty (3 years - also a joke)and Insinkerator is going to send another tank in 5-7 business days, but why is their product failing after two years? There wasn't one question or comment from their service person, probably because they get this compliant a lot. From an earlier post, it looks like they made have replaced the weakest link with a part that might last 3 years, i.e. the waranty period. After that, you are on your own.

No way to repair the unit with a new heating element either. I was forced to throw it away and buy a new one.Because of others reviews I purchased the Waste King unit and I am very impressed so far. All metal cover and heavier than the Insinkerator. The faucet is also of higher quality than the Insinkerator.

Her performance is all on the surface, no depth. I did not believe for a second she was a tortured woman from 100 years ago, all I saw was Streep the actress putting on air.

The title is very misleading. The title says that there are designs for \\"plus sizes,\\" but everything in this book is for 36 - 46. 46 doesn't even count as extra large people. How is that plus size? How is that ANY different from EVERY other knitting book out there that doesn't advertise \\"plus size\\" patterns? Most of the designs are boring, *old* and made with $300 dollars of yarn. Do yourself a favor and skip this book!Edit: Yes, I am aware that yarn substitutions are possible, but not all knitters are comfortable making substitutions. Knitters often want to make the sweater as pictured.Secondly, and the real issue, this book claims to be for plus sized women. While a *relaxed* size 46 may have a finished chest measurement of 50 inches or so, that doesn't mean that the sweater will fit or flatter a plus size woman. Since a 2x is roughly a 52-inch chest, this book has absolutely NOTHING for a woman 2x or higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Style for Real Women","review":"Here is a book with classic designs - not frumpy nor dated, just classic.

I haven't wanted to read in a long time, but this book makes me just hang out for more.To make a film of this story will not do it justice, The Day after Tommorow must be savoured by those who can be thrilled not by dancing light on a screen, but the dancing lights of the brain and imagination.peart@sprint.com.au (Deb Peart)"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't put the book down","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. Not even Clancy or Grisham could do such an intricate plot involving a Nazi conspiracy without making people question if it's legitimate. Folsom knew how to make the right twists at the right time. Hey- they could make a great movie out of this story! Really; Kevin Costner could be Osborne, Salma Hayek could play Vera, Tommy Lee Jones could be McVey, and Matthew Mcconnaughey would make a convincing Von Holden. With such a great plot, it could work"},{"rating":"2","title":"By far, one of the best books I've ever read.","review":"This book held your interest from the first chapter thru to the last.

I am anxious to read his next book"},{"rating":"1","title":"With a better editor, it could have been an excellent book.","review":"I can't quite agree with sparks@campfour from Salt Lake but he was pretty close. Folsom wrote a very complex, convoluted novel but he got some of his facts wrong, i.e., absolute zero is 459.69 deg. F., not something over 500 deg. F. In a couple of places, he had the hero remembering faces that he had seen at a distance at night in the rain. He had just too many people acting correctly on impulse, intuition or coincidence. I grant there are probably detectives as experienced and knowledgable as detective McVey but I dare say there are none who have his unfailing sense of what what his next action should be. Perhaps with a better editor, Folsom could turn in a good novel. I got through the book OK but I had some trouble with believablilty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most fascinating plot by a lousy author I've ever read","review":"I can't disagree with readers who found this plot full of big surprises and powerful twists; a \\"page-turner\\" indeed. However, Folsom is a lousy writer. Bad! Careless construction, cliche-ridden vocabulary, and one of my pet peeves -multiple characters miraculously use the same contrivances to refer to things none of them had ever encountered before. As much as I stayed curious about what might happen next, I winced over and over again at the author's clumsiness. Where was the editor?! If you love good writing, stay away; if you love wild, preposterous but entertaining plots, wait for the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly average","review":"Oh please! The superlatives are better wasted on pulp such as \\"Vanna Speaks.\\" What was all of the fuss about? I enjoyed it as a mindless romp thru spy-land but it was so full of incredibly unbelievable coincidences it was laughable. It was perfect beach trash; a book one can read while tanning, talking, and drinking beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was worth reading for me","review":"I read this book in 1994, and I will never forget it. From the very beginning it was gripping and entertaining. I wish somebody would make this book into a movie. I found it far more engrossing than other Europe-based thrillers like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"The Bourne Identity\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"Do not bother with this book - go and read something by Le Carre or even an early Tom Clancy novel...this book could have been written by a 10 year old. I had guessed the general theme of the ending about a quarter of the way into the book.Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, stilted style, over-done and absurd.","review":"If you are looking for good writing, or believable characters, or subtle insight into human motives, or even just a good, interesting yarn...then run as far from this book as you can! Apparently, Folsom thinks he knows something about psychology, science & technology, weapons, and police work. And perhaps he does know more about those things than he knows about writing...but he's very weak in all of them!This book deserves to be edited down to about 15 pages, and then burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start that cannot deliver","review":"The book starts out great. Action, adventure and what promises to be a great plot. However, when you create an enemy that becomes so incredibly powerful, you no longer have a plot that is remotely believable. I became increasingly dissatisfied with the book as the plot wore on. The first third of this book was the only part worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling sensation","review":"This is what I was left after an entire day reading the last 400 pages of this book. I am grateful I decided to read it on a weekend because the book was absolutely compelling and impossible to put down. A series of murders drive French and English police crazy. Seven deep frozen heads have been found and their identities remain unknown. Coincidentally an American doctor gets involved in an entangled mystery while trying to find the reason his father was murdered more than twenty years before. In the meantime an American detective is helping out and is convinced that the severed heads are the work of a serial killer. There also is this young and beautiful mistress of the future French prime minister who falls in love with someone else. All these people and many more find themselves connected and end up looking for answers while trying to survive a common but unknown enemy. Pure suspense in a breathtakingly story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinder","review":"It doesn't take long for the reader to become completely captivated by this story. I didn't give it 5 stars because the kindle version was difficult to read because it was so poorly edited."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have stopped reading....","review":"One of the greatest regrets of my life is that I finished reading this book once I saw where it was going. About halfway through it becomes pretty clear what the payoff is going to be. I will concede--the book was well written enough to make me think that there had to be more to it than that.....that it couldn't be as simple as I thought it was. But it is that simple. And obvious.I want those hours of my life back. Don't make the mistake I made! Save yourself! Don't read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling from middle to end!","review":"While this interesting book jumpstarted from the very beginning I found myself skipping chapters to find out what happened, I myself do not enjoy this type of delayed response. The subject matter, however, was particularly interesting and it also posessed a surprising ending which are both good traits in a thriller novel such as this one. Because I love useless information, this book has become one of my favorites. I now know enough about surgery in absolute zero and the German military police to last me a lifetime. It also provided much food for thought, the prospect of being able to combine someones head to a foreign body is frightening. All in all, a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First Half Good, Last Half . . . Yawn","review":"I was looking for a good substitute for Hagberg or Flannery when I picked this one up. And the accolades seemed to bless the novel. Makes me think there's payola alive in the review circles.I won't bore you with a synopsis, you've probably read one above. Suffice it to say the author uses one of the most tired plot twists since the end of the Second World War. The best parts of this novel are the segments where the slippery Neo-Nazi seduces an unsuspecting American clerk, most of which happens during the first half of the novel. The details of these encounters are scintilating indeed. But you can get that stuff from a Forum magazine if that's cup of tea. I felt cheated getting that from over 400 pages of what was supposed to be a \\"page-turning, gripping\\" thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and predictable","review":"I read the majority of this book on a flight to England.

But alas, I saw it through to the no-surprise end.I picked up this book based on reviews, which just goes to show that YOU SHOULD NOT BELIEVE ALL THAT YOU READ, including my words."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's (almost) good.","review":"This is the kind of book that makes me wonder: How did it get published? Why does anyone admire it? The premise is preposterous, the plot twists implausible, and the writing hackneyed. My favorite sentence (one of many): \\"The most he'd been able to gain from all that had happened was that his father, and any number of others, had been victims of a complex and macabre conspiracy involving a secret elitist Nazi group's experiment in low-temperature atomic surgery.\\" You can guess whose severed head finally shows up in the final paragraph!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a howler","review":"This book is bad-- it occupies a territory somewhere between bad Ludlum and The Destroyer novels. Many of the situations are ludicrous, and it should have won some sort of Bulwer-Lytton award for some of its writing-- the line about the truck driver performing a tracheotomy on the 70-year-old nun with a Swiss army knife had me on the floor convulsed with laughter, as did the final, wildly improbably line (which I'll let you discover for yourself). I even wrote to Bill Pronzini, saying that if he should ever write another Gun in Cheek book, this and The Pledge (see my review) should be prime candidates for inclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts Very Well, Deteriorates Quickly, Ends Dreadfully","review":"This book begins magnificently. The first few pages are very exciting, and mix action and mystery in a European setting. Some development follows as things slow down. As the book wears on, the plot becomes increasingly preposterous and ends abysmally.Having read all the way to the end once, I give this book \\"thumbs down\\", though I must admit that the beginning is of such caliber that I have re-read the start of this book more than once.It's a pity, though I believe the opening would prove excellent as a starting point for a writers' workshop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Read Half","review":"For a plot that has been used so many times you think it would have worked a bit better. The book started off well enough. I got into the extra sub plots - they were done well. The character mix was engrossing with good descriptions and development. The author is a good writer, always painting vivid pictures for the minds eye of the surroundings and locations. It is just the last third of the book disappointed all most to the level that when I came to the end I was mad. I felt I had been hoodwinked, how could the first two third's of the book be so good, fresh etc and the last bit be such a half hearted effort on a tired plot?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dya After Tomorrow","review":"I thought the book was a great thriller that kept me on my seat. I liked it so much that I re-read it and purchased a copy for a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Triangle: Gripping Start, Tapering Off To Preposterous Ending","review":"I found the opening engaging: a strange incident in a Paris cafe (all the best thrillers take place in Europe, don't they?). Things progress along interesting lines, there is some promising character development... and then it appears someone else took over writing the remaing three quarters of the book! Little more of interest emerges and we wrap up with a bizarre and silly ending.Read the first 10 to 50 pages for some fun, don't bother with the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"An American doctor, while being in Paris, sees the man who killed his father and thus finds himself caught in a conspiracy that may bring back to power the old glory of the Nazi Germany. As he tries to find the truth behind all of this, he races across Europe and faces forces greater and more powerful than he could ever imagine. The secrets become clear at each chapter, the action and the races across the Old Continent superbly detailed. A satisfying first effort from Folsom and an excellent thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad you can't give ZERO stars","review":"Absolutely one of the lamest books I've ever read. I'd gotten a little tired of Ludlum and was looking for an alternative but this wasn't it. The plot twists, turns, connections, and chance occurences were beyond unbelievable.

Having a character do something either special or meant for their nature, and slowly introducing them saying either \\"he likes to do this\\" or \\"she likes her friends because\\". And frankly, the book doesn't seem that exciting with an introduction that seems to drag on and not seem to give that more of a deep backstory to any of the characters. The story was gradually getting better as time went on, but at the slowest pace possible. Because of this slow pace, anyone would be yawning and getting bored of the book at this point. After finishing the book, I can honestly say that it was an unrealistic happily ever after that left many questions unanswered.

My only complaint is a \\"five syllable first name\\" for the heroine (and one difficult to pronounce at that). Only Amanda Quick (JAK)is such a strong story-teller that she can get away with that. I have read this book numerous times (really!) and have stumbled over that name every time it comes up on the page .... and it comes up very often. According to the Webster's Dictionary on my computer the pronunciation is as shown above, however for several years I read it as I fi GIN e a. Now when I read it, it's a conglomeration of both pronunciations and very distracting, and that's frustrating because the story is so darned good.

These fins are for pool and not open water, so all but the most careful adults will show white lines and stress fractures immediately. My 10yr old is a swimmer and after 20mins of testing the fins out(while I WATCHED), he emerged with a couple white stress fractures on each fin blade. My wife and I have Zoomers(market dominators, understandably) and I wish to Heaven that I had opted for them in THIS case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked after 2 weeks","review":"Bought these for my son who is a competitive swimmer - he trains 1.5 hrs/day.

Fell apart after three uses. The hard plastic near the toes permanently bent and separated from the softer rubber around the toes. Terrible design. Now I have to go buy zoomers again. Bit more pricey, but they last. One piece design (no glued joints) and I've had mine for 3 years.

In my opinion, it is the most poorly conceived Rifts sourcebook ever published. The book is riddled with inconsistencies and errors. One example is that all characters start with useless and almost unobtainable equipment. For those familiar with the Rifts system, all characters carry sdc weapons and tools on a world where everything/everyone is a mega-damage structure (even normal buildings/people). Wooden stakes (sdc only weapon useful only against vampires) are commonly carried on a world where any wood must be imported from another dimension (no trees on Wormwood). There are no vampires on Wormwood (stated specifically in the book). To make things even sillier, people are mdc structures but do not do deal out mega-damage themselves (no fist fights i guess). If you are looking for a good Rifts supplement...look elsewhere"},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Theater Receiver","review":"Outstanding receiver for the price. Met all my expectations.

I reset and reprogrammed the receiver several times but it always changed the settings. Beware the Yamaha Warranty! If you don't have to use it you're fortunate. This morning I told them to return the unit. I'll replace it with something else with a solid warranty; perhaps an exchange agreement.

Also ordered the Infinity TSS 450 Home Theater Speaker System and the Sony DVDPNS75H Upscaling DVD player. This thing rocks !!. I'm very impressed with the power and features of this unit, specially for its price. It was also easy to set up (I received the speakers first so I had them installed when the receiver arrived).

What a great movie. Not only was it the only Frankenstein movie that came close to the book, it was so close I'm hard pressed to find differences. Lots of the dialog was straight from the book. It is at least as good as the book, if not (dare I say it?) better. Great acting, creepy scenes. Best bringing the monster life to scene I've ever seen. It was gruesome & everything it should be, without being gory. I can't wait until Oct 26 so I can buy it. Be aware though, that like the book, it is a bit less of a horror movie than a tragedy. And it's so well done you can't help but feel melancholy at the end.

It's beautifully written; the pacing is perfect and the language is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"suspiciously similar plot....","review":"I gave this book two stars because it was well written and amusing. Mr Brundy was a likeable hero (although with a stilted faux-cockney accent that vanished and reappeared at random). I could not feel much empathy with Lady Helen, however, as Ms South spent little time developing her character. Lady Helen came across as a puppet with no depth, and her doubtful transformation from shrew to loving spouse was contrived and awkward.More disturbing, however, was the strange sense of deja-vu I experienced while reading this book. It was a composite of several Georgette Heyer novels, most notably \\"the Convenient Marriage\\" and \\"April Lady,\\" complete with irresponsible gaming brother, jewels stolen by blackguard, and a poker. One wonders what kind of an editor Ms South had.I would certainly not spend more money on this author; I can reread Georgette Heyer, with more satisfying results."},{"rating":"2","title":"A light hearted traditional style regency","review":"Sheri Cobb South has written a different sort of novel that I suspect the main stream publishers of Regency Romances might not have published. It is very well written, very light hearted, but with a gentle twist, the hero is heroic more for himself than for the rank he holds, the heroine a rather haughty Duke's daughter, forced to marry because of economic necessity. I felt that the author enjoyed writing this book, I know I enjoyed reading it. If you are feeling picky there are a couple of places where it didn't feel 100% accurate but the story flowed so well you simply ignored them. I look forward to reading and reviewing more from this author.

Very well written, with an old-fashioned style and strong author voice. Upbeat, entertaining, and a hero like none other -- a very uncommon commoner. One can't help cheering for the unpolished and unpretentious Mr. Brundy, whose tender heart and cheerful acceptance of his lot in life, coupled with intelligence, humor, and quiet confidence in his own intrinsic worth, make him a true hero.

I borrowed it from my uncle and I was really excited. When I played it it was like an earthquake hit the designers' heads. The graphics are awful and looks like it came out of the garbage. The game gets really repeditive after the second level. There is no originality at all in this game which is really bad. Sure the multiplayer might be pretty good but it also gets repeditive just like the single player. On the bonus stages you get to play as different characters, but they all handle the same way. The controls are pretty good but you won't need them because all you use is the X button.

I finished it the first time through in about 7-hours so it is really short. However, I think the game is going to have alot of replay value in trying to get better scores on each of the levels and finding secrets. That being said I have a make a comment about something other than the gameplay. Maybe this is because I grew up with Star Wars being 18 when the first one came out but I was deeply disturbed when the part of the game comes where Anakin fights Master Windu and the subsequent distruction of the Jedi Temple. Did this bother anyone else?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"The lucas arts team has done it again, they've raised the bar.The learning curve is moderate, since you have a lot of combos to memorize and it takes getting used to (esp if ur used to jedi acad) but once you have that down, the gameplay is amazing.

Trade it in and buy brothers in arms it is incredible and it is only thiryt dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak entry","review":"This game is disapointing. It is good marketing for the movie but the game play is basic and boring. It only took one day to complete. There is no camera movement to flesh out the surroundings and your movement is contained to the screen. There are only 2 Jedi powers you can use per character, the positive is that they are easy to use. There is no online option so when you are done the game...that's it. I will have a used copy on an auction site soon....."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Force is with this Spectacular Action Game!","review":"Ok, so I'm a little late in playing this game, but I love it. I purchased this game two days ago, and yes, I beat it in two sittings. The missions are so immersive, the controls are wonderful and the gameplay is simply addicting. One of my favorite things about this game is the careful attention to the plot. I was a bit worried that the video game would be a watered down version of the PG-13 film... I was very wrong. Certain levels in this game put you right into the muderous shoes of Darth Vader, killing everything that comes between you and your goals, while others put you in the shoes of the hero Obi Wan.As far as graphics, well, these rate at about a 6.5 to 7.0 right now in 2007, but for that generation of games they rate an easy 8.0. The game is moderately long, (the story mode takes about 6 or 7 hours) but there is so much replayability that story mode doesn't even put a knick in the potential gameplay.Overall this is a must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a drag","review":"I am a big fan of the Star Wars video games, but this one is a definate let down. The game is mindless and simple with very few even challenging parts. The game took almost no time to complete and left me feeling ripped off after only a few hours of playing. The game was more about pimping the movie by showing actual movie footage, than by giving the game substance and meat. If you want a movie preview this is your game, if you want a game keep shopping. What a drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revenge of the NES","review":"This crappy game feels like an old NES game. I hate it. I hate it because it had the potential to be a GREAT game. But you can't move the camera around, you can't even really MOVE around (invisible walls galore!), you get shot at from guys you can't even see as everyone attacks you from off-screen, and even the versus combat is exceedingly frustrating. When you go up against someone like Greivous, don't even bother getting near him if you're playing against the computer. I love Star Wars, so I bought this thing, I played it, I enjoyed parts of it but....if you've played the Jedi Outcast games don't even think of buying this totally average bore.

Unfortunately, this pocket reference for the other main .NET language is just the opposite. To my mind, a poorly organized pocket reference is a fatal flaw.

Almost two of those pages describes pages 1-17 in the book (covering constants and enumerations in detail), while the other 3/4 of a contents page describes, with no detail, the remaining 125 pages. With no index as well, it is almost impossible to find what you are looking for except by looking page-by-page. Want to find, say, the syntax of a select statement?

He explains why we say, \\"Let the cat out of the bag,\\" and \\"It's raining cats and dogs,\\" but he doesn't tell us why the cat has our tongue.

His early works were observations of human behavior through the lens of the animal kingdom. In Catwatching, Morris turns the tables and explains cat behavior in simple terms that we humans can understand and appreciate. It is beautifully illustrated with fantastic photography. The reader can feel the warmth and love Morris has for our feline friends with every chapter. Morris explains cat behavior, gives the origins of our beliefs about cats, and debunks popular cat mythology. Of note to the coffee table collection crowd, the book and photographs are oversized and the chapters are short and concise; yet the book is alive with love and admiration for our cat friends. If you are at all fond of cats or find their wacky behavior fastinating, this book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desmond Morris is my hero!","review":"Catwatching and his other book DogWatching are both great.

He listens to these creatures, and I daresay knows them better than they know themselves.My only disappointment is that there is no serious treatment of the very real philosophical issues that necessarily accompany this sort of project.

Pressing it triggers either the scroll left button, the scroll right button, or the the wheel in some direction.You can fix this by sacrificing the usability of one of the scroll left/right buttons (whichever you prefer) and map it (using the provided SetPoint software - which isn't so bad) to be the new middle-click.

And it drips oil constantly, so put newpaper under it.There's a reason this chain saw is so inexpensive. It's not worth it, and not worth the convenience of an electric tool. For a few bucks more, you can get a gas saw that gets the job done and will last more than 1/2 season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are people voting 5 stars?","review":"Like everybody else's: short-lived, leaks oil, and chain slips off frequently.

If you buy it, plan on draining the tank after every use or cleaning up a lot of oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but too long....","review":"I enjoyed this book, but at times the author went on and on too much about things. I would have liked it better, if she just cut to the chase and didn't drag it out so much.The ending was ok, but a bit melodramatic. Reading the diary part really hooked me, and I think wanting to know what happened to the heroine is what kept me reading through the slow parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophisticated.","review":"I loved the descriptions of the characters and the scenery throughout the entire book.

Just when you think the plot could not possibly get any more ridiculous, it does, with delightful results. There is a dark theme, but the book is so over-the-top that it is impossible to take seriously. It reads as high camp. The perfect, by-the-pool page turner. As soon as I finished reading it, I bought a dozen copies to give to my friends. I have yet to hear a bad review from them. This book has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, but it's so much fun you won't care. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best trashy novel ever.","review":"I am a voracious reader with varied but usually elevated tastes. However, I read this in one sitting on a flight from France and I have never read any book so compelling. It isn't art but it is the best that a novel as entertainment can be. I'm not sure if men would like it- they'd probably just read the kinky sex parts - which are genuinely disturbing when you realize the psychological damage done to the title character. I loved this book. The prose is sometimes clumsy but the story is fascinating, erotic, and also very moving. It's a rare combination and a lot of fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak potion","review":"I really did not enjoy this novel at all--surprising, since I absolutely loved Moline's first novel, \\"Lunch.\\" I thought the story was too slow and the plot far too convoluted.

It was so vanilla pudding and such a regurgitation of Quick's former plotlines that I was bitterly disappointed. I'm beginning to think Quick has lost her touch in coming up with original new storylines -- her last 3 books seem like repeat television shows. I'm a little tired of women who are only spunky and honest and men who are strong, silent and misunderstood. The same applies to her books written under the pseudonym Jayne Ann Krentz -- only a few are worthwhile. None of this stops me from reading Seduction, Scandal, Surrender and Reckless over and over. Stick to earlier Quick books -- they have better plotlines and more interesting characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT TO END---","review":"The heroine and her sister were irritating, the hero was uninspiring, the villain was a joke and the frequent scientific references were bland. There was no chemistry between the hero/heroine. This book was annoying enough on its own, but it was the narrator, Mary Peiffer, who really set my teeth on edge. The sad thing is part of the story line had possibilities. Ms. Quick could have done so much more with the mesmerism angle. Oh well.(FYI: Barbara Rosenblat is a much more enjoyable narrator of Amanda Quick's books.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book to read","review":"It's a nice book to read BUT its just predictible - otherwise I would have given it a 5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very boring book. I kept putting it down.","review":"This book had a victorian feel to it as did the other recent books of Ms. Quick's. It had a dark, almost late Victorian feel. The characters were boring and I didn't think there was much tension between the characters. I really like the books that she writes that involve 2 people trying to come to terms with their relationship such as Seduction or Rendezvous. I also found I Thee Wed to be equally boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"History is bunk - Henry Ford","review":"I can't say enough great things about this book. It was both funny and touching and sad. At times I wanted Horwitz to challenge some of the views his interviewees held, but I realize that his objectivity (though somewhat lopsided at times) was valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"North or South?","review":"The fact that many of the people who have reviewed this book feel the need to mention their birthplace when writing about the Civil War is a perfect illustration of why Horwitz wrote this book and why it is so important. Sure he is biased, but have you ever read a book that wasn't? At least Horwitz admits his biases and attempts (successfully) to confront such an enormous issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"intriguing and quirky","review":"This book is an extremely interesting way to re-learn your American History. The author takes you through all the important sites of the Civil War (War Between the States if you will) and simultaneously teaches you the facts of the specific battles and illustrates how those battles affect people to this day. The book is an interesting romp through the South where we meet dozens of interesting people that I was pretty sure did not exist anymore. From Civil War die hards to Scarlet O'Hara wannabes, this book is funny and scary and worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Biased and Prejudiced","review":"There isn't a whole lot positive I can say about this book other than I'm thankful its in the library and purchasing it is not necessary. There are a few funny parts and the author can be witty at times but the book overall is a waste of paper and ink. If you have a strong anti-Confederate and anti-Southerner bias, then you will like this book as it supports your bigotry. I actually heard about this book, while speaking with Nelson Winbush, an African-American descendent of a black Confederate soldier named Louis Napoleon Nelson. Mr. Winbush stated that the author of this book had come down to learn about his ancestor who fought for the South but then refused to put in any information regarding him in his book \\"Confederates in the Attic.\\" If your looking for an unbiased source on the Civil War try author Shelby Foote's many books.If you would like to learn more about black confederate soldier Louis Napoleon Nelson read the St. Petersburg Times newspaper article:[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased, poorly researched.","review":"This book could have been a good read if the author had been concerned with presenting a fair open-minded study. Mr. Horwitz seems to have a bias against the South and all things Southern. I regret that I spent money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another batch of anti-southern stereotypes rehashed","review":"I bought this book on the reccomendation of a fellow civil war buff. I was hoping for some fresh insights on the subject of the lost cause and it's continued effect on our (southern) lives. Instead it is a collection of overblown, trite, highly condescending, negative, hateful fiction. I have lived in the south/southwest my entire life (44 yrs) and I have never encountered anyone remotely resembling the ignorant, racist, borderline psychopaths that the author claims to have found on almost every street corner south of Mason-Dixon. This book is not what I expected. I will avoid further works of fiction by Mr. Horwitz."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORWITZ ACCENTUATES THE NEGATIVE","review":"Horwitz apparently went looking for the negative extremes in his journey into the world of Confederate reenacting. In addition, he painted inaccurate portraits of some of the 'characters' he encountered.I personally know one of the men that Horwitz interviewed and commented about. Horwitz did a great disservice to this individual in completely misrepresenting him and his motives and activities in the hobby. Instead of presenting him as the calm, thoughtful, introspective individual I know him to be, Horwitz presented him as a rabid extremist.While the writing was mildly entertaining at times, the representations of fact in the text have to be called into question due to what I know he was untruthful about.The inclusion of Rob Hodge as the 'star' of the book was a critical error on Horwitz' part. There are certainly hundreds, if not thousands, of more knowledgeable and much better uniformed and equipped living historians than he."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making a living by South-bashing","review":"Unfortunately just another attempt by a Yankee-peddler to make a quick buck off the South and the national interest in the war.

Don't make my mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite simply, this is an awful book","review":"Horwitz has missed a grand opportunity; instead of offering sound research on a fascinating subject, he provides readers with a large serving of overdone tripe and a side order of preconceived notions.Quite simply, this in awful book filled with the rantings of a biased, prejudiced journalist. He has an agenda: to hold our fellow Americans (southern folk) up to ridicule and scorn--and he is a master at doing this.Don't waste your time or money on this one . . . there are too many other good books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most interesting book I have read this year.","review":"Right away CITA drew me into the story in ways that I enjoy when reading a book. It was poignant, hilarious, readable and understandable. A very small, and apparently to everyone else unnoticable, error occured from time to time. We in the Heart of Dixie are ALABAMIANS. Should I even be so bold as to point that out? I just had to. But I would buy and read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avid explorer in search of the fire in the rebel's soul.","review":"There are many passionate, well-researched Civil War books. What sets this apart is Horwitz's own compassion for the contradictions of the rebel. Lucky for us, his grandfather, a Yiddish speaking immigrant in 1882, passed an infinity for this 'lost cause' on to a writer gifted with insight and humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Easy Read","review":"I was impressed. What a wild adventure! My purpose in reading this book was to learn more about the locations of the civil war battles, and I learned that and much more. This book inspires me to read even more on the war. Anyone interested even remotely in this period of American history will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Fun","review":"A superb book. I'd have given it four and a half stars if possible. It doesn't merit five stars because of some repetitive sections.

I would say this is a collection of ramblings rather than a book. He never seems to get to a point and bounces between race relations in America and some civil war history with alot of the modern day re-enactment movement mixed in. Frankly I didn't learn alot from this book. I will give his technical ability a thumbs up but the story just wanders on and on ending knowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!","review":"I found this book crutial for my own understanding of how the Civil War has and stilll affects our country. Tony takes you there in a way that you feel you are part of his journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confederates in the Attic","review":"Recently purchased Confederates in the Attic to read on my Kindle. I am a born and bred southerner. Purchased the book to get a different perspective regarding our attitudes toward northerners and to understand why southerners have a history of harboring bad feelings about losing the Civil War. Tony Horwitz comes across as someone that had a pre-opinion of the south that was debasing. His negative bias about the South is obvious. His descriptions of southerners and the south are grossly inaccurate. In my opinion he goes out of his way to paint a negative picture that is not close to how people and places are really like. Could not finished the book--I have been to several places he wrote about in the book and his descriptions were so far off I have to stop readng. Did not trust his book could provide any insights that are worth knowing about. Don't waste your time.

This book was a somewhat interesting read, as I'm both intrigued by the South and a Civil War buff. However, Horwitz's \\"I'm above it all\\" tone is unpleasant; his seeming expectation that every Civil War battlefield should remain a pristine, undeveloped sanctuary is unrealistic; his endless criticism of the minute is at first boring, then annoying. (As a native Southern Californian, you'll forgive me for not being shocked that there are mini-malls in the South.) I am sorry that I wasted my money buying a copy of this book, as I will not be picking it up again in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAIT AND SWITCH","review":"I have to agree with the other one star commentors. This book is nothing more than a collection of anecdotes about eccentrics and trivia, sprinkled with disapproving comments about the South by the author. It leads nowhere and you learn nothing. The author's lack of knowledge about the war shows also. This book had an interesting premise, but the author failed to follow through. At least now I know I can make a quick buck writing about all the eccentric kooks I met while living up North. Don't waste your money or your time y'all."},{"rating":"1","title":"More revisionist history from a yankee view","review":"Tony tries to keep us involved in the War Between the States arena by walking us through several battlefields and something that is referred to as a \\"Civil Wargasm\\", or attempting to recreate the paths of confederate soldiers through Virginia and bits of Maryland and Pennsylvania. What he accomplishes is more northern bigotry against any and all Southern culture and people, especially those who revere their past. As long as one doesn't try to draw any historical or sociological conclusions, \\"Confederates in the Attic\\" is a 'cute' little book. I would, however, not recommend it for the Civil War Buffs' library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Overated Book","review":"Over the past few years at least a dozen people have asked me if I had ever read \\"Confederates in the Attic?\\" Being interested in Civil War history, I decided to finally check a copy out of the library. I cannot understand why this book has the reputation it has or how it won a pulitzer prize. I found the book to be completly boring, of little historical value, and not at all amusing. In my opinion it is completely overated and I would not recommend anyone wasting their time trying to read it. There are many other history books about the Civil War that are far more interesting to read, and for more worth one's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too interested in race relations","review":"The author seemed to want to come back time and time again to the issue of race...which played little or no part in the real war). This book would have been better if he had stuck to the issue of Southern Independence and the fact that we of the South would be much better off today hasd the South achieved her much deserved Independence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, unbelievable, smug","review":"The American Civil War was staged for fathers to connect with their sons, and to have people to look down upon and make up stories about? That, and of course...racism. Horowitz embellishes his encounters and reports with a >wink, wink< of perfect complicity the overdone characterizations and and self-serving displays (yes, I know the Southern Guard and Rob H.) At least at the very end, he exposes plainly his biases, and nearly admits that his prejudices overweigh any honest evaluation and understanding of the American South (past or present), but this doesn't wash away the one-eyed-view of the previous chapters. Although I have never lived south of the Mason-Dixon line, I can't help but take the poor reporting personally; to anyone who wishes to truly understand things, Horowitz is offensive. I wish I'd not wasted the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"\\"Confederates...\\" was the best book I've read on the Civil War. It was told unbiasly, which is an almost impossible task. Touching and funny, it gives a view of the War not often heard. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A traipse through places and issues of the Civil War.","review":"Tony Horwitz has written an excellent modern day traipse through many of the places and lingering issues of the Civil War. It is obvious in his writing that his perspective is based, in part, on a long lasting personal fascination and interest in the history of the Civil War. From Shiloh to Charleston, the work touches on some unique places of the War. As the great, great grandson of a well known Civil War guerrilla, I thoroughly enjoyed the myriad of places he visited and his attempt in each place to uncover and unravel the personal ties and feelings we each have for the war today. His adventures with the hardcores and his attempt not to \\"farb out\\" offer delightful pieces of resulting humor which are appropriately spaced throughout the book. Anyone with an interest in the Civil War would appreciate this well written and informative book, as Mr. Horwitz peers over his shoulder back at the single most important time in American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confederates in the Attic","review":"A page-turner, it's not. But I loved it just the same. I give more than half the credit to Horwitz's writing. This book could have been a \\"this happened, then this happened, then we did this...\\" but it wasn't and I'm not sure how he did it. I found the concept of visiting Civil War battlefields with an reenactor fascinating (and funny at times) and I loved the conversations about race (as disturbing as they were some times). I'm a Yankee who moved to North Carolina in 2001 and there have been moments when I've wondered whether Southern folks had any residual resentment. Confederates... was full of insights along those lines!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, don't buy it","review":"Save your money. Don't buy it. The book had great promise, but failed to deliver. The author initially appears to be open minded, but is revealed as just another in a long line of liberal writers with a preconceived negative opinion of southerners. The entire story boiled down to slavery and civil rights for blacks. Along the way, the author denigrates those who helped him on his journey, betraying their trust in him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring ......","review":"A disclaimer: I did not complete this book. Got about halfway and lost interest. This book is both boring and trite, and frankly doesn't shed much light on why the conferacy continues to facinate so may people in my opinion. In this case you can actually judge the book by its cover - the ugly guy on the cover is a good indication of what you will read in this book - a sordid story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written book.","review":"This book gives you a good view of the different types of people that are interested in the civil war from the hardcore reactor's to people that are still fighting the war so to speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"People from 130 years ago must think we're all loony","review":"Horwitz's writing style is beautiful. He has an unabashedly Jewish, white, urban, young and educated perspective from which he interprets the people and events that he comes across. The result is obviously skewed, but in a way that is lighthearted and surprisingly open. He meets an extraordinary range of people in this trip, and portrays them all with an earnestness and sense of humor that admits his own humanity as well as all of ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written interesting book.","review":"One of the greatest civil war releated books ever. I loved how the you just couldn't put this book down. It was a real page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and thought provoking book","review":"I don't know if I can offer much on this book after all that has been said below in the other reviews. Being from Austrlia which is some distance from the United States and with no background in the Civil War (other than reading great history books) I found this a very interesting book. At times I was amazed and saddened and I wondered was America really like this. I think the book offers you something about your country that you can be proud of but also maybe a bit scared of as well. A very interesting travel, well worth the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical Civil War Book","review":"This is a highly entertaining romp of a book. It is a must for Civil War buffs, especially those, like myself, who enjoy tramping around on battlefields, cemetaries, etc. Tony Horwitz combines facts, trivia, and humor as he describes his foray into the Confederacy. I enjoyed every word and was sorry to get to the end of the book.P.S. The chapter on Civil Wargasm is not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Perspective","review":"Tony Horwitz's approach in bridging the Civil War era to modern times provides an insight to American society that is hidden to most of us. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, which gave very interesting facts and perspectives on events during the Civil War (humorously, at times). Horwitz also illustrated the ways in which our society has progressed since the Civil War period and in what ways in remains much the same. If you're interested in the surrounding facts around the Civil War, you'll enjoy this book. Even if you're not interested in the Civil War, the questions it raises about our \\"modern\\" society will intrigue many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, Smartly Written, Humorous Anthropological Study","review":"Horwitz' commentary on his travels and observations of interesting people and institutionalized mythology of southern US with regard to War Between the States is both a lesson in aspects of deep south culture and empirical study of attitudes regarding wounds that won't heal. In light of such ongoing, centuries old flashpoints in Europe, Asia, and Africa, Horwitz' novel highlights the similarities between cultural antagonisms here and there and helps us to understand the inconceivable lack of tolerance for different ideas that lead to such inhumanity as that in Bosnia, Iraq, Ireland, etc. A really valuable analogy for understanding our homes, our country, our world. His ability to portray his subjects as human, therefore imperfect, with at once both a serious and humorous side, and make his reader both shudder and snicker, is a tribute to his talent as a writer. I only wish the book were longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"poetry that connects","review":"Let me put it simply: most poetry written over the last 50 years leaves me cold. Therefore, you can imagine how refreashing--no, far more than that--you might say astounding--I found Shiva's Drum: poetry that connects to what I have seen, and heard, and felt, in a way that reminds me of the best theatre, engendering the feeling that we are not alone and that others around us have shared our common experiences, of beauty, and sadness, and of hope.

The chapters on Boundary Layer theory, and WKB theory are well written and fun to read. In addition, I also found Summation of Series chapter quite interesting in regards to accelerated convergence (a numerical technique that is sadly ignored in beginning numerical methods courses). My only gripe with this book is the difficulty of some of the problems. Not all problems are difficult, but as someone else mentioned, even some of the \\"Intermediate\\" exercises are quite daunting. Regardless, I think this is a MUST OWN book for any scientist/engineer in a research/teaching field. As a supplement to this book, I also recommend reading Chapter 6 (titled Perturbation Theory) in Landau and Lifshitz Vol. 3 (Quantum Mechanics Non-Relativistic Theory)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"I had seen this book in a bookstore over 15 years ago and regretted that I did not buy it at that time. Now that I have it, I am very disappointed. First of all, the print for the examples is very very small. The book is more of a summary of methods than any details of the methods themselves. There is no systematic development of the mathematical theory for these methods. This reinforces the worst aspects of books on aymptotic methods and perturbation theory: it's all just a bunch of random trial and error jibbrish!The authors tried to pile in a lot of methods into the book without detailed explanations. I find it hard to believe that a scientist or engineer would get a lot out of this book. As a mathematician, I found it lacking in any significant mathematical meaning and purpose. I would recommend Nayfeh's book on peturbation methods instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best","review":"I used this book in grad school about 15 years ago and got it out again yesterday to learn more about sophisticated path deformations in the complex plane.

I have tried reloading the software several times. The manual is of little use as I follow the troubleshooting hints only to end up with \\"Call the manufacturer\\". Each time I turn my PC off I have to reload the software to print again - if it allows me to reload. Further, the ink cartridge ran out after only printing about 50 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This is a junk machine. Slow, eat a lot of inks. And recently, although I changed new cartages, it prints nothing on paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!","review":"This is the worst thing you could ever spend your money on, and it does not come cheap. When it does work, and there is a 90% chance that it does not, the quality of printing is unbelievably poor. It eats the most ink I have ever seen a machine use up. Canon customer service has been most unhelpful although the machine is still under warranty. Do yourself a favor, spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroy this Canon","review":"Have been trying to use this machine for 4 months now. It has been connected and installed on three different pc(s) and does not perform at all. The manual does not help, nor does the 800 number. We shall by an Epson this weekend and put this one out for the trash men, after of course taking a hammer to it. (NOTE; the 800 number and the store where purchased only wants to blame the problem on you, your pc or your cable). Do not spend your monies here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Canon!","review":"I purchased my multipass and it was supposed to have a color scanner (the book even said so), but when I called them about it they told me that it was a generic book and that mine was not supposed to have a color scanner. The book doesn't list any other machine except for my Canon Multipass C3500. Then my warning light wouldn't always come one when it was supposed to to tell me that I needed to replace the ink cartridge. And to top it off, my print head needs to be replaced. The reason I say don't buy Canon is because I have seen many of their printers up for sale (not just this particular kind) and every time I ask what is wrong the tell me they need a new print head. I've run into many people on the web with the same problem. If only I knew then what I know now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I thought","review":"These kind of items are a necessity, AND when I saw 1 cent I thought \\"wow how's possible?\\" WELL I'll tell you how...the postage and handling is $5 lol.

I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also Available as SACD","review":"This excellent recording is also available as an SACD [Handel: Water Music; Music for the Royal Fireworks [Hybrid SACD] for only slightly more money. Irrespective of format or price, it's a top choice for these much loved works. Through clear textures and relatively rapid tempos, conductor Kevin Mallon restores the joy and excitement to these very familiar pieces. Classics Today rates the disc 10/10 for both artistry and sound, and you will enthusiastically agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Many Top Choices","review":"There are a lot of good recordings of both Handel's Water Music and his Music for the Royal Fireworks lurking out there -- renditions by The English Concert, Tafelmusik and the venerable Collegium Aureum, among others. Oh, and vintage Marriner and Academy of St. Martin in the Fields for modern instrument versions. This disc easily joins that elite bunch with rousing and well-played performances of these Baroque musical icons. Suffice it to say the Water Music is played with exquisite smoothness while the Fireworks Music is loaded with punch and percussion. The coupling of the two and the Naxos price make this album almost impossible to beat. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be much better","review":"The orchestra conductor has taken too much liberty with the score. It has run amok.

Polish goes on nicely and evenly. Love this OPI!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I love OPI polish; however the polish that was sent to me did not match the description listed. I was expecting a pink glitter polish instead I received a dull looking polish with little glitter in it.

The second coat a very natural pale pink. Could be used for an american manicure. i used this color for our 5 yr old daughter on her toes as it was barely noticeable.

Unfortunately, this polish was a little pinker than I had expected in most lights while I was looking forward to a shade with a little more purple in it. However, I was just blown away by the formula. This is the first polish that I have received that is very easy to apply, goes on thin but very opaque! You could probably get by with only one coat of this stuff, but I did two just to be safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous and luminous","review":"Kyoto Pearl is so lovely! I rarely apply light colors but I fell in love at the nail salon.

Deal.","review":"This nail polish is the right color, right brand, and everything I wanted for a lesser price than that of in a salon. However, it does not stay on the nail...It seems that it had been used or something before it was sent. There was dried polish on the outside, as well as around the rim to the bottle. No matter what I do to my nails (using nail polish remover to remove any oils on the nail prior to application, using a base coat, etc.) it peels off within a day...like literally peels off. I've seen this in salons before, where the cosmetologist or whoever added something to the lacquer to spread it further, and the end result was bubbling/peeling...wondering if this happened to mine? Won't buy from here again for O.P.I."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely lovely","review":"I am as low-maintenance a woman as they come; I can't usually be bothered with fixing polish chips and reapplying because it has bubbles and all the other headaches that have come with my brief forays into growing out and keeping polish on my nails in the past. I finally got smart and decided that cheap polish might be my problem, and looked around for the best-reviewed brand. I was not disappointed. It applied very smoothly, no bubbles, and with a thicker coat than I was expecting. The second coat took the color from a medium red/fuchsia to something just a little too pink to be candy-apple red, and I think I would have been just fine with a single coat, the coverage was that good. And then it stayed, and stayed. I'm usually lucky to get two days with perfect nails; this time I got a week, with only some wear (some very even wear, a thin line of white) at the very tips. I'm very pleased to finally find a polish as low-maintenance as I am!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite nail polish ever!","review":"This is the nicest brand of nail polish I have ever used.

When it arrived, I was very disappointed to see that the color was not right although the bottle was labeled Java Mauve-A. Even looking at it online (and I know that monitors have variations in the displays), it had the right kind of light latte brown. OPI's Java Mauve-A is a wonderful neutral color. Now I have this polish and it cannot be returned because of shipping policies. I don't know what happened, maybe OPI changed their color formulation? Anyway, best to choose your polish in person I guess, even if you think you are familiar with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite go-to polish!","review":"I paint my nails on a weekly basis, and OPI is easily the best brand I've used. This color is my favorite - very vibrant and goes on easily. I noticed when I'd go to a salon to get my nails done, I picked this color repeatedly [not deliberately though]. After 5 or 6 times I decided I should probably have this color at home.Just be careful purple-lovers!

Being able to write about gay people takes neither wit, talent nor skill merly a little imagination, which is no recomendation at all.The prose was awful and if possible the dialogue was even worse. I hated the war peoms and feel that the opinions expressed about the first world war, however valid in themselves, were both hackneyed and cliched with no basis on real experience or research.The only saving grace of the whole book was that the author didn't use the traditional streotypes of gay men, but any merit achieved by this was distroyed by her use of streotipical religious charcters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanted indeed.","review":"This 1996 Meridian Records (London) celebration and sampler of Georg Philipp Telemann showcases the delightful and ��ber-competent Cambridge trio called Badinage. Paul Carroll, Sally Civval and harpsichordist David Rowland play a restrained, precise Telemann that is honey on the ears.I once attended a Badinage concert in the candle-lit chapel of Christ College, Cambridge, where the visuals perfectly matched the auditory pleasures afforded by this trio, which specializes in the Baroque catalogue.When technically demanding music like the kind that Telemann so often wrote is played by a consort of only three musicians, there is no room for error, uncoordination, or mental lapse. Badinage makes sure none occur.The result is indeed enchanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"This was a great buyer. Item came within a week and was in excellent condition.

Because of this, the book reads like an in-depth discussion of attribute mapping between the Exchange DS and the Active Directory followed by a review of how messages find their way through the routing engine.

Use the \\"Natural Pen\\" - doesn't exist either, now called Artistic Mode. I am only 200 pages in but now realize it was a waste of money as the instructions are completely irrelevant for version 9.

Also, the Dockers Menu is another example of a mistake. The author tells you were to find the Dockers Menu but my software does not show that menu. After playing around and asking for help in the program, I came to realize that I had to ADD the Dockers Menu. But she doesn't tell you that, you have to figure it out while scratching your head.

The lever doesn't allow me to lift things out of the toaster far enough. It's ok for supermarket bread, but other things I have to grab with a fork.-- It's substantially bigger than I expected.

Because of that, you can't really progress characters nearly as much, such as getting awesome weapons and things. Also, the 'strategy' of course isn't really strategy. You just pick which battles to fight. And the one aspect that makes it utterly boring is that there are not nearly enough people in each battle.

The BC-20 prints black text faster than the color head as it has 128 nozzles for black compared to 64 black nozzles on the BC-21e. The color head has replacable color and black tanks which are cheaper to replace than buying the entire print head. The print head is very easy to replace.

What I will tell you is that this movie takes forever to get going. Despite seeing zombie hands within the first five minutes, you don't see them again for a long time. So long, in fact, that I don't think I've ever stayed awake long enough to see!I honestly can't recomend this movie to anyone. It's like watching the original \\"Day of the Dead\\" But not the first ten minutes, when there's zombies... or the last twenty, when there's zombie inside the mall.

A little to sharp for wall hanger in my opinion. it was however very east to slightly dull the edge with a little careful work with emery cloth.

You must \\"deep clean\\" the heads each time you install the photo cartridge to get the best possible picture, which is about 60% the quality of 35mm prints and very slow (about 3 minutes per picture). The colors are not true to the digital picture. Also, if you don't use the cartridge up in a short time the quality gets worse. The black and white printing is fine, except the cartridges do not last very long, even with little printing. ... Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"(...)

One drawback is speed (or the lack thereof). Printing text is OK, but to get high quality photo or graphics be prepared to wait.

I like the idea of seperate ink cartridges that can be replaced individualy. However, my BJC-6000 has been in the shop 3 times because of constant paper jamming. The machine would not accecpt the paper correctly every time, and when it did take, it came out crooked. The 2nd time it went in, they corrected the problem which lasted about 3 weeks. Then, one day, it snatched in a page and managed to crumple it up and damage the print head in the process. Ink all over the interior resulted in replacement of the platten. Insult to injury was added on when I was charged for a new print head even though the machine was still under warranty. I may have purchased a lemon.

Once I start a new book, it doesn't get put down until I find out who killed who.

What the heck is wrong with the main character Goldy .. someone who has supposedly suffered severe abuse from her ex, yet goes to his aid when he's accused of murder thanks mental and physical abuse that their son inflicts upon her! (Given his behaviour in this novel, why can't she see she's basically raising her son to be a carbon copy of her ex?)Just what is Mott Davidson thinking?Lets get real here.Would any NORMAL woman allow herself to be subjected to this kind of unbelievable nonsense? Come to think of it, why the heck is Goldy still living in the same town as JRK if she's SO damn scared of him?I can't believe there are future volumes regarding Miss Goldy who, IMO must love abuse or wouldn't have been tolerating this stuff for so long.I can't say I'll be bothered reading them though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldy....GET A LIFE outside of that whiny brat of yours!","review":"I'm getting pretty tired of whiny, pouty, in-charge-of-it-all Arch....he's becoming quite a chip off the old block....I mean, really, if my ex-husband was beating up on me and breaking into my house, my kids would have a fit! They'd probably kill him...not whine when he landed in jail....I liked the earlier Goldy books and I was happy when she found a great guy to marry, but, the story line with the Jerk and that bratty kid has worn pretty thin.Goldy needs to realize that catering to every one of Arch's whims does him no service....who will care when he gets into the real world and he moves out or pouts for weeks on end.I won't be reading any more Mott Davidson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blandest Meal in Recent Memory","review":"Mott seems to have used every cliche known to the English language in this slow-moving novel. Her use of the word \\"pittance\\" to describe her child support was lacking. She would have been better served to say that it was her \\"reason for living\\" Now that's sarcasm.

I find her characters shallow and unrealistic. The plot of the mystery is confusing with too many extraneous characters, all with some prior relationship to the detective/cater Goldy. Most of her sleuthing is done in the middle of the night as she is unable to sleep. Is it believable that her cop husband sleeps through her midnight detective work with only a mild reprove to Goldy after the fact? I haven't tried the recipes but hopefully they are better than the mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read - love the recipes","review":"This was the second of Davidson's books that I have read.

But it doesn't hurt if you do. I think this is her best so far. The characters have by now become really well developed. A couple of her previous books have had moments in which the characters' actions or words didn't quite ring true, but I didn't have that sense in this one. Well paced, very well thought out, satisfying conclusion. It was a little too long for my taste at 400 pages, but amazingly well worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"First & Last for DMD","review":"What a waste of paper - and time spent reading! The lead character (Goldy) is spineless and without charisma, and the Arch character is only slightly less sick making. I was able to finish the book in record time because I could jump ahead by approx 20 pages at a time. I stayed with it primarily to find out how the whole storyline wrapped up. It wasn't worth the effort.In a world where spousal abuse is rife, it saddens me to to realize that my response to the \\"heroine's\\" plight is that of apathy. We're not looking for Wonder Woman here, but did she have to be **constantly** depicted as the punching bag of the world?

It is obvious that Davidson feels the culinary portion of her writing as she paints clear images of her cooking. This makes cooking along with the book fantastically surreal. However, the divorce and who-done-it story lines seem a bit corny rather than moving. Yet, this is a quick read. I would suggest reading one Davidson novel for the general idea and checking out the recipes of her remaining books."},{"rating":"1","title":"a painful read","review":"This book was just painful to read. Im up to date on all my favorites and so I am really trying to enjoy this series because there are so many and I like that. But this book is worse than the previous one. I skipped so many pages and only skimmed the end so I would understand if I decided to read anymore.

Incredible sets from production designer Boris Leven and beautiful color Todd-AO cinematography by Ernest Laszlo combine for handsome images a hallmark of director Wise. Daniel Massey playing Noel Coward gives a real standout performance. This film has been long underrated. Watching it the viewer can feel the true star power of Julie Andrews come through as Robert Wise had intended. Robert Wise is one in a handful of great directors. The marketing department along with misguided reviews is responsible for abandoning this great film into obscurity. Don't let that happen!

I'll stick to the beautiful complete version on Laser Disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie is amazing!!","review":"I first saw this fabulous film in its theatrical release in 1968. I remember being floored by the period detail, the opulent sets and costumes, and the fabulously recreated musical numbers. But nothing prepared me for the astonishing range of Julie Andrews' singing and acting. She has never looked or sounded better. This should have been her \\"Funny Girl,\\" which was released about the same time, but for whatever reason, it never caught on with audiences. Gertrude Lawrence, whose life is supposedly represented here, merely serves as an excuse for Robert Wise et. al. to mount a love-fest for Julie. This is a timeless tribute to one of the great stars of musical comedy. Will she ever sing again? Is there a movie version of \\"Sweeney Todd\\" in the wings? She would be tremendous. Star is stunning!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A absolutely stunning bad film, incredibly putrid!!!!","review":"This movie is so bad, that really, it is stunning. It is just god awful.

It drags, has little excitement, and even the magnificent Julie can't save it. The musical numbers are dull and the story plods along. Casting Julie Andrews as the late great British stage star Gertrude Lawrence, would seem to have been a stroke of brilliance, and perhaps, in a better written and directed production, it might have been wonderful, but it simply is not. the critics crucified the film, saving any praise for Julie's valiant attempt at injecting life into the lugubrious mess. But audiences stayed away. Even Darling Lili, which also flopped, had some fun and is entertaining. A real shame since Andrews and Lawrence should have been a perfect match for a musical bio. Julie would bounce back with films like 10 and Victor/Victoria proving why she is still the magawatt star that she is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smart, intelligent picture","review":"This is a terrific DVD of an unfairly maligned and underrated picture. However, as good as it is, I can see why it was not commerically successful upon it's inital roadshow engagements in 1968. In many ways, it was just too good to be popular.Despite its many musical numbers, Star is not a musical in the traditional sense (think Helen Morgan in Applause and Judy Garland in A Star is Born). Also: British music hall variety doesn't cross the Atlantic well and I suspect that may have been a factor limiting its appeal in North America.The flip-side of this disk provides extensive and fascinating details of the production itself, including the desperate attempts by 20th Century Fox to recut, repackage and reposition the film to find a larger audience: it didn't work.Nonetheless, Star is a substantial accomplishment and Julie Andrew's demonstrates once again what a remarkably gifted and talented performer she is...just like Gertrude Lawrence!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the Critics.","review":"It is very easy to focus on the fact that upon release, this film was a huge bomb. Indeed, many compare this film to Andrew's previous films, such as \\"The Sound of Music\\" and \\"Mary Poppins\\" which were wildly successful.But this film is a different animal completely. The usual family friendly Julie Andrews goes against the grain and portrays Gertrude Lawrence as the selfish, difficult, magnetic woman she came to be.The meat of this film is the endless parade of magical musical numbers. Well-financed, well-choreographed, and beautifully executed, it is undeniable that this is Andrews at her best.If you take this film as a showcase for Julie Andrews' talents, it is impossible not to fall in love with \\"Star!\\" I say, ignore the critics and watch this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie Andrews is the star!","review":"This film, in my opinion is exactly the kind of film Julie Andrews needed. She breaks free from her forever view of being \\"the perfect nanny\\" and becomes the maddening and infuriaiting theater star, Gertrude Lawrence.This film has some of the most spectacular numbers and wonderful scenery and costumes(that being my favorite aspect!) Julie Andrews is wonderful as the actress searching for a love to equal that of an audience. Daniel Massey plays Lawrences Lifelong friend 'Noel Coward' and he is also brilliant, his clever lines and witty attitude amuse you thoroughly. This film is my favorite film of Julie Andrews and has greatly influenced me in the genre of Musical Theater, this is one Hollywood musical you do not want to miss!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An almost great DVD - but not quite!","review":"This film is a joy from start to finish! CLASSY is the perfect word! But the people at Fox could have done a little more to bring the same class to their DVD. Sadly, they forgot to include the Intermission break and Entr'acte Music available on the (for its time) superb LaserDisc release. And considering the improvements in \\"clean-up\\" possibilities over the last couple of years, Fox could have removed some of the dirt marks and scratches visible here and there. Also, grain and color balance are far from perfect. Apparently Fox decided to transfer the LaserDisc master to DVD without any further touch up jobs. A little depressing, I must confess! And how I miss that music in the middle of the film!Now, how about \\"Can-Can\\" and \\"State Fair\\" (1962) on DVD? Mastered from first class prints, of course!

I thought it was well written and kept me intrigued from beginning to end.The novel had a sad and tragic beginning, A child was murdered and tragically taken away from her parents. It went from a happy marriage to lies and deception.I knew this book was going to be good from the beginning. It has secrets that come out through out the book and is a constant page turner.It has all the needed characters for a great thriller, from the damsel in distress, the boy with no real family, and the handsome, mysterious Tanek, as well as many other good characters. With the help of Nell and other people they find and seek revenge on the people that murdered Nells' daughter.I thought this was an excellent novel and would reccommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly Novel","review":"I was shocked when I started reading the reviews for this book. I honestly thought maybe there was a different book with the same name. This book is like all of Iris Johansen's novels (the couple I have managed to finish anyways. I keep thinking they'll get better but they don't.) The plot sounds deceptively intriguing, but fails to live up to the back cover. Strong willed girl endangers the life of herself and everyone around her to get revenge, and the rich powerful attractive stranger (almost always a murderer or criminal, but no one seems to let that bother them) steps in to help her and they fall in love within minutes. All this is conveyed through pure dialog. And poorly written, sometimes painful dialog at that. It's like reading a bad soap opera script. It's not a romance novel, it's not a suspense novel, it's not a well-written novel. So if you're looking for any of those, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not the best Johansen book","review":"This is was the first IJ book I've read, and I have honestly read pretty much all her books since this one. Ducking is really great, but the characters could be developed more, there was so much written about Nells \\"transformation\\" but I would have like more dialouge between Nell and Tanek. I would love to read a sequel of this book because I really liked the characters both are strong, but vulernable. The side characters, although well written, took on too much of an importance in this story.After reading Dead Aim, Face of Deception, Killing Game, Long after midnight, its obvious that this is not IJs best book but a great read. You won't be disapointed, you'll just want to read more about these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ugly duckling","review":"Very fast reading and very insightful.Like all of Iris Johansen they are witty and well written.

Just felt more of a connection WITH the characters inFirestorm (Eve Duncan), but more of a connection BETWEEN the characters with this one. However, it was pretty confusing and complex at parts, and the ending was just too abrupt. I actually think I likedFirestorm (Eve Duncan)better, so try that one first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbeliveable","review":"I guess if it takes only a fall from a balcony to become beautiful I'm going to get in line.

I would skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ugly Duckling","review":"Sadly, the more likeable characters of this novel are not the main characters. Oh, the main characters are not horrible, but they're boring in comparison to their friends. I picked this up recognizing Iris Johanson as a romance writer and this isn't really a romance. I was very disappointed that the hero NEVER tells the heroine that he loves her. That he slept with another woman after developing feelings for her didn't help either. The majority of the time Nell was thoroughly unpleasant to be around. The author killed off two characters after letting the reader form an attachment to them.

After that, I'm off, to another book. For a \\"thriller\\" that should be as springy as a tiger on its prey, I'm finding this one nearly dead in the water.

Johansen tried to show that Nell was growing out of the awkwardness of immaturity and self-doubt by giving her a much more appealing face. I remain unconvinced. An appealing face she may have, but her lack of maturity, her selfishness and self-righteousness for revenge at whatever cost even if it is to step all over everyone who cares for her makes her seem more like the Terminator in my eyes. The plot jumps wildly all over the place. And as I mentioned, the constant gabbing about nonessential things was irritating at best.

All but this collection featured outdated \\"contemporary\\" stories about growing up. Guys Write for Guys Read, on the other hand, totally delivered! The mostly nonfiction stories and/or cartoons by recognizable authors (Stephen King, Gary Paulsen, Walter Dean Myers, the creator of The Simpsons) are interesting and entertaining from start to finish! My husband laughed hysterically at one of the stories (involving bodily functions-go figure), and my two kids (6 and 4) picked it up once they realized that it contained interesting cartoons.

The shorts cover a wide-range of topics from the silly to the dead-serious. In short, there's something in this book for every taste. I think it will be a popular book for my classroom library.There's only one little thing that I'm hesitant about: there's one illustration in the book that shows recognizable male genitalia on a monster drawn when the artist was in fifth grade (I think).

My only quibble is with the tempo of the Andrea Gabrieli Magnificat -- it seems a bit too brisk to me, given the space in which it would have been performed and the likely distance between the three choirs in San Marco, an effect which I believe Gloriae Dei Cantores is trying to replicate. There were times when the sound became \\"muddy,\\" and a slower tempo would have mitigated that effect. Some might also argue with doubling the TTBB choir with low brass instruments (with no other doubling in the piece), but that's really a matter of personal taste. Gabrieli would have used whatever he had on hand, so if all he had were sackbuts, sackbuts he would have used.This is a good investment if you're looking for music performed in one of Venice's -- and the world's -- finest cathedrals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious hatred: This book is full of it.","review":"While I'm an atheist... and a non-Muslim (by descent), I still feel that the author is strictly an anti-Islam guy, trying to portray his extrapolated metaphorical platitudes look sagacious.

The book strictly demonstrates the narrow-minded precincts of the author's thoughts. The book spells out religious hatred from cover to cover.

Once I did, I really can't get enough of this series...and thus, have to order the DVDs! The story is about 4 geniuses who happen to be nerds, and the stories dealing with their lack of social skills is hilarious.

I don't have the date of his death on hand, but I'm sure this string quartet from 1979 qualifies as one of those. 76 minutes, the back says.And most of that time is used up stirring some sort of celestial-sized pot of sighing dissonance, intermittent silences, and a small dose of stabbing.

The characters are so not likable, maybe except the frog. What a bore!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds absurd, but I've been there. It's real!","review":"I, too, had a relationship with someone who could not help but be clumsy and inept, although he tried his best. My situation was also pathetic, as was the heroine in this tale. I related to so much in the novel, particularly to the oblique unawareness of the husband. At first I believed as did our heroine, that he calculated his behavior; however, I eventually realized that he couldn't help it.Cudos to Jane for her insight into the microcosms of the erudite and infamous."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a tease","review":"After reading a review of this book, the plot sounded dark and funny. I waited for it to take a twist or turn, and it never did. The author leads you to believe something big and unexpected is bound to happen, and you wait till the last page for it, and it never comes. There were numerous ends in the book left flailing with no explanation or resolution, and the ending was a complete let down. I wouldn't spend any money reading this book, wait till it goes to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"A good conversation starter for a book club, but something I would not have finished except that it was on the reading list for our club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatta Drag","review":"Reading the Dangerous Husband is a little like having a world-weary bowel movement -- painfully excrementory, but not without a wee bit of relief when it's all through.The characters are hardly credible and the story line is just, well, shall we say, contemptible? It was obviously written post haste with an eye on an even quicker buck. Oh, well, I suppose there are better ways to turn a trick.Jane, please, oh, please, keep your day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary Decrepitude","review":"The gushing Amazon reviewer must really possess a tawdry mind to appreciate this yuppie farrago, probably owns the entire Adrian Lyne video collection too. Ha!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of fun to read but ultimately disappointing.","review":"This book was a page-turner and pretty juicy, but in the end I kept wondering, What's the point? It had enough meaninlgess events and left me with enough unanswered questions that I frankly didn't care. I never felt any connection with any of the characters, and really only felt sorry for the pets. The relationship between the narrator and Dennis never seemed loving or intimate--just two people living in the same house, having sex, and talking to each other almost like hostile, defensive strangers. Their motives--for getting married, for staying married, for the things Dennis did--were not clear, yet also not that much of a mystery because they didn't make sense. A little more detail and character development would've been nice. I kept waiting for it all to come together, and when it didn't, it left me feeling unsatified."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book Club Book","review":"I highly recommend A Dangerous Husband as a book club selection. The men and women in my group all came away with something different. The most interesting conclusion was that this was a classic story of spousal abuse with the couple spreading the injuries around at all the different hospitals only the outrageous stories of how the \\"accidents\\" happened were true. A darkly funny read with a great climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky, amusing, unusual read","review":"I found The Dangerous Husband at the library. I finished it in a day, because I had to find out how she got out (if she got out) of the situation. This was a refreshing change in writing style that had me chuckling through the whole book while scared for her life. I can't think of another book from recent memory that had me smiling yet frightened at the same time. Very unusual. I enjoyed this book because it was different from the usual fiction I read. It is a quick read. I'm going to look for her first book and await any future writings of Ms. Shapiro."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple review","review":"The Dangerous Husband is annoying and overwritten. The story and characters are not engaging. Most importantly, the writer apparently is under the delusion that she's amusing, that her storytelling is funny. I didn't chuckle even once. Not clever, not insightful, not significant. The whole thing felt dated and desperate. Near the end, I actually was making a mental note to myself never to read anything by Jane Shapiro again. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but not particularly enjoyable","review":"At first, I thought about giving up on the book. The relationship between the characters--particularly their sex life--seemed nothing but unpleasant. Toward the end, however, it became both funny and menacing, which I assume was the author's intent all along. This mood should have emerged earlier, however, to make some of the protagonist's decisions plausible. The degree of their isolation was difficult to believe, as well. Couldn't she just have gotten a job and made friends through it? That's what the rest of the world does, after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Abuse Your Wife Without Even Trying","review":"Author Shapiro presents a new kind of husband: the involuntary wife abuser. Dennis is so physically clumsy that he cannot help falling on top of, and dumping heavy objects on his poor spouse. She suffers various injuries as a result of their numerous, undesired physical skirmishes, and she finally decides that the only way out of this situation is to kill her husband. After all she can't even have sex with the man without fearing for her life. She decides on murder; changes her mind. She flees; then returns. Various events of Dennis's past life now become known, and once again should murder be an option?The novel does parallel a spousal abuse situation, but in sort of an upside down way. Shapiro tries something risky in writing about all of this: she makes the situation hilariously funny. She succeeds, and delivers a highly entertaining black comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"At the deeper levels...","review":"At first I was very intrigued by this author and his narrative. The story seemed to have a lot to offer. But the problem we all have when reading spiritual books is how to separate the wheat from the chaff. Someone who had done their homework, could undoubtedly, read the literature and put together their own book. What really separates true experiences from imagination? And what good is imagination in achieving greater a spiritual connection with the universe?For me, the deciding factor is, whether or not the work speaks to me. I set the book down for a few days and meditated on the contents. As I reviewed the book and it's themes, I am sorry to say, I think it is more likely a scientific reduction of the shamanic experience to an agenda of fighting global warming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I bought this for my son, then I read it too.

The tale of the trip is interesting, but please spare me the struggle bit. It is as if no other teen has ever had a struggle with his father's personality.

As a father, a son, and a 20 year pilot, this book crystallizes for me many of the unsettling, amorphous feelings that still surface, long after the focus and intensity of those self defining roles have passed. This is an adventure story about youth, flying, and discovery for sure, and it is a great one.

It should not be forgotten that these two sets of Talmudic readings and lectures are not all that is there - Levinas offers no less than five more Talmudic readings in *Beyond the Verse*. There is, as should be expected, much overlap in the style and format of Levinas's teachings. So, if my arithmetic is correct, we have 9 + 3 + 5 = 17 Talmudic readings by Levinas; although I might go further to claim that, in a large part, Levinas's oeuvre (both philosophical and religious) is one sustained and comprehensive Talmudic reading, or a midrash on Torah."},{"rating":"2","title":"real page turner","review":"The book came immediately and in the condition it said it was in.This story is so outrageous its hard to put down!

Little blue light around the water gauge window is a nice touch. Cute little \\"ding\\" when it's done.

The Breville is very sleek and looks great on my counter. I like the way that the water display lights up when you turn it on, and the bell at the end of the cycle is helpful without being annoying. The inside of the kettle is stainless steel and there doesn't seem to be any abnormal taste to the water after heating.There are two things that I don't like about this kettle. First, there is a lot of noise when heating. Most likely because it's not double walled, which brings me to my second point. The outside of the kettle gets hot, really, really hot. If you can't lift it and pour with one hand this kettle isn't for you. I burned my wrist enough to raise a blister just by brushing past the side of the kettle.I would have given it five stars if it had been double walled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Last","review":"This kettle looks great and works great until it breaks.

Eventually after about three years of use the kettle completely broke. As this appliance is pricey, it is my expectation that it should last longer than that. I'm exploring other options for my next purchase, possibly a similarly priced Krups kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a re-design","review":"Like some other reviewers have found - this kettle's heating connection wears out.

That one also failed in the same way and now does not turn on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Good quality, efficient, good size.

The only drawback for me is that the on button is at the bottom of the unit so you have to take your hand off the handle after you fill it rather than setting it down and turning it on in one fall swoop... really a non issue.Oh, and the blueish glow is a very nice touch. Trivial, but definitely a conversation starter."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent electric kettle","review":"Breville sent me this model to replace another Breville tea kettle which broke within the warranty period. I was so pleased with it that I purchased another one for our vacation home. It is an efficient and good looking kettle and because it is stainless steel it doesn't leave a bad taste in the boiled water as other tea kettles do that I have purchased in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets things HOT!","review":"Excellent quality-made kettle. Heats fast. Love the glowing lighted fill indicator, which goes on when the water is heating. Only negative - and it may be a big one to some - is that the exterior of the metal kettle itself (not the base on which it stands) is very HOT after water has boiled. Would prefer that it has some kind of built-in insulated buffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a pleasure to use so far","review":"I'm enjoying the kettle very much. It has a lot of nice thoughtful details, and there hasn't been any noticeable off-taste of the water. I just wish the small amount of plastic it does have could be glass instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it worked!","review":"We purchased this Breville electric kettle a few years ago and it was great while it worked. Heats up fast. Turns itself off and a bell dings when it boils. Unfortunately, things began breaking down. First, the light went out. Not a big deal since it wasn't necessary for the overall function. Then, we'd flip the switch to the \\"on\\" position and nothing would happen at all unless we removed the pot from the base and repositioned it. This was very inconvenient and annoying, because you had to listen to hear whether or not the pot had \\"kicked on,\\" so we called Breville support and they kindly sent us a new base. That worked for a couple of weeks and then the same problem was back. This time when we called, Breville was not so supportive. So now we have a lovely stainless steel pot that really can only function as a pricey flower vase! For the price we paid, I would expect better quality. Too bad few things are meant to last more than a few years anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for more than occasional use","review":"After having my wonderful trusty Hobbes electric tea kettle for over 10 years till I dropped it last year, I needed a kettle that would work well with repeated use. After reading the reviews, I chose the Breville Ikon. It looks great and, at first worked well, but what a mistake! After about a year, I started having the same problem with the connection on the base not working. First it was occasional; now I can hardly get it to work at all! What a rip-off! The mfg should change the engineering on this so it works for more than a year....especially at this price!Breville SK500XL Ikon Cordless 1.7-Liter Stainless-Steel Electric Kettle"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY FOUND A GOOD ONE!","review":"This one heats immediately, leaves absolutely no foul odor in the water, as many do.

Thats what got me hooked on getting it. Only after 1-2 months the thing started not working properly. Whatever the connection from the base to the unit itself is not designed very well. The connection is all misaligned after normal use and wont turn on. You have to tweak the metal tabs at the bottom so it makes a connection with the base. This only helps for a few days before you have to do it again. It has only been a year and now it won't turn on because it breaks the circuit breaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasts a year, company does not stand behind their product.","review":"We bought this tea kettle January 2010. Recently we had a problem with the contacts connecting and the water boiling. I contacted the company and because the warranty expired I was told that I would have to purchase a new base, which I did. When the base arrived it did not work. I contacted the company to let them know and they said they do not take returns. So now I sit with two bases and a tea kettle that doesn't work. I have read most of the reviews and have found others that had the same problem. When I first purchased my tea kettle I was very happy with it as are many who rated it currently 5 stars. I am curious as to what they think after a year when it stops working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty base design","review":"The kettle no longer gets power from the base. It appears that the contacts in the base have become corroded. It is still possible to make it work be swiveling it a lot, but that is a pain. A pity because ti's great when it works. I'm thinking of buying a replacement base for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT TOO SURE","review":"I was seriously thinking of purchasing this kettle so I went to William Somona to check it out in person before purchasing on Amazon. Although this kettle has all the features I want what steered me away from purchasing the kettle was the way the lid opens and closes. The store had two of the same model kettles on display one of the kettles I could not open the top latch. I actually had to pry the lid up. Then it would open a couple times and then get stuck closed again. The other kettle on display was just fine. This lead me to believe that probably with use you'd have to pry the lid up when you add water. So for now I will keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust!","review":"I'd almost decided that after testing half a dozen electric kettles, the Breville SK500XL Ikon was the one. It looked top quality and I loved the blue light that illuminates the water level. And although the water boil auto shut-off takes about 7-10 seconds too long to do its thing, I could live with that. It's also about 20% larger than need be, taking up too much space on the counter. Again, I could live with this. But what I can't live with is the rust forming at the bottom of the kettle. After just a week, I noticed there's rust forming where the bottom of the pot meets the sides. Apparently the seam isn't stainless steel or water has leaked below, causing rust on the underside which must not be stainless steel. Regardless, this is unacceptable. Breville needs to check this design because it's flawed if this is what happens when things aren't 100% properly welded.Returning to Amazon, and the search continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous design","review":"Bottle surface is so hot that burnt our handsInside the kettle got rusted that we no longer dare to use the boiled water to wash our baby bottlesI had to stay away from Krups because I kept getting leaky kettles, but this product is not much better and even dangerousvery disappointed for a product of this expensive price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I have read all the previous reviews and decided to buy despite of couple bad reviews.

They both failed the same way. I know a lot of people are happy with the Breville kettles but most don't realized after a year or two of constant use, the electric contact between the base and the kettle will soon wear off. That means, the on button will not light and the unit will not work. I called Breville and found out that this new unit has the same electric contact mechanism. If you plan to use this for more than one or two years, I would consider another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly...","review":"For an Englishman abroad (i.e. I need gallons of tea a day), this product looked like the bees knees - the best kettle out there. And it is without doubt a good-looking machine with lots of great features. But unfortunately it has one fatal flaw - the hot water that comes out of it smells of plastic. I thought this would pass with a bit of use but no, the nasty boiled plastic smell remained. In the end I sent it back and bought a Braun instead. Shame, in every other respect this is an excellent machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective kettle","review":"Disappointing performance.

I contacted Breville, and because I did not have my receipt they asked me the batch number on the unit. I provided it, and I was told this number showed when the kettle was manufactured and that it was manufactured 3 years ago. Although the item could have been sold (to me) far later than the manufacturing date, Breville is using this manufacturing date as a reason to deny the 1 year warranty agreement.Don't be fooled by the sleek design and name. Breville is apparently not interested in standing behind it's products any longer. This kettle is entirely too expensive to last for such a short time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kettle lasted just over a year and died","review":"A nice looking pricey kettle but it has a problematic heating base. Shortly after about a year of use the base's electrical connector stopped functioning making the unit useless as it wouldn't heat the water. The warranty is only good for a year so Breville would not replace or repair. When I contacted Breville they offered me a discount if I wanted to purchase the same kettle but who wants to spend more money on the same kettle after such poor performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light shorts out","review":"After using this kettle for a year the light on the side, under the handle began blinking on a off, like a strobe. I saw a few other people on here had the same problem. It still functions but what really irritates me is that when I called Breville to ask about repairing or replacing it they were rude and couldn't offer any help. Not the type of company I will ever do business with again. Buy from another, more reputable company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pot burns out after 1 year","review":"I have had this hot water maker for a year and this morning I saw the element was burned out. Last night I smelled a burning smell and saw the pot was hot even though I had not used it for a couple of days (it was plugged in). I unplugged it and kept it unplugged until I went to use it today and saw it wasn't working. Now I will have to buy a new pot but this time I will buy a different brand. This pot is too expensive to need replacement every year plus I worry about the fire hazard. I suggest others with this brand only plug it in before use. I kept mine plugged in, but even so, that SHOULD have NOT been a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken in a short while","review":"i first purchased the SK550 model. in less than 3 uses it had to be returned for warranty repair/replacement. when they sent it back, guess what, they sent me the SK500 model.i didn't have problems with the unit initially - not even the bad smell that seems to impact a lot of people. however, just as soon as the warranty period is over - BOOM - the unit stopped working.i am a household of one - i used it only several times a week - not every day. so for it to go out on me in that short period of time is a waste. i liked it otherwise and it looked good. now i'm really debating if i should get another one. really have doubts though."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible kettle","review":"I bought this kettle some time ago. I hate it for the following reasons:1. Very noisy from start to end. VERY NOISY!2. When the water boils, it continues boiling water for 2-3 minutes (why?? hellooo.. it's already boiled!) and it doesn't go off. While boiling all this time, it produces SO MUCH steam that all my cabinets above the kettle become really wet -- it's unbelievable!!What a waste!+ Amazon return policy sucks. I realized that there are better kettle on a market (for example stainless steel electric kettle Krups - the design is much better + no issues that described above) but I was not able to return this kettle to Amazon because it was over 1 month. Very disappointed.

It was used less than once a day for heating water for tea.Judging from the Ikon reviews posted since I purchased mine in 2006 and the reviews of many other electric kettles on Amazon, I think that I will go back to heating my tea water on the stove using a simple whistling tea kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, except no longer shuts off","review":"This worked well for about two years.

It looks very nice and the quality is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Kettle","review":"Things we love about this kettle: Nice big, easy to grip handle. Swivel base, so you can rotate the kettle to grip the handle as you wish. Big opening in lid and cylindrical design allow for easy filling and cleaning. Large spout really pours- no waiting for a little dribble at a time. Boils super fast! Auto turn off. Oh, and it has a neat filter which catches mineral deposits so they don't get in your tea.Cautions- it should be cleaned regularly to avoid mineral deposits which seem to cause the kettle to vibrate more while the water is heating up. Also, the slow open hinge operates with a plastic gear. WE are concerned about how long that will last, but- so far, so good. Just close it gently. WE're very happy with our choice- looked at them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasts about a year and a half.","review":"I purchased one of these for my home and liked it enough to buy a second one for use at work. About 18 months later, the first one started failing to shut off consistently. I'd come back to the kitchen 20 minutes later and it would still be boiling -- dangerous. Shortly thereafter, the lid on the one at work began getting stuck open and can be frustrating to close. So far I haven't replace either of them, but they continue to degrade. The light on my kettle at home now flashes frantically while boiling. I would've recommended these kettles heartily a year ago, but they are too expensive to replace every two years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, solid kettle!","review":"Just bought the Breville Ikon to replace an inferior Chef's Choice model that gave out after just 10 months.

Nowadays, there are several choices out there, but this is certainly one of the best I've owned to date! It's a nice looking appliance and is solid and well built. It's much quieter than other rapid boil kettles that I've owned.

After looking at the reviews on the Breville, I went ahead and bought it at Bed,Bath, & Beyond with my 20% off coupon. When I first rinsed it out and boiled a pot of water, I thought I had found a great kettle. However, when I emptied the water and it air-dried I noticed small black spots on the bottom plate on the inside. I rinsed it out with diluted vinegar and tried it again, only for the same thing to happen with even more spots than before. I thought it was a defective product, so I returned it and bought another one. The same thing happened with the second one.

My previous kettle was a Breville too and lasted almost 8 years. Was still working but had developed a leak at the bottom which apparently is to be expected after several years of use.This one is good. I like the blue light that comes on when the water is boiling and the little ring when it shuts off. The button at the top, above the handle makes opening the lid very easy.The only reason for deducting a star from my rating is the shape. Could have been a little more elegant. It looks like cut and sealed from stove pipe.

However, within six months, my boiled water started to have a metallic taste and when I examined the interior, I was surprised to see that there was a ring of worn down metal that was probably the cause of the metallic taste of the hot water. I no longer had a receipt and it was past due any return policy date. Luckily, I purchased it from Bed, Bath, and Beyond and they gave me a store credit---no questions asked. Because they had a limited number/brands of electric kettles, I ultimately purchased an Aroma Hot H20 Xpress at another store.

I have to push it several times, and then it opens only partially and I have to use my hand to open it all the way. For the price I paid for this item, I expected better. If it wasn't for that, I would give it five stars. UPDATE: After about a year of use (I use it at work, an average of 5x a week), water leaked into the water indicator, so it's really difficult to see how much water is in it.

I like stories with action. I like books that have you on the edge of your seat, like Stephan King books or something. Its got to have parts that make your spine shiver and parts that gross you out beyond belief. Im not a fan of simple happy books.The only reason i read the book was for school, I probably wouldn't have picked it up in a library and said, \\"I shall read this book!\\" If I would have had the choice to read it I would have said no. If you are the kind of person that likes a happy story with somewhat saddening parts, then I guess this is a book for you. But if you don't like that kind of thing I advise you to pick something up by: John Saul or Stephan King.Silly people..I am thriteen not twelve..if only one more year had been added"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Alcohal Ruins Your Life!!","review":"I thought Crazy Lady was a good book to read because it really taught me about how alcohol can ruin your life, and how it can affect the people around you. Alcohol is a bad thing to get addicted to because you can get so addicted that you could hurt someone. In Crazy Lady a lady in the neighborhood got drunk so bad someone thought she was going to hurt her son. It is bad to get to addicted so I think you should try and stay away from it. Also if you have children you can get them hurt or taken from you, and that can hurt them just as bad as it can hurt you!! Also I think that people should try to stay away from alcohol because it can hurt you in many ways!! That is what I thought about how this story taught me about alcohol!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion on Vernon","review":"My opinion on Vernon changed because he always stole things and threw things at people, but he realized that thats wrong.Vernon was the kid who would pick on people.Later on in the story he started to get to know some people and realize what he had done.He started to like these people and get to now how nice they are except one person was an alcoholic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy Lady","review":"This book was about a kid named Vernon who gets to know the neighborhoods craziest people,Maxine and her kid who has disabilites.

I learned that mentally challenged kids are really not dumb like everybody thinks. They have their mind and own thoughts. All alchoholics are not bad either. Most people drink because they are stressed or because they are sad or something.I learned that you can never judge a person by what they look like. One person might dress with no clothes matching one another, but they could still have a great personality. I really liked the character Ronald because if he was real there could be a lot learned from him. Vernon was a good character because he was the one that liked him when no one else payed attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy Lady","review":"This book isn't very good. It really is boring.

The main charecter,Vernon, was to goody goody and wanted to solve everyones problems. Ronald, a mentaly challenged boy, didnt really know what as going on around him. Another charecter was Maxine.

He was the main character in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't recomend","review":"To me, this book was not a book I would normally read. It was more like a book that I would have read back in the elementary days. I didn't feel like I could relate to the book in any way at all. This book would have been a good book for learning about differences and disabilities but I do not believe I am doing that. The book does not really have an ending.

Vernon a boy helps the strange Maxine Flooter and her...uh \\"mentally disordered\\" son Ronald. Don't expect any more plot than that. This book was so slow nothing good ever happened. Routine happened all the time. Also, the ending was very predictable. The last three paragraphs were very desperate. About the only thing that kept me going for the last four chapters was seeing if Ronald would talk. If all that weren't enough, the language is too strong at times for a children's book.

The book includes personal interviews with Zuni artisans and insightful information about their ceremonies and culture. Along with the Zuni research, is a story. The story follows the lives of a family of artists and their struggles and accomplishments. The book's subtitle \\"A Tale of Art and Mystery\\" is definately appropriate, although you must read the book to find out the mystery. Included with the text is a multitude of plates and pictures that depict actual Zuni art and Zuni life. The characters from the story are also pictured in the book. I highly recommend this book to those people who are familiar with Zuni culture and to those who know nothing about it. Overall, a very interesting and insightful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Zuni Artists: a tale of academic freedom gone too far","review":"This book is at best a good account of Zuni arts and at worst a sensationalized account of crazy events in Zuni.My major beef with this book is that while making the names of \\"Helen\\" and others in the account fictional, the author published photographs of \\"Helen's\\" actual children and family members. In a small community, one would only need to be vaguely familiar with the story and would know who the authors were talking about. When there are photographs, there is no doubt who the authors are referring to. This breach of academic responsibility has become the hallmark of anthropology in Native communities. This book is one more reason why anthros, Keith and Kathy Cunningham included, are extremely dis-liked in Indigenous communities."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS EDITION","review":"At all costs, please do not ruin your impression of Aristophanes by reading this translation of THE BIRDS.

The story was just a slightly modified version of the original. The effects were also pretty crappy. This movie was obviously made to sell 3D TVs and nothing more.

The truth does not recommend for anything buy the 3D format, but I do recommend the 2D Bluray format is great.To comment on this, I reproduced the 3D content in a 50-inch 3D TV and 3D projector on a scale of 120 inches."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY IF YOUR A BIG FAN","review":"Ok first the good stuff great sound good 3d and if your a Tron fan you will probably enjoy it.For the rest of us the movie is dark all the way through there is no in your face 3d to speak of story line will put you to sleep wait for 2hours and then your treated to one good scene I wont tell you and ruin it I would recomend it only if your a big fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tron 3D","review":"I was very disappointed with this movie.

Anyways the story seemed lacking, spent too much time making everything look pretty all in lights. The 3D effects also were like a 6/10 nothing really flew off the screen at me, you'd think with all those discs flying everywhere one would make it off the screen...but no. There were a few parts where you could really feel the some depth however. I would strongly suggest they not use the 3D as a strong selling point. As for the thing switching between letterbox and 16:9 really wasn't needed and it lessened the 3D effects, and also at times seemed to just happen randomly. Overall it wasn't horrible but really not worth running out to own, there were a few highlights such as Olivia Wild in something you could paint on. The best way to get through it is just think of it as a 2 hour Daft Punk music Video...I probably wouldn't of been so cruel had it not been blown up with ads and hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"What 3D-VERY VERY Disappointing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie in the theather which is why I decided to purchase this movie.

I remember when I first watched it as a kid and could not get over how amazing the film was, but this new addition is just plain shameful. There was no plot hardly at all; the concept of Flynn being gone for nearly 20 years; okay possible, but come on, the best they could do was that a clone took over and Flynn, being the great \`user' could not find a way out other than just doing nothing and spending his time becoming a \\"Zen\\" master; please! Give me a break! I expected so much more! Not too mention that we don't find out whether or not Tron lives or dies at the end, only that he falls into the water and his suit changes color. They don't even fully explain what it is all about with the Isomorphs and why they came into exsistence to begin with. This movie is just crap and lame and any other word you might wish to use.

Could anyone whine anymore!It's a flippin awesome movie GET OVER IT!!!!!! the action is awesome!Tron is the absoulte bomb!The music is cool. its extremely 80's but awesome! The effects were out of this world!They were almost as good as Star Wars graphics.If you're a mom who sees the rating don't beleve it.There's two cuss words in the whole thing and WAY mild.Overall this movie is the bomb!!!!Buy it and wacth it if you haven't already!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't remember","review":"saw this movie back in the 80's and thought it was cool, got both versions to watch and compare. however, re-watching it as 'adults' didn't find the original as entertaining as we once did and the ending just leaves you hanging. can't say that the 'new' one impressed us either. we care for younger children and they enjoyed them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one to own in 3D","review":"The 3D in this movie is fantastic, very well done.

Yes, the light cycle chases are ace and there was some good stuff in it, but on the whole I found it boring.Then I was on holiday and watched Tron Legacy on the plane. What a great film this is, way better than the original. Even on a two inch screen the effects are amazing - Tron Legacy is like watching a fireworks display for 2 hours.The story has all the same problems as the original, and to be honest I think they should make a prequel showing the uprising as that was the most interesting idea in the film.But, on the whole this is a great film and rekindles some memories. By the way, look out for Michael Sheen doing his best David Bowie impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad Disney produced this movie","review":"While the effects & story were cool, Disney isn't.This movie could have used some serious violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS!","review":"After enjoying my 3-D LG TV for a while, I bought this movie and it is terrible in 3-D!

I liked the move but would go for the cheaper 2d version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tron Legacy","review":"The 3D and cast are excellent. What is lacking is character development.

I'll never buy an Amazon 3D movie online again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tron: Legacy","review":"This Tron is a good Tron. I am a bit of a fan of the original tron. The original Tron had/has a younger jeff bridges in it. This Tron: Legacy has an older jeff Bridges. I am a person that bases movies on their original counterparts. I really like to older Tron. The newer Tron: Legacy is pretty good, but I am conparing it to the older Tron. I really can not do that since each movie has its own guidelines to go by. Tron was an original, Tron: Legancy is a Tron of the future - Tron. SO, each has it's own point of interest going for it. I would say. Stop here with the Trons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment","review":"This movie is by no means a perfect 5 star movie. It is one worth seeing though.

The movie made no sense at all, and was ultimately terribly stupid. Kind of like Speed Racer, or something, but without the over-the-top CG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Before I begin my barrage of criticisms, let me say something: I have not seen the original, so what you are about to read isn't the rant of a fanboy.This movie is utterly laughable, first of all, the plot is completely predictable, by the middle of the movie I could predict without error everything that would happen. The characters are lifeless shells, it makes you wonder if the actors were even trying. The special effects are pretty lame as well, the ships look silly and the glass-shattering injuries look dumb. The most impressive thing I can think of is seeing two Jeff Bridges, and that wears off quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"failure","review":"disney absolutely fails at life i recieved the tron 2 disc bluray and dvd combo for easter and put in the code to transfer the movie and magically nothing happened i call disney call back later. and people wonder why people pirate movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"Husband liked it","review":"My husband liked it so much that he watched it twice.

But TRON LEGACY has about as much substance as cotton candy. We've seen the plot all too many times--good guy goes bad, turns into a megalomaniac wanting to take over the world. The acting is merely posturing and programmed.

Not watchable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. I'm amazed.","review":"Flynn sends a secret signal to his son from the digital realm. Sam deciphers it and makes it to the Grid. There, along with Quorra and his Father, he discovers a plot by the ruler Clue. The 3 decide to escape and save the digital realm. We know a human can enter the Grid, but can a person from the Grid come across to the real world?This movie is incredible. It's far exceeds the 1st Tron film in every way. 2 of my favorite actors, Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner, are back and make this another memorable movie. The special effects, plot, and acting are as good as it gets. There is also plenty of action and drama. You can't miss this incredible sequel that outshines the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tron Sequel","review":"I watched the original Tron when I was a kid.The sequel is actually following its tradition with a twist.Really recommended for it's fx, something that hasn't seen before not even in the original Tron (because its really old, but innovative in its time)The plot could of been more complex, but is entertaining.Any Tron fans out there, I think you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this movie","review":"A lot of people hate this movie. I am not one of those people. I actually enjoyed this movie. I thought it was a faithful extension of the original and the special effects were great.The 3D is very tasteful. I.e. no obvious gimmicks with characters through things towards the camera to get a reaction from the audience.If you like the original movie or are simply a fan if Sci-Fi you should enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"3D Rating only","review":"I try to write reviews for people who are wanting to get 3d blu-rays, but are scared of wasting the money on a movie that has no 3d effect. I have a panasonic 55 inch gt 600 hz 3d plasma with a 600hz 3d rated Monster hdmi cable. This rating is strictly for the 3d quality only. At the very begining there is a message that tells you this film was not intended for 3 d but convert to 3 d(only a few scenes are 3d). The 3 d quality on the certain scenes are good however, the rest of the film is a big disappointment. In my honest opinion I would not have purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music Score","review":"This movie is so boring. There is not much drama in this movie. There is no philosophical value. It is very different from the original. I see this movie as an action flick but this movie has too much talking that makes no sense IMO. I do like the visual. Visual is very good. I also love the score. I am going to get the sound track.2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst 3d movie","review":"This is one of the worssssst 3D movie I'ever seen.70% of the scenses were shoot in 2D.They should tell up front that most of the scenses were shot in 2d, instead of being when it's played.If you're looking 3d movie, this is definitely not the one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tron is the Man","review":"I saw this movie in 3D in theaters and I loved it.

Tron stimulated the mind in a way that was exciting and somehow put you right there with the players. Tron: Legacy brings back that excitement and builds the story from the beginning to a thrilling climax. Bruce Boxleitner and Jeff Bridges are the inventors and players in both movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT","review":"I watched this for about 10-15 minutes and turned it off.

And the only reason I made it through was because there was nothing better to watch.The story picks up hooking the first movie, and introducing us to Jack's (Jeff Bridges) son, who has grown up without a dad, and has become a rebellious youth.The visual effects were fantastic. The story was incredibly lacking in plot, characters, and theme development. It wasn't believable . I wasn't drawn in. I wasn't hooked.The original was a lot better, in the story, characters, and theme.I would not buy this for my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"must be a \\"tronster\\" to enjoy it","review":"I purchased this for my 10 year old son because he liked the concept of \\"going into the game.\\" While the cinematography was good, the story line did not hold the attention of my son, myself or my sci-fi loving husband.

This combo packaging sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tron Legacy Shipping and Product Review","review":"I pre-ordered this item and got it a day before the actual release date! It was in perfect condition, still wrapped in the plastic. A great family movie, hardly a foul word is spoken and a good message of fatherly love. The BEST part of the movie is the MUSIC! A great sci-fi movie with incredible visual effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something of a disappointment","review":"I tend to make my reviews of products with hundreds of reviews brief since there is little to add to the existing ones.The bottom line is that this film has fabulous production values, great acting, wonderful action sequences, but a plot that is so thin as to be nonexistent. This movie almost fell in the same category as the wretched \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\". What redeemed it in my eyes was the way the actors made the most out of the material they were given to work with. Jeff Bridges is particularly impressive in a dual role. The plot is nothing more than a few cliches strung together - growth of a rebellious son of a famous father under pressure, a monster created by a modern Frankenstein, fallen hero redeems himself at the final moment, etc. Surely the screenwriters can do better?But ultimately the acting and action kept me involved. Recommended, but Shakespeare this isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Tron is a favorite of mine. Tron Legacy is a disappointment, and waaay to derivative. The threats are the same (rogue program). The games and many scenes are derived from the original movie, but the games lack imagination the second time around. All the bad guys are eliminated, but instead of the game ending, more bad guys appear. And Flynn's off the grid living quarters, and sound effects, are right out of the last scene of 2001, where Keir Dullea is on Jupiter (or wherever it was he landed). Michael Sheen does a good job, as usual. The sound's not bad, and the visual composition of the fights is good, but the writing is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and silly","review":"I loved seeing Jeff Bridges and Bruce, but this was long and boring.

The sound is outstanding with at least a 5+1 speaker system turned up some what. In some ways the music and movie balance reminds me of Bladerunner which also was outstanding.

A definite buy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst 3D i've ever seen!!!!!","review":"The movie itself is not bad, but i bought a Blu-Ray 3D thinking that i was really going to enjoy it. Well at the begining of the movie you get \\"Several scenes of the movies were shot in 2D\\" That was an understatement!!!! I didn't really see anything on 3D and i kept my glasses on the entire movie.If you are interest in buying the 3D version of this movie, please don't, just buy the regular Blu-Ray and you will be getting the same dvd. I gave it 2 stars because the movie is not that bad, but they should not claim is 3D when not even 10% of the movie was shot in 3D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I'd heard","review":"I had heard a lot about this movie, and was quite excited when I saw it go on sale, so I picked it up, and wish I hadn't. The special effects are beautiful (hence not giving it a 1 star rating) but the plot is so boring. Acting is great, and really everything about the movie was fine, but I found myself having a difficult time staying focused on the movie, and my family, with whom I was watching with, felt the same way. None of us had seen the original film from the '80s, but we were told it wasn't necessary and that we'd \\"Catch right on.\\" There must've been something in the original we needed to know, because now we have another blu-ray sitting on the shelf that will never be watched again. At least I purchased it on sale..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An anti-Nazi story? really?","review":"Putting the plot aside, I would say this movie is a mediocre Hollywood special effects movie.I wanted desperately to see the original after watching this just to remember what 'color' was.Here's the thing:1. You are inside the computer/net! really? didn't see much in there. Few if any references to RAM, bits, CPUs, Facebook, email, etc. Computer games? yes, only what we have seen before in the original Tron.2. You are inside the computer/net: You can make a movie with no bounds. You can change gravity, you can do anything! Friggin World of Warcraft is more intersting than this monochrome city with dark clouds above it!3. Go rent the orginal and use these discs to put drinks on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where does this standing in Disney","review":"This movie is a graphic intensive movie but looking at the story line and actors and feeling-good-after-watching, it was not so satisfying. I mean no offense, nerds, who loved computers and last Tron so much, directed this movie. It was a good movie but it was not the best from Disney. Disney usually makes better movies, more frufilling movies than this.But 3D was good. Quality was great. Movie rewards are sweet. You need to have 3D monitors, player, and glasses to watch this. When you don't have any of this items, the computer does not play it. I know it because I only dont have 3D monitor and 3D bluray does not get played.This is a one-time- thrilling movie. but nothing more than that. It is boring to think about it or to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Previews that never end.","review":"This is a great DVD to buy if you want to watch previews, because apparently there's no way to skip them. I recommend you rent this first, so you know what you're in for. Then, when you discover you can't watch the movie you actually got the DVD to see, you can send it back without losing any money beyond what it cost to rent.I don't understand what goes on in the heads of Disney executives who think that when consumers sit down to watch a movie, they first want to watch a lot of advertisements. Especially when those advertisements come on every damn time they want to watch the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"doesn't cover dark circles","review":"it's a good concealer. however i was looking for something that would cover my dark circles as well. i feel like it works a lot better for blemishes on your face than under the eyes.

Because the characters are real (i.e. CNN's crew) it was credible.But the most moving part was the background music. This would make an awesome CD to own, ranking it right up there with Black Hawk Down Sountrack. I can't find any reference as to the availability of this in a soundtrack, but if it exists......I WANT IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Camera","review":"I wish people wouldn't write good reviews about this camera. For the amount this camera is, you can do a lot better. I love the video feature, but taking pictures indoors is horrible. The flash is not very good and the pictures come out dark. And don't even try to take pictures without the flash because they are going to come out extremely blurry. You have to have a very steady hand if you want the pictures to come out good, and that's if the subjects aren't moving. I have tried the various scene modes in the camera, and it still doesn't do anything, infact, if you use the indoor portrait mode and you take pictures with the flash on, they are still blurry. I would go with a Sony if you want bright pictures. I'm thinking of buying one and selling this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent camera","review":"Excellent tiny camera with amazing LCD and crisp photos.

But only a few.The first, is that it does take decent candid videos. But even my phone can do that. I'm looking for better photos and this camera does not perform well. You have to have an incredibly still hand to take decent pictures with what seems like a VERY slow shudder. Inevitably, I get blurry photos. The reason I give it 2 stars is because of its form factor, and some of the features that can make it \\"cool\\". When I broke the LCD, I bought a canon and couldn't have been more happy that I busted this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommned.","review":"I bought this camera yesterday and I'm 90% sure I am returning it tomorrow.The indoor picture quality is not what I was expecting. I tested out a few pictures of my pets, they didn't seem so bad, but when I tested it out on people...they were awful. They looked like the picture quality of the basic kodak digital camera. If someone had glasses, the light would reflect off of them everytime. Outdoor pictures are good, but you can't always go outside for every picture you take!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lasting - great deal","review":"This was my first digital camera that I purchased in 2005. I bought a refurbished one for almost 3/4 of the retail price, which was a great deal. As of 2009, I still have this camera. It has served every purpose needed. The thing I like most about this camera is that it starts up in about 1 second, and takes a picture very quickly. I am always sniper shooting people. It is on the bigger and heavier side, but when it came out it was the real deal. The zoom is really good and can get really close. The only problems I have are taking pictures when its fairly dark, and with some light. I am looking for a new camera, but that is only because I want a smaller one, and this one is so scratched up.I highly recommend this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for outdoor shots","review":"This is a great little camera if you do a lot of outdoor photo shoots of still objects. I have 3 small children, and it doesn't work too well for my photo needs. I take lots of indoor pictures which most of the time turn out pretty dark unless I have it super bright in my house, but that isn't very often. I tried to take pictures at my son's kindergarten graduation in his classroom, but it was too dark to get even one shot. I had to get video of him to be able to see him at all. Not so great for kids in motion either, they are blurry.Video option is great though. I guess I use this option most on my camera. I have had this one about a year, and I am going for a canon with IS (image stabalization) now. I will retire this camera to my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design and Even Poorer Customer Service","review":"LOVED this camera until it broke one year later. I mean it completely broke. It's dead. The battery power died during a photo shoot and killed the camera. Now it won't even turn on. See my post in the forum on this page for more info. The short of it all is, do NOT buy Kodak. My GF has a Canon Elph and it's far more amazing than anything Kodak makes.

For me, Robert Witte's main goal wasn't just to teach the reader how to use (modern) test equipment, but to give the reader some of the knowledge/intuition that he has gained throughout his career. Each chapter is planted with little \\"gold nuggets\\"--derived from real life application (not a text book experience). I say this with much joy. As an engineer, I've been exposed to many, many engineers with varying experiences and knowledge on using test equipments. But none have demonstrated the ability to collate his/her ideas on this subject matter of great importance as the author demonstrates. After all, when you're dealing in the nano or pico range, it's nice to be intimately aware of your measurement device and its inherent errors.

It seems this is a common phenomenon even today, since I see people defending an obvious (I did see the COMMERCIAL) commercial for Wall Mart, surely paid (indirectly?) by Wall Mart itself. Yes folks, this commercial, just like the Fed Ex commercial (that many people including me paid to see) Cast Away should fool no one (but unfortunately it does). This is even more suspicious that those \\"experts\\" that give world wide tours (without charging!, which proves they are being paid for their propaganda by \\"unknown\\" sources) DENYING the existence of subliminal messages (why would someone bother denying that?). If you want to be a useful fool go ahead and buy this (hey I did buy this to see the \\"other side\\" of the debate but this is not it, and I was suckered) if not, better go and observe a real Wall Mart yourself (a sad experience to be sure)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst propadanda piece I have ever seeen","review":"I can't believe this! I have seen portions of this slick propaganda piece repeatedly because it is sponsored by WALMART themselves. That is like writing an honest autobiography--it just does not happen.

Not worthy of critical analysis, avoids issues of human cost! On and on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not associates - Prisoners","review":"Wal-Mart doesn't have associates - they're prisoners. I wonder if the makers of this film, the Galloways, have ever been inside a Wal-Mart store. If they had, any store, they would see the horror. Illegal aliens, overworked and sad-faced employees forced to manufacture politeness as if they were living in North Korea, a lowering of the standard of living in communities. Look, I shopped at Wal-Mart last week. It's hard. I know. But I'm going to do my best to stop going to Wal-Mart. This film is dishonest and corrupt and the worst kind of false propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this propaganda","review":"First off, yes, I did watch this movie. It plays like a corporate press release. This film likes to cite how good Wal-Mart is for the economy, based on how much they pay in taxes. I would argue that the thousands of \\"mom & pop\\" businesses that have been displaced (destroyed is probably a more accurate word) around the country by a Wal-Mart opening in their town generated an equal amount (if not more, since they don't have an army of lobbyists in Washington looking out for their interests). I find it highly suspicious that this \\"pro\\" Wal-Mart documentary was slapped together in time to compete against the excellent \\"Wal-Mart: the High Cost of Low Prices\\" by Robert Greenwald.

But they offer the lowest prices and I need to save every penny I have living in this horrible economy where the rich get all the tax breaks and I'm left with nothing. Wal-Mart makes up for it's low prices by giving their employees a low pay check and having tax payers pay for their medical. My neighbor works and Wal-Mart. She does it because she has no place else to go. And she has a child she has to support so if she loses her job she will be in a very bad situation. Wal-Mart is a horrible horrible cancer on this world and one day it's going to kill us all.Oh, and Wal-Mart stores are total dumps. With the amount of money the company has you'd think they could pay a few extra people some money to clean the place up. But we all know why they don't, don't we?

The sound quality is pretty good, not great, but good enough to capture the artistry of this short-lived bluesman. The radio studio cuts on acoustic provide a glimpse of another side of Freddie King's guitar talents that are largely unknown--solo acoustic. He modestly claims that he's out of his element playing an acoustic, but he does a great job, of course.The centerpiece to this great CD is his flooring version of \\"Ain't Nobody's Business If I Do\\" (this is one of the live cuts with a full band).

Because I live near the Chesapeake Bay, I am especially interested in the subject of Pfiesteria and its threat to our environment. Thank you Mr. Powlik for helping to raise awareness about these issues. But back to the story...it's gripping and moves at a great pace.

SEA CHANGE started off reminding me of the movie THE FLESH EATERS; unfortunately, after a few introductionary deaths, you have to wade through over 400 pages of talk and speculation about \\"the slick\\". Amidst all the talk, there occasionally happens something that might be classified as \\"action\\", but don't expect the pace to pick up or the excitiemnt to mount; those moments are as dull as the endless conversations.

The menace du jour in protagonist Brock Garner's life is a toxic algae bloom that reads as believably as the latest headlines in the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd. Surrounding a core of credible science is a cast of believable, well-developed characters that lure the reader compulsively into page after page as the action mounts and the danger reaches strangulation levels. As Powlik himself asserts, we are not the commanders of Mother Nature as much as we'd like to think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea Change Works!","review":"This book kept me riveted from beginning to end. The characters are believable and the science is just edgy enough to scare you into thinking a menace of this kind could really materialize. Yes, there is a lot of back and forth explanatory dialogue among the characters, but the issues are complex and the author doesn't dumb down the plot just to work in an explosion on every page (there is plenty of that anyway). I think the settings and pace of the story work well to give the reader the feeling of being on the inside of the action. I not only know what is happening, but I know why. The suspense builds nicely AND you end up caring about what happens to the characters at the end. I am looking forward to reading James Powlik's next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete garbage","review":"I'm not going to waste much time ripping this book - just wanted to warn people away from it.

There is just one problem. The author has no idea how to develope any suspense or even any real interest in what happens. I am in the middle of reading this book right now and I could care less how it ends. A good thriller will make you want to keep reading all night to see what happens. At no point in the first 270 pages have I ever even wanted to read the next page to see what happens. The author just doesn't have a knack for story telling. I am surprised that anyone other than a marine biologist would call this one a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Clive Cussler","review":"I have had the good fortune to meet the author, and learned of this book in that manner.

Yet like the other buyer said close ups are blurry and some fashions have no pictures. I didn't find the picture's backgrounds distracting, but that is a matter of opinion. If you have the books listed above don't waste the money this one is worth. I have found several errors, mostly on the names and some acceosries, but nothing really big.

It's pseudo science in a bottle - a cure for 21st century man with too much leisure and money and not enough purpose.There is page after page of exercises to help me become more like Leonardo.

Why hasn't he made an invention decades ahead of its time? Is this all he can do with the arsenal of mental powers he claims to have discovered? Write a $11.17 self-help book?

I found particulary amusing. Gelb suggests that while the minestrone is simmering, one should begin enjoying \\"the synthesis of colours, textures and aromas\\", as any good cook would. However, Gelb extends this appreciation for the simmering brew with the ludicrous suggestion that one should \\"sing and hum the sounds of the emerging gustatory and olfacotry symphony\\" and begin dancing \\"your minestrone dance\\".

I listened to it as a cassette series and caught myself shaking my head at Gelb's professorial inflections.Gelb's constant harping about how wonderful Leonardo was, down to his advice about going to the bathroom regularly, made me want to remind him that Leonardo was human and doubtless had flaws. Do I want to think like Leonardo, after hearing about how inventive and smart he was in so many fields? Not after hearing Gelb's devotion. A bit of humility goes a long way in opening up one's mind.The best advice in the entire book is to write in a journal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Richness of Life","review":"This is a wonderful book that inspired and influenced me in ways I wouldn't have expected. I think it's about how to live richly while you're here, something which the brilliant Leonardo appears to have been able to accomplish. This book tells how to engage all the senses in creating an experience of daily abundance. It contains brilliant ways to interpret the past and how things were done then--and then bring them into the present in useful and creative ways. This book is full of the sumptuousness of the good life. The author is funny, charming, and lovingly masterful on his topic. I thoroughly enjoyed it and heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste!!!","review":"The one great thing about this book is the title. After that it gets considerably worse. Mr. Gelb, it seems, doesn't really provide any great insights in how to think like Leonardo, but rather common sense ideas that you could get from the millions of other self help books out there. This is one book that I would recommend passing. The ideas are common sense, if not borderline ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing approach to mental prowess","review":"Genius is made, not born: despite this fact many would believe great thinkers sprung from birth with ideas intact. That's why Michael Gelb's How To Think Like Leonardo Da Vinci is so important: it provides a rebuttal that developing the mind isn't dependent upon genes alone, and it shows how to uncover hidden abilities to unlock latent creative potential for learning and creativity. Chapters describe sensory awareness and how it may be increased, present a range of exercises and applications to learn the rules of mind mapping and how to use them effectively, and generally 'teach thinking' to invigorate latent processes. An intriguing approach to mental prowess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is everything I hoped for and more! It is full of fun and valueable exercises to expand your mind. You are gauranteed to learn something when you read this book. I highly reccomend that if you purchase this book-which you would be crazy not to- to also purchase the \\"How to Think Like Leonardo Da Vinci Workbook\\", Its an excellent companion to this book. If you love Leonardo Da Vinci or you want to be a modern day reniscance man or woman than please buy the book. Anyone who buys it will surely benifit from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a gem!","review":"On my \\"buy it, get it from the library or skip it\\" scale, this is a definite buy.If \\"The Artist's Way\\" were Creativity 101, this book would be Creativity 201. \\"How to Think Like Leonardo DaVinci\\" by Michael Gelb, is a masterpiece. It is challenging, expansive and fascinating.In it, he provides a step-by-step program for expanding your creativity and accessing your own creative flow.This book has not gotten the press attention it deserves. Get it anyway. It's a gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Attn: Artists & Intellectuals. This is a good book.","review":"Do not mind the stars. The book is worth purchasing. 5 stars would mean that this is the last book you buy. I am a student on an endless quest for higher learning, excellence, creativity, intelligence, and so forth. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to all students, teachers, and those in search of inspiration and hope of manifesting your hidden potential. My word of caution is to understand Leonardo da Vinci for who he was and what he pursued. If you too pursue truth, then follow the principles of Curiosita, Dimostrazione and so forth. Do not treat this text as a Bible. Understand the principles that helped Leonardo achieve his goal."},{"rating":"1","title":"This offering is pabulum at best.","review":"While some of the biographical background and quotations are interesting, the main body of this book offers some absolutely silly suggestions for emulating the thought process of Leonardo. If he were to read this I'm sure that he and his compatriots would have a good laugh. When I reached the \\"exercises\\" I was reminded of some of the infomercials that dominate late night TV. I would not be at all surprised to see Gelb hawking his audio tapes soon. A waste of time. Anyone sincerely interested in learning about Leonardo would do well to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocatrive, stimulating","review":"This book is a must read for anyone intersted in expanding their own intelligence or understanding the new thinking about just what intelligence really means. As a retiured school psychologist with over 30 years of measuring intelligence I found this read provocative and stimulating should be requred reading for all interested in the field of intelligence"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This is a good book and really opens up your thought process. Does a nice job of illustrating the interconnection of the senses and the way they impact our thought processes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book was a very interesting read. \\"Understanding the Quran\\" lays out the concepts of Islam in a profound way and really made you think."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],G={key:0},M={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",G,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(O,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-60dcd723"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/49.md","filePath":"library/49.md"}'),C={name:"library/49.md"},L=Object.assign(C,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{R as __pageData,L as default};
