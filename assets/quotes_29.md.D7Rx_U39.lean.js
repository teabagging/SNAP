Am buying a different one as a gift for the same friend. There is a basic design flaw as most materials shrink when exposed to cold temperatures. The lid fits INTO the base of the shaker. Fill it with ice and cold gin and the base shrinks. Thus the lid is STUCK. You have to wait for the ice to melt and the base to warm up in order to pull off the top. That seriously cuts into the number of martinis one can consume in an evening. Not worth the under twenty bucks price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has pluses but one big minus...","review":"This shaker looks very attractive and works well, EXCEPT that the removable top invariably fails to be removable. Once the shaker gets cold, the metal contracts and the pieces stick together, making it a real pain to get the two pieces back apart for washing or for \\"martinis, round 2\\"...and the problem doesn't abate once the shaker warms up---once it's stuck, it's stuck. It's true that if you take it apart IMMEDIATELY it doesn't stick, but I forget to do so at least 50% of the time (usually when there are guests present and I have other things to think about). I have had this shaker for about 3 months and make martinis pretty regularly, but I'm tired of messing with it: I've decided to buy another shaker and give this one to GoodWill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brrr!

However there is no way to dial out a number from a stand-alone phone's handset... Which pretty much defeats the whole purpose of using an adapter and a regular cordless phone.

I went to Zooms web site and found a PDF manual which explained how to use your regular phone to dial SKYPE contacts by assigning them a speed dial number.Other than that it is a great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reliable hardware+software","review":"I am uing this product since two months.

That would have made this system superior on any other on price/quality. After every call, Skype always ask to rate the quality of the call. Every time I took the time to rate it excellent, it is so obvious so you are sorry not to give it. I am only on the research of the feature SMS from cordless phone.

While I do pick up glass sauce jars, you really need to be careful, a good squeeze on the grip and stay steady that the jar doesnt spin on it's edge, it could slip.

Therefore it is so disheartening that the jaws were designed [?] so well yet crafted with such weak material that a great tool is now a pitiful means of picking up items. Of the three I bought [ outdoor use ]and the one I had [regular use], the jaws bend with an amazing lack of force. Stronger jaws would make this tool immensely better for day to day use.

This one is solid and will do the job and \\"they all wear out\\" no matter what they are made of."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works well but with some limitations","review":"This tool is sturdy and picks up coins off the floor. In comparison, the Gopher does not pick up coins or other flat objects (except paper that will crumple). But the Gopher is much lighter weight and easier to use (because the handle is perpedicular to the rod, which is not the case with the Nifty Nabber). And the Gopher can grab a can such as a standard tuna can, which the Nabber cannot because of the shape of the grabber part. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, the Gopher doesn't last very long before the screw threads that retain the rubber grabber parts become completely stripped. For people with lower back problems, it is useful to have both tools, as they complement each other. The trick, I guess, is to use the Gopher sparingly. We'll see how long the Nifty Nabber lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for roadside garbage.","review":"I've had two other similar grabbers break in their first hours just using 'em to pick up roadside trash.

This is the same company (same people in the video) as Say, Sing & Sign. This video is just too fast to really learn how to sign the songs. They try to break it down first but it's too fast to learn it. You'll have to do a lot of rewinding if you want to learn to sign along. As with the Say, Sing & Sign videos, the signer doesn't sing out loud the songs but instead she mouths the words to the songs. It's so annoying because sometimes the singing voices are kids or a man. It looks so stupid when she mouths those songs. The best children's signing videos, in my opinion, are Signing Time and My Baby Can Talk.

The only worth of Bernstein's parody-like interpretation is comparative, and as a lesson that even geniuses have their limits.

I know very little about Church history in pre-revolutionary America and this book is a very good introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly Christian Biography","review":"What's most surprising about Yale's latest attempt at an Edwards Biography is how thoroughly Christian it is. Having extensively studied the 18th century Puritan, I've long been baffled by just how many of his biographers have attempted to make Edwards, to quote G. Marsden, \\"over in their own images\\" (p.2). In so doing, some of these books have made his Orthodox Christianity, which was truly the centerpiece of his life and thought, strangely and eerily quiet. Some biographers have tried to separate Edwards' religious convictions from his genius. Marsden doesn't. Any biographer who wishes to write honestly about Edwards must necessarily write much on Edwards' faith and his God. Marsden does. These things were truly the centerpiece of his life and so therefore should be the centerpiece of any book about his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous","review":"Jonathan Edwards is considered by many to be the greatest preacher, theologian, and philosopher in American history. George Marsen has written an excellent biography that explores Edwards personal, public, and intellectual life in 18th Century New England. Edwards had a great appreciation for the holiness of God. He tackled many of the great questions of the Christian faith, such as; can free will exist if God is sovereign? Where did sin come from if God is all good? How can one tell if one is truly saved? Edwards' answers may not satisfy everyone, and in many cases, they are difficult to grasp (at least for me!) Nonetheless, his work is always thought provoking and leads one to a greater appreciation of the character of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, balanced, and unbiased look at a legendary man","review":"In a word: This biography is fair, deeply inspiring, and so well written it is hard to put it down!

Although slower, I still run with the bulls at every opportunity.Jim Hollander is a world-class photographer who has drunk deep. He has known Fiesta for many years.

I hardly know who to blame first, Bernstein or Watts. Bernstein's tempo choices were mystifying, starting with the ponderous orchestral introduction. It was so slow that at first I thought there was a defect in the CD. But no, Bernstein, in a misguided attempt at drama, had reduced Brahms' powerful opening to pure schmaltz. Instead of music, Bernstein gave us melodrama. And Watts gave us Edward Scissorhands. The man has absolutely no ability to carry a phrase. Watts' jerky articulation in the first movement sounded like the musical equivalent of epilepsy. If you love Brahms, this recording will grate on your nerves like fingernails on a blackboard. For a sensitive, lyrical and truly authoritative interpretation of Brahms' second piano concerto, go straight back to Toscanini and Horowitz.

Also, I hear alot about Strangers, but I would have to say that it is pretty much the worst Whiskeytown effort.

I did think the book would have gone from good to great if the writing had been better. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, and I did like the book. There were just certain things that could have been touched up by an editor - the overuse of exlamation points and random jokes that were out of place in the narrative, for one thing.

I say this because if he/she is playing with a friend, they can learn a conversation through dolls. I think this is more a girl's toy, but boys are welcome to play with it. You might have to have a special bin for these toys because they easily get lost. I am getting this for my birthday even though I am eleven.

This is one of the best songs of any genreof music available. At times, Tom Jenkinson's music couldbe very wild, but somehow, all the sounds harmonized as oneinto perfection and into something one has never hear in hisentire life.

If you love the Flintstones as much as I do, you will love this CD. Most of the songs here will be familiar to anyone who grew up watching Flintstones reruns over and over again. In between the songs, they have inserted instrumental background music from the show. I love this CD, but there are several notable songs that are not included. There is nothing from the episodes featuring Hot Lips Hannigan, Ann-Margrock or the Swedish musicians. There is also one song that doesn't belong here, in my opinion, which is the awful \\"They'll Never Split Us Apart\\" from an Alice in Wonderland TV special. Despite those criticisms, I would recommend this CD to fans of the Flintstones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"When I bought these I was mainly looking for a long enough cord to be able to put my MP3 player in my pocket. Not only is the cord legnth great but so is the sound. I didn't expect the sound quality to be so good in such an inexpensive product. The cord also has a built in volume control so I don't have to dig the player out of my pocket to adjust the volume. The buds are quite comfortable, I have worn them for hours at a time with no problem. I love these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not svankmajer's best...","review":"Jan Svankmajer is one of my favorite directors and I bought Lunacy without knowing anything about it beyond a simple synopsis; unfortunately it fell very short for me. Aside from some nice stop-motion sprinkled throughout (though accompanied by obnoxious carnival music) and a neat orgiastic ritual scene the movie is slow and unaffecting. If you're a Svankmajer fan definitely see this at some point; but if you're just trying him out get Alice or Faust or even Conspirators of Pleasure. I think all three are equally superior and give a better sense of what Svankmajer can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much to say","review":"I bought this charger because the original one quit.

Only then did the diode light show. But if the battery is a dud, the charger light will never come on. Then too, if the charger fails and the battery is good, the light will never come on.

Unfortunately, there is no way for steam to escape while you cook with the lid on until you lift it up. The only way to lift it is by the sides -- two glass lips on the edge of the lid. Unless you are wearing two oven mitts that fully cover your hands, you run the risk of getting seriously burned by the escaping steam. I have a fairly serious burn from lifting the lid using hot pads. I even lifted the lid slightly with a fork to allow the steam to escape before I grasped it with the hot pads -- unfortunately it was not enough to prevent the injury. If you purchase this item, I would recommend using it without the lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hot to handle!","review":"If you are going to use this item, please read the instruction booklet completely. Not only (according to the instructions) is the glass cover prone to breaking, shattering, cracking, etc., handling it while cooking appears to be an adventure all by itself. You can burn youself a number of ways from lifting the cover without a great deal of protection, to just tilting it the wrong way which may release hot steam on your body (it's all there in the book.) It looks good, is pleanty big and has an easy to use heating control switch (it appears). I didn't try it, though.

No adventurer, I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned more than once!","review":"I own this fry pan. I am looking for a new one. This one is hard to use. The glass top has glass handles on the sides of the lid. When the pan is hot the lid and handles are very hot. You have to use pot holders on each side of the lid to lift it off. Steam escapes as you lift it off, and you rarely escape getting burned. I would give it no stars if that was an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consult the burn unit at your local hospital","review":"The skillet itself is fine, the nonstick does a good job and clean up is easy. The glass cover, however, is a serious oversight in design. Though its a novel idea, being able to serve or microwave/conventional oven heat in the cover, there is simply no way to safely lift the cover from the skillet.

My favorite songs on this album, however, are the serious Eminem parody \\"Look Yourself,\\" the serious Five for Fighting parody \\"It's Not Eden,\\" and the humorous Proclaimers parody \\"I'm Gonna Feed (500 Mouths)\\".If you want to hear the best that ApologetiX has to offer of Christian musical parodies of classic and contemporary pop music -- buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say boring?","review":"I hate to say it.

It is truly amazing that Townsend, a female author, was able to convincingly capture a teenage boy's life, troubles, and concerns. The secret Diary of Adrian Mole portrays the life of a young boy growing up in England having to deal with all sorts of troubles including tension with his parents, friends, and relationships.

It's funny, often realistic, and very insightful.There is so much about Adrian's thoughts, feelings, and misadventures that speaks to all of us.

We are also given a charming insight into the life of the lower class in Britain in the early 1980's. Adrian is totally clueless about what is going on around him. He even feels superior to everyone around him because he is such an \\"intellectual!\\" I imagine that he was probably the class nerd--he just didn't know it. Adrian's family is totally dysfunctional but his discussions of the outrageous actions of his parents are amusing. There are many tender moments during the Diaries but overall, the book is \\"dead hilarious\\" and I can't wait to read more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Mole","review":"A terrific series focusing on the hardships of an intelligent male way beyond his years.

I have never been the same since. I have had a long relationship it seems today, with a collection of characters so insane, bizarre and unique that they seem real to me. The other characters that Sue Townsend has created have also hooked me. Whether she is writing as herself, the oh-so-intellectual Mr. Mole, a young Margaret Thatcher, or a fly on the wall at Bukingham Palace, she manages and wonderfully.I often hear it whispered that the author is tiring of these characters and intends to retire.

I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed a Grisham novel. Its main character is complex. If you are looking for a book that is about describing the Tour from cover to cover, you probably want to look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a novel about the complexity of a person with a lot of cycling thrown in, this is your book. I read the first couple of chapters the first night I got it. I read the last 250 pages on the second night. It was good enough that I was up way too late and missed riding or running the next morning.

The author lightly touches on cycling in the last half of the book and even then has no hold on the reader during race sequences. Being a bike rider and racer I know that there are not tons of action packed ideas to write about in cycling races but this was more boring than 50 miles on the trainer.The ending is very abrupt and has more of a philosophical point than a good cap to the end of the story.

From the start the Netgear loses the network conection frequently, and even when it has a connection it won't allow me to copy a large file. Weird.

Heavier items, like breakfast pastries would fall through when you put them, therefore you couldn't toast them at all. The clean up of crumbs was not as \\"care-free\\" as I thought it would be. There are a lot of crevices for crumbs to get caught in on the front door, making clean up difficult. Maybe I received a 'lemon' model, but I am not willing to try another one.

Trash? Of course, at least he got that right. Why? Why? Why? I wish I could understand why this happened but it is truly beyond me. So you say you like Toby Keith? I say you need mental care. This album is the lowest of low, the worst point for all humanity. Toby seriously please stop, people apparently listen to this garbage, so please stop giving it to them. It should be a crime but it's not somehow. Just be happy your not in prison for what you have done, and leave the world alone.

I had been able to listen to snippets of some of the songs through the Fan Club website, but in no way was I prepared for the CD. It is AWESOME! Toby gives us everything we have been asking for ~ rockin' country, smooth ballads, and even a few \\"bus songs.\\" Toby Keith never fails to deliver what his fans want!

This is probably one of his best cd's yet. I did not think his last cd, \\" Honkytonk University\\" could be outdone, but it has been done with this new fantastic album.

Turn it up!\\" like his \\"Beer for my Horses\\", \\"How Do You Like Me Now?\\", or \\"I Wanna Talk About Me\\".

It is a sure fire hit for his new label Show Dog Nashville. The first single \\"Get Drunk and Be Somebody\\" is a crowd pleasing, rowdy song. On the other hand \\"Crash Here Tonight\\" is a tender ballad that shows Toby's gentler side. Other songs including \\"A Little Too Late,\\" \\"Can't Buy You Money,\\" \\"Grain of Salt,\\" \\"I Ain't Already There,\\" and \\"Note to Self\\" show the range of Toby's musical talent.

Toby is multi talented such as singer,song writer, actor, hat line, record company owner, restaurant owner, etc.. He shows his love for music by making sure it comes first. He has made alot of number one hits and there is going to be alot more of them off of this cd. It is a must have in your cd collection.

Just about anything can be heard from this album. His first hit song Get Drunk and Be Somebody is just a good going out party tune. Nothing should be taken serious with this song, everytime I hear it, I have to turn my radio up to listen. If you love the sweet sensitive side of Toby it is recommended to listen to Can't Buy You Money, A Little Too Late, and Crash Here Tonight. For all the listeners who like off the wall humor, please check out his new Bus Songs on there. You will surely get a laugh out of them.

I already owned all of Toby's other albums and had high expectations of this first release from his own label, Showdog Nashville. Let me tell ya, Toby Keith delivered big time on this one. No matter what mood I am in there are songs on this album to suit it. From the fun, shake off the day \\"Get Drunk and Be Somebody\\" to the tender, heart felt \\"Crash Here Tonight\\" and even a dose of reality with \\"Can't Buy You Money\\". And only Toby could record a song like \\"Runnin' Block\\", one of the 3 new bus songs included on this album. This one makes me laugh every time. Toby Keith is one of the greatest talents of our time. You can hear the creativity and passion in each and every song.

I respect his integrity and songwriting skills, but this album diappoints. At it's best, it offers little in the way of new sounds, new ideas, or new flavors. At it's worst, it's dim and, in some cases offensive. None of these songs excited me (like \\"Beer For My Horses\\" or \\"Let's Talk About Me\\" or wooed me like \\"I Love This Bar\\" or \\"Wish I Didn't Know\\".Songs like \\"Running Block\\" are downright offensive (and no, I'm not overweight, I just have compassion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toby ain't as good as he once was","review":"He got that right, The 2 most recent hits Get Drunk & Be Somebody (ok tune) and last albums Aint as good (Great tune, great sentiment) were fine, but ever since How Do You Like Me Now? he has sucked the big one.He always seems to go for the shock value and the cheap shot. Garbage like American Soldier, I Love This Bar & Courtesy Of The Red White & Blue are songs i ould expect a one hit wonder to have.Come on Toby, what happened to writing heartfelt good songs like When Love Fades, Does That Blue Moon Ever Shine On You, Whos That Man & You Shouldnt Kiss Me Like This?He sure isn't any good, any more, bring me some Dixie Chicks please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame effort, people, what's between your ears?","review":"I really liked Toby Keith.

He got the title right. TRASH. Dumb songs. The music is not any better. Songs about getting drunk and fat women don't seem to get a positive response from listeners outside his fanbase. I try to figure out why his music gets worse and worse. Is it a lack of inspiration or effort? Maybe both. It may also be the result of making an album every year. I think that affects the quality of his music. I agree with the Amazon customers who say that he should take a break. At least, they have better tastes in music than those who say his cd is 'AWESOME'. I have turned his music off and now I am listening to Country artists with more talent like the Dixie Chicks and Josh Turner. Their songwriting is a lot better and they make real great Country music."},{"rating":"1","title":"poseur","review":"Showy good ol boy toby done real good, but not at music, only at following the trend for loud-mouthed rednecks for bush couple of years back.

When he tries to expand his music (slightly! pigs ear/silk purse ya know) its too much of a stretch.

Only on \\"A Little Too Late\\" (dig the clever string arrangements), and the tender \\"Crash Here Tonight\\" does Mr. Keith offer something fresh and unpredicatble.

It is by far my favorite song on the album, song#3,\\"Cant buy you money\\" is a song that i can totally relate to, broke as i am (hee hee) and i really love song#4,\\"Crash here tonight\\". There seems to be a little bit of forgetting birthdays and anniversry dates here, i guess it happens to best of us (myself included). All in all, I would totally suggest this one, and not just cuz Imma fan, although I may be a little bias.

There's a common theme to his last four albums. If he's not complaining about the Taliban, he's singing some power ballad about getting drunk. After rocking us with a few songs from \\"Unleashed,\\" \\"Big Dog Daddy,\\" and \\"Shock'n Yall,\\" this is what we get? What a waste.

I'd say it's a given that \\"Get Drunk and Be Somebody\\" is another favorite. Toby always excels in lyric writing; I think everyone can relate to the story he tells in each of his songs. Another great song that touched me is \\"Ain't No Right Way\\" (to be wrong). This song deals with prayer in schools and sends a very important message. It also shows Toby never shys away from controversy - if he believes in it, he's going to stand behind it!!The entire CD is incredible!

I purchased both of these top rated books, in my opinion, from Amazon.com because they have the best prices and widest selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening video that really helps get results","review":"In my opinion, this video is as close as you can get to having a personal trainer without actually having to pay for one. Raphael Picaud gives you excellent tips and demonstrations on how to properly weight train. For most people who don't know much about form or technique this video will be quite enlightening. I thought I knew how to lift weights (seems simple enough, right?), but I never really got the results I wanted. After watching this video, I put the techniques to use and I got excellent results, quite immediately. It's also great for preventing injuries and muscle strain. I highly recommend this video for anyone who wants to learn how to work out the right way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good info, but not easy to grasp on a video.","review":"I envy the reviewer who gets to work out with this guy--I imagine he knows his stuff and would be great in person. However, for me it did not translate to the video and I have been unable to get much assistance from the video. Learned some items about proper form for lifting, but I really think this is the kind of thing that can only be learned with an actual trainer watching you and giving you comments. There is a reason people have coaches for just about any sport...you cannot really evaluate yourself and you need someone watching you to give you this type of information. At this point I cannot affort a trainer, but I also wish I hadn't spent the money on this video and had instead put it toward a live training session."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"One of the least informative exercise videos I've ever encountered.

We hit many classic short pieces from that repertoire: The Russian Sailor's Dance, In the Steppes of Central Asia, Dawn over the Moscow River, plus selections from Lt. Kije and more. The performances are strong and vivacious but never out of control, and the vintage sound holds up rather well. I confess regret at not having the full set of Ipoolitov-Ivanov's Caucasian Sketches and the complete Lt. Kije Suite from Bernstein and company, but I'll take what I can get, and what you get on this disc is just over an hour of great Russian music that's well played."},{"rating":"2","title":"False Profits - A long overdue examination of MLM.","review":"I found this book to be fascinating and difficult to put down. It offers a very thorough treatment of the multi-level craze and examines the psychology and motivations from a very personal perspective.

Success or failure in MLM/Network Marketing depends on an individual doing their homework and working hard...Period.There was a time in our country where franchising was considered unethical and was nearly banned by Congress. Network Marketing has had growing pains, but it is an empowering, legal, ethical way that the average person can apply themselves and improve the quality of their lives.Network Marketing is being taught in Universities now.

I was hoping it would work with my motherboard, but I kind-of expected it not to work. In the past, on other computers, I found that unless the manufacturer includes an adapter as part of the included accessories, the chances that a third party adapter would work is pretty slim.I was sort of surprised this did not work since it should have been compatible with all DVI specificiations (e.g. Single/Dual Link DVI-D and single/dual link DVI-I).Update 9/11/2011: My display, Samsung T240HD, has a DVI-D port.

In the daylight, you can't see any detail on the screen at all - Period. The screen is so dark, you just can't make out any details.I tried contacting Magellan and they were unresponisve, saying only that the contrast control would adjust brightness - It Doesn't - and nothing else.It appears to me that Magellan did not do its homework on this one and I am disappointed, both with the unit and with Magellan's response, which is basically zero.I am now back to looking at Garmin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great, but you can't see what's on the screen","review":"The display on the SporTrak Color is very poor.

Shortly after opening it I noticed that the control pad was stuck off to one side. That upset me but I wasn't going to return it over just that. Me and a few of my friends went down to the lake later that day to do some geocaching. I felt pretty secure climbing the rocks next to the shore, its water resistant right? WRONG. I dropped it in 3 inches of water and in the 5 seconds it took me to get it out of the lake water had leaked inside of the screen and the gps itself. Needless to say it didn't work after that.

There are way too many menus, upon sub-menus, upon sub-menus. Button presses must be firm and precise - especially within the enter and direction key area. Accidental key presses are common. The keypad layout in general - is cumbersome. The color screen and its resolution are disappointing (even after playing with the contrast option). You need to constantly tilt (angle) the unit for a decent view. The sample graphics seen online and on the box are not a true representation of the kind of bland washed out color you actually see. Side streets do not show up (not labeled with text) and are depicted only as a ultra-thin line(s) against a white background.

The mapsend software is $80-$100 on top of the cost of the GPS.I will NEVER purchase a Magellan device again.

She also liked to press all the different buttons to hear the music. Now that she's two she can fit the shapes into the correct places (without much difficulty) and press the top to make them all fall out at once - that always makes her giggle.

When you touch certain buttons it doesn't say circle and leave it at that it plays a song too, but doesn't stop if you hit a different button or the same button. I am confused by this toy.

Many people also complain about it having one repetitive song, but this toy has numerous fun songs. The songs even speed up when the toy is being pushed or pulled along the ground. The shapes fit easily into the slots and if you press the bug on top they all pop-out with appropriate sound effects. I've seen complaints that the pull-string is missing... I read the manual and found mine in the battery compartment.My daughter got this among many other gifts for her 1st Birthday and it is her favorite toy.

The song lyrics are \\"sort sort sort my shapes\\" but I swear it sounds like \\"eat eat eat my shorts\\". I had no idea what the thing was saying. The voices are horrible. The sounds are horrible. The music is horrible.Did I say this toy is horrible? No, I think I said this toy is terrible. Well, it's horrible too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This toy is cute looking but the sounds and interaction are annoying. The little intro song is a little creepy sounding and not fully understandable, and you have to listen to the entire thing before you can play with the toy. The shapes are difficult to \\"sort\\" onto the body of the toy as well, because they have to lock into place, and the strings attached are a little tight. In addition, the pull string is a little long which may scare some parents away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and slightly creepy song","review":"This bug looks cute, but 1)is too complicated and 2)the song is very annoying and a little creepy! Not a very good toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wiring issues","review":"First off---my son loves this toy! I only wish it had held up longer than TWO WEEKS. There's some sort of issue with the internal wiring---the sound gets stuck on a loop (one of the songs starts playing automatically, plays for about 5 seconds, then restarts...and restarts...and restarts). If the sound worked properly, I would give this toy 4 stars. Also, it is very loud, and there isn't a volume adjustment like many other infant/todder toys had. If it had that feature as well, I'd give this toy 5 stars as my son really has started learning the names of the shapes (and does love to play with the toy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does too many things at once","review":"My son got this toy for his 1st birthday (he is now 18 months). He does enjoy playing with it because it sings and he dances to the music. However, this toy is confusing because it does too many things at once. If you push the top down, all the shapes pop off and she asks to help find the shapes. If you put the square back into the square, it says \\"square.\\" That is, if the toy doesn't roll at all. Every time it rolls it starts singing \\"come along, let's play along, let's take a learning journey...\\" So, the learning experience is actually over. I have tried to play with it and can not manage to put all the shapes in without it starting some other annoying song. It also has a lot of buttons and each one does a separate thing. My son ends up getting overstimulated and throwing the toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying!","review":"This toy has enough \\"memory\\" to play a variety of tunes. Unfortunately, the same introductory shapes song plays over and over...incessantly. To the point of madness. The baby will not even be touching it and it will say \\" WHOOPS! HAHAHHAHA!\\" This kind of giggling will correct any interaction with the toy. My LO is 8 mo. old, so probably not old enough to fit shapes into notches, so that's the extent of this toy so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating toy for a 16 month old","review":"Definitely try out the toy at the store before you buy it. We received it as a gift from a non-parent. This toy is annoyingly loud, but the words are difficult to understand. The six shapes do not fit easily into their slots. The toy's interactive feature is not child-friendly for the suggested age range, as it does not give the child enough time to follow the directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and annoying, plus strangle hazard","review":"Briefly, the toy is INCREDIBLY annoying, difficult for anyone to use (much less a small child!), and the long string for pulling it was very tempting for my 14-month-old daughter to try to put around her neck and pull on. This is the worst toy we have, and an incredibly poor design.As many other reviewers stated, this toy is incredibly annoying. The WHOOPS and awful loud staticky intro song seem to play constantly and have to play all the way through before you can do anything else. And then they are triggered again very easily.The supposed sorting and \\"follow the leader\\" games don't work well.Add to that it doesn't pull easily, and the string presents a safety/strangulation hazard, and it is the worst toy I've seen.The only good thing I can say about it is that it seems durable. Which in this case is unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"So annoying!","review":"My 12 month old has this toy and on the rare occasion that she shows it any interest, it is such a complex toy to use, and it plays the same incomprehensible song over and over until you figure out the game then says \\"woops\\" if you do the wrong thing. the string does not pull the bug properly so if she tries to take it for a walk, it just flips over and she drags it. If you press the top button, which is the easiest and most obvious maneuver on the toy, the shapes pop out of place and have to be placed back into their spots exactly in the right direction which makes it very difficult for a child barely learning where they go let alone in what direction and face up. Argh. Not happy with this one at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this toy","review":"We received this for a gift. What a waste of money; please save yours and buy something else. The picture has a pull string, well ours didn't come with one. The main issue for me is that shapes...since they don't fit securely in the toy, they are just asking to get lost. The shapes don't \\"stick\\" in the shape spots very good, I'm always looking for something to grab on the toy to hold it steady so my daughter can pop them on, but i always grad the thing on top, which makes all the shapes pop out. Ugh. There are way better shape sorters out there -- check out tolo and battat. Forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy Legs Learning Bugs","review":"The one that I received was not as the picture showed. I wanted the Crazy legs that had the cords attached to the pieces so they would not get lost. I could have found the one they sent at any store. Also, it cost more to ship it back than it was worth. So disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product! And a big waste of money!!","review":"I bought this toy brand new. It was missing the pull along cord. The toy also the shapes dont fit properly in the slots so when you hit the release button half of them are stuck and wont pop out and it also very annoying it sings the same thing over and over ...\\"sort sort sort machine\\"... i would return it but it isnt worth the headache. But i do not recommend this product its cheaply made."},{"rating":"1","title":"pull string is very dangerous","review":"This toy was fun until the string choked my child. The toy is big and heavy for a child of its age group, especially when its hanging from your childs neck. If I didnt get there fast enough I know it would have very easily suffocated him. Please do NOT buy this toy for your child and if you must, then CUT THE STRING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronizing and annoying","review":"My daughter adores songs so I tolerated her playing with this toy at her great grandmother's house, but I was wincing everytime she switched it from the song mode to the \\"learning\\" mode. \\"Uh oh\\" is not a helpful phrase for learning and the voice in and of itself sounded manipulative and condescending even when asking questions.Also, it didn't pull well on its string on carpet for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only toy I've ever thrown away","review":"This is the only toy I've ever thrown in the garbage. Not only is it an annoying song, but the main button on the back (which is the one your baby will push all the time) makes the bug say \\"woops\\" like the baby made a mistake. Seems like a really dumb idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most annoying toy","review":"This is by far the most annoying toy that my son has. The same shape sorting song plays endlessly in every mode. The shapes are attached to coils that are too short. The shapes don't easily stick into their appropriate slots and if by chance you get a couple shapes into the slots they get pushed out with an equally annoying and incessant \\"WHOOPS!\\" if the toy is moved, a button is pressed of the string is pulled. This toy causes aggravation for my son as well as for us.I'm considering throwing it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The kids play with it from time to time","review":"As others have said, it's bulky, heavy, and the \\"whoops\\" and the song get annoying quickly. I'm an adult, and I had some problems figuring out exactly what they wanted in some of the games (and while some of the games will say \\"whoops\\" and explain the purpose of the game when you push the wrong button, others just say \\"whoops\\" and start up the song again, so you really have no idea what they wanted you to push).The reason I chose to write this review, however, is that my 15 month old got his finger wedged between the wheel and the bug's body this morning, and cried until I managed to get it out. Considering that this is designed for 12 months and up, I would not have expected the wheel housing to be close enough to the wheel for small fingers to get stuck.For whatever reason, the kids seem to like it, though. They picked it out at the toy store."},{"rating":"1","title":"really annoying","review":"most annoying baby toy we own. it was a gift. it keeps repeating the intro song and you have to wait for it to finish before you do anything else. then it is easy to trigger the intro song again so you end up waiting on the stupid song to lay over and over again. even the baby gets bored and wanders off. only the cats like to play with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistant reward/ discouragement","review":"I actually had to read the instructions to understand what this toy was doing (and I have 2 college degrees). What it does is asks the child to perform a task, if they perform it correctly it claps... if not it says \\"oops\\". When we took it out of the box to play with it, all it was doing was saying \\"oops\\" to everything we did. What I realized, after reading about it, is that when it \\"sleeps\\" it still keeps the same task. So, if your child hasn't played with it in a long time, it still wants them to do the task it did last time they played with it. It confused and frustrated my daughter. We are returning it tomorrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I purchased this toy and had it for about a week before it stopped functioning correctly. The lady bug that sits at the center top part is easily pulled off by my son exposing a small plastic tube that could be painful if fallen on. On top of that the toy's sounds glitch, at first it would play music and a song and it started glitching during a certain part of the song. Shortly after that it only makes this annoying laughing sounds that glitches over and over again. I wish I had taken the toy insurance from Babies R Us because this toy was a complete waste of money.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"It looks fun so my daughter keeps reaching for it but neither of us can figure out what it's supposed to do.

Don't buy it - Look for it at the thrift store where we will be donating it."},{"rating":"1","title":"loudest toy ever!","review":"This toy has too much goin gon for an infant or toddler. It is over stimulating and has no volume control. we received this as a gift and it is by far the least pulled out toy for our 13 month old."},{"rating":"2","title":"my daughter plays with it","review":"I got this for my daughter 6 months ago, and she plays with it. I find the noise annoying, but she seems to like it. She likes to pull on the legs and tries to put them back in the shape spot. She also likes the big button on top. I paid $20 for it, and it I feel it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"crazy legs... or just plain crazy?","review":"This may be a better toy for the older groups. I got this toy for my 8 month old for Christmas and she had very litte interest in it, only wanting to push the very top button that does not do what one might expect (woops!). Now she is 16 months and has started pulling it behind her and pushing the lighted buttons but still will not follow the game and therefore... WOOPS! The toy seems durable, have not had to replace batteries. Parents beware, the toy is very annoying. Pull the string WOOPS... Push the wrong button WOOPS... And I've never said that about any toy ever! WOOPS! I would not recommend this to parents with younger children unless you are looking for something for your child to grow into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Bulky","review":"This toy is just very bulky and could seriously hurt someone when thrown. It doesn't roll well. The shape sorters have very tight strings that attach them to the ladybug, so your child cannot handle them well. The song is not the greatest.

I put tape over the volume and it is still really loud and now it is muffled so it defeats some of the educational value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editing unworthy of Oxford.","review":"Professor Ferling is an apparent master of the primary sources, and offers many useful insights, but the reader is repeatedly jarred by the author's infelicitous use of language, and by the unaccountable failure of Oxford University Press to exercise the most ordinary functions of editing.Was \\"notoriety\\" what the ambitious young Washington sought? Did Jefferson really seek to live in a \\"grandiose\\" manner? And since Adams had no recorded connection with artillery, can we believe that he studied \\"cannon law\\"?I stickied boners like these, all in the first half of the book, until the book looked like a pink porcupine. Apparently another, more diligent editor, was assigned the second half.This reader never expected, not in the deepest bouts of pessimism, to write a review like about an Oxford book. Perhaps Western civilization really is doomed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent analysis of the Revolution's three large figures","review":"Ferling concentrates on the event that launches three first presidents of the United States onto the world stage: the American Revolution. There has much been written about these three men (Edmund S. Morgan has even written a book that concentrates on these three just as Ferling has), but what sets this work apart is Ferling's piercing analysis. Rather than a pedantic recollection of the actions of these men, we are treated to his interpretation of their impact on the Revolution.I'm not going to say that I agree with Ferling on all points, but I appreciate his erudite opinions and clear writing, and believe he has made another contribution to the already sizable quantity of literature on the American Revolition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Perspective for a History Professor","review":"As an avid reader of the American Revolution, I had heard great things about this book. Unfortunately, it was terribly disappointing. Ferling spends too much time raising Adams to god-like status, in an apparent attempt to continue his sole rehabilitation of Adams' place in our history (see Ferling's other writings). In short, it's a shame that an author that is a history professor spends so much time in the present analyzing what Washington or Jefferson should have done instead of telling us what they did keeping in mind the time period and atmosphere of the late 18th century. If you are looking for a critical analysis of our Founding Fathers, this book is for you. However, if you are looking for, heaven forbid, a book about history, skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most exciting Schumann 2nd on disc","review":"I waited years for the reissue of Bernstein's Schumann 2nd in a splendid digital transfer such as this.

This is a blazing performance of surging power. The New York Philharmonic never sounded more cohesive in ensemble sound, however.

Strauss's first novel showed some promise, but she loses steam here, resorting to the standard dialog patterns and melodramatic mood music to tell what is basically a trite tale in new clothes. The price is probably right. It's the time you might waste that you have to factor in when making the decision to purchase this.

Groups like Bon Jovi, Poison, Cinderella, Def Leppard and so on were all a huge part of late 80s top 40 music. They set the trend and helped shape top 40 music at that time. They don't get so much as a single track on any of the CDs. Love the tracks they picked, but I think it should be a little more equal time. Same thing could be said for big rap hits like \\"Parents Just Don't Understand\\" 1988 and \\"Walk This Way\\" 1986. Just to name a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About The Biggest Sellers, Folks...","review":"I've noticed in one review here that someone was complaining about what's NOT on here. See, Billboard is about sales/airplay, so if your favorite hair band or rap group didn't have one of the 10 or 20 biggest hits of that particular year, they ain't going to be on this collection. Having said that, this is pretty representative of what was big on the pop charts that year. If you're looking for hard rock or rap, this wouldn't be where you should look for it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"bowl turner","review":"At $8000.00 why would anyone purchase the 4224b compared to the Oneway 2436 3hp lathe with a lower price and a lot more accessor+ies.You can purchase the 42 outboard turning attachment for less then the lathe alone and itfs not make in CHINA.

However, mr. Clayson's writing is selfcentered and this book is more about Clayson's taste of music and his views on the music scene, then it is about the Big O. Roy Orbison's tragic life - first wife killed in a motorbike accident and two children died in a fire - is being used as a background to Clayson's chit chat. A big dissapointment; a Big D for Clayson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-stylized inaccuracies","review":"I would give zero stars if I could. The book is riddled with inaccuracies (ex: incorrectly states that Tommy Dee [of \\"Three Stars\\"] is actually John D.

Moreover, it's shocking how dull this book is when you consider how much drama there was in Roy Orbison's life. The author certainly doesn't offer much perspective into how Roy persevered after the horrible deaths of his wife and sons. Indeed, you don't really feel as though you've gotten to know Roy any better after finishing the book. Clayson seems to have spent almost as much text insulting other recording artists and offering long-winded, irrelevant asides as he spent discussing Roy's life and music. Let his snitty preface (in which he complained of \\"ham fisted\\" editing in a previous edition of the book) and the adulatory \\"About the Author\\" blurb stand as omens of the author's self-indulgence."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad written book","review":"i'm a fan for Elvis and Orbison ,and prior to this i have read an Elvis biography (many years ago)and i thought that i would have the same pleasure but it was so bad written that i couldn't finish the book, it's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this fake!","review":"The content of the book you see here is not what is being sold!

In the Sixth especially, Bernstein finds a wild, Northern spirit in music which can sometimes seem over-refined. His vigorous tempos in the outer movements make this work much more dramatic than usual. In the Seventh, Bernstein creates huge tension all the way through this one-movement masterpiece. At the magnificent climaxes, you sense that the orchestral musicians really loved playing for this man. However many times I listen to these two Symphonies under Bernstein, I never cease feeling exhilirated.I'm not quite so enthusiastic about 4 and 5, although this version of the Fifth is widely admired. Throughout, the playing and the sound are in tune with Bernstein's robust approach to these works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Netgear Customer service: \\"It does not work 85% of the time\\"","review":"After I installed it, it did not work.

To me, it read like so many other books written in the \\"style\\" of other authors, such as \\"Scarlett\\", or \\"Mrs. DeWinter\\".

If you are new to megadeth ( like i was when i first heard this ) its not exactly a generalised DETH sound but it is really really good classic/style melodic metal, and if thats what you are looking for then you wont be dissapointed. Check It Out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TO REMIX REMASTER OR NOT TO REMIX REMASTER!!","review":"I think this is a good album, but try to avoid getting a REMIX - REMASTERED copy it sounds totally different from the original album.The original sounds better and you can actually tell what he is singing about.If DAVE would have just remastered the albums that would have been cool, but he remixed them too.Stick with the original it's always the best!!I rate this CD a 5 of 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album, dont like the remastering.","review":"Why did Mustaine need to remaster this album? I have the original copy of this, but I have heard a few songs from the new remastered copy. Some have the songs have different guitars and vocal tracks (as they might have been rerecorded) in A Tout Le Monte, train of consequenses, And Reckoning day. ThE remaster makes the already great production sound inferior to the original. If you want the better version of this album, then get the original version. Hell, I got mine used in near pristine consition for 1.00 dollar. A way better deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrash? No. Metal? **** Yes!","review":"This CD isn't \\"selling out\\". Sure, this CD is different from their past releases, but it kicks a s s in a different way. The complex solos and awesome riffing are still here, just at a more mid-pace speed. This CD also includes the awesome yet beautiful ballad, \\"A Tout Le Monde\\". This CD isn't without heavy tracks, such as \\"Reckoning Day\\" and \\"Train of Consequences\\". Overall, I feel that this isn't their best work, but it's nothing short of awesome. This CD should be yours if you like Megadeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEGADETH TRILOGY","review":"Megadeth 3rd cd in the trilogy at the top. RUST IN PEACE, COUNTDOWN TO EXCTINCTION, YOUTHANASIA.This album is amazing not a bad track on it. This album is very heavy and loud. The album starts of with the heavy riff of Reckoning Day a great album opener the album is just amazing from the start to finish. My favourite tracks have to be Victory , The Killing Road, Train Of Conseqeunces, Reckoning Day & A Toute Le Monde."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEGADETH BIGGER THAN METALLICA","review":"This is the foremost the best Megadeth Album EVER! A Tout LeMounde is by far the baddest song i ever heard Dave Mustaine and his Mighty crew have ever assembled. If there were 6 starz i would of definitly would have awarded it without a second thought. Youthanasia came out in 1994 and never looked back and kept cruising along at metal speed. Dave Mustaine, Dave Ellefson, Marty Freidman and Nick Menza hands down can do it like no other band. It was a God Send that the ego-maniacs Metallica gave Dave Mustaine the walkin papers, cuz they knew that he had the talent to put together some awesome songs(didn't want him to steal their sunshine) So much the better DAVE MUSTAINE YOU ARE THE BEST! YOUTHANASIA!! shows your TALENT! Do pick this up if your a MEGADETH fan, and if your not you will not be disappointed!! Reckoning day is the heaviest song on this album and will rock the most stubborn rock fan!! Touch'e Dave YOUR ROCK BROTHERMAN!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Youthanasia is not Megadeth's best album, but it is awfully close. If you enjoyed Countdown to Extinction, you will love Youthanasia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Countdown, but pretty solid","review":"At this time in Megadeth's career, Megadeth had the great pressure of doing a followup to Countdown to Extinction. The pressure was great. Was it a worthy follow up to Countdown though? Sort of. It was kind of disappointing. Not really thrash anymore. A little more mainstream. Even though a few of the songs are letdowns, Train of Consequences and Reckoning Day are real good songs, but Victory is definately the best song off the album. Worth getting for megadeth fans, but for the casual fan, go for Peace Sells...But Who's Buying, Rust in Peace, and Countdown to Extinction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"This disc is unacceptable unless you like tracks that are incomplete. It is one thing to have excerpts and another to end the track only 10 measures from the actual ending of the piece! Buy a disc with reasonably complete pieces instead. I am not even \\"filing\\" this with my other classical CDs. (It will be filed somewhere else.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Worked great, had it in my office to connect to an Avocent KVM. Worked well.

It is melodic and powerful and accessible while still being clearly of the 20th century; this is not a conservative work that is stuck in the past. Stern's intense, gutsy, and emotional playing is some of the best I have ever heard. On top of that, you have Leonard Bernstein and the NYPO, both in top form, accompanying Stern. The disc also features the Concerto for Flute and the Concerto for Clarinet by Carl Nielsen. While not on the same level as the Hindemith, they are excellent performances of two late Romantic concertos. The recordings, originally from the mid-60s and here digitally remastered, are superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual coupling but great performances","review":"Coupling two wind concerti with a violin concerto by a different composer is certainly not very common. Nevertheless, the performances are all superb, especially the Clarinet Concerto as performed by Stanley Drucker. I have no idea why this work is not performed more often in the concert hall. It is a wonderful piece and with the snare drum obligato, it is quite entertaining also. If you can find this CD at a reasonable price, I would buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarinet Concerto","review":"The Clarinet Concerto, written shortly before Nielson's death, is considered to be the ultimate virtuoso piece in the clarinet's repertoire. The legendary Stanley Drucker's rendition is often considered to be the benchmark recording of the concerto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Original","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. Other than the \\"Preparing for Death\\" chapter, there was nothing new and I've seen organization much better addressed in other books. The author seems to concentrate on office work - well, I've done office work for 40 years and she didn't tell me anything I didn't know. Maybe it would be good for absolute beginners, but anyone who has been around a few years already knows the tricks of opening and sorting mail, filing, etc. I didn't see anything special about her advice, especially with all those glowing references included with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item, easy to use.","review":"This little guy works amazingly.

The flexible shaft makes is very easy to create a milk foam that is superior to the ones generated by expensive machines at coffee bars. The pulse feature is better than a traditional on and off button.Not only have we used this for frothing milk but also salad dressings and salsa. One of our friends kids actually used the MAGIC to whip eggs prior to scrambling them. The ideas and possibilities are endless.I was impressed with the power and quality of the unit. The product is made in Israel and is extremely well made. I highly recommend purchasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It cried then died.","review":"This thing worked great... until it died shortly after, that is. I thought that it was great that it had a little holder for it to put on the wall. It looked great and was good about foaming milk. But the foam was only minimal and not what I expected. I could've done the same thing with a whisk and gotten a better result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brillian insights into organization and motivation","review":"This is a reissue of one of the classics of organizational psychology, \\"Eupsychian Management\\". The editors have added commentary by some important management thinkers. The book consists of the journals of Maslow during the summer of 1962 while he studied an organization. These are the thoughts of a great humanistic psychologist, a founder of the field, probing the realities and possibilities of human organization and leadership. It is a one-of-a-kind book, perhaps more important for today's leaders than when it was first written. It is must-reading for anyone who wants to be a more effective leader in this Age of the Knowledge Worker."},{"rating":"2","title":"good information","review":"Very nice book. The book has good information regarding management. The book is good for those who work as supervisors or lead people within an organization"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maslow for Business","review":"As psychologist I recommend especially this book! It is a bridge between an 'ethical theory of personality or men' and 'working with others in any organisation or business'. It can be used in 'Human Resource Management'. In the West a 'free human individual' is the piller of a free society and even all civilization, since Aknaton. (In the book Moses by Freud, Aknaton is mentioned as the first individual.) A free human individual creates more revenue for businesses and is much better for all others. It counters man just seen as a machine, rat, animal, subject or moneymaking instrument."},{"rating":"2","title":"liked it","review":"I am a guidance counselor for elementary school age children.

After 3-4 uses (about an hour long each), the remote started to fail me. It completely broke during a photo shoot. I was about an hour away photographing lightning when a tiny piece inside the remote broke. It would have needed to have been soldered back together, but at 1am, this wasn't possible. It really let me down and as any photographer knows, equipment failure can ruin a shoot.I would not recommend this to anybody looking to buy a remote control for a camera. Pay a little bit extra and spend the $30 on a nicer one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"It is nothing fancy... it just works and it is not overpriced like the Sony brand.

It does what it is supposed to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't always work","review":"I bought this instead of the overpriced Sony version. In re-reading other reviews, there are some complaints about the length of the rubber sleeve and that may be the root of the problem. About 1/3 of the time I plug this in, it does not work. Nothing happens when I push the button. Even when I reseat the plug, the days it does not work, it just doesn't work. When I go to use the remote a day or a week later, it is fine. It could be the extra length on the sleeve or perhaps I have a defective one. If it worked all the time, I would give it a higher grade. When it does work...it is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED.","review":"I was disappointed with the quality of this product the minute I opened the envelope. This is actually the first time I've ever been unhappy with a product that I have ordered from an Amazon vendor. I based my decision to buy this product on the photos made available during my search and I feel that the actual charm looks very little like the photo used. The charm itself looks cheap and scarcely resembles the photo. I'm not convinced that it is sterling silver. It also failed to include a clasp to connect it to the sterling silver charm bracelet that I bought from a different Amazon vendor. (Btw...I am very happy with the bracelet itself.) I paid more than $25 for this product and I feel that the quality is worth about half that.

In one chapter after another, he focuses first on grace and then truth, and contends that the balanced Christian life must have both, and with a truth-centered Christianity, one runs the risk of being legalistic, but in a grace-centered Christianity, one also runs the risk of being overly nice, with the truth taking a back seat.It is a nicely woven theme, and can be read in one sitting, although the reader might want to chew on one chapter at a time. A powerful treatise, though, and it's right to the point!!Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Both Grace AND Truth needed","review":"Since we are so polarized in America these days we are often in error, because ONE virtue alone is not the whole picture. The Christlike message is in the middle - on top of the saddle. Martin Luther once said that \\"the devil doesn't care on which side of the saddle one falls off\\". This book is very easy reading and gives many good examples (anecdotes)of how Truth is needed sometimes, and at others Grace is needed. When I read it I realized I was sometimes lacking Grace in my life. Truth alone is not the answer, as Grace alone is often not the answer. That's why the extreme conservatives are as wrong as the extreme liberals. Folks, let's apply both Grace AND Truth, as did Jesus of Nazareth. Read it yourself and determine which side of the saddle you MIGHT fall off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner From Pastor Alcorn","review":"I read The Grace and Truth Paradox at the end of 2004, but I chose to pick it up again due to a Changes That Heal study that my wife and I were a part of.

Here is a memorable quote, \\"It's not about earrings, tattoos, clothing, drinking wine, or smoking cigars. It's about justice, righteousness, love, and mercy. It's about grace and truth.\\" I like that line. I also want to recommend Alcorn's Heaven book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly reccommend!","review":"Quick read but has the potential to change your life if you let it. Wonderful, wonderful book!

Randy Alcorn's book is a gem. Randy, as usual, hits all the hard topics head on.I loved his segment on - \\"We've redefined Christlike\\" to be \\"nice.\\" He writes - \\"By that defination, Christ wasn't always Christlike. He confronted people with sin, raised His voice, threw tables and called people snakes, blind hypoctires, and white washed tombs.\\"Randy, as usual makes me laugh. \\"In the 1930s, German church leaders defended Adolph Hitler as a leader who didn't smoke or drink, encouraged women to dress modesty, and opposed pornography. If that's your checklist, Hitler was a swell guy.\\"BTW I bought the book for one cent on Amazon (second hand.) Good on the Alcorn ministry group.

As a mom, I appreciated the openings the book gave me for discussing some deeper spiritual concepts as we talked about why the events in the book happened as they did.The book reminded me of Pilgrim's Progress, but at the risk of sounding irreverent toward the classics, I'd have to say that Learning: Life in the Castle captured our imaginations even more than John Bunyan's allegory.

Comfortable and nice pillow top section. However, the third time I was ready to use it I noticed that the 9 volt connection pin had broken and dislodge, thus you couldn't plug it in. So I opened up the electronics panel with a screw driver, and used some styrofoam to keep the outlet pushed out. So now I could inflate it again if I held the adapter in. However, two days later, when I turned the thing to \\"inflate\\" i noticed that it didn't work. I opened it up again and saw that the cheap plastic had broken. So now it's dead.

It has definitely exceeded my expectations. I've been using it myself recently because my bedroom is going under some renovations. The pillow top easily zips off to wash. The biggest surprise for me was that it doesn't sink in the middle when weight is on top of it. The mattress stays relatively flat like a standard mattress. My only complaint is that sheets don't stay on the mattress well due to the fact that it is double-high. Other than that it was a great investment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little support and billowy","review":"A closer look at the product picture illustrates exactly what I am talking about. As you can see, the sides are bowed out on the long edges. This is even more exaggerated when ANY weight is put on this thing. Turning over on this mattress is like a carnival ride. Expect to wake your bed mate up with any movement of your torso. I can say it did hold air and over a three nights of use, it did not have to be topped off. I'm sure if this mattress had some sort of frame, the comfort level would be much more significant. I consider this a step above sleeping on the ground and a step below sleeping on a pile of blankets. For this price range, I would recommend trying to find something with a little more quality, or settle for a single high air mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unconventional book to be sure","review":"To be sure, this is an unconventional book... but what can you expect from Robert Capon?

I had also read Tanizaki's book upon which this movie is based, so I was curious to see film director Yasuzo Masumura's interpretation. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Movies about lesbian love and twisted sexual affairs may seem tame in today's world. But keep in mind this film was made in 1964, and in Japan no less! The plot centers around Mitsuko and her efforts to emotionally control her male and female lovers. This movie is erotically charged without being exploitive. There is very little nudity. What Masumura gives us is a very good portrayal of how sexual obsession can lead to annihilation. The acting is outstanding. This is a hard movie to classify, but it's definitely one that leaves an impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than Karajan\`s","review":"As I wrote a review some time ago, this is a follow up. I know very well this Also Sprach Zarathustra version because I had it in vinyl back in the seventies (from Columbia Records). And now a I am very pleased to say that the CD is as good as the original. Is unbelievable how an analogic recording from the seventies can sound so massive, as there is no audible compression at either high or low frequencies. Bersntein got the initial rumble from the organ and the bass drum a little bit longer, which adds a more dramatic atmosphere. I can't say that Karajan's version with the Vienna Philharmonic is not at the same league (after all this the one from the movie), but Bernstein gave to the work some histrionic touch that I really love. Mehta with Los Angeles Philharmonic did a very good job, too, but or me Bernstein is the absolute winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well, but puts out heat","review":"This unit does a very good job of removing water from the air, but it does put our a fair amount of heat.

The nonstick surface does not brown like the old fry pans did. It is very light weight.

Sadly after spending $50.00 on this item I'm out shopping again for, yup, a \\"real\\" electric fry pan. Lower your expectations and you'll be happy with this.

She does this without sounding either too 'symbolic' or too 'mathematical'. Each number is presented with its own compound illustration, and these are - to put it plainly - quite awesomely well executed.

I utterly commend this rare, beautiful and fascinating book to anyone with even a passing interest in numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deceivingly great book!","review":"This little book taught me even more about the sacred qualities of numbers than I ever would have imagined!

The theory is right, a compilation of unsoliscited music from Fat Cat Records, but the candor is off. It's mostly filled with dischordant noise and ranting.

And this was coming from the \\"Consumer Sales Coordinator.\\" No thanks! (Nice customer service!) The design makes it inevitable that this will occur. Do not buy this as you will be out 30 bucks, not to mention have Teflon coating your popcorn so that it looks like somebody ground black pepper all over it.

As far as I know, the popper is still popping corn some five or more years after I gave it away to a family very happy to have it.I can and do recommend this popper with the provision that the popcorn is not theater popcorn quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best there is now!","review":"We've had one of these things for year.

After it's third use, I picked up the cooled popper to wash it and the left base handle crumbled in my hand--fell to bits. The popper had only been used according to the instructions, so I emailed West Bend to find out how to get a new base. I was told if I shipped it to them insured, at my expense, I might be able to get a different base if it was still under warranty!

It also leaked oil out of the bottom of the machine.I have went thru 2 more since then, and my last one just died tonight...hence I am on Amazon looking for an alternative.As another reviewer noted, it appears they went to cheap foreign manufacturing and got junk.

Things definitely have gotten cheaper in quality since they moved production over to China. This popper is under powered, the stirring arm continuously gets stuck on the popcorn kernels and will reverse only to become re-stuck and the process continues until the corn begins to pop. There is a significant amount of unpopped kernels(probably due to poor stirring. The dome cover is flimsy when compared to the older unit (we had opted to use the old cover as it was stronger). The non-stick finish is very rough and causes the stirring rod to drag. I've returned the unit back to WestBend, WI for replacement.

It is a cheap piece of junk. It squeaks and creeks when the motor turns. The quality of materials and workmanship is noticeably less. Worst of all the popcorn doesn't taste half as good. I never stopped being a loyal customer, West Bend stopped being a trustworthy manufacture. I'm going back to popping corn the old fashion way, on the stove.

The 'stir' function is a joke too, more of a hinderance that anything. Kernals get stuck underneath it...even after tweaking (ok, bending) them a bit. Personally, I wish I hadn't bought this thing. I could do better with a big pan on the stove, and it would be easier to clean! I wish I could find another one like my old one..I'd buy one used! (I used to use a spoon to stir the seeds in my old one, plugging it in, and unplugging, till it was just right..THEN I let it pop!..it made great tasting corn. Think I'm nuts? You haven't tasted it! It roasts slowly before popping and has a GREAT \\"movie theater style\\" flavor) Just my 2 cents from a popcorn fanatic. (btw, air poppers should be outlawed!

I was so disgusted with it, I sent an e-mail to the company and asked what happened to their quality. They did respond, which I was impressed with, but didn't really have much to say other than we are sorry blah blah blah. I guess I shouldn't have been suprised when the popper shorted out last week.

Thus, you cannot prevent the rod from scraping off the Teflon surface after repeated use.It's dumb.I bought mine from a local retail outlet.

Making it hard to clean, rough and pitted.

The directions say to simply wipe it off with a damp cloth and that does work, just doesn't feel like I'm ever able to get ALL the oil off the pan.

I have had one for many years. Unfortunately, through no fault of West Bend, I had to replace the popper. It was still working just fine. This new popper works just as well. However, the metal base is not as sturdy as the base on the original (older) popper. When you clean the inside of the popper you can tell West Bend has used a cheaper metal material than on older models. Unfortunately, all companies are cutting costs. I'd pay more to have the stronger bottom (the area where you spread the kernels). Overall, I am happy with the popper since I am stir crazy for popcorn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent popcorn popper","review":"This is a great product. Only two slight nit picks.1. had to tweak the stirring wire to keep it from scraping the heating plate.2. black plastic lid doesn't like to stay on when you go to flip the popper upside down so the PC falls into the bowl/lid.number 1 was an easy fix with bare hands.number 2 is kind of a non issue as long as you don't care if some small bits of popcorn debris falls on the counter.Over all the only thing that keeps me from rating this a 5 star is that I have only had it for a few months so I don't know what kind of longevity to expect. It feels relatively solid and for the price I don't think you can really do much better!

We eat just a lot of popcorn in our house, I would guess that the popper is the most used appliance we own and we have owned several of these poppers. It makes great popcorn, is easy to set up and clean up, BUT, on every one of them the bowl top has become brittle and has deformed to the point that it is no longer functional. Our current edition, after about 6 months has warped to the point that un-popped kernels will shoot out the side under the bowl as the popper is doing its thing. If you only make popcorn now and then, this popper will probably last for several years, \\"BUT.\\" It is too bad that this defect, which certainly has been common to the six or eight West Bends that we have owned in the last several years, isn't fixed with a more durable bowl. Until it is we won't be purchasing another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stir mechanism jams","review":"We owned one of these years ago and after it gave out after several years of heavy use we went to buy another. It was a great popper. The popper, however, had obviously undergone a redesign on the stir mechanism. The popcorn kernels now got jammed in the mechanism causing it to stop. It happened with every use. This forced me to shake the unit while it popped to avoid burnt and unpopped kernels. Unfortunately, this shaking allowed the oil to get down into the base where it accumulated over a few uses. The oil in the base began to smoke and drip out of the bottom, so I ended throwing the unit away. Too bad they had to change a working design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Popper","review":"The stir stick is weak and turns very slowly and at times stops and thenreverses it self.

It took way too long to start popping and the kernels did not produce the big fluffy popcorn I was expecting. When I used the \\"butter well\\" located at the top of the unit, this caused moisture to condensate inside the popper and much of the popcorn ended up wet. I was checking online to see if anyone else had experienced this problem when I found out about the flaking teflon.

Cleanup can be cumbersome, but the popcorn always tastes great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like we had as kids","review":"I love this popcorn popper. Seems like any brand of popcorn we buy almost all the kernels pop. This unit reminds me of the same popcorn maker we had in our house as a kid except now instead of having to shake the unit to stir the kernels the stick on the bottom does the work for you. We did have to return one popcorn maker because the spindle or the stick didn't seem to be quite straight and the bottom the popcorn popper started to scratch which worried me what our kids might be eating. Also the tray where the oil and popcorn is placed is not dishwasher safe on our model. Not sure if there has been any change to this but it would be welcome improvement. Just my opinion but the taste and ability to use as little or as much butter/oil/salt as we choose is a big plus over microwave popcorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Popper","review":"Have had several of these poppers and they make great popcorn. I grow my own and it is always a favorite among family, friends, work and church so I use the popper a lot! The last one I just bought had a floppy pan which I thought just hadn't been tightened down properly during assembly. Should have returned it, but thought it would just be easier to take it apart and tighten the nuts. Well, one was cross threaded and although it was turning off, it also twisted off leaving no fix to that bolt so there is now only one nut holding the pan to the rest of it. Also found out that the pan was warped and couldn't seat properly even if it was tightened down. You can see the red hot element through the space between the pan and the base. Pops great though - live and learn!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Popcorn that taste like you are at the Movies!!","review":"Okay I got this popcorn maker at TARGET and wanted to beat the taste of microwave popcorn that sticks in your throat and taste awful.I started searching on the web thru reviews at Amazon , etc. and ran out to buy this maker.

Unfortunately, I'm back to zapping corn. The machine works fine despite some scraping of the teflon surface and it pops almost all of the corn. But the taste of the popcorn is just awful. It's chewy and mushy and the kernels don't seem like they're fully popped. It's nothing like the crisp popcorn you get at the theatre or from your stovetop or even from your microwave. I've tried different types of popcorn and different oils but still get the same nasty results. I'm going to buy a Stovetop popper and see if that provides the classic popcorn taste I'm looking for. Who wants Teflon in their popcorn anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"I have owned 2 Stir Crazy Corn Poppers over the years. Both were made in the USA and were good, solid well made appliances. The domes eventually cracked through years of heavy use. When I ordered this replacement,I presumed I would be buying another like I had owned before. But when it arrived I discovered that it was cheaply constructed in China of inferior materials. The heating surface was thin metal with unsealed edges around the perimeter allowing oil to enter the area containing the heating coil. I took the dome and put it on my old American made base that still works well, and threw this flimsy China made base in the trash where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only way to pop!","review":"The best popcorn popper money can buy (in my not so humble opinion) I've read the con's; palstic might melt in your food...do you drink bottled water?; butter-well doesn't evenly distribute the butter....melt some butter in a pot on the stove and pour it over your popcorn, duhh..; doesn't last long.....I've never wore one out...only had to replace when I lost, or broke the original, yes I said lost, as in moving.

These are the best. The only real problem with them is the useless butter chamber and lid on the top. It's completely worthless and just makes the bowl harder to clean. Hey West Bend, save us all some time and money -- redesign the bowl without that top chamber. Also, I had to laugh at the reviews that complained about the stirring wire rubbing against the non-stick surface. As another reviewer pointed out, it's a metal wire. Bend it to where you want it! Someone else complained that oil gets inside the mechanism. Maybe it does, but I get at least a year out each Stir Crazy, and I use them a lot. They're easy to clean and easy to use. I've tried others including the microwave bowls with the gimmicky \\"powercups\\", but Stir Crazy is still the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stir crazy driving me crazy!","review":"Bought this to replace my old one that I'd had for several years now.Either my popcorn is not good or the popper is not working well.

The heating plate can't be removed and I worry about water getting into the electrical components below. The bowl does not come clean easily and has acquired a sticky film even though I immediately clean it when it is done popping - after transferring the popcorn to another bowl. The shape of the dome/bowl is not good for releasing the steam that collects, so if you make a full bowl of popcorn, it's a bit chewy. If you use the tray on the top to melt butter onto your popcorn, then the butter leaks out of the black cover on the bowl and stains your couch! It takes up too much room on the counter, it won't fit in my 1950's cabinets, it's difficult to clean, the bowl doesn't hold the butter, and the popcorn isn't that great. I'm looking for a glass bowl on my next popper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great popcorn popper!","review":"This popcorn popper makes delicious popcorn that kids can actually see pop.

Then, two years ago Number Two was replaced; but this third popper quickly had problems with the motor turning the stir rod. We became more careful in cleaning it thoroughly around the pivot point to no avail. So, we recently purchased our fourth one thinking Number Three's issues were just a fluke; and we had a \\"lemon\\".Since the first turn of the stir rod of Number Four, the motor moans. It does work and it does pop the corn.

You have to be careful when turning the unit upside down to let the popped corn fall into the transparent globe.The base plate of the bottom cooking surface doesn't come out. To clean it, you are more or less limited to wiping it off.Other:I read reviews saying that the plastic globe can crack from heat buildup if the little cover is left in place on top of the globe while popping corn.

Not only does it pop more kernels than a microwave but is less prone to burning the entire batch. Being able to use the top as a bowl is a really convienant feature. I recommend using high quality coconut oil; it has a very pleasant aroma when cooking but doesn't impact the flavor of the popcorn then there's the added bonus of being better on the sides ;)The only down side is that if you have a small kitchen that it tends to take up a lot of space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Popper! Great Taste","review":"I bought this popper about 3 weeks ago. I've made several batches since buying it. I must admit that this popper works great. It pops every kernel. Since you only use a small amount of oil, it is not oily at all. Also, it's not as dry as those air poppers. But if you want tons of butter on your popcorn, this machine is not set up to do this. Although you can put real butter in a vent at the top of the popper, it's not enough for a real butter lover (you can always melt butter and add it on top after popping). However, if you want a slight buttery taste, with great tasting popcorn, then this is the popper for you. I've read reviews where they say that the non-stick surface breaks apart. I haven't had that yet, but I will update this review later if it does (check the date to see how much time has elapsed since I wrote this... if no update, then it still works fine)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wipe down the bowl for perfect popcorn","review":"To use the bowl, pop the corn without the black lid on top. This lets some of the steam escape. When the popcorn is just done popping, wisk off the lid (and watch the last kernals that pop fly about) with a paper towel. Quickly wipe the steam out of the bowl with the paper towel, put the bowl back over the popcorn, and flip. The popcorn is perfectly dry and I do not need to wash another dish.I also never use the black lid.Nothing ever seems to leak out so why bother.Jolly time popcorn, and the weird yellow mighty pop oil and salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Popcorn Popper","review":"I love popcorn and I bought this popcorn popper, and what can I say?

It leaves no old maids and the corn is light and fluffy. I use a very light popcorn oil to pop the corn and it gives the finished popcorn a butter taste. I have just a teeny complaint - there are a few burned pieces of corn and a burned area on the heating portion of the popper. I pull the plug out the second I hear the last corn pop, but I always have a mess to clean up in the end. Will I damage the heating plate if I keep scrubbing it to get the burned area clean? I use a very soft soaping brush and leave no scratches. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they pay for people to put 5 stars in?","review":"I have used many popcorn poppers. This one makes popcorn easily, but it is chewy due to the self basting steam it produces when you use it.

I recommend you explore hand cranks or air poppers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Faithful & Best popcorn ever!","review":"I've owned this popper for 17 years and it's still going strong. It makes the best popcorn ever especially when you use solid popcorn popping oil such as CocoPop sticks (found at Smart & Final Warehouse store). I also use the pre-measured packets that are made for theater type machines that you rent at party stores. I drag this popper everywhere we go in our motorhome and have become known as \\"The Popcorn Girl\\" to the kids. I purchase popcorn bags (sleeve type) and the kids stuff them with a scooper. It keeps them entertained for hours or until I'm sick of listening to the generator run! I've replaced the dome lid once and the non-stick is beginning to wear off the ridge where the stirrer rotates, no big deal.

Today I noticed that oil/grease from the motor unit that stirs the popcorm has started to leak from the edge of the top of the popper, at the edge of the teflon, where this oil/grease can get into food. This is clearly motor grease/oil, looking and feeling much like motor oil from an automobile, not like organic canola oil I use in popping. Naturally, I won't be using this popper any more, as I do not prefer to eat food contaminated with motor oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would you risk your health ingesting teflon?","review":"This item is a health hazard. The fact that the company is still allowed to sell these after all these years is an insult to conscious consumers everywhere.

I guess you have to use oil to pop the corn -- something I didn't want -- otherwise the machine doesn't work and produces an abysmal five pieces of inedible popped corn.

I get great poppcorn everytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered Twice -- Both Poppers Arrived Broken","review":"I was very interested in having popcorn without all of the chemical additives in microwave products. Difficult task???? Apparently so. I ordered this product twice, both times Amazon sent it without padding and the plastic base of the popper was broken. Stove top models cannot be used on a smooth ceramic cooktop. That leaves me one option: I am going to go back to using my old hot air popper and dodge the kernels that pop all over the place.

I have a burn scar to this day from the oil and butter splattering on my stomach. So, if you buy this, be sure not to make either of these mistakes, or at least not in a bathing suit (although I think I still would have been burned wearing a shirt, just not as badly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Popper","review":"We love our popcorn popper. The clear dome lets the kids watch the kernels burst into fluffy corn, which is very fun. The best part is that the arm mechanism is very effective at keeping the popcorn from burning. Very affordable. The only thing I wish is that there was a safer, easier way to get the popped corn out of the popper. Flipping it over is a little tricky because of the steam and warm base. Overall though, we think it's the best popcorn popper on the market and a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will never use another popper!!","review":"This is my second one, the first one finally gave up.

The plastic bowl is cracked and deteriorated, so I bought the new one.This item is loaded with problems, but here are the reasons you shouldn't get it:1) It's under powered. The heating element doesn't approach the temp of the older one and you need hot oil to pop the corn properly. This one cooks the kernels and many don't pop.2) The stirring arm is flimsy and cheap.

In every single test, the popcorn tasted stale, no snap, crackle or pop to the popcorn, just really disappointing. I'm not sure whether the steam that the unit generates when popping the corn is the culprit or not but it didn't matter what brand I used (I tried 3 including Orville Redenbachers best) the popcorn came out very non crispy and unlike any movie popcorn I have ever had. After going nuts with my experiments and not getting nearly the results I needed, I am back to Orville's microwave popcorn, including a dose of butter and popcorn salt.

Neither one lasted more than a few times of making popcorn. On the first one, the Teflon barely started to scrape off when the threaded center knob broke off. I wrote to the company to see if they came up with an improvement over the flimsy plastic one. They said no. I tried gluing it to no avail. We bought the second. On the second use, the Teflon came off in a large scrape when a kernel or two wedged under it during popping. On now the fifth use, again without much pressure at all, the plastic center knob broke off again. It is now going out in the junk like the last one. If anyone pays full price for this, they are crazy! Luckily ours were on sale for $20.00.

I usually just melt the butter in the microwave & add it after the corn is popped. The only time I have had poor popping results from this popper is when I have used old popcorn that I have had for a while (popcorn looses moisture when it is old causing poor popping performance). Otherwise, it pops just about every kernel. Have given several as gifts & everyone loved them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...","review":"Well, it does pop, kind of.

The screw-on knob is very tight and cheap feeling.3. The metal stir bar is not level and scrapes the coated base.The knob from my old unit fits much better, and does not cause the new bar to scrape. The bowl from my old unit fits on the new base.CHEAP, CHEAP PRODUCT and PARTS! How could this have ever passed a QC check?!!!I highly recommend that you DO NOT buy this product.

The bowl on the newer model seemed more durable than the old style, and this was good, but the overall quality of these Chinese imports (my old one was made in the U.S.)seems shoddy to say the least. The new popper wouldn't rest on all four 'feet' simultaneously, rocking slightly. It dripped oil from beneath the unit onto the countertop, and worst of all, the heat element lasted no more than six months, after which time it wouldn't heat the corn to popping temperature.

Well only after eating a big bowl of popcorn did I come back to the machine to find that the teflon was rubbed off in a \\"circular\\" pattern. It was from either the metal stirring rod or a piece of popcorn that got stuck under the rod. Yuck, I must have ingested some of that teflon. I took the machine back to the store thinking I had a faulty machine. I made a batch of popcorn on the new machine, and although the scraping isn't as bad-- it's still there. The teflon is coming up after just ONE USE. C'mon man that is not reasonable. This machine is going back.

Unfortunately, demonstrating that everyone relies upon 'philosophy' is not the same as demonstrating that everyone *should* rely upon 'Objectivism'.By the standards of 'Philosophical Detection' itself, 'Objectivism' is an abysmal failure as a 'philosophy'. Rand deserves credit for inspiring a few people to read philosophy other than her own - and frankly not for much else. Even her few legitimate points are presented in such a plonkingly self-aggrandizing fashion as to dissuade the reader from looking into *any* philosopher other than Rand.

Bernstein does a great job in unlocking the flavor on these first two symphonies: #1 \\"Winter Dreams\\" (indeed evoking the long, cold, snowy expanses of Russia; and #2 \\"Little Russian\\" which is a kind of symphonic tribute to the homeland (the opening of the forth movement sounds a bit like a main theme from the 1812 Overture).Comparison: Karajan/BPO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm at best","review":"Bernstein's recordings of Tchaikovsky's two earliest symphonies are, for the most part, forgettable. Bernstein plays them as if he were just going through the motions. The balance is off on both (much of it spoiled by an overbearing tuba that smothers the rest of the orchestra), and the New York Philharmonic lacks an energy and edge to their playing that these two works deserve. The 1st and 2nd symphonies, while not as popular as the better crafted 4th, 5th, and 6th symphonies, still offer a great deal of wonderful music.

There is a PGV rating on the back for violence but they don't tell you about the adult language as well as the sexual references.

The concealer was coiled and I could not manage to get it uncoiled so it would lie flat. (Notice the ridges on the inside of the coil which would indicate it is tightly wound.) The product closest to the inside was very tightly wound and I thought it would be unusable. I had to revert to just covering the cord with a rug.

Otherwise, it gets a 2 star rating because the rest of it works OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not stay flat","review":"As other reviewers have noted, it's very difficult to get this to stay flat.

I want to like it, but to be honest, I can't say it has ever helped me understand a topic I was having trouble with. It is all math, math, and more math. That may be what physical chemistry is all about, but the problem is the math does not do a better job of teaching you than textbook math does. If you need more help than your textbook provides, this doesn't have it. The short paragraphs that introduce you to concepts use the most technical words they possibly can, so I feel like I am reading a math book or my own Atkins' texbook.

It gave good background information, but little in the way of examples of recipes. This is a great supplement to that book. THis book provides many more recipes with examples of meal plans. This book also gives good explanations of daily requirements, how to calculate them for you, and just how to make creative, health meals based on volumetric eating. Lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. Go figure!! Highly recommend the combination of books if you're looking for a change in you eating style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazed with the concept simplicity and ease of reading","review":"This book is very easy to read and you can jump into the concepts early on rather than having things dragged out. I love the way this book is written. I've already applied some of the concepts into my daily life and have already started to notice results. These concepts are easy to follow and stick with. I'm glad I don't have to give up food; this helps me to stick with it. It took me a long time to gain the weight I've gained and this book will help me to lose that weight. It's not a miracle \\"lose it all now\\" program. It gives you concepts that will help you lose the weight slowly, healthy, and permanently if you stick with it, which really isn't hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"My $0.02","review":"This is a very helpful book for people trying to lose weight.

This Volumetrics plan is the most sensible and useful one I've found. This newer book contains recipes that don't require a lot of exotic ingredients and are easily used if you are on Weight Watchers or South Beach too, but the Volumetrics plan is easier to shop for and more satisfying. The book also contains useful guides for how many calories you should cut in order to lose weight, how to measure portions etc. and other similar info found in many other diet books, but the title really says it all - you really do feel full on fewer calories, but you do it by eating a wide variety of good, easily available foods. I've lost an average of 2 pounds a week on this plan and it has been the easiest to stay with I've tried (and I've tried them all)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Vegetarians","review":"The majority of the book contains recipes with meat, fish, poultry.

So to confirm my suspicions, I looked in all my music books at home, checked my Motown CD collection then spent hours on the internet searching, and sure enough, I could not find any reference to The Volumetrics anywhere. Probably some one-hit 70s Albanian boy band.

A reference to the fox who \\"comes to kill\\" and a statement that the boy says \\"You stop, or I will whip you-NOW\\". It becomes apparent that they are all running from a man with a gun showing a faceless man holding a rifle. Then you see the man with the rifle who says that someone is chasing him so \\"I took my gun and then I ran\\". It all ends with a sheep with his foot in a bucket that just needs some help.I understand the premise of the story and, in fact, it is a very cute story about a boy who is just trying to help. However, I do not feel that this book is appropriate for a two year old to be reading. (or should I say read to) and I\`m not sure at what age level that this would be appropriate.

Threatening words used in the tale included: \\"You want to kill the little cow! You stop, or I will whip you--NOW!\\" & \\"it can bite & kick & kill\\", and there were many other such references. These are violent & scarey words to a young child & promote the idea of violence as a way to solve disputes. How awful that an author wrote a book like this. Please Mr. Mike McMlintock, write children's stories without referring to violence. You have gifts to use, so please use them wisely! Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Talks About Killing","review":"I am writing a similar review to others in the \\"1 star\\" column to help lower the review level of this \\"four star\\" book. This book should have no place on a child's bookshelf. It is a fun book and could be a great read, but it talks about a fox trying to kill a calf and it has a man with a rifle in it. I can accept one animal trying to \\"get\\" one another or perhaps even \\"bite\\" or lastly \\"eat\\" another, but talking about killing another anything is unacceptable.

Unfortunately, this is a poor-sounding recording even for its time, and Bruckner and Mahler are NOT composers whose works play to Szell's strengths. Fortunately, there has been an absolute eruption of terrific Bruckner and Mahler recordings since the 1970's, and we have a wealth of choices. For Szell, I'd suggest his Dvorak, Schumann, Mozart or Beethoven, even Tchaikovsky, but not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!","review":"It is very rare that I give a recording such a low rating, but in this case, I think, you the listener would have to agree with me --if you ever made the mistake of buying this disc. You might ask: Szell+Wiener+Bruckner=Disaster? Yes. Szell was a master, and he may have been a master of Bruckner, but this is not a representative document. Part of the reason you can't enjoy this recording is because of the terribly bad sound. Another reason is the yes, lazy, performance of the Vienna Philharmonic. Whatever Szell may have felt during this performance, whatever his credentials as a Brucknerian: they are not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor severe reading...","review":"I just don't find Szell convincing in this repetoire...it as if the orchestra is bored and comes to the conclusion they are in for a long night...in spite of some fine moments Szell just refuses to play romatically.

She tends to assume not only responsibility for the women she \\"heals\\" but the original development of a model that has been found in other previously written literature and that in itself is a commentary on her own unhealed woundedness.

This is not a problem if your telescope has an alt-az mount, but if you have an equatorial mount, then, regardless of the initial orientation, the finder eyepiece will be pointing toward the ground for about 1/2 the sky.

After all, aren't we all a little confused sometimes about what God is and where that confusion takes us in our search for spiritual answers?

Maybe hanging it from her rear view mirror would be nice.I had gotten one of these before and the quality was great. Heavy silver with beautiful beads.

The backing orchestration and vocals are excellent. However, everything unravels when the lead vocals commence. The singers all sound as if there was a curtain between them and the microphone when the recordings were made. It is not just a matter of 60 year old vocal chords being weaker than 20 year old. It is not the obvious lack of proper balance between the audience noise and the music. The simple problem is that the vocals were not mixed at the correct volume. I can understand such a problem with a 1960 concert. This is a 2003 production!

After reading this book I could remember every detail in Amelia Earhart's life. The only problem with this book is, like a lot of other biographies it isn't very exciting and not even once during the book could I not put the book down. But if you're interested in Amelia Earhart's life you have to read this.The book starts off talking about Amelia's childhood, about her fathers drinking problems. Then it talks about her training as a pilot and her different jobs she gets. It talks about each of her record braking flights, giving details like the names of her planes and even says details like what the weather was like when she was taking off. Finally it talks about her mysterious disappearance at sea and talks about the many theories about what happened to her.

I have to agree with the previous reviewer, though - why this quirky marketing strategy? This was a great show that ran for a long time. If they offered the series for sale in regular music stores I am sure I would periodically blow some change on them, just like I am slowly collecting Monty Python and other series right now (as long as the DVDs were a decent deal and contained three or more episodes apiece). I bought the last \\"best-of\\" collection and I guess I'll buy this one (at least it's on sale) but it just seems to me like the show is a potential goldmine and it is being marketed stupidly. With so much material to choose from, why be so cheap? Laugh-in was a beloved part of my childhood, and one I desire to commemorate. Make with the shows, already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have done a better job with this collection.","review":"Once again, Rhino has put out another collection of Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. However, this set is inferior to the first one for three reasons. First, the episode with Greer Garson is indistinguishable from the one in the first collection. Second, the listing of the episodes is different from the way they are presented on the DVDs. Finally, on the third DVD, they didn't have one of the regulars talk about his or her time on the show. This is the reason why I rated this collection so low, as it's always nice to hear the regulars' talking about their time on the show and there are still are a lot of them we haven't heard from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing & Expensive","review":"The selection of the 'best' seems very haphazard & some of the late '60s political references have lost their edge 35 years on. There's a lot of padding between sketches, Goldie Hawn writhing about in body paint. The worst thing of all is that there are just two episodes on each disc and the remaining space, about a third of the whole, is given over to one of the performers rambling on a lot about themselves and what fun it all was but nothing about the production and its history. Really poor value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not buying until more content, would buy entire series if offered","review":"At first when I saw that this is a 3 DVD set I was happy because I thought there would be a lot of content.

Only 1 episode is taken from the 1968-1969 season (my favorite season). Stars include Greer Garson, Lorne Green, Danny Kaye, Herb Alperb, and others. This set also contains some great characters such as Gladys & Tyronne, the Russion Soldier, the Farkel Family, Edith Ann, Ernestine the Telephone Operator, and the Russian Imigrant - Mr. Rosmenko.The only downside to this is the fact that most of the episodes are from the 3rd season.

Well, I've got a news flash for you - if I had ice cubes handy I could put them in my soda and be done with it.

I was told that they were aware that most Champagne will not fit and some of the new special format bottles will also not fit and the company is looking into a solution(make it a half or three quarters inch wider would seem a no brainer).Since I did not test its cooling capabilities I can only tell you that since I could not fit the wine bottles that I normally drink in the machine it did not work at all.

She hires Jerry, a teenager who has recently lost his job, to help her with the packing and then to act as her tour guide before she returns to Alaska.

This is a tight group that has played and toured together often, a group that is not afraid to take some chances in improvising, yet who seem to love spinning entrancing webs of melody and rhythm. The cuts on Lontano vary in tempo and style, but consistent throughout is the sheer intensity of the playing. That is not to say the music is relentless and loud and pounding; indeed, the playing is often soft and tender--but it is an intense softness, an intense tenderness, deep and smoldering and soulful. If you are a jazz fan who has not yet picked up on Stanko's sound, Lontano is a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy Without Listening First ..","review":"i think tomasz stanko and this quartet are fantastic and the last two albums - soul & night - are great, great, great. stanko is my favorite trumpet player the the trio esp piano are hot and original. they are now defining jazz because the american musicians have not done anything in recent years. ecm is the hottest jazz label ever.with that - i bought this in pre-release and just got it and i have listened to it only twice and i just don't like it. it feels like no structure - like warm up material and there really is no tempo.so - if you like this then theoretically you should melt when you listen to sould & night. enjoy your music"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy product and equally crappy service","review":"Purchased the item in Oct 2007 as a gift for my nephew who lives in Trinidad.

A showdown occurs at the planet Kirk has been contracted to save, where Kirk's former crew are pitted against Kirk and his new planetary defense force.A secret treasure of information the planet holds a key to interpreting this mystery, as Kirk captains a now-decommissioned Enterprise as a defense ship for the almost defenseless planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ties in the original journeys from the series to the films!","review":"This is definately one of the best Star Trek (original Crew) books I've ever read.

Kirk runs off with a beautiful woman half his age,chehov facing death asks himself \\"what would the captin do\\", and sulu an accomplished starfleet captain could even save the day with out saying \\"captain kirk had always wanted to do that\\". despite shatner's ego ashes of eden is a above average trek novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sampler! Great price! Great performance!","review":"For about eight dollars (plus the price you pay for shipping and handling), you can listen to Leonard Bernstein's analysis of the first movement of Beethoven's fifth symphony in four different languages, concluding to his powerful groundbreaking performance of the romantic artist's greatest work ever written! A great introduction to Bernstein's Royal Edition! Crisp sound (Sony upgrated the sound quality about 24 bits)! Don't pass by this one! This has to be the greatest performance of the fifth I have ever experienced!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lenny Performing Beethoven's Fifth","review":"I guarantee you, that if you want some little information about how Beethven made his fifth symphony (the first movement only), you should buy this CD. Beethoven actually struggled very hardly when he made the music. This was probably not the way you expected. I thought he made it easy and calm, but I was wrong. Listen to the rest of this information WITHIN THIS CD. You should buy it. With the whole 5th symphony itself, this is truly a classical sampler for beginners. The performance is fairly good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece, but keep reading ...","review":"Bob Roll's 2005 Companion is a delight to read and a masterpiece in explaining the Tour, even if your bike racing knowledge is limited to wondering what all the fuss is about. Chapeau! If you don't have it, get it. Unless you already have the 2004 Companion, that is, because the vast majority of the book is pretty much identical. Only the TdF cribsheet is all new. No offense, Bob, but I'll stick with the 2004 version and my Velo News 2005 guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut-n-pasted from 2004","review":"Unfortunately, this book is mostly a cut and paste job from the '04 edition, and a very bad one at that. For example, on several pages 'last year' refers to '03, on others it refers to '04. On page 105 Richard Virenque had won 6 polka-dot jerseys, on page 117 he won 7. I gave it a second star only because I'm a big Bob Roll fan.C'mon Bobke, you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled Promise","review":"Tour de France: Companion 2005 implies that you will be getting a guide to the race for 2005. If that is your expectation, you will be disappointed. Of the 184 pages, almost 5 relate to this year's race in what is hardly more than cursory detail...There are no profiles of the stages. There are no individual stage maps. There are no descriptions of the routes and the challenges they pose. The authors, it is clear, have not taken the trouble to follow and scout this year's route. They did not follow last years either would be my guess, nor will they next.The cover of the book promises to provide a 2005 crib sheet. If the reader expects to pass a test based on the promise of the crib sheet, he will get a failing grade. Look elsewhere if you are interested in information regarding the current Tour de France."},{"rating":"1","title":"not 100 % wool!","review":"This is NOT 100% WOOL as described!

While the two conductors do it in vastly differing styles, they both get their point across quite effectively. The Philadelphia strings are, as always, beyond reproach and the sound is fine for the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'must have' u-boat historical document.","review":"For anyone seriously interested in WWII German U-Boats this is a must have book. Perhaps a little dry and technical to the light reader, it contains a wealth of information about the capabilities and tactics employed by German U-Boats from the best possible source - the BDU itself. The scholar will make many connections after a thorough study of this work, and it is well worth the cost for the layman as well. I also recommend that the serious student visit uboat.net for the single best source of information to complement the reading of this book that I have found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polemical and Divisive","review":"Rather than shed light on these important issues, Urvashi Vaid disses anybody in the movement who doesn't see things as narrowly as she does. So, for example, she attacks belligerently Bruce Bawer, author of the splendid \\"A Place At the Table\\". To say that Bawer doesn't understand gay issues is obscene as well as absurd. It's Vaid who doesn't understand that gays come in all shapes and sizes, and that she doesn't represent anyone except a small bitter fringe element. Bawer resonates much more with mainstream gays and lesbians than she ever will. She might read his book and learn something from it, instead of condemning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Paper and Ink","review":"This book is a polemic by an author with a narrow mind. As a gay man, I resent mightily her insistence that if you don't see issues HER way, you have no place in the Gay movement.On the one hand, Vaid expresses a \\"sincere\\" desire to reach out to others in the Gay Lesbian movement. On the other hand, she silences those, like the great Bruce Bower, who disagree with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit my 2012 Tacoma","review":"I ordered it carefully, but when I got i\\\\t, it showed that it fit through 2011 Tacoma's. There is a pump mounted on the fender of the truck that is in the way of this filter. I checked a 2010 Tacoma and it does not have that pump there.

Everything was in perfect condition and all of the parts were in the box. The instructions were great - each step has its own picture so that helped a lot. The only tools I needed were some screwdrivers, a rachet and a few sockets, and a couple allen wrenches, and it took me about 2.5 hours to install everything. Definitely noticed a difference in the sound and the acceleration response, which is exactly what I was going for. I know there are other cheaper intake kits out there but I got the K&N because they're the best brand and you can't beat a million mile warranty. Overall I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its good for the sound.","review":"I bought it for my 07 Tacoma and it was easy to install. It gave the truck a nice sound when passing. It said to give 10 more HP at 4900 rpm's, but Im never that high into my rpm's.After having it on my truck for a week and reading more about it on some tacoma forums I decided to return it. Paying $200 for sound was just a little to much for me. So if you are buying it to have little rumble when you pass then its great, but dont buy it for anything other than sound.A little side note, while reading about my truck on Toyota forums technically Toyota's come stock with a Cold Air Intake system, you just need to replace the paper filter with a cloth one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great!","review":"So glad to see Richard and Elizabeth together in a movie but it wasn't great.Kind of like a bad drug trip, with bad acting and set and props.But still love Richard Burton & Elizabeth Taylor ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster - should have been so much better!","review":"If it was not for the stellar performance of Richard Burton this movie would be worthless. He rants and raves and practically chews up the scenery while the support cast is boring and dull. If the cast was working up to Burton's level this movie would be STUNNING! If the cast was as exciting as Taylor's bust - prominently displayed on her every entrance - the movie would be spectacular! Unfortunately, it has all the spontaneity of a bad senior class play."},{"rating":"1","title":"His bias is showing","review":"I got this book from the library on a strong recommendation. Myheart sank when I saw the foreward was by ex-Pres Bush pere. I did get through the whole thing, but became increasingly disenchanted.Author is strongly biased in favor of what may be loosely called \\"the right wing\\" (not that those terms have any meaning these days!). He waxes lyrical about Cheney and Rumsfeld --writing even after their iniquities have become public. He skids lightly over misdeeds of the Cold War, especially those of the U.S. The only fairly readable parts were his thumbnail sketches of the military men he encountered during his career. As far as I'm concerned, reading this book was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting","review":"I couldn't really enjoy the book and gave up on it by chapter 5. The author seem to keep repeating certaing topics over and over and dull in telling the story. The book mostly seem like an autobiography of his life in the air force with a lot of his opinions. The book covers the Cold War but he presents it in a very tedious and slow manner. Could be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"informative but self-congratulatory","review":"This book contained a lot of information about the Cold War, but the tone was unrelentingly self-congratulatory and put me off the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"from a Cold Warrier","review":"Tom Reed's book brought back the memories of those days in SAC when any one of a number of conditions could have unleashed the horror of multiple nuclear explosions. Fortunately, the wisdom and maturity of the right people at the right time evaded those conditons. And the discipline of SAC crewmembers and leaders was vital to the success of the standoff.Reed also focuses on the bravery of those few who had to risk their lives to gather intelligence prior to satellite reconnaissance development. All in all, a real eye-opener on what went on inside the halls of power."},{"rating":"2","title":"A History of the Cold War - Long Overdue","review":"Reed writes this insider's history of the Cold War in the prose of a fine novelist. This is a difficult book to put down. It is about powerful people and their interactions within the framework of government at its highest level. Politics and poker! Bureaucracy and those who knew how to cut through it. A calculating and manipulating president's wife. Americans and Soviets exercising superb judgment at critical moments, moments that could have made for a different life on this planet had those judgments not been correct.

It came quickly and in good order, but to me it's useless.

The 4th is captured in all its stormy, turbulent power, rarely yielding the listener an opportunity to come up for air. Despite the quality of the 4th, the disc's best track just might be \\"Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis,\\" which I have always believed would fit nicely somewhere in Holst's \\"The Planets,\\" but it clearly has its own distinctive, soaring, passionate voice. \\"Fantasia on Greensleeves\\" is delicate and delightful as always, and the disc concludes with the seven part \\"Serenade to Music.\\" The reason I can only give this CD four stars is that accounts of these works by Barbirolli and Boult are still the standard bearers, and Bernstein just doesn't quite offer their insight. In all, this is an oustanding album and a prime candidate to be reissued as a Bernstein Century title, though I seriously doubt it will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratches...","review":"I like the idea of this safety blanket and the material does keep the baby warm.

This book sheds very little light on any of the individual Maryland families mentioned in the title. Its focus is on wealthy colonists as a class with little emphasis on the individual families. Furthermore, it is not really a study of the 'Maryland' elite as the title says, because it primarily limits itself to only two counties in Maryland. The book might be interesting to historical sociologists but I doubt that anyone wishing to learn details of old Maryland families would be satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I never heard of Hazel's Candies, and I bought this book along with several others as I launched into home candymaking.

His explanations and definitions are useful. After teaching the Exner system for over 13 years, I continue to find this the most invaluable tool in assisting my students to learn to accurately code profiles. The one short-coming that has been apparent in every edition of this book is the tendency for the examples at the end of the workbook to sometimes violate the coding rules stated by Exner himself. Thus, it is useful to examine those responses and try to understand why the coding does or does not make much sense for any given response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Not As Good As Another ' 85","review":"There's a bootleg cd titled, \\"Across A Crowded Room\\" apparently taken from the officially released laserdisc with the same title. I believe it was a show shot for Japanese TV. The \\"Faithless\\" cd sound quality sounds a bit muffled and flat compared to the bootleg, of which the sound is much clearer and crisp. The only con for me was the amount of reverb that was used in the \\"AACR\\" cd, but was negated by the energy of the show.

The whole affair seems leaden (and, if you're up for that sort of Petrushka, you'd be better off with Klemperer's weighty but interesting account on Testament). \\"Bloated\\" is what I'd say about this one -- the Philadelphia virtuosos can't rescue it from Ormandy. One feels Ormandy probably only liked The Firebird of Stravinsky's compositions. The ugly spot-miking of the Columbia engineers doesn't help; it's terribly obtrusive.

The informative, often fascinating text is beautifully and profusely illustrated with superb color photography, complemented by vintage bland-and-white images of Middle-Easter villages and cities, the rug-making culture and process. The reader will find a wealth of expert advice for buying an oriental rug, how to evaluate quality and price, buying and trading customs (with tips on negotiating a purchase), and invaluable ideas respecting interior decoration with original rugs. Oriental Rugs Of The Silk Route is enhanced further with a glossary of oriental rug terminology and a helpful appendix on oriental rug cleaning and repair. Oriental Rugs Of The Silk Route is rewarding reading for the oriental rug enthusiast, and a highly recommended introduction for the novice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveals The Fascinating Art Form Of Bargaining","review":"Gregorian's book is compelling stuff and speaks about a part of the world where bargaining is as much an artform as the rugs themselves. Gregorian is an expert on buying, using extremely sophisticated, yet seemingly simple, methods developed over generations. It reminds me of what the owner of the most expensive men's clothing store in America once told me, \\"I make more money buying the fabrics than I do selling the suits.\\"Being an author myself (\\"Why People Don't Buy Things\\"...the new science of selling products, services and ideas based on over 50,000 interviews), I'm fascinated by the time-proven methods employed by Gregorian. Obviously, they've been passed down by his family and work as well today as they did years ago.This book is well worth the read even if you're not into rugs.

Terry Kath will always be an unbearable loss to this band and I really miss some special musical bass-patterns by Peter Cetera, although in voice he is substituted rather well. The voice of the organ player is really terrible: we call him the 'chicken farmer' here! Nice DVD to have and join the party, but musically it makes me sadder every day.

The recipes do not produce good soap and the instructions for re-batching produce rather unpleasant-textured soap that takes months to harden up and become useable. The author recommends the use of fabric dyes, many of which are highly toxic and should never be applied to the skin. Slightly less serious, she recommends using pot-pourri fragrance oils which are not approved for cosmetic use and can cause major problems in the soap manufacture.

I did not do things exactly like the book since I used the microwave for rebatching. Use your gut and play with your soap it makes you feel good. Straight forward about potential hazards.

That is not a fatal drawback; I have many books the sole purpose of which is to provide inspiration. However, the book is seriously lacking basic information (such as lye-fat tables, sources, or a real trouble-shooting guide), and I find the rebatching recipes call for too much water.

I tried the vegetarian basic soap recipe in order to mill it and make the fabulous soaps displayed. The milled soap never melted. It was like a waxy consistence but I placed it in the molds anyway fighting the air bubbles. I told myself\\" maybe if I try the Castille soap basic recipe it would melt(and olive oil is expensive) well it did not melt either and what a shoulder,arm and back workout it was to mix the paste. We need more trouble shooting included in the book I'm sure we can get those nice looking soaps some day!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper soap than other books","review":"It's cheaper to make soap from The Complete Soapmaker than other books because the ingredients you need (chicken grease, beef lard, olive oil, for example) are readily available and fairly inexpensive. I've been silently appalled at the cost of ingredients for recipes in The Soapmaker's Companion -- you can't find cocoanut oil or palm oil at the grocery store. The ingredients tend toward the exotic and have to be ordered via mail order. I guess I have a pioneer mentality -- I like the idea of using waste grease for something useful. I've been happy with the quality of the soaps I've made from both books, though I tend to favor The Complete Soapmaker because the recipes are more completely saponified. I don't like the slightly greasy feel of superfat soap from Soapmaker's Companion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great photos. Bad instructions!","review":"Ihonestly don't understand this book, though I am grateful since the excellent pictures inspired me to continue the quest. I tried to mill as a beginner and then again as an experienced soapmaker. Both times I got the samething, warped and shrunken bars, though I did use the same basic recipe.I've heard you need to start with a good base and her base did not work. I'd love to try again, but only if someone else has had success. Have you? email me.

It bills itself as the \\"Complete Soapmaker\\" however it is not this at all. The entire focus of the book is on rebatching. As most any experienced soapmaker will tell you, rebatching is time consuming, unpredictable, and often unnecessary. If someone wants to learn rebatching then this is an OK resource (although I think the pictures and recipes do not emphasize the challenges of rebatching). However, as a \\"complete\\" resource on soapmaking...I don't think this book fits the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be KIDDDING me!","review":"Wow! What a terrible book! Who is comfortable handling lye (which the author admits can ruin metal, wood, clothes, etc., and she advises you to wear goggles and rubber gloves to handle); can find obscure ingredients like finely ground pumice, sweet almond oil, powdered kelp, frankincense powder and vitamin E oil at their local supermarket; wants to give up an enamel or stainless steel cooking pot and two plastic pitchers forever (you can't use it for anything else after you put lye in it); and has two spare candy thermometers handy? Not I. I will find another soap book. Thank goodness I borrowed this one from the library first. Sheesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"This book has beautiful photos and cover, but that is about it. I bought it years ago, when I first started making soap. What I wanted was something about hand milling soaps, this book is about rebatching. I did not try her basic soap recipe, but I did try her rebatching techniques. None of them worked, it took the grated soap forever to melt and forever to harden. Finally I gave up, and the book has sat on the shelf unused for years. There is much better information to be found on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good condition, good book","review":"I recived the Soapmaker book in good state and I am satisfied with provided informations about the book itself.

Thankfully, it isn't the first one I actually used. She warns on page 34-- \\"don't make the mistake of adding the lye to the water\\" when the correct method is EXACTLY the opposite --or a SERIOUS explosion/reaction can happen. The recipes are also very \\"lye heavy\\" and she confuses \\"handmilling\\" with what soapmakers term \\"rebatching\\". I'm very concerned that this book comes highly recommended on many web sites for beginners to soapmaking. There are many better books out there that are much more informative AND accurate!! Hot and cold process soapmaking isn't teribly difficult and very rewarding, but when working with caustic chemicals, one should be well-informed. This book could seriously mislead someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Great Book!","review":"From start to finish a very colorful and promising book! Author constantly reminds of safety.

As he tells you about two teams of dedicated athletes who play for the love of the game and the pride of their school, with little hope of going on in the athletic world, he also goes into the traditions of two great schools and the bond that the men and women there have with each other and their schools. My daughter Lisa, a '94 midshipman, is mentioned in the book and would have been proud to read it. I don't usually like to read about football; I prefer to watch it.

What a disappointment when I received my copy and tried to read it. It is by far the most rambling and unfocused book I have tried to read in years. The author's essential message could be summarized in a few sentences and strategies for protecting onself from controlling people listed on one page.Unlike most \\"self-help\\" books, this one is not organized in a way that makes it easy to find sections on identifying problem behaviors or on strategies for countering them. I expected an extention of the ideas presented in the Evans' book \\"The Verbally Abusive Relationship.\\" Not so. \\"The Verbally Abusive Relationship\\" is written for a general audience and \\"Controlling People\\" is a very watered-down and rambling version of the ideas presented in \\"The Verbally Abusive Relationship.\\" Look elsewhere if you want a book that will help you develop your own ability to protect yourself from people who try to control you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?

This book is hard to get through, has made up stories, and after reading it, hoping it would have words of wisdom.

Here's the secret for \\"breaking the spell\\" of the controlling person in your life: when they say something controlling, such as thinking they know better than you what you are thinking or feeling, say \\"What?\\" or \\"Nonsense.\\" That's it, and it took 250 pages to get to this \\"gem\\", and sixteen pages to explain it.I had definitely hoped for more useful information both on how to improve myself so that I am less \\"controllable\\" and how to effectively deal with people who seek to control me.

How about the fairy tale about Teddy? This book illustrates quite clearly how a person has a deep need to control and will go to any lengths to do it, but let's not forget the author promises to discuss how to deal with them. That part was literally 5 or 6 bullet points of things like \\"say 'what?' over and over\\" or \\"say 'nonsense'\\". Oh, I guess those magic words just never occurred to me. I guess next time my husband is verbally assaulting me, calling me names, threatening my hairstylist so she won't cut a single inch off my hair, I'll just say \\"what?\\" and he'll magically stop!!Get real!!This book is truly bizarre.

But I've had nothing but problems with this horrific device! From the beginning, the manual was in Chinese, the operation was so complicated that I had to refer to (and decipher) the manual over and over. Just changing the ink carts was ridiculous, as the stupid thing ALWAYS said \\"no cartridge\\" until you pounded the new one in with your fist (all three colors and black did the same thing). Had to \\"clean\\" the black each and every time I wanted to print a letter, resume, etc. More smudged and faded prints than should ever be put up with. Won't ALLOW you to print if the idiotic thing PERCEIVES that ink in ANY cartridge is low (even if it's almost half full)!!!!

Its a great looker as others have mentioned, and its low profile is perhaps the best in the all-in-one segment. It will fax well. The included software is OK. But it is a dog at printing. I've replaced the black cartridge numerous times, and I only print perhaps 15 pages a month! Sometimes, I replaced the cartridge twice in a month; and even then it has streaking issues.The real cost of ownership of this printer is unaffordably high.

Fortunately I had purchased an extended warranty from Staples when I bought it. Staples also exchanged this machine for a refurbished item. About a week after that I received a postcard from Brother stating that with this machine, they have extended the original warranty by a year. I guess this did me no good because the \\"error 41\\" occured again 2 days after the end of the second warranty. Well that was it, three strikes and I'm out.

So, I called Brother and, after spending ten minutes listening to their irritating voice mail drill down system, I finally got a live operator who unsympathetically declared that the machine was \\"broken\\" and would have to go to a service center. She wouldn't even discuss WHAT about the machine was \\"broken\\". Great.

Then it would just stop printing alltogether. So I called Brother, and then sent me a complete replacement machine. And it did the same thing. So I called Brother. This time, they said the warranty was only 30 days long, and so I needed to contact their service center. Sure, that's what I'll do.

The incidents at first were few and far between and usually at times when the TV was not on. Recently, however, whenever I turned on the TV, the receiver would shut off and I could not get it back on with either the remote or the receiver's power button. Then suddenly it would turn on by itself and instantly go off. It would go into a loop of on and off until I finally unplugged it from the outlet.The receiver supplied by dish, will loose the signal and I have to do a hard reset by unplugging the power while the receiver is on.

I found that you can watch the videos stored on the DVR without a service card. It cannot be used to record, watch TV inputs or USB memory stick. You can take the 235 G hard drive out and copy all the recorded shows to your own PC. Just remove the hard drive from the DVR and connect it to a desktop computer. The Dish Network uses a Linux hard disk format called Ext. (Dish Network uses Linux to run its unit if that helps.) You will have to Mount the three unnamed partitions to see them with Windows. Just use the Windows disk manager to see the DVR hard disk. A special program like Ext2fsd can be used to label the partitions. As far as I know the rest of the DVR 625 unit is useless without a subscription. I just kept the 235 gig HD in my desktop computer and trashed the rest of the DVR 625 unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable DVR, Will Make You Want to Cancel Dish","review":"After having this unit for two years we are cancelling our Dish service.

I can't tell you how often I missed the last 20 minutes of major shows because the DVR didn't record correctly. Avoid this unit and don't subscribe to Dish--they weren't helpful, they raised rates without informing subscribers, and they tried to force me to not cancel.

(Examples include: FIR, IIR and adaptive (LMS) filters, Goertzel algorithms and DCT for JPEG)It is also a very useful reference for DSP users with some experience as the example applications included can be used to provide a basis from which to build their own specialist applications.The structure makes it easy to follow and refer back to.

It read more like a kid's novel than anything else. It lacked depth and emotion. The characters were all made out to be shallow, childish and weak, while Mr. Keating's part in the changing of the boy's lives was terribly downplayed. Some of the very poignant scenes in the movie were simply not justified in the book.I have to say though, that I have to give credit to the author for some of the extended scenes that were deleted in the movie, but apart from that, it's a big disappointment.

No matter how many ways you tried to pour the water in, it would always pour over the side.

She is fabulous in the movies and her erotic dances, particularly in the second movie, are enough to cause the onset of puberty in a five year old.

Just when the beat cops think they've tightened the noose around the suspect, loose ends begin to appear, witnesses lose their certainty, alibis crop up, and even the cops doubt what they've seen. Who is hiding the suspect and why? This is a fast-paced modern thriller, in stark contrast to the darker, more deliberate Widerberg work The Man on The Roof (1976).

His favorite part about this toy is that the cars go down the ramp. He also enjoys putting other small vehicles own the ramp. My only critique is that it is not as educational as I had hoped. If you rotate the blocks the toy does not label the side of the block that is up. Each block has a set of phrases and sounds it makes, these change based on the number of times you press the block down, not the side of the block put in. The blocks from the other sets do fit into this set, but produce less responses then they would if put in their original set. The buildings do link together, but they are easily separated.

The Third Symphony (recorded some 15 years later) certainly could have used some of that elemental urgency. Bernstein doesn't SHAPE the music whatsoever. He allows his troupe to simply play the notes, without benefit of a guiding interpretation. The result is an uninspired nullity. The two best recordings of the Third (both presently not available) are Riccardo Muti and the Philharmonia on Angel and Lorin Maazel and the Vienna Philharmonic on London.

The same thing (booting for 1 second then the laptop shuts itself off on its own with a single beep) happened 2 months ago then it resurrected itself without any intervention. Then it happened yesterday and now it's long gone... The hp service reps are completely useless; they just try to get money from you by charing you for diagnosis then wanting to charge more if repair is needed. (I talked to them on the phone and I'm not shipping my laptop) I definitely don't want to do that so now I have to buy another laptop. I've never had any problem with hp laptops before (I owned 2 other than the current one, and both are still running well) and I kinda feel \\"betrayed\\" by hp...

I have heard of complaints about the griddle design but you can buy a number of other griddle products out there that are larger and work better. As for clean up(unlike the other review it is easy to clean) , well it is no dfferent than any other grill or campstove product. You take care of it and it will take care of you.

Those developments rendered the book extremely untidy.More so, paying a total price of $71+ (inclusive of shipping) for a book that my classmates bought at $43.99 made my sense of disadvantage even worse.

He has utilised some of the best drummers in the world on his recordings to date and they contribute considerably to his success and my enjoyment. Imagine my dismay when I viewed this DVD to find only programmed drum parts and just a live percussionist!!!. In the opening dialog Sting openly admits having dropped drums and drummers because \\"they get in the way of the song\\". A very bland performance compared to his previous recordings - if I'd known there was no drummer from any review or even from the outer cover of the DVD I would have thought twice before purchasing this recording.

Hey Sting, we don't care about the building of your sound studio. I don't need to see you give big, girly, hugs to the members of your band. It does not thrill me to see you barefoot playing guitar in your hallway. I could care less about your interactions with people that make you feel like a mini-God. Get over yourself. Sing the songs and shut the F**K up. Don't sell us on how much you can buy or how much others love you. GET OVER YOURSELF.

This huge band of his can play beautiful music no doubt, but he has a tendancy to not work as hard in a big band. Sting really comes out in a smaller band - the Broken Music tour was MUCH better. The songs on Sacred Love were okay - not my favorite CD. Having said that, this DVD is really enjoyable. It's great to see Sting at his home here in LA just playing music, surrounded by his friends and family. The live footage at the Mayan sounds great, and there are a couple of songs on this DVD that cannot be found elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Kidding Me?","review":"I totally agree with the reviewer from Portland, Oregon.

Blake artistically focused upon the European history of the former colony from the 1890s until the early 1960s. He briefly covers the UDI period of Rhodesia, but his best writing recounts the political events that defined Rhodesia before 1965.Blake beautifully articulated the political history of Rhodesia, but perhaps, like other liberals, he missed the major point. He failed to account for the African perspective of Rhodesia's turbulent history and how it influenced the Europeans. If Blake had the advantage of today's historical perspective, his book would undoubtably have a different voice.A History of Rhodesia is a well written book that provides a thorough acccount of (southern) Rhodesia's history.

This is a larger-than-life composition rendered with high dramatic flare (and recorded without anything to complain of). Bruckner's Fourth deserves to be one of the most controversial works in the canon, in terms of its cumulative emotional or philosophical statement (or whatever abstract vocabulary you choose to impose upon it): whatever it has to say about the world, it is nowhere near as apparent as, say, Brahms' First or Tchaikovsky's \\"Pathetique\\".

You REALLY SHOULD get this book...it rules. No, it more than rules...it's so punk rock that it's off the chart.

The man changes how they feel about men and then they live happily ever after. BORING!! Not to mention the constant references to designer duds such as Manolos, Hermes, etc. just doesn't bring any value to this book. It worked for Sex and the City because Sarah Jessica Parker is a style icon.

It promised an interesting mix of chick-lit, romance and some very light erotica. The Lipstick Chronicles is a fun book with four stories about four friends and colleagues who meet the loves of their lives in unexpected ways. I liked the first story about an independent CEO and the handsome investor who steals her heart. This book was fun to read at first, but it became tiresome after the third story. The stories were too similar and the characters became tedious after a while. Each story is written by a different author, but there isn't a single thing that differentiates the writers -- it's almost as though one person wrote them. I guess what I'm trying to say is that The Lipstick Chronicles had a good premise, but it didn't hold my interest for long. It just didn't do it for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was way too predictable","review":"I felt that this book was way too predictable and boring. It lacked an exciting plotline and the scenes were way too short to capture my attention. I brought it on vacation and had to buy another book because I couldn't get through it. It would've been much better if the romance between these couples was more built up. The dialogue did not really hold my attention either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Honestly, this book looked so promising... predictable is a HUGE understatement in this case. I mean, romance and chick lit always has a certain level of predictability, but is it too much to expect good dialogue, interesting characters and a believable storyline? This book makes it sound as though working in the dot com industry is a sure fire way to hook up with hot, rich, successful young men who happen to be good in bed too. The first story abt the CEO of the company was OK but by the time I finished the book it feels like I've read 1 story 4 times.

If this is still the original lineup it certainly does not sound like it. A blatant, superficial attempt to create the old glory days perhaps, but nary an inspirational passage is heard amongst Claypool's constant shallow exercises. For sheer instrumental competency alone our players deserve a tad credit, but throughout this brief, vacant side order of c-rate songwriting, Primus offer extremely little of that distinct chemistry which gave all their off-kilter, funk-fueled musical rantings a lasting depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer","review":"All the best Primus in one.

After having only one miscarriage I almost had a complete nervous break down! The torment and tragedy this woman endured, is a true testament of her strength, courage and faith. As I read this book I cried every tear with her, felt her every heartbreak, and prayed that her story would have a happy ending. Any person who has had a loss in their lives should read this tremendously inspiring book. This woman's story of hope and undying faith has totally changed my life. Before reading her story I was a virtual recluse. I wouldn't go out anywhere for fear of seeing women with children, and getting myself more depressd.

Too bad that We3 only lasts three chapters -- just not quite enough to really explore the themes involved.

But once they're working it's time to move on to the next step, and experimental materials are no longer needed...Morrison carefully builds his story, layering levels of creepiness and sympathy together while continually cranking up the violence and danger. The premise is exaggerated, but feels uncomfortably realistic, which heightens the impact of the battle our unfortunate, uncomprehending protagonists find thrust upon them.While too graphic for my tastes We3 is a erie, highly emotional tale. Perhaps Morrison's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"When pets are not good for kids.","review":"Good comic, good story, good ending.

It definitely hits you over the head with the pretty familiar scifi tropes of HUMANS: BAD, SCIENCE: BAD, NATURE: AT BAD MAN'S MERCY, WORLD: BLEAK... To be honest, those aren't my particularly favorite scifi tropes; I typically like my scifi more whimsical and less overtly BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEAK.I found the story profoundly sad and grim. And while clearly that was the intent, I couldn't help but feeling as though it was overly manipulative as opposed to a good, clean piece of scifi. Also, the writing wasn't really great; it really does continually hit you over the head with the aforementioned topics.Gorgeous art, but not my favorite graphic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not every original idea is a good one","review":"Not sure what this story is about, really.

Morrison's tale of three altered animals (a dog, a cat, and a rabbit) trying to figure out what to do (and how to avoid the forces hunting them) after being freed from their armed forces research facility on the verge of their being decommissioned is heart-rending, and Frank Quitely's artwork is, if anything, stronger than the story itself; the emotions the characters show belie their rudimentary speaking abilities. Morrison and Quitely have packed an incredible amount of emotion into a very short story.

The ability to do 2-player link off a single cart is the best feature this offers.Mario Kart Advance (also a SNES title) represents a 3rd generation SNES title and was more advanced than FZero in it's day, as a result it's port for the GBA (also a perfect port) is much better than FZero, so if you want a game like this, I would recommend Mario Kart Advance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game but I miss the first F Zero.Please bring it back.","review":"While Maximum Velocity is a very fun and fast game that I like playing when I need a break from stuff like Zelda and Super Mario Advance stuff. I admit I only play it on beginner but still I manage to settle down with that. I think its cool they have 10 cars rather than 4 like the first F Zero for SNES.However the limited number of race cars on the SNES was part of it's charm and it is a very significant Super Nintendo game. I think they should rerelease the very first F Zero onto the Game Boy Advance so we can get something back that we miss and for those who never played the SNES title to get something theyve got to see for the first time.I hope Nintendo considers bringing back the very first F Zero.That would make us all happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great racing game","review":"If you are a racing fan, this is a must have. You need to be alert and ready for difficult turns. It is a little frusterating, being that the first tracks can stll be a little difficult.

I'll come straight out and say, that I found it somewhat disappointing. There must be a dozen poems in it about dogs, all of which are meticulously rhymed and metered, but all lacking verve and high seriousness.Others deal with bird hunting, and business failures, but only a few have \\"gay\\" themes, among them a few man-boy poems, which I found very erotic, though somewhat over the top, even for my tastes.I suppose my biggest problem with the poems are their forced rhymes, paddiness of diction, and artificial tone. Murphy never comes off as sincere. He knows his meters, but he sings like a queen in a bar full of breeders.He should write solely for his own kind on topics such as gay pride and gay love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shades of Robert Francis and William McGonagall","review":"Timothy Murphy is one of the upcoming \\"New Formalists,\\" having debuted with his first book in his mid 40s.

Timothy Murphy devotes far too many lines to the subject of dogs, thereby giving new meaning to the term \\"doggerel.\\" However, amid imitations from the Chinese and ditties on the woes of being both a millionaire and a farmer, one can occasionaly hear hints of musical genius-- though the genius belongs to another age, and to other poets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Amateurism","review":"This book lacks any sense of musicality and reeks of extreme amateurism, its sentiments are trite and its allusions to boyhood homosexuality are not very subtle, indeed I would say this is the epitome of the state of modern poetry today, JUST PLAIN BAD"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid collection","review":"A solid collection from one of the more distinctive voices to emerge from New Formalism.

It details the minutia with which the military deals but there is little in the way of ops or hard-core action if you will. As a writer, Stanton makes a great soldier.

I also send a copy to friends when they lose a pet, it brings tears, but happy-sad tears, and healing tears. The artwork is dear and compliments the innocent flavor of the text.

This book was recommended by a friend after her kids (3 and 5) lost their dog and it was really a God sent! We told our son that Johnny had \\"died\\" and that he sent him this book so our son could know more about the wonderful place Johnny was staying.

What results in Madigan's analysis is a picture of a uniquely Quranic conception of divine revelation and given to humanity--one that itself points to the transcendent supratextual nature of the Qur'an itself. What appears to me to make this work even more balanced and useful is the dialogue that Madigan often enters into with other classical Islamic sources while constructing his own independent position. The discussion of al-Shafi'i's reatment of the Quranic trope \\"al-kitab wa-l-hikma\\" is particularly notable.The text itself is beautifully printed and includes both Arabic texts and translations of the sources quoted. One could hope that the high quality exhibited here will quickly become the standard rather than the exception in the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"what \\"Kitab\\" means","review":"Book is about the use of word Qur'an, kitab, mushaf in its various forms and in different context and locations. It is very interesting book for it pulls attention to very important details that you otherwise might have missed when you read the Qur'an or not recall how the same word was used in previous ayats.Author also investigates the oral nature of the Qur'an and its written form and concludes that for Muslims the oral Qur'an was essential and therefore there was no push for written form.Although it was more about if the Qur'an is the same as \\"kitab\\" or if it is part of it for author draws attention to both expressions used in Qur'an for me it was a reading lecture to catch the details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved my dating experiences 200%","review":"Now I know a few new things.

Here, he is again excellent, but even he was unable to overcome such a weak script. The story involves the Communist tactic of arresting and breaking down a man mentally. The script is pretentious, inconclusive, wordy, and unpersuasive. The production itself is low budget but competent. Hawkins overacts at times, but that's nothing new. One comes away from the film with perplexity and disappointment. Yes, the Cardinal confessed everything. And his inquisitor is apparently ready to commit suicide--for having succeeded. Who cares? There is nothing inspirational or even informative here. It's like an acting school, with two veterans of stage and film displaying their prowess. A film best forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dogs, excellent stories","review":"When most writing about dogs is of the sappy \\"Chicken Soup\\" variety, this collection provides a welcome alternative.

Rather it is the other way round. Western civilization does have all the signs of decay but the root cause is not the inherent evil nature of its people rather their acts which have made them follow the wrong path.

The lyrics are sung in Japanese, but the music is clearly influenced by bossa nova. I haven't heard anything like it before. The lead singer has a wonderful voice, very soothing and sexy, and the rhythms are laid down to make you feel relaxed and yet playful. I'm the type of person who falls in love with a tune right away or not at all. This release had me humming several of the tunes all day long. I simply could not forget them. Start with Blue Light Yokohama and let it get into your system. This one is pure magic. I kept dreaming of Japan, or far away places like Rio de Janeiro. Then try out Coffee Rhumba. It will make you want to get up and dance! Finally give Lost Inside My Dream a spin. This group is certainly onto something very original and catchy. I can't wait till their next release, but until then, I have stumbled upon some great music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"its the greatest yet!","review":"george strait is my hero, i love everything that he puts out. his latest is the best yet and believe me i own alot of them including \\"strait out of the box\\" of course it is great strait too. i hope george stays around forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jipped","review":"It is a good compilation of works; however, if is a \\"greatest hits\\", then make it one and play the songs that made him the superstar he is........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder on Music Row","review":"If you want to know what happened to \\"real\\" country music this song \\"MURDER ON MUSIC ROW\\" tells what happened.

Because all of the old songs have been around, I'll stick to reviewing the two new ones. \\"The Best Day\\" is probably not the most commercially flawless tune, but that is what's so great about it. It shows that George is not afraid to say something special with some substance. It's not canned garbage, it tells about something that should mean something to all of us, and that's spending time with those we love. \\"Murder on Music Row\\" cracks me up. I never thought George Strait would sing a song that slaps so many people in the face the way this one does. But I love it. He and Alan Jackson are two of the few country artists left, today, and they definitely have every right to defend their ground. I try to write my music in the traditional manner they have defended so long and proud. As a matter of fact, the country scene today looks an awful lot like it did in 1981, Strait's first year in the limelight. Great job, and keep up the great work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great country music","review":"If your a country music fan. You shoud buy this CD. I cant say enough for George and the good music he consistently puts out. This is a hell of a collection of some of Straits finest songs.

This album proves that Mr. Strait still has the heart and soul to roll out damn good music.I Love Murder On Music Row, love them all!

It's very funny and original and just plain fun. I do illustration work and this book can really get me started. I also get great ideas for art classes and for my own children. This is really one of the best art books I know. It also brings home the point that drawings that are not realistic can sometimes show the essence of the subject better. I've bought two of these, one for myself and one for a writer friend, to give her inspiration when she's facing writers block.

What can I say about this sorry excuse for a movie? I've seen better acting from strung out porn stars. To give any of the \\"actors\\" a razzy would be insulting to the razzies. They would flub their lines but keep going and the director- if there was one- wouldn't cut. Not that a second take would've been any better if the first was any indication. And by the way, in a movie, a naked annoying chick is just as bad, if not worse, than a fully clothed one. Nudity and fake blood alone does not a good horror movie make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Night of the Idiots","review":"If you like Bill Zebubs movies, you have a problem to begin with. However this is probably one HIS best movies. But the victims in the story are so idiotic, that I found myself rooting for the Pumpkin man!! Lots of Nudity (Typical Zebub) and some gratuidous violence. Very Poor Special effects. You'll find yourself watching the entire movie not for entertainment, but just to see if it could possibly get any more idiotic and it does. The Special feature commentary by Bill Zebub was better than the movie. It has some funny moments and it's definately campy. It's like watching the old sexploitation films of the 70's at the Drive-in. If you like this type of movie, you'll love this one. If you are plot oriented, don't waste your time with this one. It is what it is...a Typical Bill Zebub flic with a not so typical ending. Pure Idiocy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mustang GT350H","review":"I loved building this model it was a very fun to build.

It is 1/4 or more the price of a i pod and holds plenty of music (you can always add up to 2 gig if needed) Besides loading up to around 10 CD's on it, It also acts as a mobile hard drive, voice recorder, plays FM radio-which you can record your favorites w/ the push of a button! It also has a nice green backlight that they don't even talk about. Must use a different headset than it comes with to get the nice sound it delivers with the SRS wow. It also works perfect with windows - supports easy drag and drop right through windows explorer via quick USB. Only downfall is you can't put your files into different folders on the actuall MP3, so if you load 100 songs, you have to go through them to find a specific you want to listen to at the time. However, they do load onto it in the same order you put them on, so the songs stay together as a 'CD'. I looked at many, and I am very happy with what I picked! 3B delivers very quickly also!"},{"rating":"1","title":"errata","review":"The author is clearly struggling with the materialleading to significant mistakes throughout (e.g.whole numbers are confused with rationals, the fourcolor \\"solution\\" is muddled, history is garbled--not to mention B.C.E. and A.D. being juxtaposed onthe time line).

DO NOT BUY, this should be a rental if nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim and poorly written","review":"I loved the idea of this book, and the cover was gorgeous. But the actual contents are exceptionally grim and are written in horrible \\"poetry,\\" each told from the point of view of a child ruminating about his or her gruesome circumstances. The result is writing that is both depressing and static, and the \\"stories\\" aren't stories at all but the stream-of-consciousness thoughts of a child over the span of about five minutes.Unfortunately, the only attractive picture is the one on the cover, so not even the illustrations can save it.Alternative:Esther's Story by by Diane WolksteinTruly jaw-dropping pictures and a fabulous retelling of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED this book!","review":"Although billed as a YA title, Higher Ground has crossover appeal as a classic initiation story. The characters felt authentic and were unique and universal at the same time. I especially enjoyed the setting since I was born in West Virginia and recognized the landscape and landmarks. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flavorful, stores well, very low sodium","review":"Because this is in a can and not an aseptic box, it stacks better, stores better and lasts longer. It tastes great, mixes beautifully with rice, veggies, makes great gravies and soups. When I was recovering from 3 (!) root canals in one month, I would pop the top of the can (pop-top: another bonus), stick a straw in the can and drink my meals.And when one of my cats was very ill, as part of her recovery, she slurped up her saucers of Campbell's Low Sodium chicken broth, much to her betterment (and my happiness).And last but definitely not least, I've been a Campbell's consumer since I was a little kid - Campbells makes great products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, Dated Look at World in 1950's","review":"Journalist-Author William L. Shirer wrote this surprisingly accurate look at Europe and the Western World at mid-century point (early 1950's). Readers see Europe as it recovered from devastating conflict (with help from the Marshall Plan), Germany was divided, and the Cold War was reality. Also, the U.S. was the undisputed economic engine, heavily influencing Europe and striving to contain communism. As these pages were being published, the first moves towards the common market (and later European Union) were in effect, and the Warsaw Pact and dearth of European Colonialism were coming. Shirer couldn't see the future, but his analysis was generally on target.This book didn¡t join the author's eyewitness accounts of Nazi Germany on the best-seller list, but Shirer's ability is evident in these pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This bread pan is the perfect pan for making bread.

When I saw it I just knew the price was right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusion - Help Requested","review":"My childhood was infused with the 1940's (on 78's) and 1952 (monaural LP's) BSQ recordings of Beethoven and Schubert. So much so that when the new stereo recordings came out in the early sixties and I heard them for the first time I was appalled, even though I was barely 20. To me, at the time, this just was NOT the Real Thing. Now I'm trying to reassemble all the Beethoven quartets as played by the BSQ in the '40's and 1952. That turns out to be a real project, because very few of the CD's here are definitively labelled with their recording dates. Obviously Sony found it more desirable to repackage the early '60's recordings, and that's great - for those who want them. Any advice (with specifics) on how to get all the necessary information on dates and correlate it with particular CD's offered here on Amazon?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this a chance","review":"I have little interest in the atonal period of music but still find plenty of post-romantic pieces which are engaging. This particular piece is one of those. I was not familiar with Schoenberg and had read about \\"Transfigured Night\\" in Ted Libbey's book: Building a Classical CD collection.\\" After reading reviews on several, including Mr. Libbeys' suggested renditions, I settled on this one.I have not heard any other recording to compare this with but have listened intently several times now to it. The quality of sound is rich and vibrant. The music is modern and beautiful in passages. One should not expect immediate gratification if you primarily listen to classical chamber music. I urge one to listen carefully several times before passing judgement on this piece. It will grow on you. It deserves full praise for it's place in history as revolutionary and the Julliard String Quartet with Walter Trampler and Yo-yo Ma play it beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"das CD ist sehr gut.","review":"This CD interprets the music of Schoenberg in a way that magnifies the opulence and beauty. Schoenberg's use of traditional classical writing in Verklarte Nacht is fantastic. The development of his style and composition is scene in one of the first pieces he composed atonally op.33 (Piano Sonata). The classical tradition is seen in the use of themes. The piece is Sonata form! A classical style of composition. The progressive steps that Schoenberg has blessed the classical tradition will be reviered for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outback chair company is the best","review":"I highly recommend the Outback chair company and any chair or frame they make!The chair I received was missing parts in the box, so after having limited options with returning and getting a new almost 60 pound chair, I called the outback chair company and spoke with Jack. He was great and the company is great! If you have any problems with hardware, they are more than happy to work with you to get you the part I need! I know there are less expensive chairs out there, but when you subject the item to all the elements and the company stands behind it even though they did not sell it, that is the sign of a great company!I greatly recommend the outback chair company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short!","review":"Plain and simple, this stand is too short for the chair I have. Maybe I need to get a smaller chair. At first, I couldn't attach the chair to the ring, to hang it. I had to rig it on the top, and it was fine. When I did get something to hang it with, it hung way too low, and I was actually sitting on the bottom part of the stand. So, back to rigging it like before. Now, even with that, it's too low since the chair stretched. I'll have to see about finding a shorter chair since it would be way to much of a hassle and too expensive to send the stand back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed!","review":"This hammock swing stand arrived very quickly in a rather well worn box. Likely due to the weight of the individual parts. But once assembled is a very strong, very heavy, high quality stand. I shopped around and needed one that could hold just in excess of 300lbs.

And boy, did she deliver! The music on \\"Bebel Gilberto\\" is so smooth and ethereal that it gives me goose-bumps. No matter what kind of day I'm having, I can pop in this CD, and I instantly imagine myself happily relaxing on a sunny, beautiful beach. I've been a long-time follower of Brazilian jazz--Joao Gilberto, Gilberto Gil, Jobim, Astrud Gilberto, etc.--but what's so great about Bebel Gilberto's work is that she brings a fresh, unique flavor to the genre.

I really loved her debut album, and I swear listening to it was a daily habit. I love her modern take on a traditional music genre. She really helped create a new genre all its own.Now her newest album is noticeably different. Suba (who sadly passed on) does not help out on this album; this may be why the album is more traditional-sounding. Whatever the case, it's a great second album. It took me a few listens, but now IT'S becoming my new daily habit.Now all I can hope for is not such a long wait for the next album, and Bebel---->come visit the NW again soon!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul soothing music","review":"I ran across Bebel on Pandora & fell in love with her music.

No one makes modern bossa nova and samba as sweet and bright as Ms. Gilberto: \\"Simplesmente,\\" true to its title, has a stripped-down simplicity that doesn't need excessive bells and whistles. Ms. Gilberto's vocals carry the day here, from the smooth \\"All Around\\" to the more mysterious \\"Cada Beijo.\\" Her voice cuts through the density of \\"River Song\\" and gives \\"Every Day You've Been Away\\" and \\"Next to You\\" a certain poignancy. \\"O Caminho\\" takes a lovely path, and even \\"Winter\\" melts under Gilberto's gentle touch. Even the silly \\"Jabuticaba\\" takes on real meaning in her capable hands. So much cheaper than a plane ticket to Brazil!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Best Album","review":"CLASSIC ALBUM. After listening to Tanto Tempo, I was very disappointed. I gave this album a chance since alot of the songs on the wonderful Bebel Gilberto Remixed are from this album. I'm not usually into foreign music because when I listen to it, I feel like I'm trying to be cool or something. It just doesn't feel natural.But with Bebel, everything feels so smooth and real. The production of the album is amazing. There's so many beautiful breathy layers, the bass is so smooth & packs a punch, all the songs are related but all very different. It flows so nice. Just when you think the album is gonna hit a standstill, an even better song comes on and sweeps you off your feet again.Truly a REMARKABLE album, and will forever be in my top 20 albums of all time (and I've heard A LOT of albums in my time.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hofer'sbook on Fncy Coloured Dias","review":"I have been aware of the Aurora Collection for 25+ years and was always amazed by it.

I can only imaging how short it's lifespan would be on stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"It seems like a good idea","review":"I bought this backpack when I was pregnant with my second child. I rarely used it as a sling backpack because with two kids I found that I didn't have the time to put it over my shoulder. And if, by chance, that I did have the time, the shoulder strap was very uncomfortable. It was constantly rubbing the side of my neck. The other times I just threw it over one shoulder and the problem with that was it always flew down and sometimes hit my 3 year old in the head! This would be good for someone with only one child, otherwise it's too much of a pain to deal with in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, POOR quality","review":"I am a loyal \\"baby (california) innovations\\" customer. My first diaper bag 2 years ago was by them and I loved it but now that I have two children I needed one that would not slip off my shoulder as most diaper bags do. I purchased this diaper bag because a few other mom friends had and raved about it. I LOVED IT and still do except after 5 days of proper use, the strap completely came apart at the seam. I assumed it was a one time manufacturing malfunction and returned it the next day because I very well couldn't use a broken diaper bag. I received a brand new one and it is happening again!!! The strap is slowly breaking and it has only been 7 days! In addition, as mentioned in another review, the zippers are poor quality and are difficult to close. I do love the design but due to my now double complications with the strap I am not impressed and will be contacting the company as soon as I am done writing this review. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper issues!","review":"I was so happy when I received this bag at my shower...and was so happy with it for the first two months of use. Then the zipper (for the main compartment) started to be a bit fussy...and now it won't close at all. I'm very dissappointed. The size of the bag was great, and I loved all of the compartments...but it's useless if I can't get the main zipper to stay closed. I was careful not to overload the bag, since I know that overloading can damage the zipper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Better for the Dad","review":"My biggest complaint about the bag is aesthetic. Since it crosses the front of your body-shoulder to hip-it really accentuates a breastfeeding mom's breasts in a not so flattering way. Basically is makes them look HUGE. The bag itself is great, and works well for my husband. I'm going to look for a regular bag for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I hate this stupid bag.The elastic on the back pocket separated from the mesh within about a month of using it, the zipper pulls come apart (super! diaper bag with a built-in choking hazard!) and there's really not a lot of room thanks to its unique shape. Now, I admit, the shape seems like a great idea, and is what attracted me to the bag in the first place, and I've seen lots of other sling backpacks that are exactly what I expected this one to be, but this thing slides around when I bend and fits like crap. I cannot believe the number of good reviews I'm seeing here. It's the only diaper bag I've ever had, so maybe all diaper bags suck? I dunno. But this one does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap construction; counter-intuitive donning process","review":"Although the sling design seems ergonomic, it's counterintuitive for me, a right-handed person, to get the bag over my head--it's hard to describe, but it's not a thought-less process. I struggle each time to figure out just how to get it on. Once on, it's comfortable and the cell phone pocket is convenient. On the other hand, once on, you can't really access any other pocket. My biggest complaint is the zippers--crapola. One of them broke after two uses and now it's completely busted. The others catch and seem ready to go at any moment. It seems to me that one could just as easily wear a courier bag slung across the chest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish, Comfortable and Functional","review":"This diaper bag is great! I love that it doesn't look like a \\"baby\\" bag. Also, my husband likes the fact that it doesn't look like he's carrying a purse.This diaper bag is comfortable and functional. It's not too big and bulky, but it does hold plenty. I breast-feed, so instead of holding a baby bottle in the cooler compartment, I put a bottle of water in there for me and it keeps it cold. Also, there is a compartment for a cell phone on the strap, so when it rings, I'm not searching all over for it. The changing pad is a great size, too. I also like how the strap clips off on the bottom. This feature makes it easy to sling the bag across my shoulder.With our first child, we had the Eddie Bauer square-shaped bag--I hated it! It seemed like I always had to search through it to find anything. I highly recommend this diaper bag, with all the storage compartments, it makes finding things so easy! I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We don't use this bag","review":"We registered online for this bag because we thought it was stylish. Little did we know that it is really hard to find anything in this bag because of all the little tiny zipper compartments and the main compartment only zips down the side so you have to take everything out of the bag to actually see what you are looking for. It's really hard to do all of that when you are out with your baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - for right shoulders only","review":"Merits of the bag aside, I'm giving this bag a low score to call attention to a conceptual flaw. It is designed to \\"sling\\" on the right shoulder. I always wear my bags on my left, so this doesn't work for me. Sure, you could wear it on your left, but it doesn't fall the way it's supposed to and defeats the purpose of this potentially clever concept. It's too bad they don't offer it designed both ways. We lefties can't catch a break. If you wear your bag on your right, this might be the bag for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product good - delivery not so good","review":"The baby bag was really nice my husband liked it also i actually boutght it for him the only bad thing was the delivery it took them 2 weeks to get the product from a suppose it 3 day delivery so it was late for the baby shower"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't make this a first pick.","review":"The concept of a backpack diaper bag is what attracted me to this particular bag. After making the purchase, I used it only once. The zipper is very difficult to open with one hand and having the opening on the side, things would fall out (if I could get more than the changing pad inside). There isn't much room for more than a couple of diapers. The cellphone holder doesn't move up and down the strap much, so half the time it was right in my face. I am still searching for the right diaper bag for me. Right now, the free one from the hospital has worked the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Zippers","review":"This bag had all the features that i was looking for. insulated bottle holder, side pocket big enough for a sippy cup, place for my wallet, keys and cell phone, convenient place for diapers and wipes (easily accessible). This bag was perfect except for the defective zippers. They get stuck and that is really annoying when you are trying to change a baby or do whatever else with one hand and the baby in the other. My grandmother suggested rubbing candle wax on them so that they will slide easier, i tried this trick and they still got stuck so i bought a new bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great style but SMALL","review":"I love this style of bag, it keeps everything out of the way and on your back and doesn't hurt your shoulders. But it's such a tight fit in there!I generally carry 2-3 (cloth, so slightly bigger) diapers , wipes, a change of clothes, my wallet and a sippy cup, and those *barely* fit. When we were going on a longer trip and I wanted to cring toys I had to big another bag for them. Definitly not for newborns and I wouldn't really recommend it for anyone who brings more then the bare essentials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Like this Bag","review":"I am a first time Mom and live by these reviews! I received three diaper bags at my shower and this is the one I decided to keep. Initially I thought it was going to be too small, but when I packed it it held a lot more than I thought it would (outfits, diapers, blankets, wipes, etc.). I breastfeed and don't have to carry formula or bottles, that would probably take up more room. It's not meant to be a suitcase, so if you were going on a trip you would definitely have to take another bag, but for grocery shopping and outings, the bag is fabulous. I put my son in the cart and keep the sling on me the entire time and my hands are completely free. It is also incredibly comfortable, most of the time I forget I even have it on! As everyone else has said, my husband is very \\"secure\\" carrying it, it looks just like a backpack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bradley examines the effects of patriarchy on the individual","review":"Marion Zimmer Bradley uses her fantasy world of Darkover as a backdrop for her close and brilliant analysis of any patriarchal civilization (fantastic or actual) and its affects upon the citizens who live under its sway. The three main female characters each holds and defends a unique position in a culture which forces them to choose in a manner which proves detrimental to the human soul. Her characters are well-drawn, her setting is beautifully creative, and the issues are shockingly relevant to every reader, female or male. With a carefully drawn plot, Ms. Zimmer-Bradley's fantasy novel addresses generation gaps, identity crisis, personal politics, spritual growth, and cultural conflicts which provide distance from and insight into the plight of Terra, circa 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introducing Free Amazons from Darkover","review":"This book tells us about a society guided by women who do not accept the social rules in Darkover. This is the story about Jaelle and how she leave the dry town (where womwn are property of theirs husband and use chains around her arms)and became a renunciant. It's also the story of Magdalen Lorne and how, pretending been a renunciant she has became one in fact - Margali 'n Ysabeth.

Most cancer doctors will warn against the harmful effects of taking antioxidants with chemotherapy or radiation treatments. This book completely debunks that medical school dogma.As a cancer patient, you need to arm yourself with factual knowledge. This is one of the books you need to study and share with your doctor. It covers specific combinations of chemotherapy drugs and antioxidant supplements. If you can't agree on what you should take, find another doctor.It would have been helpful if Dr. Moss had mentioned some of the animal foods which contain high doses of Vitamin A and other antioxidants, but his emphasis is on supplements and \\"fruits and vegetables.\\" I still recommend you study this book closely BEFORE you agree to a treatment regimen for your cancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excited and enlightened","review":"I am so excited about this book. I have been researching how we can help ourselves win or even prevent battles against diseases - cancer included- without resorting to unnatural chemicals. Anti-oxidents occur naturally in foods, yet the potent doses some of our bodies need to prevent or fight diseases must be readily available.

Some are the greatest of all time (Space Ritual, 1999 Party)and some are just really good (none are bad, despite dodgy recording quality). This one falls in the really good group. It is a recording of a complete concert from 2001 and the band is ON. The music is in the forefront, with the odd poetry secondary. A bit of improvisation here and there, lots of good and old songs. A perfect blend. The closest album to this is 'Palace Springs' from 1991, which was quite underrated. Highly recommended. These guys are not Dead. Good thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"early Mozart","review":"This robust recording of two youthful Mozart pieces is a wonderful addition to a Mozart collection. The Sinfonia K. 364, written when Mozart was 19, is very upbeat in feeling, with its exquisitely melodic andante, which is here movingly performed. The Concertone K. 190, written when he was 17, is also lovely, and features some nifty solo oboe work by Neil Black.Recorded in 1991, the sound is excellent, and the English Chamber Orchestra under Raymond Leppard fresh and lively. The two soloists are magnificent and work together beautifully. The great Jaime Laredo, who is another child prodigy, and a huge hero in his native Bolivia...and now also in Vermont, doing such fine work as Music Director of the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, plays the viola in the Sinfonia, and the violin in the Concertone.This is a delightful CD for Mozart lovers, and you'd have a hard time finding a better recording of these charming compositions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egoistic, Concieted pile of Rubbish","review":"I was suprised about all the raving reviews of the The Sari of the Gods. This book has no plot or structure. Characters, places and times switch in midsentence leaving the reader puzzled and confused. For most of the book the reader cannot even tell who or what he is reading about! The superflous barrage of facts (and fiction) assult the reader's senses in a disorganized and chaotic manner. All in all this book is the product of a highly ego-centerd, very arrogant, and drug induced author."},{"rating":"1","title":"choral music","review":"I was very disappointed in this cd.

Oh sure, the first movement is a most welcome addition to Elgar's catalogue, it's a strongly argued piece of music, with a great \\"hook\\". The rest unfortunately shows Mr. Elgar at his worst. Boring, overlong, discursive, without interesting melodies or rhythms. The recording by Naxos and Paul Daniels is fine, but outside of historical pursuance, and the admittedly wonderful first allegro, it's not a symphony to return to again and again (and I've tried!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different view, for different tastes","review":"I was somewhat disappointed in this recording, having read the gushingly positive reviews in the press. In short, I disagree with little of what the other (positive) customer reviews here have to say, but I simply prefer the interpretative tone of the Davis disc. In general, I find his approach more subtle, more searching, and more attuned to the bitterseet undercurrent that for me, the best conductors are able to reveal in EE's music. In Davis I hear the language of the Cello Concerto--in Daniel, for me, what I hear (in interpretive tone) is more Crown of India (wonderful fun in its own way). In fairness, Davis might have done better with some more vigor in the outer movements. But Daniel strikes me as trying too hard by half when it comes to Elgarian ebbing and flowing. No complaints about the sonic impact or the coherence of the reading, though. Points to Naxos for getting it done. Maybe Leonard Slatkin will be inspired to put out a version for us now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"for children. Has cute pictures that kids love too.

This book was billed as precisely that. However, I was annoyed that the author seemed to go out of his way to scorn the papacy and almost universally presented the Popes and the Church of Rome in a negative light. As a Catholic, I found this tendency annoying and distracting from the book's true purpose. I wouldn't recommend it as either a history or a guide book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.

Seriously, just spend the extra 10 bucks on a decent harness. This one takes forever to figure out and when we finally did get it together, I'm pretty sure it still was not on correctly. It is extremely uncomfortable and is designed in such a way so that the leg straps (which are very long) become the part that goes around your waist. This means that when weight is put on the harness, the legs are constricted very tightly and the waist is left loose. Then when weight is taken back off, you are left with a waist strap that hangs around below your hips. I never actually had any accidents happen, but I definitely think that a harness with a design like this poses serious risks.

What I felt is that the author is confusing delivery management with the technology itself. Major sections of the book (under the guise of governance) are devoted to people and expectation management and politics rather than technology. Majority of what is discussed is applicable universally to execution of any project in any decent sized organization.

Half way through, I was expecting some kind of advance in the plot, but then he adds a whole drug sub-plot in Tijuana...I just didn't care anymore.The author is no James Ellroy, where the plot becomes a web of complexity and everything is eventually related....nope, this is more a two-lane highway, that becomes, 6-lane, then 8, then 16...and after a while you just lose track.On the positive side, his writing is good and the characters were interesting...I just wish he could have provided one solid plot instead of enough plots and background for 4 novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"The usual SoCal fare","review":"Typical southern Calif. murder procedural. Wealthy powerful man is murdered. Who stood to benefit, who to lose.... How is his big pie gonna be sliced.Parker, T. Jefferson writes better than most but it's still a typical southern Calif. murder procedural. Wealthy powerful man is murdered.........Also the ending was insanely irresponsible. I mean the shoot out at the Mex/Cal border. I don't think the real cops etc. would have done it that way. Or at least I hope not! They, I hope!, would of waited until the beach transfer then made their move, having filmed the whole trip along the way, making for a nice neat wrap up.I recommend Newton Thornburg's 'To Die in California'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"Although I tried mightily, I could not get interested in this book.

Jefferson Parker should be more popular than he is. He ranks right up there with the best! Cold Pursuit is yet another great read. The plot has already been discussed so I won't repeat it, but I highly recommend any book by Mr. Parker. I also just finished reading California Girl and I'd also rate it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Characters Make This A Winner","review":"Homicide detective, Tom McMichael is charged with investigating the brutal murder of 84 year old Pete Braga. Complicating the case is the fact that the McMichael and Braga families have a long standing feud, that includes violence on both sides. Parker does a wonderful job of introducing his characters to the reader without a lot of tedious details. I've read many of Parker's previous novels and it's his writing style that keeps me coming back. He tells a good story and keeps the pace moving at a good clip. His characters stay with me long after I've finished a book of his. I can still remember Silent Joe...one of my favorites. Tom McMichael will stay with me too. A decent guy trying to do a good job under difficult circumstances. A very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written","review":"Tom McMichael is a San Diego homicide detective, no problem until businessman Pete Braga is murdered. Their families have been enemies for years but McMichael is determined to rise above the situation: his job is to solve the crime. Parker's narrative is action packed with more curves than most mountain roads. Separating the past from the present is the biggest obstacle Tom faces as he struggles to ferret out the murderer. \\"Cold Pursuit\\" will keep you guessing from first page to the last. T. Jefferson Parker is a talented author and I look forward to reading more from him.Beverly J Scott, author of Righteous Revenge and Ruth Feverhttp://www.beverlyjscott.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Pursuit","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

L. Stine book that I wouldn't be scared by this \\"teen-horror\\" author. But, just because it doesn't scare the heck outta us doesn't mean its not a good book. Even horror-master Dean Koontz will often throw out a book just as scary as Stine's... but anyway.This book . . . is just about like all of Stine's books... only with a hint of Survivor in it. But its far more than meats the eye. When i first got it i was soo thinking a copy-cat story line going with the Survivor TV Show (and im sure thats where Stine got the idea for this book) but it turns out to have a twist-a-plot that is rather entertaining. I suggest buying this book, but remember, its TO BE CONTINUED, so buy the whole 3some at one time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The thrilling first book in a special Nightmare Room story.","review":"April is thrilled when she learns she is one of twelve honor students chosen by \\"The Academy\\" to spend two weeks during the spring on a tropical island, meeting celebrities and competing in a series of games and events. But when the kids arrive on the island, April senses that something is not right. Mysterious accidents and illnesses strike both the kids and the staff, and April uncovers evidence that someone else may be living on the supposedly deserted island. The other kids on her team refuse to listen to April. They just care about being the team to win the $100,000 prize. April's on her own, and an ancient evil filled with a thirst for revenge is out to get her. This book starts off the Thrillogy, a special three-part story arc from the Nightmare Room series.

I can only hope that a longer, more in depth version is someday written in which we are told more about the UPS man as he's handcuffed to the door. But maybe my love for this story has to do with the joy I sometimes get from checking the mail.A few of the stories here weren't quite to my taste, \\"I Wear Black to Mourn Myself,\\" for example, but nothing ever drags and not once did I grow even remotely bored.

We also get a glimpse into a new movement to rid the city of all benders. Korra met up with two brothers who are competing in a pro-bending game.

After the first series - Avatar : The Last Airbender, I never thought that there would be another series as great as it. Fight choreography and a good storyline is very important to me.

Okay!","review":"Korra should be an interesting character to follow in the new Avatar series from Nickelodeon. This animated series is poised to be as big a hit as the original and there are some CGI elements that have already surfaced in the premiere episode. The visuals are astounding as well as the fight coordination and I expect that the lessons that the avatar will learn along her path will be good life lessons and keeping with the tradition of the original show. We'll have to see how the new world of the avatar pans out as it is set in Republic city (at least to start) which seems to follow a 1910's technology with air-ships and automobiles of the era with high-rise buildings like those of New York at the turn of the century. So, time will tell, but so far, it looks promising and I am eager to see more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avatar tribute.","review":"Wonderful story well worth the wait.

I was able to watch it on my GoogleTV through Amazon Instant for free (a promotional thing, I'm guessing). There weren't any streaming problems and it showed in good quality HD.

I was pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Incarnation","review":"Having enjoyed the original Airbender series, I highly doubted this new Avatar incarnation could live up to its predecessor. I was glad to be wrong. In fact, in many ways The Legend of Korra is a nice upgrade. Aang, bless him, is likeable and fun to root for. But it's strangely refreshing to have a more mature female lead take the reins.The story is well told and the subplots and character arcs nicely interwoven. My only possible gripe was the climax. Without spoiling anything, let's just say I found the resolution slightly unsatisfying. Handled differently, I thought it could have led to other more interesting story possibilities. That aside, I still enjoyed this first installment as a whole and I'm sure Book 2: Spirits will continue to captivate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good continuation of the story of Aang","review":"Great storyline, keeps you guessing. Animated characters still portray some underlying properties of people as a society. Moral dilemmas solved, so good for the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh new look while staying true to the original...so far","review":"What I loved about the original series is the witty humor that was completely lost with that sad excuse of a live action movie. The Legend of Korra seems to have brought that back. The first episode does an excellent job at setting the stage for the brand new story, providing effective introductions to all the new characters and the evolved world of the four nations in Republic City while tying up loose ends of what happened to the original characters (the quip on what happened to Zuko's mother!). Gotta love the Platypus Bear cameo as wellThere is definitely still much to be seen as to where the Legend of Korra will go, especially if it can exceed the same great story telling, humor, and action of the original but so far I like what I see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legend of Korra episode 1","review":"I was hoping against hope that this show would not be a huge disappointment, as is nearly every continuation or sequel to the shows I love, like I loved Avatar: The Last Airbender.

I cannot express how excited I am to watch this story unfold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legend of Korra EP 6","review":"Okay this is what I was missing, I absolutely love this episode, it's going to get better from here on.

Definitely still worthy of never missing an episode! For having \\"mastered\\" three elements, she doesn't seem as capable as you'd expect. I understand her skill will develop throughout the seasons, but it's left a little to be desired (probably on purpose). The characters are good, but the main characters are older than last season. The more modern city atmosphere, as opposed to for example, the Ba Sing Se city of last season, is kind of boring, seeing as every action cartoon takes place in a city. I'm sure things will change and pick up. Like I said, it is still very worthy - but so mare mostly because of the nastalgia of last season popping up here and there."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"WOW. Just WOW.

This Chicago quintent hit its peak in 1967 with the number one hit \\"Kind of a Drag\\" which still sounds great today. The album is arranged roughly in historic release order. The tunes \\"Don't You Care\\", \\"Mercy,Mercy, Mercy\\", \\"Hey Baby\\", and \\"Susan\\" along with \\"Kind of a Drag\\" alone are worth the price of this disc. The other 13 songs are just a bonus. Dennis Tufano's vocals, the group's great harmonies, the use of brass on a number of songs, and the hit tunes, most penned by Jim Holvay, make this a solid choice. Also included are great liner notes about the group, past and present. While this group wasn't one of the giants of the late 1960's pop era, this disc is recommended to all Buckingham fans and to anyone who digs good music from this era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy by the Buckinghams","review":"This is, plain and simple, a feel good album, taking the listener back to less complicated days.

I have Williams' more recent performance of Barrios (from the Jungles of Paraguay)on CD. It's a comprehensive collection of Barrios' best compositions; however, I think that CD was recorded with way too much reverb, which is somewhat distracting. So, I'm going back to this older collection of Barrios, with much less reverb. The only bad thing about it is the Ponce Folias, which I'm not crazy about. Unfortunately, the Folias takes up about half the CD; but like almost every piece Williams lays his hands on, the Folias is played with impeccable skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got the wrong CD!","review":"I ordered this one, but what came was \\"Famous Guitar Music from Latin America\\" by guitarist Kurt Schneeweiss.

First, their comedy gets very old, fast. Five minutes in to a short and I'm ready for it to be over. Okay, Moe slaps Curly, that's funny once, but not 12,000 times! Don't get me wrong, I have a good sense of humor, but I just can't see these guys as funny. The shorts are often tedious and drawn-out, the routines get extremely old after a while, and the acting is well, not exactly Oscar material. Let's just say that the 3 Stooges are funny for maybe five minutes, then after that the steam wears thin and you'll go absolutely crazy if you hear Woob-woob-woob-woob-woob one more time.

Within minutes the entire counter was in a puddle of water that had leaked out where the bottom of the handle attached to the pot. The entire heating element was sitting in water. We turned the electricity off at the main box so I could unplug it from the wall.Today when I called the company I was told that even though it was a dangerous electrical hazard, there is only a one year warranty on material and workmanship and this is OUT OF WARRANTY!

Every since we bought it the on/off switch kept going off right after the kettle was turned on. However, we didn't want to be bothered with returning the kettle back to the store, and it didn't seem like a big deal to turn the switch back on. But apparently, the switch was not the only problem that waited for us. Just recently the kettle started leaking badly in the place where the bottom of the handle is attached to the kettle. One morning I walked into the kitchen and discovered that there was water all over my kitchen counter and it was dripping on the floor. I was stunned to find out that all this water leaked from the kettle overnight. It's just seems like a huge fire hazard to me since the water leaked on the kettle base as well as on the kitchen counter and the base was plugged into the outlet. This is a dangerous and unreliable product! Cannot believe we payed 59.99 for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, button sometimes pops up right away","review":"I am disappointed in this kettle. Our last one was a Krups, and it last about 4 or 5 years. Of course, that model wasn't available anymore, so I ended up buying this one. It seemed flimsier, but nice and light, so I thought I'd go for it. This is used several times daily, but within a couple weeks, I noticed that the button doesn't always stay down when you press it. It either won't press on the first try, or it will pop up after just a few seconds. Annoying, but it just required trying it again and then it worked. I thought maybe I hadn't pressed it properly or something until I read the other reviews. Now it's leaking from the bottom of the carafe or near the bottom. It's probably 9 or 10 months old. I expect an electric kettle should last at least a couple of years. This wasn't super expensive (I think I paid $59.99), but it wasn't the cheapest either. Time for a new kettle.

This Krups showed up under my Christmas tree in December of 2009 and it was immediately set-up in my kitchen. My first impression was that the water had a plastic taste to it, even after following the instructions and boiling a sacrifical pot of water (which I did several times). The plastic taste either abated after several weeks or I got used to it (don't know for sure), and the kettle quickly became just another appliance in my kitchen. That was until it started leaking. At first I wasn't sure if the kids had just spilled water on the counter and failed to wipe it up under the base of the kettle; however, as the leak got worse it became obvious it was the kettle and not the kids that was to blame. So much for fine looking Krups, I'm buying another Oster stainless kettle; much less bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is dangerous!","review":"We bought this kettle two months ago. About two weeks ago, it leaked boiling water from the handle, scalding my husband's hand. The automatic shutoff failed and we could not make the water stop boiling until we unplugged the thing. There should be a recall over this. Do not purchase this product until its safety has been assured. I called Krupps. They were going to send me a label to return it. They have not done so.

Finally it broke and we bought and FLF2 model as a replacement. After 6 month, it started leaking. Krups replaced it. We stayed 3 weeks without a kettle waiting for the shipment. After 2 month it started leaking again! Krups replaced it again. 2 weeks of wait. Now, 3 month passed it is leaking AGAIN! As many other reviewers say, it is a defective model. If not leaked, I would call it below average quality - on/off switch some times turns off right away. It is also quite noisy.Stay away from this kettle and probably from any other kettle made by Krups.

It was a bit frustrating to think that your water was ready when it didn't even begin to heat up yet. After several weeks of living with the malfunctioning button, we decided we paid too much for it not to work all the time. Also the whole kettle felt flimsier than the Braun we had.

We bought the Krups FLF2-J4 thinking it would be as good or better. But it is just a piece of cheap Chinese junk (no pun intended) without even German-like design. The plastic is thin and tasty and the cord is only 9\\" long, I guess they save a penny a copy that way, but you can't plug it in without an extension cord. So look elsewhere.

Neither was ever dropped or abused, used 2 to 3 times per day.Don't let the German brand name or high price fool you. These are cheap Chinese-made junk sold with a grossly inflated profit margin.

They do boil water fairly quickly, when they work. After just a few months, BOTH of the new ones now leak vast quantities of water onto the counter. Fortunately, both kitchens have ground fault interrupters. Although the idea of the design is valid, the manufacturers must have brought in \\"value engineers\\" to manufacture them even more cheaply. These things are not just overpriced garbage which suffer early failure, they are extremely dangerous. Obviously, the two \\"new\\" ones are no longer in use. This product should not be sold.

Usually radiating out from one of the handle mount holes. They all leak after some time but averaging about 6 months.My wife and I have bought 6 of these terrific pots over the last few years and we like them.There is no repair possible short of replacing the whole outer shell so it is not worth repairing the units.

This one started to leak water after less than 3 mos of usage..we have not been filling it with water that's above the max level - but we have been filling it with more water than before and it cannot handle it!

After 1 year, it began leaking badly at the bottom of the handle making it very hard to repair on my own so I called Krups customer service to see if they had a suggestion or a warranty for me to use. It turns out, the reference code at the bottom of the unit makes a huge difference. So buyer beware when you go to BBB to purchase this item in a hurry. Not only do you pay more for it but if you are not aware of the date imbedded in the code then you may be buying a kettle that is already out of warranty. I purchased mine in 2010, but the code had \\"0409\\" in it making the item out of warranty. I am going to replace my unit with an Aroma kettle.

We checked the Krups website - nothing helpful there. We've used the kettle almost every day for the past 2 years, but it was never handled roughly, dropped, damaged etc. So why is it leaking?

Five cents more in cost and thirty seconds more in design thinking and they'd have made a considerably more durable and long-lasting product. Now have to use a knife to futz with it manually and use a knife to get the lid to unlock. It's a design that's manufactured to fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky","review":"I had the same problem some of the other reviewers had. My kettle worked great for about a year, but then began to leak near the bottom of the handle. It's very dangerous. This is happening to a lot of people, so it's some sort of a design flaw.

It is a nice looking unit light weight and fast at heating a full load of water. However, an odor is created in the unit and after two weeks of usage it still remains. It hadn't diminished during that time. It smells like burnt plastic and it transfers that to the water for our tea or fresh ground coffee. Not pleasant. We felt it just wasn't safe.

But today, I came downstairs to water all over my counter and realized that it was leaking from the seam where the bottom of the handle joins the body. I intended to buy another kettle just like it, so I came back to Amazon, but then I read some of the reviews. It appears that this is a recurrent issue that Krups has never chosen to fix.

I had Braun wk200 tea kettle for about 10 year and it worked great until something was weared off and I could not turn it on. I have bought this model and it did not last very long.

A minor annoyance that kept it from 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAILED SEAL","review":"I first owned one in Germany and because Germany runs off 220 the kettle we had heated way faster than any U.S. electric kettle. However moving back to the US we needed to buy one that runs off 110. We purchased this one about 6 months ago and at first it seemed to be a good buy. Then one day I was heating up water and when I came back water was all over the counter. At first I thought I had over filled it, but when I picked it up I noticed that water was running out between the handle and the kettle. Not sure what happen or how it lost its seal, it wasn't like we played football with it or did anything out of the ordinary. In conclusion when it did work the kettle was fast in boiling water but for dependability and durability I would have to give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing design flaw","review":"The kettle looked fine; it heated water very quickly - its 1750W power was the reason we chose it in the first place - and we didn't have big issues with plasticky taste. However, after less than a year of daily use, we found the dreaded puddle on the counter under it: the kettle was leaking from the area where the handle joins the body.Krups replaced that kettle, and we hoped it was just that particular kettle and not a design flaw. We've had the replacement kettle less than 6 months, and there is a puddle on our counter again. Plainly this is a design issue; I see from earlier reviews that I'm by no means the only person to have found it out to my cost.Can't recommend this kettle. For the price, and from this maker, we had somehow expected better. We're shopping for a replacement...from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"ln less than 6 months this kettle was leaking and kept turning itself off. l was really disappointed, l was the owner of a Krups coffee maker and thought it would be nice to have the kettle and the coffee maker match.

Needless to say l did not replace the coffee maker with another Krups.l liked the design of the Krups, however l did find the lid was not that easy take on and off.l have now replaced the kettle with a stainless steel one at half the price from another company."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVED KETTLE - BUT....","review":"I purchased my Krups electric kettle about a year ago and loved it right from the start. Ditto with the positive features in other reviews. But it just died - won't turn on after only a year or less of use only two or three times a week!! NOT good for Krups reputation. I would like to buy another one just like it but $60 for one year's use seems outrageous to me! I would think Krups could easily improve the switch and stop the leaking problems and wonder why they haven't since this model is so obviously defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design but horribly shoddy construction","review":"Our previous kettle (Krups AC 17) withstood over 8 years of daily use, so we had high expectations for this one. On initial use, we liked that it boils water very rapidly but doesn't get really hot on the outside, in contrast with its stainless steel competitors. We also liked the easily readable fill gauge on the sides - much better than the ones with the gauge in-line with the handle.HOWEVER, it started leaking from the bottom after only a few months of use (pretty much right after the warranty ran out), and based on the number of similar reviews here, it's clearly not a fluke. Clearly, Krups quality is not what it was - we'll be trying another brand next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality control is lacking","review":"At first I LOVED this water kettle. It was so easy to heat up water quickly and safely. I used it all the time. However, after only a year of use the connection between the base and the kettle unit has stopped working. I have to press down on the kettle with brute force to get the unit to work. My husband fixed it so the connectore would touch again, and it only worked once before it shorted out again. Everything else is in perfection condition, but the critical component isn't made to last. I am really disappointed, especially after only a year of use, and a one year warranty of course! Not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That faulty switch drives me nuts","review":"A very handsome product, I was attracted by the Krups name, but within two months it started to switch itself off just after I'd switch it on.

I'm shocked that Krups seems oblivious to these complaints and several consumer websites report its customer service being very unresponsive."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaky non-starter","review":"I bought this because it's stylish-looking and doesn't take up much space and because German products have a good reputation (where is it actually manufactured?)

The drummer was ex-cellent but you cannot hear the drums very good because the saxplayer is playing louder over all the other instruments and drow-ning them out, including the drummer. I'd also like to say thatthe sax player throughout the album came up short on alot of thesongs-like he was playing with a \\"FIRESTONE\\" saxaphone that had major blowouts with alot of flats. That's my opinion, his notes were flat on most of the tunes. Other than that, the album was a good swing jazz CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as described.

This game is awful. The graphics are nothing close to what it was claiming to have. Fielding is slow and choppy. Throwing is unrealistic. Overall gameplay is pathetic. Rosters are terrible. There are a few good things, the crowd and stadiums are pretty good. Overall, the game isn't worth your money. I took mine back. It's a sad excuse for a baseball game, and the only option they give us this year. And I haven't even mentioned the freezing issue and the way 2K handled it. Here's hoping we get MVP back next year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please bring back MVP Baseball","review":"I will keep it simple...The Good:The game freezes up and you can't play it for long.The Bad:EVERYTHING !!!!Easily the worst baseball game ever made,when it is not freezing youre hoping it will.The fielding is beyond bad.Players switching is laughable and dont even get me started on running the bases or hitting...luckily you cannot give out a zero mark so it has to get 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"good game but freezes a lot","review":"It is a good game and fun to play once you get used to all the controls.

Even when you DO understand the controls, they're so awkward that it isn't even fun.- There's no feel to pitching or hitting. A homerun feels the same as a single. Pitching is a disaster.- Graphics look the same as a PS2 game from 4 years ago. Why does this game warrant a higher price tag???- Game freezes.- Messy interface, difficult to navigate.====================I can't imagine a worse baseball game. Couple this with the freeze issues many people are having, and this is without question one of the worst games for the 360."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Baseball Game Ever","review":"I was really looking forward to this game since their older baseball games were fun and only cost 19.99. Well since they have the rights to the MLB games now, I figured it would be worth it to pay 59.99 for it. The biggest mistake ever. The graphics look like PS2 at best, the players move slow so it's impossible to make catches and big plays, the batting sucks and takes a long time getting used to. Another big complaint is the camera, the angles are horrible and make the game boring. DO NOT waste you money on this game. I'm just gonna have to wait till next year for a decent baseball game."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the !@$$","review":"I have been waiting 3 months for this game, what a joke. MLB the show for PSP blows this game away. All i kept hearing about was how good the graphics are going to be. None of the players look like real players, the hitting controls are a joke, and the fielding anamations are horrible. Please MLB, give back the money 2k sports gave you for the rights to make the game so real players like EA sports and other software companys can make a MLB game."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW! What a disapointment","review":"Just plain terrible. The Graphics are very poor, especially for the 360, and they are so bad they begin to distract from the game right from the begining. But the real problem is that the gameplay is even worse. Fielding is terrible, player controls are terrible, and baserunning is a joke. The pitching and hitting controls are the only savior. The designers took a fresh approach to the sport and I did actually like their ideas. However, they just can not make up for the rest of the flaws. This title just looks and plays as though it was rushed to the shelves. On top of all of this, player ratings are a complete joke. Anyone with any knowledge of the sport could have done a better job here.All and All do yourself a favor and pass on this game. Maybe next year we can get a little competition and maybe multiple baseball titles to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"MLB gaming for the next decade is ruined.","review":"Ok, so maybe its not that bad, but this game sure is a waste of money. Now that 2k sports has the MLB license i guess you can forget about playing a realistic/fun MLB game for the rest of the decade and beyond.All of the problems listed in the other reviews are accurate. I would also like to add a few problems and glitches with the game. There are several occurences where you you sign or trade for a pitcher, and cant set him in any of your rotation or relief slots. He is listed as on the roster, but just cant be accessed. Also, the player ratings are terrible. I'm not sure how to explain how bad the ratings are, but one example is that a player you draft out of high school starts with a higher rating than an allstar from last year.The bottom line, is that unless they vastly improve the game for next years version, they have a good shot at going bankrupt because nobody who buys this game will ever buy another 2k sports baseball game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a game for the baseball nut","review":"Ok,So I thought that I would give this game a chance since my son and I love baseball. I read all the bad reviews and actually purchased the copy cheap off of EBay.This game is terrible.

Duh. Where is the challenge.I downloaded the updated rosters and they were even wrong.So disappointed in this game...i hope that they spend some time on the next one because it is obvious that they rushed this one out for the release of the 360.Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game sucks so much!!!!!!!!","review":"MLB 2K6 its the worst baseball game i have ever played.

Sometimes change isn't good they change all this gameplay and didn't have the decency 2 have a tutorial. The graphics suck and games are not all about the graphics but 2k5 looks better. I'm a EA sports tan and ppl were downgrading their games at least they were realistic I notice on all the 2k sport titles that they have a habbit of putting in all these game modes and extras but they don't do anything 2 the graphics yal need to step yal game up 2k sports cuz all the graphics in your games suck this is definetly trade in bait.

I often find myself searching to see where I need to go to change game options. Some of the \\"improvements\\" they made, are the same stuff that EA sports already had with MVP baseball.As for the rosters, they aren't even up to date (even after the online download) and they hardly is any minor league system at all.

I can't decide what's worse: pitching or hitting. Even after you get used to it, the hitting is boring and frustrating. As far as pitching, it is nothing new except that the catcher regularly misses the ball and then when you send him after it, the controls get screwy and he often runs right past the ball (sometimes even runs circles around it, does anything but actually pick it up) while anyone on base can probably make it all the way to 3rd, if not home.

I have always viewed them with suspicion but allowed for the possibility of some folks simply having different tastes. This is why I found the reviews for Major League Baseball 2K6 so facinating. This is a game that is defective and due to the defect, freezes. So, even if someone has very low standards, they could not honestly give a defective game 5 stars. Well, take a look at the 5 star reviews here and you can finally see proof that there really are planted, fake reviews. Call me naive for needing this type of evidence, but guess I am too much the optimist. Now, who do we think planted them? lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only thing good is graphics.","review":"ALright I have had this game for a while so I finally read about all of this and it's true. The only thing on this game i think is the graphics. The rankings for everyone is horrible. If i simulate a whole season i have ALbert Pujols only having around 19 home runs and Dontrelle Willis will have an ERA of around 2.30. Thats like impossible for over 30 starts. Another thing is that the batting stances are way off of the regular starters and so are the pitching windups. They look terrible. I only play this game because baseball is my fav. sport and nomatter how bad it is im gona play. Another thing is to make the 360 games more fun how bout have a become a star for next year and run through your career with them. That would make this game 10x better. So if you really wanna play this game alot like me you must love baseball because it does get boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"First off the game freezes, you can follow the tips on the 2K6 message boards but eventually the game will freeze again. I took my copy back and got a full refund, hopefully other people will be so lucky.For posterity here's my take on the game on the few games I played. The batting and pitching systems were very good. I could tell that is was going to take a little while to learn the nuances but I enjoyed them. That said the fielding and camera angles available are terrible, not only is it hard to move your fielders but the view is zoomed in too much.I was exicted about the baserunning system but in use it didn't work all that well.

Fortunately, this has changed with the years, so now there are more recordings of it by the violin virtuosos. The standard recording of it is the Josef Suk, but it suffers from a bad audio, because it is an old recording. This CD has a great audio and, in terms of interpretation, Sporcl is flawless and full of warm and emotion.

Otherwise, I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tent never even made it to the beach","review":"We purchased this pop-up tent for our daughter's (6 months) first trip to the beach. The night before, we opened it up and the pole snapped. It's made of very poor material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"I bought this product for my baby to play outside in our yard. It is very difficult to fold into its case so unless you have lots of time on your hands, do not buy this sun dome. The poles that hold it up break very easily and are impossible to repair. Save yourself time and money by buying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"We purchased the Sun Dome last summer for $40 and it broke after the first use. Not worth the money. I am a little shocked at the $67.99 price. Do not pay that much for it. If this product was listed for less than $5, you may get your money's worth for a single use."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTED MONEY","review":"The Kel-Gar Kid's Sun Dome was a total failure. We were looking for something that we could bring on the beach for our little sun. Here's what didn't work:- it gets pretty hot, and provide not much shadow- it blows away even if you feel the two side pockets- it breaks at any time you try to fold it back- the instruction aren't clear on how to fold itI would give a ZERO to this product. we barely used it three times. The structural folding rings broke in several pieces and we weren't able to use it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save yourself the hassle!","review":"I bought this tent dispute the numerous bad reviews, and it turned out to be as bad as they said!

Please please please don't purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Kid's Sun Dome!","review":"I love this Sun Dome. It just arrived in the mail so we haven't tried it at the beach yet but when I opened it, it popped right open. So happy! Gone will be the days of struggling at the beach to set up my son's tent. I do not understand the negative reviews about closing the dome. I followed the instructions and was able to close the dome on my first try. I would recommend this product. Great buy for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product, collapsing takes patience!","review":"We go to the beach often and this has lasted many uses. We even use it in the house on rainy days as a 'pretend' beach indoor play time.The only con is collapsing the tent as well as if and when you do not want to use the net screen there is no latch or velcro to keep it back. I would recommend this product for the price and since it is for beach use, it so far has held up to the elements. We do weigh it down with sand on the sides as well as but our beach bag inside since it may blow away but we haven't had that problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea...not worth it!","review":"Things wrong with the sun dome:1. A big circle window in the back of the tent that doesn't have a way to cover it. Goodbye shade properties.2. Mesh is made of super fine fabric that rips in an instant, even on it's own velcro. We cut off the tabs to prevent ripping. It's a cotton mesh, and very fragile.3. Impossible to fold up!! My husband and I both tried 3-10 times to fold it according to the directions and got nowhere. And normally we're really good at that kind of thing. We gave up and it's sitting in our living room. Not sure what to do with it now...It was a great idea that is not worth the expense, get another brand of sun dome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful product","review":"I live near the beach and thought that this would be a great thing to have for my daughter. The first time I used it the dome was so flimsy it completely blew over my daughter while she slept in it. The second time the pole snapped rendering it useless. The customer service at Kelgar was unhelpful and unapologetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hazardous!!","review":"DANGER!! We've been through two of these in two summers and both times a rod snapped, cutting through the fabric, making the product dangerous. The first time my son was an infant and we caught it right away. This time my son was injured! I also gave one as a gift my sister in law around the time we initially purchased the product for our son and she had the same problem. After 3 uses she had to throw it away. I was able to exchange mine the first time, but this time I was told to contact Kel-Gar directly. Kel-Gar claims there is nothing they can do and will not work with us. Very frustrated and would encourage buyers to look at different companies and products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product, avoid at all costs","review":"If you buy this, plan on only being able to use it once. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to fold back into its case. After spending 15 minutes trying, I realized it had snapped in half. Utter piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to fold","review":"we purchased this last year for our new baby. it took a couple of tries to get it folded the right way. once we got it in the bag, we put it away until needed again. I took it to the beach a few weeks ago and found that the tubular pieces inside were broken. we are very disappointed in this sun dome. i don't think this is worth $40 at all. the only good thing is that it has adequate space inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, Flimsy, and Impossible to Fold Back Up","review":"I would avoid this product. My wife and I purchased it for our son's first trip to the beach. Pops up easily, and stayed relatively stable once you loaded up the side pockets with sand. It doesnt block the sun very well (lots of mesh). That is a catch 22 because the tent stayed cool for my son, but we had to set it up under the shade of an umbrella. I would have been okay with the product if that was the only issue. ...however, it broke the second time I tried folding it back up. The instructions to get it back in the bag are totally ambiguous. The poles are made of fiber glass and the bottom one snapped while I was folding it. This wasn't user error, just cheap material. After the pole broke, it was easier to get in the bag (ironically) but it was one of the bottom support poles so it made the tent less stable. I dropped it in a garbage can on the beach at the end of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect except it breaks into pieces","review":"Perfect, matched exactly what I was looking for. Folded up nicely and quick. Of course, I followed those directions, folds up like the sun shades for your car's windshield, no problem, I can do that. Opened it up for its third use, one totally broke pole and two kinked poles. Poor baby has a saggy, dilapidated sun dome now:( Wrote company with complaint today and we will see what they say/do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless unless no wind or sun","review":"I purchased this tent to protect my babies from the sun at the beach, but upon using it today, I found it utterly worthless. If there is any wind at all the tent blows down so that it covers the babies inside, and there are so many see-through screen areas that it hardly blocks the sun at all. If there is sun and wind the you would be better off not having the tent at all. If there is no sun and wind, then this would be a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Louis Jordan at his best","review":"Of the R&B pioneer Louis Jordan's series of low-budget musical comedies, this is the best by far. An interesting look at Black college life in the 1940s, this is the tale of Jordan returning to his old college to settle scores with a rival and raise money to save the school. Not as corny as it sounds. A bit more story and better acting than what usually appeared in Jordan's comedies. Jordan is of course at his best with his clowing and singing, and sax playing, but he also shows that he could really act when called to do so. Check it and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow and never arrives where it was headed....disingenuous actually.","review":"A movie like this didn't need to move fast or have action. But it still moved far too slow. Some good ideas, and the main characters are very likeable until they aren't. The background tune for the first half of the movie is mind numbingly insipid. Looks very nice despite the low budget. But the interesting ideas, and viewpoints of a couple quirky people start off and then don't get anywhere. Too much promised, not enough delivered.I was glad I watched it, it was different than mainstream movie fare these days. But I just can't give it more than a couple stars. In the end it was quite shallow and incomplete. Then to make it worse, the ending was quite disingenuous. Almost enough to make me take away another star. But I will leave it at two."},{"rating":"1","title":"If...the middle word of life","review":"and lifeless is the best word to describe this film.

I don't know much about cinema, but this one is worth seeing for just a few bucks. I especially loved the old photography, silhouette scenes, and George listing encyclopedia entries.

Lisa della Casa is a radiant Euridice - hercrystalline voice at its most attractive. The very young Rober-ta Peters is a delighful Amore singing with precision and musi-cality. Chorus and orchestra are a bit rough for Gluck and Maes-tro Monteux is occasionally sluggish in his tempos. Good earlystereo sound and including all the ballet music. A fine set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"We owed the predecessor design of this item and it just couldn't hold up to daily use. The slides/glides (whatever they're called) were lower quality and the whole thing was failing apart within a couple years. Very dissapointing considering the cost. I looked around for a replacement and saw that Rev-A-Shelf had upgraded the design. They even seemed to make a big deal about the slides/glides by making specific reference to the manufacturer (which was not Rev-A-Shelf). That usually means something. Well, this upgrade is awesome. Very high quality. It is designed so that when you shut the cabinet, it stops it in the last 1/2 inch or so, and then quietly sucks it in that last little bit, so that your cabinet shuts silently. No slamming or banging. We are extremely impressed with the quality. This sucker was worth every cent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I am a big Frances Farmer fan and I was looking forward to this book when I ordered it. All I knew was that it must be a novel about her, since I have not heard anything about the book. It's more about the characters who admire Frances than about her herself. Anyway, the book is bland and boring, and I couldn't finish it. It just went nowhere. I would stick with the other Frances books, \\"Shadowland\\" and \\"Will There Really Be A Morning\\". Both grabbed my attention immediately and didn't let go.Being out of print, this book is expensive to buy.

It is was easy to install since I was able to access my attic and get to it. If not for attic access it could've been very tricky to install. The light is beautiful and was cheaper than Home Depot. It is just as loud as they say it is and can hold 2- 60 watt bulbs which puts off a decent amount of light which is something you want in a bathroom. It came with easy connect wire connectors in which you push a piece of stripped wire into the colored connectors and you are done. It does come with a four inch vent outlet that I had to switch because I had a three inch vent before. All in all it is a good product for the money and I do not have any problems at all out of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic Western","review":"No western library should be without this novel.

It is a great book for young adult reader to get them intersted in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedium long before the excitement finally begins.","review":"I have often heard of Zane Grey, the \\"Father of the modern Western novel.\\" And I have heard of this book. I finally got around to read it, to my dismay. Surprisingly, at least to me, it appears to be mostly a treatise against the Mormon religion and it's treatment of women. Secondly, it is a travelogue with ongoing, over-the-top, boring descriptions of the countryside. I challenge anyone to draw a sketch or a map from the word pictures of the area that Grey concocts. In a way, I am glad I stuck with the book - although I was very tempted to quit at several junctures - because the last 30 pages or so have the thrill of adventure I would expect from a Western. With so many other authors to explore, it will probably be a long time, if ever, before I return to Zane Grey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book, my first Zane Grey","review":"I appreciate Zane Greys ability to paint a picture of the books changing scenery with words.

It is as if the publisher didn't want readers to know what Grey wrote, so put it all in \\"the fine print.\\" Tiny type is understandable when a long ingredents list must be squeezed onto a small bottle of multi-vitamins, but there is no excuse with a book. This is, in fact, the only book I've ever seen with a type face this small--the only book ever I couldn't see well enough to read.The book is printed on good paper with adequate margins and lots of white space (too much space between paragraphs), suggesting that a quality paperback was intended.

However, this book is fantastic. Rachel Gibson gets better with each book. These characters are richly drawn and well-rounded. The hero, while still a manly man sheriff, is significantly more interesting than some of Ms. Gibson's previous heros. Unlike the cop character from It Must Be Love, Dylan is not overly judgmental. He's also funny, loving, romantic and very good with his son. I only hope her next book can live up to the standard she set with True Confessions. The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because of the \\"mystery\\" involving the deceased sheriff, which never goes anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly...not the original!","review":"After watching a Magoo short tacked onto our Mr. Magoo's A Christmas Carol disk, my kids were in love with Mr. Magoo!

The Belly Button book had a lot of potential but just didn't come across. The prose is stitled and awkward in its phrasing and rhyming and doesn't always make much sense. For instance, there are some hippos at the beach and the text says \\"We don't do much throughout the day. That's how we like it best. We nibble grapes and watch the waves. We take a little rest.\\" Maybe I'm missing something.... What does this have to do with belly buttons and why are they eating grapes?Oh well.

Our protagonist, himself a survivor of a strange experience on a train, has to try to stop the energy building up.The climax is a tour-de-force as the train hurtles to London, the demon grows ever more powerful, and the deaths pile up.Laws has a wild imagination, and he likes to kill people in very gruesome fashions, but if, like me, you like your horror fast and action packed, then he's the man for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Pack?

I've read other reviews but apparently I'm not strong enough to handle something this terrible. It was like watching a thousand puppies being raped then eaten by a monster. Not a quality monster either, a monster staring in a sy-fy channel original movie.But I digress, this game is just like Splinter Cell if Splinter Cell had horrible graphics, bad voice acting, a dumb plot, and if it made you want to kill yourself. It has all of the difficulty of Panzer Dragoon Orta without any of the fun. The graphics would have been amazing if I had a time machine and used it to go back ten years ago.

I know there's an argument saying \\"it's not a terrible game,\\" but this is definitely not nex-gen material. I know that's becoming a new trend now, people putting down games that they feel are not up to next-gen standards, but this game REALLY isn't. My roommate reserved this, mainly cause the preview looked awesome, long story short major disappointment. This would actually be a pretty cool title on the PS2 I think. The controls really don't fit right with the 360 controller, and I think for the stealth games, the PS2 controller has its advantages. (i.e. Metal Gear Solid) The graphics look well polished but you can tell they didn't make any effort to place it with the rest of the current 360 titles.

What you get are pages of uninspired face-on photos (256 in all, I think) of the diamonds in the collection, cropped to the shapes of the stones, with nothing else to make them look remotely interesting. Next to each small (less than an inch) photo is a brief description. The book is mainly a catalog color names with an occasional colorful description or story about a particular diamond.

One cliche after another, and nary a fact to back up any of her fevered imagination.Reading this book was like listening to a drunk, witless boor who has cornered you at a party go on and on about the Peterson case.

OK for some I guess. Better than Amber's but that's not saying much. Preferred Crier's by far for interesting detail. This one just wasn't my thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Everywoman Case","review":"Dillon is \\"everywoman.\\" This case was \\"everywoman's\\" case. She writes with an unexpected directness often tempered by a sharp sense of humor, and the result is at once extremely readable and extremely sincere, if at times a shade pretentious. You may not always agree with her, but you never doubt that she herself believes what she says is true, and when she takes a position she pulls no punches in her opinions; she is brutally honest--and not always in her own favor.You may love her, you may hate her--but from either side of the coin she is the voice of many who followed the Peterson trial, and you can't deny the facts speak for themselves. She had the guts and work ethic to put everything on full display.When I finished this book, I felt so sad - for Scott, for Laci and her family, and because it felt like saying goodbye to a major chapter of my life. That's why I'm glad she has a blog I can read every day. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and Bloated.","review":"What a disappointment. This blog writer uses 10 times the number of words needed to make a point. Not as advertised, loaded with inaccuracies, very expensive, a dud. Try Crier's book or Rocha's for some substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book and boring blog","review":"This book is not worth the price nor is it worth any price as far as I am concerned. The book is totally one person's OPINION of the case of Scott Peterson. It does not include any new facts or any information that hasn't already been published. It is boring, goes on incessantly about his guilt and tries to prove to the reader why an action points to his guilt. I finally started scanning the book after the first two chapters as it was so boring I couldn't finish it. If you want a book that is a quick read and full of exciting details about the case, find another book. I spent some time checking out the author, Loretta's blog after reading this book and found it to be almost as boring. I did read some entries on her blog where her blog followers had written positive five star reviews on this book to encourage others to buy the book and try to wipe out the negative reviews. Don't waste your money, look elsewhere for a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just her blog, verbatim...","review":"Ms. Dillon has a blog, where she pontificated extensively on the Peterson case. She then took most of her entries on the Peterson case down off her web site, and jammed them in all together into book form. Although Ms. Dillon considers herself a writer, her blog is poorly written. With no fact checker, editor, and 95% opinion, the end result is, as expected a poorly written, overly verbose book. Ms. Dillon is asking her readers to pay for something that, at one time, she offered up for free. This went into the trash heap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a vanity press offering","review":"'the whole truth' would be that a publisher wouldn't buy it. This offering isn't fact checked or had benefit of an editor. Much of what is offered here as evidence just isn't evidence. The sonar search and most of what is included as affidavits, interviews or testimony just didn't come into play for the investigation or the trial. It has no relevance to the investigation, the trial or the outcome. Crier's book is the better read for behind the scenes information - that mattered and was taken into consideration at the trial."},{"rating":"1","title":"boo","review":"My opinion of this book is not good. I was offended at her attempt of trying to make light of a dark situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a ghastly book","review":"As much as I tried I could not get passed the 2nd chapter. I think it was written too fast. I will wait for Sharon Rocha's book. I know that will be worth it! And her money will go to a good cause! Not her wallet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on The Trial","review":"As the author states in her introduction, this is the only book on the Peterson case to cover the trial. And cover it well. This book devotes over 2/3 of the original weblog posts to the trial - summaries of testimony, transcript excerpts, analysis, law review, and opinion based on following the case from the beginning.The book was also short-listed for a non-fiction book award and has been cited by many websites and authors who have information about the Peterson case.For those who didn't follow the case and don't know what really happened in court, or only followed it on TV, Stone Cold Guilty is a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be.","review":"It didn't even seem like a book. It seemed like a high school term paper with just opinions. I do not think Miss Dillon has the credentials to give her pycho analysis of the case. I went to her website. What is with her sick songs about SP? That's crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone Cold Guilty book opinion","review":"Not the best book I have read. I also found the price steep. Not suggested reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"This author I felt was over confident in her writing. I too shared this book. I am glad I did not invest any money in it.I wasted time reading this piece of junk. I wish Amazon had more taste in their books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disrespectful to the victim","review":"Another 5 Star reviewer wrote about this book that \\"some parts are funny\\". This is about a homicide. A beloved daughter, sister and friend brutally taken from this Earth with her unborn baby devastating many lives. This author finds humor, parody and creating 'songs' in this book which I find repulsive. This is a murder and that kind of light treatment of it is completely disrespectful to the memory of Laci Denise Rocha Peterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT what I'd hoped for","review":"Having been an avid follower of the trial of Scott Peterson as well as having read all of the books regarding this case that have to date been released, I was thrilled to find this one. This new author is no doubt intelligent. However, I found that Ms. Dillon's book offered much less insight than the others that I have read. Perhaps it was her writing style, but the over use of adjectives and adverbs made for a tedious and at times, boring read. Ms. Dillon's adament attitude of \\"having been right\\" from the onset and the humor that she attempted to incorporate into the book towards such a tragic subject left me with a less than favorable opinion of her. For verification purposes I shall also add that I am not familiar with her weblog as so many of the reviewers here seem to be.Perhaps some people may find \\"Stone Cold Guilty\\" a great read but I did not and I regret having purchased and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very engaging","review":"I was disappointed because of the boring blog-type style. Too much was made of the chapter on the \\"sonar\\" reading equipment. It seemed to say \\"buy me, buy me\\". Not a good buy at all. I definitely am disappointed.Ms. Dillon should concentrate less on taking notes from newspaper and television and attend the actual events. This author is definitely not ready for prime time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Trial's The Thing\\"","review":"From Dillon's intro to the book, she claims that \\"the trial's the thing,\\" and she's right. By the time you get to page 27 in the book, Peterson has been arrested. Other books about the case end here. In Stone Cold Guilty, this is just the beginning.In between the events from the arrest to the conviction, Dillon injects some light-hearted humor, summaries of court documents, and a few surprising tidbits of poetic snapshots or literary analogies. Who besides Dillon would think to compare Scott Peterson's circumstances to the existential drama, \\"No Exit?\\" Some of Dillon's analogies are pretty sophisticated and not for the average Joe.But even the average Joe can appreciate the throrough coverage and fearless efforts of an unknown blogger in presenting this story. The author does a fantastic job of bringing all the details to light that were skipped by the media. There's something for everyone in this book. It's a banquet of treats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unappealing","review":"A book consisting, in the main, of acerbic commentary from an author who lists no apparent qualifications other than interested observer. There is no meat in this book for the consumer, only acidic fluff. Acidic fluff is best served in small portions with time for the acid to dissipate between bites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This book was a great read. I really enjoyed it. I re-read the trial last night and it was even better the second time around. I picked up on so many new details that I missed.This book has all the meat and all the broth.If I could give it 10 stars I would!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title of the Book Says It All","review":"Unfortunately, that's all the book says. The daily news reports and interviews were more easily digested than the many run-on sentences the author throws at her readers. In addition, the author's attempt to establish credibility to a subject with which she herself was an outsider is sorely lacking. I'm sure that many individuals related on some level to the tragic tale within the pages of this book, but several authors have done a much better job at conveying the full impact of Laci Peterson's death. \\"For Laci\\" by Sharon Rocha is a much better read and provides much better insight of this case from a credible perspective. Save your money (and your library card) for some worth while read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of compassion","review":"I too also read her blabbing on the hurricane. What a heartless person. How can she have compassion to be able to write a book? She is not at all human. She should be compared with Hitler. Cept he had power. Loretta has none."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rambling disaster","review":"If this book was really on a shortlist for an award, all I can say is that the other entries must have been even worse than Stone Cold Guilty - hard to imagine.This \\"blook\\" is a rambling effort of spewed out by a writer who seems to believe good writing consists of navel-gazing followed by a lot of adjectives.There is no research here beyond reading media accounts of the trial like everyone else in the world did. The \\"exclusive\\" sonar information is a fraud - the sonar operator, Gene Ralston, told Dillon to stop using his name to promote this debacle.This is nothing more than an attempt by the author to insert herself into a murder trial as if she found it vastly entertaining. How insulting, to Laci and her baby and her friends and family. Their murder trial wasn't a \\"play\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thumbs Down","review":"I was an avid watcher of the Peterson case, and have purchased every book published about it. I sincerely regret wasting so much money and time on this book. It was a very difficult read because it contained many run on sentences and grammatical errors, not to mention many inaccurate statements. I felt compelled to read the entire book because I had spent so much money on it, and kept thinking that it had to get better. Much to my dismay, it only got worse as each chapter passed. I should have listened to the prior reviews of this book, instead of opting to give the book a chance just because it was about the Peterson case. This book did not become part of my permanent collection of Peterson books, and I literally placed it in the green bin with the rest of the recycling the day after I finished reading it. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on this book. If you really feel you must read it, wait to find it at a yard sale or thrift store for a nickel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gives you everything","review":"If you want to know more about the Peterson trial than we all saw on the Fox and CNN news shows, this is the book you want. I doubt you'll find anyone who does their homework like Ms. Dillon. Her blog entires were much more than \\"here's what happened today and here's my opinion.\\" Not only does she go through all the trial transcripts with a fine tooth comb, but she takes the reader through what actually happened and the resulting implications.This is NOT a Hollywood remake of the Laci Peterson murder, or the Amber Frye story, or any similar Hollywood saga. This is the play-by-play from a couple of weeks before Laci goes missing to \\"You are hereby sentenced...\\"If you were a Scott Peterson Trial junkie, or if you want to know why the whole country was dialed in on this case, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the Facts, Ma'am","review":"This is a very good book. Not only does it contain a great deal of information about Scott Peterson's trial, but the author also manages to convey, in great depth, the emotional aspects of the case. I definitely recommend this book!This is definitely a great resource for anyone who wants to know the facts of this case. The author constructs realistic comparisons and actual transcripts of the trial and legal documents.This book contains crucial information that was not on TV or in the newspapers. However, some of the material covered is redundant, nonetheless, there are many interesting facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone Cold Guilty.","review":"Stone Cold Guilty proved to be Stone Cold dumb.

I have to agree with the other reviewers in their opinions that this book is a bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"Fortunately, I bought this book very cheap at a book resale shop for only $1. It actually wasn't even worth that. Some of her facts are wrong, and I think she is completely wrong for \\"cashing in\\" on this case when she was only an avid follower of the case like so many other thousands of people. Anyone can keep a blog on this case and then incorporate the blog into a book. Since the author is a \\"nobody\\", I have a low opinion of someone who is an \\"average Joe\\" trying to make money on a case that was none of her concern personally.I wouldn't waste my time or money on this book. It was very boring to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The facts presented are not to be trusted.","review":"I agree with the reviewer \\"John\\" below and concur that vanity presses do not afford the fact checking process to verify any information in their publications to be true. No one hired this person to write this book, gave an advance or request and she has paid to have it published. No one edited it nor verified any of her information is accurate and non-libelous. I doubt anyone would sue a vanity press author for libel as it is well known that there is little money to be made in this kind of endeavor. But I think amazon at least owes its customers a disclaimer about a book written about a true life incident.

This book is worth every cent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Reading this was the equivalent of reading a book report in high school - dull, overstuffed with adjectives, and rife with unfounded opinion.The contents of this self-published book were already posted on the author's blog during the trial. Dillon has interviewed no one actually connected to the case, except a sonar operator whose work was not even presented during the trial.She doesn't understand criminal law, and it's obvious in her writing that her 'legal review' is based only on a superficial reading of California criminal code. There are no informed insights here.The same goes for her armchair 'diagnosis' of Peterson's psychological pathology. Even worse, she manages to claim with a straight face that anyone who disagrees with her doesn't know what they're talking about.I really doubt that Catherine Crier, Nancy Grace, Rick Distaso, Jim Brazelton, and other major figures in the trial are all clueless just because Dillon says so.Verdict: Waste of money.

I prefer using every rectangle size available, and not the round, because the rectangles fit nicely in fridge and cabinet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass beats plastic!","review":"We've been replacing our plastic storage containers as they wear out, and we're happy to be replacing with glass. Glass lasts longer, doesn't stain, is microwavable and is easily recycled should it ever break. We bought the 10-piece set, and then added a larger rectangle, and additional sets of the small rounds and small rectangles. We use them for storing leftovers in the refrigerator, microwave (you can even microwave with the lid loosely fit if you're heating something that spatters) and in our lunch bags. The lids snap tight, but are reasonably easy to remove. The only negatives are that they're heavy, and you have to be careful with them when they're hot - in particular, don't set them on a cold or wet surface right out of the microwave. This is a great change from the plastic containers we've been using, and we expect they'll last for years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Set","review":"Got it a few days ago, and like them very much! Actually I thought they're plastic, but then i just got that i didn't read the description properly)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Two containers where impossible to cover with their corresponding lids no matter how hard i tried!! I was so disappointed in this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Frig Storage and Microwave","review":"I have read the info on snopes.com and comments from these reviews and made an educated decision that when Amazon put this set in a Today's Deals sale, I wanted them. This set meets my needs. I want to use less plastic. I am cautious with glassware so would not go from freezer to oven with any glass dishes. The fine print in the instructions tell you to let the frozen food/dish thaw some before putting it in a hot oven - that makes sense to me. I have so far been using these containers for storing left overs and reheating them in the microwave. I would use them for baking but they are smaller than what I would normally bake in. As with all glassware, pieces could shatter but in my experience, I have not ever had that problem. I am happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to plastic","review":"I bought these so I could throw away all of my plastic containers to avoid the chemical leeching into my food and I love them. They get hot when you microwave them and are obviously heavier than plastic would be but if they keep my food safe, that is worth while to me. They are a bargain at this price. I think I will order another set of Pyrex but this time with more circles, the rectangles aren't really that useful to me as most of my leftovers are side dishes instead of full meals. I don't think the lids are really leak proof, I had homemade ice cream in the long rectangle and when it tipped on its side, some of the melted portion ran down the side of the container."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese manufactured garbage.","review":"I LOVE the OLD pyrex. It was the BEST but this new stuff is made in China and is garbage. If you are lucky enough to have some of the old bowls all you have to do is hold them next to the new ones and you will see the difference. The old ones are clear and the new ones have a blue cast to the glass. For some reason the blue tint in the glass weakens it but somehow makes it cheaper to produce. From what I've read all colored glass is more fragile especially when subjected to heat but I have to tell you, it also chips with just regular use. I've never had any of the old pyrex chip. I have many of the old ones and wanted to add more sizes. I was VERY disappointed. Also, the lids for the new ones are EXTREMELY stiff and very difficult to get on to the bowls. I even had one lid split because it would not stretch. Somehow this new stiffer plastic is cheaper to make just does not make a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Covers don't fit pyrex containers","review":"When I received my pyrex storage containers, I tried without success to get all of the lids on their matching containers. Two containers where impossible to cover with their corresponding lids. Several family members tried as well and they were unsuccesful. It is so disappointing to receive a product that obviously does not have quality control. Another minor complaint is that this is listed as a 10 piece set. If customers are in a hurry when ordering, they may not realize that they are counting the lids as part of the set thinking the order includes 10 containers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to plastic","review":"I bought these containers for one reason...plastic containers smell. They absorb colors and odors and over time, this becomes both ugly and unpalatable. They also are prone to melting and warping, both in the microwave and in the dishwasher. Glass seemed to be a natural solution to these problems, so we bought this set.The Pyrex containers are great for solid food. Tomato-based pastas don't stain; garlickly foods don't leave an awful residual smell; and since glass is a better heat conductor, they're more optimal in the microwave than plastic. Heed the other reviewers' warnings regarding liquid storage; the lids are probably the weakest point. For liquid, we use Nalgene containers, which never, ever leak (backpackers use them religiously)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS","review":"In case you haven't read the January issue of Consumer Reports yet, let me summarize: Corning sold Pyrex to World Kitchen, who is using cheaper glass which makes it more likely to shatter from heat. The European Pyrex still uses the traditional Pyrex formula and is as heat-resistant as always. Consumer Reports says: \\"We baked at least five samples of each brand in a 450-degree oven. All of the U.S. Pyrex and Anchor dishes shattered when placed on the wet countertop. None of the European dishes ... broke\\"Amazon sells the European product:Arcuisine Elegance Glass 2.8 Quart Rectangular Baker"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pyrex drops the ball","review":"I purchased this exact same set 3 years ago and loved it. Recently I decided to do away with all my plastic containers and switch solely to glass so I purchased another set. The first set I got the lids wouldn't even go on the round containers. I called Pyrex to complain but they sent me to Amazon customer service instead. I found it odd that they didn't want to hear about their defective product. Anyway, Amazon replaced the set promptly and without hassle. The second set I got had almost the same problem! The lids are extremely hard to get on (only on the round containers) They are indented so far that they almost go inside the bowls instead of out. Maybe it was just one batch of the product but I would be leery of buying them again especially since Pyrex doesn't seem to stand behind their product. Thank goodness Amazon does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Ordered this item as a supplement to some storage containers that were no longer available. Thinking Pyrex would be a fair quality product for the price, was I wrong! First of all it listed the item as a 10 piece set, only 5 Containers and 3 lids. I think that makes 8. Missing the two lids basically turns the container into a bowl. Also, the lids themselves are very flimsy and do not fit the containers well. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't put liquid in them!","review":"I decided it was time to clear out all my mismatched storage containers and bought a few sets of Pyrex...and immediately wished I hadn't! The first thing I used it for was cut veggies and I put some water in with them to keep them fresh. I went to put it in the fridge and the water started pouring out the side! I thought maybe I hadn't closed it right, but sure enough I had and it is just NOT sealed tight! And they are ALL like that!Fine if you want something to just store overnight, but don't expect these to keep food fresh or airtight and certainly don't expect them to hold liquids in!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I love these bowls because you can microwave them safely, they look nice on the table, and when you're done you just toss the lid on. Good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pyrex storage 10-piece set","review":"Again, I was so disappointed in the shipping of this product. The one quart bowl had a chip taken out of it on the rim of the bowl. Again, this bowl had to be damaged before it was mailed, because there was no broken glass in the paper that it was wrapped it. Why, someone would ship it in the condition it was in. I didn't mail the package back, it would be more trouble than it was worth. i just threw the bowl out.

Great buy, would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pyrex is awesome","review":"I got my first pyrex set as a gift from my mom when I moved into my first apartment in a new city after college. I have been in love ever since. Pyrex is perfect for a busy single lady on the go. I would go from fridge to microwave or stove on those busy days, sometimes just grab a container of leftovers for my lunch on my way out the door. Perfect for the all nighters when you need to pop something in the oven and work while it cooks. Pyrex is just so convenient not to mention safer than plastic when using the microwave (I use a wet paper towel instead of the plastic top). One thing to note when using pyrex in the stove: do not heat above 450 or use on broil, the glass could possibly break. I have never had this happen to me. I still have the set from my mom which was 7 years ago, the whole set with no missing pieces or broken ones. I just like to buy more for variety of shapes and sizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help...How do you get the lids on?","review":"Just purchased the 5 pc. pyrex storage set but what is the point of glass vs. plastic if I can't get the lid on?

Glad this is just a test otherwise all contents would be spilled out and I still don't have the lid on, have tried all 5 pieces and they are all the same..I need a pyrex pry bar to get them on..will probably send them back if I don't find a solution.

They're great for sauces or just a cup or two of leftover rice.I did find that the circular lids had more trouble fitting over the container, but once you get them on (and stretched out a bit) it goes on a bit easier.

You get 5 containers and an extra microwave lid. I have found them to have a good seal while i'm carrying pasta or stew in my backpack. I still put a plastic bag around them just in case though. The only reason that I'm only giving 4 stars is because the lids are sometimes difficult to put on, you just have to figure out the right technique.

Its difficult to remove them but yet they don't do their job at securing it tight.

They really are much better than plastic. The only complaint that I have is that the bottoms of the containers aren't really rounded enough to fit inside one another for compact storage. I have found that when I stack same-size pieces together, they get stuck & have to be carefully pulled apart. I have chipped the lids of several pieces doing this. It is surprising that the manufacturer hasn't considered this, though the flat bottom does make for better bakeware. I now prefer to stack the smallest container inside the next larger size, and so on, then to stack these sets of three on top of one another, keeping the lids in a separate stack. This prevents the pieces from getting stuck together and having to be pried apart. I also think this method takes less space in the cabinet anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS.","review":"I am in LOVE with these dishes and the lids that come with them.

Given that these are for food storage this is a major concern. About a week after getting mine I cracked a lid taking it off a cold container.

They would get stained if you microwaved food in them and you could certainly not pop them in the baking oven. The sight was unseemly too. With Pyrex, I cook and serve in these and then just close the lid to store the leftovers and can warm up the dish by throwing it in the regular oven or microwave the next day depending on the dish. They come out clean from the dishwasher, not all scratched and warped like plastic. Glass is one of the safest materials to store food in, superior to any kind of plastic. And of course, they will last longer too which helps save the environment. My plastic containers had to be thrown out after every 6-8 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Plastic","review":"This set of pyrex glass containers with covers is great.

You would be better served saving your money and investing in a far superior documentary series like the expertly assembled boxed set of the classic (and, in my opinion, the finest WWII documentary series ever made), Thames Television's \\"The World at War\\" or the more recent alternative, \\"BBC History of WWII\\"--both remarkable in content and depth and far more engaging for the armchair historian or casual viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cursury look","review":"As the other review mentioned, this DVD set is available at Ross for 3 or 4 dollars. Even then it is not worth it. I'm a World War buff and the way this set glosses over important events with a sentence or two bothers me. To say things along the lines of \\"Meanwhile, the fighting continued in North Africa\\" does not cut it.

Simon of Beauvallet pushed and fought his way from lowly beginnings to the height of the realm, but the beauties of the land could melt his heart so he was called Simon the Coldheart behind his back.A different style for Heyer in that this effort does not have the snappy dialogue of her Regency works, but it does fit the period. All the other features are present with a tight plot, crisp and knowledgeable descriptions of the customs and above all the power of the woman who can melt a cold heart.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Heyer's best","review":"In the early 1400s, the illegitimate son of a lord forces himself into service for his father's greatest rival and rises through the ranks to knighthood. At some point he meets a noble lady who is his prisoner, and they somehow become a couple.I started this book and gave it 70 pages or so but didn't finish it. I bounced off it hard. The introduction said Ms. Heyer did not want this early novel republished and I can see why. Simon's the best at everything--everything, no matter how improbable--except emoting or feeling any kind of fondness whatsoever for his fellow humans. It got old very quickly, and I wasn't interested in hanging around long enough to see him somehow manage to fall in love and become a better person."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my two all-time favorite books!","review":"(My other favorite is Charlotte's Web, by E.B.White, which is of course totally different from Simon the Coldheart!) Most of Georgette Heyer's books are set in Regency England, and she herself did not consider \\"Simon\\" to be one of her best efforts, asking that it not be re-printed. I am glad her kids got together and decided to re-print \\"Simon\\" because it is a totally unique blend of medieval life, adventure, romance, and character studies. Simon himself is a larger-than-life hero who walks straight through the front door and into the reader's memory for a lifetime! As my 10-year-old daughter observed when she read it, \\"Mom, I love this book! That Simon's a man and a half!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Heyer want this book published?","review":"Georgette Heyer wrote so many wonderful books that I recommend you skip this one, unless you are trying to read the whole oeuvre or are a serious scholar of the progress of her writing style. It is set in medieval times (as is her unfinished and rarely read history, Lord John) and her gift for dialog and characterization seems to be lost beneath the weight of the armor. If I remember right, according to her biography, The Private World of Georgette Heyer, this book was an early effort which she did not wish to be published. Instead, go on to one of her other novels. For mysteries, I recommend Blunt Instrument or Who Killed the Butler; for romances, any of the historical ones. And if you are new to Miss Heyer's work, you have many blissful hours ahead of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her era...","review":"I am a devoted fan of Georgette Heyer, and have read a couple of her suppressed books--which number about six, all from her early publishing period, before she found her 'voice'. This was among the suppressed titles, but her husband decided to republish it after her death. I think her judgment on the matter was better, unfortunately.Heyer started publishing at age nineteen, and 'Simon' is obviously juvenilia. Sometimes embarrassingly so--c.f. Simon's affection for small boys (!) and the fact that he falls in love with the putative heroine only after seeing her in male garb. (!!) And unfortunately, the middle ages is not her era. The dialogue is heavy and not particularly realistic--far from her witty efforts in the Regency books.There is the occasional good scene that suggests Heyer's future triumphs--such as Simon's encounter with his father. But for the most part, this book should have stayed in the obscurity to which Heyer consigned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I love things that makes life a little easier.

Shipping was relatively quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what they say","review":"I got these sooner than it said, and then when i got them out, they didnt have the bag they said was with it, and then one pair the hinges were in different spots and they sit crooked on my face, and one pair the arms were so bent that they sit way off on the left of my face, the one pair that had good frames, the lens ended up cracking after about three hours of having them for no reason. i am hoping that i can bend frames and pop out lenses to make up at least one good pair of glasses"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont like it","review":"I honestly do not like these. I thought they would be great, but they are really just junk. My 9 bucks are wasted on this and i do not feel like returning them. I guess for some people they like them for style. If you are huge in to aviators then you might like these but I have had aviators that are not as cheap as this one. So i spent the money and went out brought me a pair of SpiderWire sunglasses for fishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"They arrived earlier than predicted, glasses are in good condition, wore them for a drive, they feel comfortable, and they do a really good job dimming the sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic value, great sunglasses!","review":"I bought these for an event for myself and several friends, and it was great! We all enjoyed wearing these, they were cheap, and they are relatively durable. The coating does tend to come off if you scratch them, but it's that way with most mirrored glasses. You really can't beat the price on these--and you can order a whole bunch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"not the tightest glasses i've had, but for the price they're worth it. in fact, i'm not sure if my last pair was so crappy but these seem very very dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonable Quality and Great Price","review":"Received this within a couple of days of ordering. Pretty much everything fits together nicely and the power supply is fairly quiet. I couldn't get my new Intel m/b to boot, but it turned out to be memory probably not the power supply, so I had to open/close install/reinstall the m/b several times during trouble shooting. No issues, other than the spacers under the m/b needed to be used -- which I didn't catch the first time.Installing the mATX board was slightly tricky, but no contortions were needed. The metal case material isn't the heaviest I've seen, but does hold up to multiple installs as I mentioned. Only the one side comes off, with two thumb screws in the back holding it in-place. The front panel snaps off/on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Arthritis Exercise Book","review":"I purchased the book The Arthritis Exercise Book at Amazon,It is a used book,it looks almost new. It is just what I wanted on the subject of exercises for arthritis. I also like that it is not so big that you can quickly find what you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"It was too flimsy! and it doesn't look anything like the picture. not even the color! I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Insightful","review":"This book provided great insight into the challenges encountered on the mission field. The information about the Caste system and its powerful influence on the culture was eyeopening. Even though this book was written many years ago, it still is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent High-Level Sino-U.S. Perspective","review":"For those whose circles don't include the halls of power in Washington and Beijing, Patrick Tyler's \\"A Great Wall\\" offers a valuable historical perspective and background information. As Tyler makes clear in his concluding chapter, understanding the complexities of the U.S.-Chinese relationship since the Communist victory in 1949 will be of critical importance to the next U.S. administration, which will have to deal with such key issues as Taiwan. \\"A Great Wall\\" makes an excellent companion piece to Nicholas Kristof's and Sheryl WuDunn's \\"China Wakes\\" (Vintage Books, 1994). I recommend this work to those with a casual interest in China and to those who are just beginning their quest for knowledge about the Sino-U.S. relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ho-hum account","review":"Some interesting nuggets here and there of new information that Tyler has turned up, but otherwise most of the info here can be found elsewhere. Tyler falls into the trap that most NYT journalists fall into: that is they exaggerate in order to increase drama and tension in their narrative. This unfortunately fudges facts and leads readers who are not well-versed in the subject with possibly mistaken impressions. There are better books out there on China to read like \\"About Face\\" by Mann so why waste time with this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed feeling","review":"I view this book with mixed feeling. I felt the book is good originally, that's the only possible channel I could learn from, until one day, I heard the interview of the author from radio PBS, that gives me a feeling he is qualified as hollywood movie conductor. his account of his experience full of drama exagration but self-contradicting. The way he describes XinJiang border escape but his editor-in-chief could call him to finish a draft, about his explaination of why Beijing municipal government does not allow resident to raise big dog (I'm sure he know the offcial saying but not willing to tell, to ruin American's expected answer). In one sentence, his choice of words is tricky enough to misguide naive Americans who never take enough time to understand other countries but quick at reaching conclusions.This in turn, raises my suspicion on the way history is unfold in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boorishly bureaucratic and mud-slinging","review":"Spasmodically researched, abominably written, and distastefully biased, Tyler's \\"Great Wall\\" is a slog of a read. Its deeply cynical portrayal of every public figure, its boorish recounting of each private squabble, together with its complete lack of historical proportionality, all make it well worth missing. Profoundly disappointing.--Of Special Note: Kissinger fans, beware!---Tyler's malignant portrayal of Kissinger easily rises to the level of vendetta, dominating the largest portion of the book. The statesman \\"weasles\\" and snakes his way across the pages, ending finally as the author's own epithet. Offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS GOLD!!!","review":"All I can say about this 4 cd filled with timeless music is; Everybody should have one copy home!

It has a cushiony footbed and was comfortably thick, warm and dry while skiing. It also has a cushion on the shin for the ski boots. The fabric content is 50% acrylic, 25% wool, 16% nylon, and 9% olefin. I would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Wigwam, you'll go warm & comfy!","review":"So glad I bought these for my son in time for the big snows we had over here this year. He loves them & wears them around the house too. Wigwam has some of the best socks & they are the only winter/hiking socks i buy for my family. Simply great socks. No stretching, no balls, just don't put them in the dryer, they may shrink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good in person","review":"I've bought some jewelry online in the past that doesn't look as good in person.

Easy to install, but with the 3rd Generation iPod installed in the dock, could not control the iPod with the Denon AVR-588 Remote. It would, however, start playing on its own for a few seconds and then stop. The front of the receiver did display Remote iPod, but couldn't control it. The 4th Generation didn't work either. Plan to return this and get the ASD-11R instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality item","review":"The dock worked OK with my Denon 2808 for about 1 month and then just stopped working at all. The receiver can not communicate with the dock and does not get the signal from the iPod. Piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst equipment I ever bought","review":"Simply doesn't work.I connected to my Dennon 3808 and can't see videos and the sound couldn't be worst.Useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good prodcut - works fine","review":"I connected this dock to Denon 2808CI AVR, with ipod mini, works fine.It could able to display ipod playlist and song on HDTV (text only) connected via HDMI(1.3).it lets you to select songs with remote.sond quality is good. but i would prefer not to keep ipod in dock when not used, cause it allways chages. Overall very good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works on older iPods, some issues with setup, great sound","review":"I hooked mine into a new DHT-487DV home theatre system. Followed guide and fiddled with Setup -> Inputs which recommended audio going to DVR component jacks--big mistake as to screwed up playback for the DVD player. Switched it to AUX audio and the conflicts disappeared. Excellant sound quality, especially on my 192kbps MP3s and better. Worked with 4GB Nano and 30GB iPod with Video. Navigation via remote tricky, with no skip-forward/backward or song display on receiver, but everything else works. Caveat: tech support informs me this unit not firmware upgradable and some functionality with newer iPod (9/2007 or later) lost--he recommended ASD-3N (networked) or ASD-3W (wireless networked) that is firmware upgradable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"As an person new to Wicca and Witchcraft this is a really good book but I am lucky enough to know other wiccans to help me out when I have questions.
