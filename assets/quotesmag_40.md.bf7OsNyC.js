The text also looked at many issues from just one side, rather than looking at the issues at hand from multiple perspectives.

I've lost so much on the two hard drives that I will never use another Sabrent enclosure again. E-mail Sabrent tech support with no response.

Just take the time to figure out the right places to screw your internal IDE HD into the case. If you're needing a create an external HD that will be constantly on, then consider a case with a built-in fan.Otherwise this case is perfect for the majority of users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enclosure for the price","review":"I was looking for an affordable enclosure for a hard drive I salvaged from an older computer. I found that for the price, this enclosure was perfect. It was easy to install and operate. So far I have not had any issues with the use of this enclosure. I must admit the overall construction is somewhat \\"economical\\" and appears to be delicate. However, for my purposes (the occasional backup of data and pictures) the unit works great. This was a perfect option that allowed me to salvage a 40 G hard drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage... Beware!","review":"Well, I just assembled this drive about ten minutes ago. I then plugged it up, and Vista recognized it immediately. Before I knew it, I was browsing all those files that I thought I had lost. I was elated! I thought to myself, \\"For only $18.99, I have recovered my data...\\" That thought was short-lived, since the drive came to a crashing halt just moments later. I don't know if I'll ever forget that \\"pop\\" and power down. I'm imagining that the data is all gone now, and, considering that it is five years' worth of data, I'll be beside myself if it is. I'm going to buy another 3.5\\" IDE to USB conversion kit to find out--you better believe that it will not be one from Sabrent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"problem of Power supply cable","review":"The power supply cable was not work.

I'd give zero star if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"I figured getting a cheap case would not be a problem but that was a mistake. I tried a 500gb and a 120gb drive with the case. They both work fine with another case that I own. They were both set to master and the drive light flashed green but neither drive would appear on either of my XP machines. I tried every other jumper setting to no avail. The front of the case is flimsy but I wasn't planning on moving it around a lot so that would have been irrelevant. The drive activity light is mounted on the same side as the cable connectors. Finally the cord from the case to the power supply is short so if the drive is on a desk the power supply dangles. Basically you have a weight hanging from the drive which will make it easy to pull off the desk when hit. I just sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work","review":"It looked OK when I took it out of the box. I've seen better, but looks shouldn't matter when it comes to need for transfering data from an old IDE drive to a new SATA internal drive. The problem is, it only worked for about a second until it just sat there doing nothing. I know I probably got a defective one, but haven't had the time to go about replacing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to close the cover back.","review":"This is my first enclosure. When i got it, i tried to open it. Finally i figured out how to open it. But when i tried to close it, the hard drive was stuck with the other cap and couldn't close it back. At the end, i broke the other cap and closed it then, it fit into the box.I was disappointed with this enclosure. No Shock absorbent. Inside the box, there are only two plastic slides to slide the hard drive into the box. It was pretty easy to slide the hard drive into the box but it was really hard to close the cap.It's not really good for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sabrent ECS-U35K Ultra Slim USB 2.0 3.5-in..","review":"Good for using ole HD backup, easy assembly, case look cheap but working good, money well spend.."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheep","review":"this product is the worst made enclosure i have seen. it doesnt go together right, the screws are to short, but for the price i guess what can u expect; at least it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Choice","review":"I bought this hard drive enclosure because I had an old 3.5\\" IDE Western Digital Hard Drive that couldn't be used internally in my new computer that uses SATA connections. So far it seems that I made a good choice to help me convert the old hard drive to an external hard drive. The directions for assembling the enclosure around the hard drive weren't very clear, but then again you really don't need the directions either. It took less than five minutes to put it together.It comes with everything you need including the power cord and the USB 2.0 cable. Just plug everything in, flip the power switch on the enclosure on, and your computer should read the drive.One warning, this enclosure doesn't have a cooling fan, so it's not meant to be left on all the time. Just turn it on when you're using it and turn it off when done."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"This enclosure stopped working after less than a year. The hard drive still works if connected through another way, but the enclosure will no longer supply power. The hard drive barely fits inside, and the assembly is annoying with all of the additional steps to hide screws with a cover that you have to screw on (showing the screws). Normally I ignore reviews like this, but this was a pretty poor product. If you get this, ignore the instructions to set the hard drive as slave and set it as single. It should work that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"HD Enclosure","review":"It took longer to remove the shipping tape than it did to install the drive. Easy. Nice! Saved me money and a lot of grief. I plan to buy at least two more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal. Enough with the jumper controversy!","review":"This is a great deal for the price. The thing I liked most, was the ease of drive installation. My previous enclosure was from MadDog, and it was a bitch to install the drive. This Sabrent model has a very simple and clever design. It appears to flimsy at first, but once the drive is in, and the screws are in, it's fine.There are so many differing reviews about how to set the jumper! The instructions say Master. Some people say this doesn't work. Some people say it's the ONLY way to get it to work. My guess is, it depends on the particular hard drive people are using. My drive was already on Cable Select, when I took it out of my old enclosure. I left it on CS when I put in this one, and it works fine.I was a little disappointed when I opened the box, and discovered that the flimsy stand was broken. But a drop of super glue solved that problem. All in all, you can't go wrong with this for a measly (...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"USB","review":"I spent several hours trying to get this product to work and kept getting error saying \\"unknown USB device\\".

Luckily I had an extra USB cord other wise I would never had solved this problem. The USB cord was completely defective!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works but No Support","review":"I've had this for a few months and it works with Windows 2000 and XP. I just plugged in an IDE drive and Windows recognizes it. The case seems to be made of light aluminum. With the hard drive mounted, the metal side of the drive comes in contact with the case. I imagine that is for heat transfer as there are no ventilation holes in the enclosure.There is a small set of instructions that cover installing the drivers, but it's not needed unless you are using Windows 98. There are no pictures or instructions for installing the hard drive in the enclosure. The encloser is a little tight for everything, but if you are careful pushing all the wires inside, it goes together okay. The manufacture's name is non-existent on the box or instructions and no URL is present for web support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made piece of junk.","review":"This enclosure is poorly made, drives don't fit well so they slide around, the connections are poor, the cables are too short, the top doesn't fit properly and has to be taped down, and before long, it won't even turn on.

PURE JUNK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected","review":"For a cheapo drive enclosure, this seemed to work fine. The hardware is clunky and you have to work hard to get the drive situated and the back cover on, but worth the discount. Note, there are two size screws in the bag: one smaller size for holding the hard drive in place via side screws (hidden behind the plastic side panels), and another larger size to secure the backplate. Also I had to futz around with the jumper settings to get it working. I have a couple of Wester Digital IDE drives. When I set the jumper to master I got 'This device cannot start. (Code 10)' when I plugged it in. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the XP drivers (not from the disk, from Windows) a few times with the same result. Switching the jumper to slave cause the XP computer to not recognize it, but then when I switched the jumper to 'CS', XP recognized it as a Western Digital drive (before it said it was a generic USB mass storage device) and it has been working great since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Quality, Excellent Value","review":"This is a good quality, extruded aluminum drive enclosure. If you have ever installed a hard drive in a computer before, it should take no more than 5 or 6 minutes to assemble this. There may have been installation instructions, but they went unread -- it's pretty intuitive.Windows XP automatically detected and configured the new drive as soon as it was plugged in. Like any new hard drive, don't forget to go into go into Disk Manglement and format the drive before trying to save data to the new disk.The external drive has been in use for about 5 months now and has performed flawlessly. And the fact that this is a USB 2.0 device means that the throughput is pretty decent.I'd buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"First one was bad, second worked just fine","review":"The first unit I ordered was defective. The IDE hard drive ribbon cable was torn half way off the connector and there was a loose plastic piece that had fallen off. Fortunately Amazon returns are easy and the second unit worked just fine.This doesn't do anything to quiet the HD and it can get pretty warm so I wouldn't recommend using it all the time, but if you just need to temporarily use an external drive this unit is ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"I purchased this to add a backup USB drive to my larger myWorld Book NAS and it worked just fine. I had a 160 GB drive lying around and it worked perfectly when I installed it in the enclosure. Installing the hard drive is easy and shouldn't be a struggle for anyone that's ever dealt with hard drives before. The vertical base I received is different than the one pictured but it too works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Returned to Life.","review":"My late brother's external hard-drive had, what I thought died, and I thought I lost all of our memories. However, upon realizing it was the casing itself which I had shorted I immediately bought this product.

Got a new machine but it was not IDE compatible, so I bought this device from Amazon (free delivery). I am happy so far, it attends my requirements, it was pretty easy to mount and put HD in device, no need to use the small CD, windows XP (laptop) and vista (desktop) recognized on first connection. I am avoiding to leave this device turned on for long periods, but I forgot to turn off one night and it was not too hot next morning, so heat does not seem to be a problem. As long as you follow the short installation instructions, you should be fine.Product picture has only comestic difference in the device base, but its nothing to worry about.Only problem is that I would need to buy two devices to avoid switching/installing HDs each time I need one of them. :P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but could be much better","review":"One of the threaded inserts (in one of the two enclosures I bought) wasn't threaded, so I could only put one screw in to hold the front plate to the enclosure. The instructions didn't say that the screw holes to mount the drive were covered by a slide-in extruded plastic strip, so it took me awhile to find how to fasten it in. During the several hours of formatting, the case got really hot--almost too hot to touch; but, this shouldn't be a problem in my application since it won't be powered except when I'm adding files. All in all, a pretty poor design & implementation--but, it was cheap & it does work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sabrent USB PATA Hard Drive enclosure works well","review":"This hard drive enclosure was easy to use and operate even though the instructions were brief.

My drive would not fit inside and still let the thing close. I dealt with it by using some masking tape around the gap for a while.Then my computer kept losing the connection. I would get constant errors, and iTunes was having fits. I though my hard drive was bad. But I put it into another enclosure and it worked. Which means this thing was not only mechanically bad, it was electrically bad too.You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works on the first try","review":"I had a problem with a dead XP computer, which refused even to boot from a CD. I had to save some files from a hard drive, and was ready to give up, when a friend suggested this device. So, I've removed the hard drive from a computer, made sure what type it is (it was inside a Gateway computer bought in 2002) and purchased this enclosure from Amazon. When enclosure arrived, it was very easy to figure out how to put a hard drive in it -- it was a fool proof procedure, there is only one way to do it) and then I've switched it on and connected to my new iMac running Leopard OS. The device comes with a small CD with drivers, but I did not use it, and did not install anything on iMac. The iMac immediately recognized the new drive, and I was able to copy my files from there, which is well worth the price! Because of the old formatting, originally the drive was read-only. Using Mac OS's Disk Utility I've re-formatted the drive, and now it is read/write. That was easy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised.","review":"I purchased this product because I had a couple of 3.5\\" HD's laying around and figured I would get some use out of them.

Michael Finkel is truly at the bottom of the barrel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful to be alive","review":"I read this book 5years after the fact, having seen a 48hours rerun tv report on the crime story and interview with the author. I highly recommend this book and found myself not wanting to put it down. That the author had a direct connection to Chris Longo allowed me get a better grasp of the human connection weaved within these inhumane events. After reading this book, I constantly find myself thinking of the victims and the family's struggles the months prior to their murders and pray that they are at peace. Reading this book allows you the opportunity to look within and take if even a moment to be thankful of just being alive. A must read for those interested in reading crime, mystery and psych thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly engaging","review":"True Story is engaging, well-written, and a real page turner. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Serving","review":"This book is about a murderer's theft of the author's identity to help him escape police apprehension. The author makes much of this fact,seeing himself as a victim, but an account I read of the actual murders has no mention of the author, nor does it need any for the purpose of telling its story.Nor is the author a very sympathetic character, having announced at the beginning of the book that he has been fired for fictionalizing a news story for the New York Times. (a practice becoming more and more popular, it seems)My main complaint, however, is that the book is just not that interesting unless you're fascinated by the inner workings of a journalist's mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought \\"True Story\\" was ponderous ,egoitistic and much too long.The philosophical musings were poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book was about the Christian Longo murders","review":"Apparently no one cared to hear Michael Finkel's excuses for his fraudulent story in the NY Times and therefore he decided to slip it into a a horrendous murder story that would catch peoples attention. I was expecting to read the true story of the Christian Longo murders not whining from Michael Finkel over his firing. I did not learn of anything about Christian Longo or his trial that wasn't already covered in the newscasts on TV from this book. I still don't think Mr. Finkel gets it! Readers don't like having the wool pulled over their eyes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"True Story: Murder, Memoir, Mea Culpa","review":"Micheal Finkel wrote a story portraying honesty and true memoir from only the murderer! It is written with the lies and deceit from Christian Longo who is a liar and con man as proven in court. He should have portrayed the truth about Mary Jane and her three beautiful children. Christian was too proud to accept public assistance for his family but he certainly was not to proud to accept a public defender in order to save his own worthless self! Micheal Finkel made an enormous amount of money on this book and has yet to offer one red cent to the family who went into great debt to bury the family Christian murdered. I am sure Christian gets something in return for the story. How right is that? I hope Mike Finkel writes the story on The Death of Christian Longo. May he really have a story to tell about suffering and pain while he waits for the lethal injection that kills him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Story -- in so many ways","review":"One can only hope that with this mea culpa Michael Finkel finds the personal and professional redemption he seeks and can return to his chosen profession as a journalist.For the devotee of crime novels, True Story will be a hit because of the insightful way the author relates the criminal's actions and character, or lack of it. For the journalist, teacher, reader, True Story provides hours of thought provoking prose.Finkel is a superb writer. His style brings the best of literary journalism and investigative reporting to a story that has more grist than any novel. He is confessional but not whiny, philosophical but not self-indulgent. The complexity of the characters and the flaws they share keep the reader attached and involved from the very first page. It's not light reading, but once you start, make a pot of coffee because you won't want to put it down, and no matter what hour you finish it you'll lie awake pondering its implications."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet surprise","review":"John is HIV+, and with the new drug cocktails and his new workout regiment, he's finding himself with a hot new look and attitude toward life. He and his boyfriend having a falling out, and John unleashes himself into the party culture. His boyfriend realizes he still wants John, and begins to change his own behavior in the hopes of getting John back. I didn't expect much from this romance novel, but I was pleasantly surprised to find how intelligent the commentary on gay culture is. Outland's book is a joyful, smart, fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. Return this book to the shelf.","review":"I was really disappointed with this novel. The characters were paper thin and the dialogue was so unrealistic, tedious and boring. The author spent a whole page having two characters discuss the ingredients of those GNC supplements. How boring. The plot was uneven but at the same time predictable. I won't pick up another Outland novel. I was half way through this book before I realized I had read one of the authors murder mysteries which was just as disjointed as this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have read in a long time","review":"This book was terrible. I am glad I checked it out from the library. I knew it was bad when I had finished half of the book and skipped to the end, realized that it wasn't going anywhere and returned it. The writing is horrible. The characters were flat, and very uninteresting. The plot was contrived and to be honest I really didn't care what happened to the main character. (Well, I was hoping for a grisly accident, a shooting from a jealous ex-lover, ANYTHING that might make the book exciting. Alas, that was not to be. It seemed like he made some of the characters historians, but they acted in stereotypical manner and didn't seem to know all that much about history. A little research and character development goes along way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud","review":"This truly is the dud of the year. Everyone who says this is not \\"great literature\\" certainly got that right. This isn't any kind of novel. Full of cliches, a stupid and uneven plot (not to mention simplistic and incredibly unbelieable), and no sexual incidents to titilate the only person who would want to read this book. Mr. Orland needs to stick to his even worse mysteries. At least those are clichic already. Mr. Publisher, please, please spare us from another Orland novel, I beg you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Yeah!","review":"The title says it all -- this author is out to get your money. If you don't like that...well, you know the rest, honey. I agree with the previous reviewer who rated this 1-star, and for all the right reasons. This book is a phenomenally negative and juvenile work, certainly not worth the time for people who read books. There is too much \\"been there, done that\\" about this book, and not enough plot for more than a short story. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desire for love, love of desire","review":"I can't believe that that this book is presently ranked at 3 and 1/2 stars. While I realized that it wouldn't be Kafka, it was a frightening book even for fluff. It actually makes the perfect companion for the more academic book \\"The Elusive Embrace\\". The idea of \\"desire for love, love of desire(lust)\\", which is explored in \\"The Elusive Embrace\\", is perfectly illustrated in this shallow tale of modern gay existence. It is nauseating how often the protagonists gloats that now, \\"cured\\" of AIDS, he is gorgeous and can be both object and subject of desire. He abandons his boyfriend, who had cared for him when he was sick, and embarks on a joyride of drugs and sex. While the nicely packaged ending sees the protagonist return to his old flame, it's sad that Harrison has to work out and buy new clothes in order to win back his old boyfriend. The book extols materialism and appearances over virtue and scoffs at the threat of AIDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and poorly written","review":"I was very dissapointed by what started off as an interesting premise. The characters are all self-centered, boorish, immature, and predictable. One friend described this book as \\"light and fluffy\\" while I say it's not worth wasting any time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Overrated","review":"This is a book for a very particular gay audience of which Iwas not one. The book begins in one light-hearted direction, gets toochatty by half, finds itself too cute for words much too often, and has virtually no payoff. Mr. Orland has a gift for realistic but meaningless gay chit-chat, tired philosophies about gay culture (nothing has changed in 50 years apparently), cruel stereotyping (particularly of fag hags, men over 30 and boys under 22), and humor which is far from funny. Also annoying is all of the talk about sex yet very little description of it. In some respects Orland parodies many of the 60's and 70's gay authors -- Rechy, Merrick, and Porter -- but certainly does nothing to advance this genre to a new level. I began to hate the main characters by the end of the book and truly hoped they would have to pay a realistic price for all of their carousing and bitchery. Alas, the price was the price of this awful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this!","review":"I love this product. So easy to use and clean. Definitely worth the money.

I think it is helpful to learn why we procrastinate in order to understand these behaviors and then change them. I recognized myself in so many of the sample situations desribed and the explanations behind such actions.The second part contains a lot of helpful techniques, such as breaking a big project into more manageable chunks, or deciding to work on one chapter of a book at a time that needs to be finished.I really have to reread the second part though (What to Do About [Procrastination]) because I unfortunately haven't changed my habits yet. (In fact, I should be working right now but I'm writing this review.) So until then I can't really say if it helps or not, but Part one was eye opening to me.

Fighting- it is a fighting game, but boy do the computer have some cheats and can get you frustrated. This unique fighting system of just smashing buttons gives you the cramps and blocking does not exist, its more like dodging and believe me you get hit a lot but your enemies can block.2. Graphics/music- really good but if the game is so frustrating what does it matters?3. Storyline- Its allright, you got to complete a series of missions4. Over all Fun Factor- you only get one to amax of three points to built your character fighting power and defense, it takes long, the missions can be frustrating and at the end it seems like no matter how tought you built your character it still sucks...Golem can be very dificult. If you find getting your finger and forearms tired then you will find this fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLY (CENSORED)!!!!","review":"I never heard of this game before until my homeboy mentioned how it was a mixture of Def Jam: Fight for NY & Tekken. It came in the mail and I been playing it ever since. There are codes to unlock all of the characters (Including Tekken's very own Marshall Law & Paul Phoenix) but nothing to make the fights any easier. The special moves aren't what you think they are, but they will help when others are jumping on you. The combos are wild depending on your character's fighting style.

It is full of errors and written with a dryness only a military procedure can match. It reads like a procedure to support systems training... another military wonder... and I bet this text was once used in training soldiers to become instructional designers.

We wanted a printer for one of the execs, that printed and scanned documents quickly. It has been working great for the money, until this week (May 19, 2008). All of a sudden, when we print a document, it would just spread ink onto the paper, instead of printing. We have only used HP ink cartriges, and we tried cleaning and deep cleaning with the HP Tool box. We even talked with the HP online support for an hour. They couldn't suggest a solution to the problem, either. So now it is a piece of junk, and I am shopping for a new printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but Noisy","review":"My first impression, after running several of the operations available with this printer, was that it is well worth what I paid for it. The photo copy, document copy, and regular printing were all high quality and completed in an exceptable length of time. I haven't tried making labels on CDs/DVDs yet, but it's a nice option to have available. One thing worthy of note is that you can only make 4X6 (or 5X7) photos. Software installation took a little longer then expected, but the overall setup was very easy. In my opinion, the only negative thing about this machine is the LOUD noises it makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good printer","review":"The ink cartridges shipped with the unit lasted a few pages (3 days), but I had purchased additional cartridges so alls well.

First, it installs three different copies of the printer, and defaults to a random copy. Several times a day, I am having a \\"HP Photosmart C5200 series (2) installed\\" pop up in my taskbar. At random times, I am not able to print at all, or I have installation menus pop up requesting me to reinstall using the CD. Since installation, I have noticed a significant slowdown on my computer; this printer allocates a great deal of memory and never releases it. This printer is a nightmare - don't get anywhere near it.That being said, if you've already have it and are stuck with it, it does print cleanly and fairly quickly. The scanner is decent, very good for the price. Copier works great. So as long as you don't mind an on-again off-again printer, this is a good one.

The printer itself is fine but the HP Networking software is buggy and causes error messages when you shut down Windows (both XP and Vista).I tried the Email support and went round and round with them. Their solution was to uninstall then reinstall the software. When that didn't work, their next suggestion was to uninstall then reinstall the software. When that didn't work they had me download a software update, then uninstall and reinstall the software.

Glad to see it didn't work.If the thing worked like it was supposed to, I'd guess I'd be pretty happy. Guess it's back to shopping.UPDATE: Although it didn't have the capability to print to CD's, I ended up going with the C5180 instead. Network ready! That held more importance than being able to print to discs. No issues installing it, and so far it's working great. Wish I'd gone with this one instead of the 5280 right from the get-go.

I need to print at least 2 test pages before the colors print correctly, which wastes A LOT of ink. The scanner is worthless. The only positive feature is the ability to print on DVDs, but again I need to print test pages before I can get a simple black and white label. If I don't, the labels come out purple or pink. This is the last HP color print I will EVER buy. Don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last HP printer. Ever.","review":"Short and simple, the (Windows XP) drivers for this device are garbage and have not been updated to fix numerous layout problems. In addition the interface is far less than intuitive. If you want to print anything other than 4x6 photos and 8x11 paper, forget it. Next time I'll buy something else. Anything else. HP has gone so far downhill lately I refuse to spend another dollar on their printers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for light user.","review":"Although the basic functions of the printer is not so bad for personal use, if you print substantial amount of paper for work or study, you should choose another one. The price of the machine itself appear to be reasonable, yes, is reasonable, however, ink is very expensive. I regret to realize this HP's scheme of business after buying one. And, it does not work well when you try to print both side of paper.I will never \\"buy American\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in HP Photosmart","review":"Unless they have improved substansially, I would not put big bucks into an HP Printer. My Photosmart C4180 seems to have croaked after only two years and moderate use. It wants to think that it is out of paper, but it is not. I have followed all the steps on HP Website to fix this problem, and none work. Also, had Online Chat which directed me back to Website.Final suggestion on Website was to have machine \\"serviced\\". I think we all know what this means...\\"Forget about it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"If amazon reviewers give it 3 stars, trust it!","review":"It was the first day using it and it created nothing but problems. I decided to go ahead and get it at the store even though amazon reviewers gave it an average 3 stars because it was a decent all-in-one printer for the price. I'd had problems with HPs in the past but only after a year or two and I think these printers are disposable anyway.Well this d--- thing ruined 10 sheets of holiday paper. If you buy it, don't print a big job and walk away. Stick around so it doesn't create a garbled mess on the paper! I am returning this today because if it has problems down on the first day, who knows if it will last 90 days. It also slows the computer down with all of its software.Epson annoyed me with all of the cartridges you had to buy. So now I'm onto my second brand I think - Kodak or Canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hummer of Ink Consumption","review":"Buyer Beware! I bought this printer new, had to junk it as total loss and buy a different model. The six tiny ink cartridges in HP's Vivera Ink Sets run out constantly in staggered rotation. After first few print jobs, you cannot print a 50 page document without replacing at least one of the tiny ink cartridges. Costly and very annoying! (Also, a Hummer-sized environmental disaster, considering all the plastic packaging.) Grrrr! This is not a true \\"all-in-one.\\" It is a \\"photo-only\\" printer and basically useless for documents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeff's Disappointment","review":"I was really excited to get the HP Photosmart C5280 All-in-one printer. Much to my dismay when I opened it up, it didn't have a cable to hook up to the printer. I think there should be a law of CLEARLY stating what comes with the product and what doesn't. There was NOTHING on the website regarding this lack of cable included. I ended up paying another $35.00 for this product. I thought it was deceitful advertising both from Amazon and the vendor they use to fulfill this order. I have been a victim of bait and switch - when I complained to Amazon, they turned and went running for the hills. They totally blamed the vendor - way to stand behind your product and image. I am only one voice, but I will choose to take my business elsewhere.Sincerely,Jeff"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good, I'm buying a second printer","review":"The price of this all-in-one is so good, that I've purchased a second for my house. I love the convenience of the 4x6 paper cartridge that I can leave photo paper in the printer all the time. The cartridges are much cheaper and seem to last longer than other printers that I have had. If I wanted a heavier-duty printer, I would pay more, but this printer has been incredible for the price. I also love just being able to walk up to the printer with my SD card and printing directly from it vs having to run thru the computer. Love this printer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ted S","review":"The installation was very simple. The quality of the photos printed on the unit is exceptional.

The simplicity of the copying function is great.Very happy with the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fine AIO printer","review":"I feel obligated to counter the bad reviews. This printer is just fine. I have used the scanner and copier several times to test it out and it is fast and quiet. The printer works just great: fast, quiet, crisp and clear. I use the cheapest paper I can buy as well as card stock for my jewel case covers and it works fine. I have been printing dozens of CD labels and I love it. I don't know what people are complaining about regarding the software but it installed seamlessly and is intuitive in its operation. I have not used the photo printing feature but that is not why I bought it. I have been using this printer for two months now and I am totally satisfied. I only print a modest amount in the scheme of things so if it is an ink-sucker, I can not say. I can say that in the two months of modest use, it has barely made a dent in the two cartriges that came with the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick Design - Mechanical Nightmare, Photosmart C5280","review":"The HP Photosmart C5280 has a nicely designed exterior, and provides an excellent human interface, with clearly labled buttons and color function screen. The real problem with this unit is its poor mechanical performance. I am surprized to read any positive reviews, and must draw the conclusion that either the reviewers did not use the printer over a long period, or I simply have a lemon. Problems:- Error message says \\"Print Cartridge Alignment Failed\\", CD and web site offer no solution for this failure.- Printer screen reads \\"Printer in Use\\", after print is complete and must be rebooted tp reset.- Absolutely eats print cartridges. They are expensive and very low volume.- If the unit is off for more than 48 hours you must \\"Clean Print Cartridges\\" or your printing will be spotty & incomplete.In conclusion I am going to trash this unit and buy an alternate make & model."},{"rating":"1","title":"lwoelfel@satx.rr.com","review":"Installation was very easy, however it could not do every thing I needed it to do. Could not print card envelopes, the user define feature was not complete. HP chat line was of no help in correcting this problem. Scanning was below average, printing a document was below average compared to a Epson. I returned the C5280 back to Best Buy and got another epson, I am very happy with my epson. I've owned Epson before, though I'd try HP, but that was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can try to kill it...it will not die!","review":"My last HP printer lasted about 5 years (and still worked pretty well when I upgraded), so I decided to go with the HP again.Came home a little tipsy one night, ran into my desk, sending the printer crashing onto the wooden floor and into pieces. Next morning put pieces back and it works good as new. These guys at HP are getting better at making some sturdy machines.Also, it prints nice.UPDATE: The scanner eventually stopped working. Maybe the fall hurt it, but it was about a year later and it hasn't been dropped, shaken, or bumped since. HP support not helpful. Some guy from India told me to buy a new one. So I did... but went with a Lexmark instead. It works great and the ink for the Lexmark is a lot cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good printer but the drivers suck","review":"Good printer but... the installer keeps running all the time on Vista and do you think I can find out how to fix it? The Installer Clean-up utility doesn't help. Very annoying.

It has given me excellent, dependable service over that time through many projects. As a singer-songwriter, I've used the CD printer to print professional looking labels directly on special CD's - over 600 - and it is still going strong.I am constantly copying, producing newsletters for school, church, and my husband's business. The extra-large ink refills really do cut down on trips to the store.My hobby is photography, mostly family, but some for my productions. The C5240 prints bright clear pictures and is easy to use but the change in HP ink in the last couple of years seems to have changed the colors a bit. I also find Kodak paper to print a more vivid picture on it.I think HP is the only one making a printer that prints on CDs. I should buy an extra just in case this one ever dies!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"This is the worst product I have ever seen -- everything is broken, software installation took years, nothing works, the bloatware is _very_ hard to use, .

I've spent well over 20 hours either uninstalling and then reinstalling software or trying to get support for this miserable product directly from HP. And, when I did get through to them, the HP phone support was useless. They had me do the same things their website suggested I do which I kept telling them hadn't worked. Problems ranged from errors when printing, no connectivity, no scanning capability, inability to update driver software, etc. In order to print or scan anything I've had to do it via a memory card. I'll never buy another HP product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS PRINTER!!!!","review":"I've had this printer for over a year now.

Printers have come a long way in just a couple years. It prints quietly and quickly with excellent quality.The CD/DVD printer option is a nice add-on not usully found in this price range.But the photo printer option is where this printer really excels. Pop in your memory card and the LCD screen will allow you to view, sort, and edit the photos on your disk. You can crop rotate and reduce red-eye, all on the printer itself. The photo quality isn't as good as a stand alone printer (I'm going to hold onto my Kodak Printer Dock for now) but it is certainly one of the better inkjets I've used.All-in-all, this printer does a lot for the $150 price tag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality all-in-one printer","review":"I basically use the printer for home and school works. I went to stores to really inquiry about its functions and features before placed an order on Amazon. This printer works well - prints very fast, scans documents and pictures clear and copies documents in seconds. I haven't used the CD/DVD label printing feature but this is one of the reason I selected HP C5280.

Have had it two month's now and have printed well over 5000 pages in color and b/w. I had the paper jam 1X and just removed the back cover and physically pulled it out. The ink level indicator must be calibrated for the smaller cartridges as it will print 200-300 more pages after it tells me the ink level is low. It does go through ink at a more rapid pace than my old 1610 did.Other than that, this thing has been a workhorse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"This printer worked alright for a couple of years, now it seems like I'm troubleshooting every time I want to print anything.

But I had to stray from them, didn't I?I always brush my thick, wavy, medium length hair before I wash it, and did no different this time, but after washing my hair it was a complete ratted, tangly straw-like mess.

While most long-time fans will have seen the action live, it will still increase their heart rates as they see their heroes perform once again. One other theme is the unique nature of the Packer franchise; it is publicly owned and is a not-for-profit. Furthermore, Green Bay is the smallest city hosting a major sports franchise in the United States, proving that success, even in sports, can have many forms.Even though I have watched these highlights many times before, the presentation still increased my blood pressure.

It's a short book, which is nice, Bradbury gives the fable without a lot of excess writing.There is something about the book that really drew me in while I was reading it. Maybe it was the wonderful black and while drawings that are scattered through the book, illustration various scenes. Maybe it was just the story itself, the story of a young boy who learns to think and feel with his heart and mind, and learns to fly with the help of a most unusual god.

His chart numbers for his second LP reflect this.Buble's voice is pure and truly made to sing this kind of music without making it boring. By choosing to remake the famous Nina Simone selection \\"I'm Feeling Good\\", Buble not only effectively remakes Nina Simone, but brings older, classic music to a younger audience as well as an older audience. While \\"Feeling Good\\" is the standout track, IT'S TIME features many great tracks including \\"Quando, Quando\\" feat. Nelly Furtado, \\"You Don't Know Me\\", and others. Great productions, great voice, excellent, 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not really time.","review":"According to this CD, it's time. But it isn't. I checked. This CD might be a liar.

It sells and that's all that matters. The deceased original artists are light years better but marketing magic has put Buble in everyone's faces. At some point, Buble will flame out through overexposure or the teeny boppers grow up. Buble represents why music is in such disarray through monopolistic practices that emphasize star making marketing over artistry, which retards the development of new sounds and talent. The day will come when people will toss their Buble, Brittany Spears, and Ashlee Simpson CDs in the trash heap wondering, \\"What was I thinking when I bought this schlock?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER GOT IT","review":"I DID NOT GET THE CD THAT I ORDERED.

After all the hype, I was expecting something really great, but Frank Sinatra leaves Buble in the dust (as does the rest of the ratpack). When I was listening to the CD, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was in some cheap hotel lounge. I kept expecting to hear the clinking and clanking of glasses and silverware during the music. I think this singer has some talent, but there is nothing special here so far that distinguishes him from every other lounge singer. I also did not like the female who did the duet with him. Her voice sounds kind of nasally to me, and I keep skipping over that song so I don't have to hear her.I mean, this CD is all right if you want some background music at a cocktail party or something, but it's not so great for just listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed, may have moments","review":"When you do songs that are associated with classic artists such as Frank Sinatra, you should at least try to surpass and transcend what came before. Mr. Buble really does not succeed. There are too many uncomfortable sequences within songs, where I felt he was \\"walking through it\\", rather than selling it. The album does have a shining moment. \\"You and I\\", known only to me as sung by Barbra Streisand, is a masterpiece of phrasing and restraint; what a cut!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Time","review":"Really disappointed.

The tempo, beat, cadence - all superbly done. His rich vocal tember renders the musical chords with a richness I've never heard before. If he had been Sinatra - Sinatra would have been alot more popular. While those of us from the older generation loved some of those songs, Mr. Buble represents them with a fresh new blending of passion and committment that Sinatra never had. Bravo Mr. Buble! When will the next album be out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift that keeps giving","review":"I was given my first Michael Buble self title cd as a gift and I found the his music to be very enjoyable. Having now purchased and played his newest offering \\"It's Time\\" over many times since, I am impressed even more with this young crooners cagey ability to put his own stamp/signature on every song. I've heard it said that if you can't recognize a singer's voice after only a few notes he or she won't make it. Well, Mr. Michael Buble is recognizable! And darned good!!From the first notes of Feeling Good to the last notes of You and I he's 'got you under his skin' for keeps.It's Time is a surefire hit all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Michael Buble's voice is amazing and his songs are great.

With all the tragedy our country is facing at the moment to play this cd and be taken far away is what I needed and what I yearned for. Beauty, kindness, happiness, compassion, love - those words all come to mind when I think of what this compact disc speaks of. When I turn off CNN or the local news here in Kansas that seem only to be filled with sad stories I turn on my cd player and get the lift I need to face another day.Music does move one's soul and lift one's spirit and this cd needs to be heard by the world at a time like this. It has given me pause to be thankful for what I have and to pray for so many others that face challenges unheard of in our time right here in our fine country. If the song Home doesn't touch all our collective souls now, nothing will..........."},{"rating":"2","title":"the sound for generations","review":"In an era of loosing the greatest generation at a rate of over 1000 per day. His music is simply energetic. The combination of big band sounds with the voices that we have loved to hear over the years brings the times when romance intermixed with the hardships of life made us look forward to Saturday nights with the crooners and divas of your. This modern day mix of music endears to me to the people that have made our lives what they are today-- Better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not To Be Missed","review":"I first heard of Michael Bublé from a friend of mine and I was immediately hooked and had to go out and buy this CD. His style is at once a throwback and completely new. He evokes Sinatra on \\"A Foggy Day,\\" \\" Save The Last Dance For Me\\" is a swinging number that always make me get up to dance and \\"Home\\" is just beautiful. This is a stronger, more assured album from his first release.I'm sure, in the years to come, Michael Bublé will become a major force in music. People are looking for something different yet assuring and Michael Bublé is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's time for the copy work","review":"Michael looks like a young Buddy Greco or Bobby Darin with this CD. Some great songs and interpretations like \\"Try a little tenderness\\". But why he has to copy and use Nelson Riddle arrangements? I think this CD was over-produced. Micheal's version of Quando, quando is terrible and sleepy. But still four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential for your collection","review":"thoroughly enjoyable cd from beginning to end with song styles and tempos that make the ride fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bright future for young song stylist...","review":"On the recommendation of a friend, I recently purchased the second CD, \\"It's Time,\\" of a young Canadian song stylist by the name of Michael Buble. Having a rather eclectic musical taste I didn't expect much from the CD, certain my friend had over-hyped it. Was I ever surprised! This is, without doubt, the single best CD that I have ever purchased. Buble's voice, his phrasing and the song selections on this CD make this a listening experience that should be shared with the world. I hope for nothing but great success and continued production from this rising star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeding my Expectations.","review":"Michael Buble's newest cd has exceeded even my high expectations!His energy and vocal styling is second to none and each trac showcases his amazing talent.The hit song named Home that Buble wrote is unquestionably Grammy consideration calibre.My rating for this cd is a full 5 Stars+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least Essential Album of 2005?","review":"There is simply no reason for this album to exist. It will be all over the bargain bins within a year. There is no added spark or anything but by-the-numbers arrangements-- it sometimes sounds like parody. Who will seek this stuff out in 5 years? No one. Buy the originals instead. Unless you like imitation swing like Rod Stewart-- then this is for you. If you'd like to hear Beatles songs with a jazz/swing twist, listen to John Pizzarelli Meets the Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get It's Time Right Away! It's like fresh air!!","review":"Best voice and best interpretations of classics I've heard in toooooooo long. The Buble take on the great American Songbook is flawless - no, he's not imitating the original artists he's updated them and with care and attention has given them a fresh new Buble feel and sound. It's Time is like a breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing","review":"What a releif to hear music that I can actually understand.Very nice, easy to listen to. I found the disc relaxing, like a hot shower or a good book. We may have lost Frank and Dean and others, but we still have some appreciation for that kind of music. Let's keep supporting this kind of music and maybe people will realize that Rap is not music, but just noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy listening","review":"This CD is great to listen to when you're in any type of mood.

I bought this primarily for \\"Home\\" which I love but play the entire CD over and over. His voice is mesmerizing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Aint Got That Swing","review":"This is my first Michael Bulé album. This guy has a great voice, but the arrangements and his phrasing are all plain vanilla and boring, in my opinion. This is the kind of music a middle-aged White woman who goes to the Meyerson hall in Dallas likes. I put this in the same category as Michael Bolton or Kenny G.In my opinion, it's all very formula, very predictable, and has no soul.This is the kind of act I'd expect at Disney World or a cruise ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great one","review":"After thoroughly enjoying the DVD/CD release, \\"Caught in the Act,\\" I also gave this CD a listen to by Buble, the second album of his that I have listened to. I have to give it 5 stars because I am very much impressed with and enamoured by Buble's emergence on the scene. He is a very capable vocalist and has given me a new perspective on what a jazz vocalist should sound like.In comparing this album to \\"Caught in the Act,\\" I would say that \\"Caught in the Act\\" is a better purchase. A lot of the songs on here are the same arrangements used on \\"Caught in the Act,\\" except these are the studio takes. I still think this is a great album, but being able to see Buble on the DVD was what made me get into his music. This album is a nice follow-up to \\"Caught in the Act,\\" and proves once again, that Buble is a great vocalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Michael vocal talent are so amazing, he sang every song in the album beautifully.

The sound and production are there but it seems they've taken a young man with a great voice and he has no real emotion to express.

The exercises often have the same issues. Contained a fairly substantial amount of vocab, most of which was correct.

The book is useless, but the publisher has cleverly tied the book and class to an even more user-hostile Moodle page, so instructors are march-stepped through the class by a pitiful text and an even worse website. The book is absolutely worthless, unless you already have a pretty firm grasp of the French language.It's also worth noting that access to the website will cost you another $80 and that will be the least fun you've ever had with $80, including the absolute worst dental appointment you've ever suffered.

Instead of innovative, original compositions, as in The Richest Man in Babylon (\\"All songs written and produced by Rob Garza and Eric Hilton...\\"), this CD is a compilation of other works (\\"Thievery Corporation would like to thank all of the artists who created this music\\"), as well as 1 rehash of the title tune from The Richest Man in Babylon.

(Anyone interested in the other ESL artists pickup the Modular Systems cd)The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars was there are a few points where the tracks catch you ear because they don't merge as well as the others.

This disc has a supurb mix job and each track blends seemlessly into the next, a great set for the summer! I'm giving this disc out to all my friends this summer. Several tracks are not all that new and if you are really into down tempo or chill music you will have heard at least 3 or 4 of these tracks on other comps.

It is technical but not beyond the average person's ability to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than Getting Started","review":"I've taken many EEG workshops in the last few years, but this book tops many of them. There is a lot more here than just Getting Started in Neurofeedback. It is a must read for those starting out as well as for those who want to review and brush up on the basic concepts. I found Demo's approach not only comprehensive, but he also illustrates his major points with specific case examples. The only thing I missed was a table of normative baselines of peak to peak amplitudes. But apart from that, this book is a wonderful gift to the beginning neurotherapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"No images","review":"Disappointing that there were no images -- graphs, diagrams, photos, etc. -- included in the Kindle version that I bought for my iPad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenged my Beliefs","review":"What a unique expression.

The word \\"synchronicity\\" does not appear anywhere in the book. I found this book on a website called The Synchronicity Times. And I like the web site. I clicked on Recommended Reading and got this book. But this book is about, as I see it, the author's feelings on how we should dissolve social sexual mores. Bascially the Sixties Sexual Revolution plus some Hindu philosophy plus some New Age ideas. Pretty impractical in real life, and a bit childish. Just my opinion.

The author lays out what Joseph Smith made up out of whole cloth and called a religion, but then does not go in depth about how preposterous it is, and never really gets into why BY bought into the whole fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Choice","review":"This is a great watch that gives accurate time every day - looks good and functions flawlessly. After a year in a sometimes dirty, sweaty, physical environment, my Deville looks brand new. The crystal hasn't a scratch. A light soap and water rinse and I'm ready for dinner out with the better half. In terms of appearance and performance the watch is a great value. My other Omega purchased in 1967 (yes, I'm old) still works perfectly but I'm saving it for my grandkids. The difference in the crystals is interesting as this Deville doesnt scratch while the '67 does easily. After 41 years of using/wearing Omega I've learned that it's the world standard"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, powerful poetry","review":"This book is beautiful inside and out (great cover). Diane Thiel is an extraordinarily lyrical poet, masterful of both form and free verse. The poems in \\"Echolocations\\" are on themes as diverse as the effect of war on people for generations after, the life of women, and science and the environment. Thiel's language is compressed--it is almost impossible to find a superfluous word--and powerful. The imagery is vivid and evocative. The title poem is representative: the poet encounters the skeleton of a whale on a deserted beach in Colombia. In entering the skeleton, she embarks on a journey from the personal to the universal. In extraordinarily resonant language, Thiel makes us FEEL the connection between all living things and lets us hear the whale's--nature's--song. This book of poetry is an invitation to a journey that is well-worth taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning first book","review":"A stunning first book, rich in imagery and nuance. Evokes a life deeply re-membered. These poems, song-lines, echo with history, with personal courage, with self-transformation. Unfold each poem, line by line, like you would an old map. It will carry you to the center of your self--the only place you will ever find treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst book I've ever read","review":"At least the author seems to try her hand in making sense of her lyric thrust. The first section of the book is overly ornate with teutonic diction, the others tepid with unimpassioned verse.

The warm-up was ridiculously slow; so slow that I skipped to the first work-out segment and again was so disappointed, I quickly turned it off and put in my favorite work-out tape instead.

I knew nothing about Quincy Jones, except that I liked the music and this was around 1963. But, when i saw his name popping-up as a composer in such movies as The Carpetbaggers, In The Heat of the Night, did I began to learn about Quincy Jones. He was the first black musician who composed music themes, but also was music direct for the likes of Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughn, Dinah Washington, The Brothers Johnson, and of course, Michael Jackson.Quincy is the last of his breed and this book also gives acolades to other great musicians, who are long gone and unknown to many young music lovers. This is a good chance to get to know them."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most important and powerful musicians of our time","review":"Q, The Autobiography of Quincy Jones has been an awesome, page turning read! Most would use a journey of writing their biography to embarrass and annoy friends and family, Quincy just tells it like it is. One of the things I love is the ability to show the readers that he is human and has flaws. Despite issues with his mother and the countless women in and out of his life, he realized that only HE could be the one to make a difference in his life. The other thing I love best is his incorporating dialogue of close friends and family in the book, which only speaks to the kind of man he is. Loyal. Finally, I think the book teaches us to rise above our circumstances. Come what may. Quincy Jones, truely is a living legend....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on the Block","review":"This is an excellent read for any music fan. It is filled with great stories chronicling not only one black man's experience in the music industry, but it also chronicles the history of \\"popular\\" music in the U.S. and Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Enjoyable Book..","review":"Like all of the other singers and musicians, Quincy Jones should stick with music. But i guesse if you can write music you can write a book. I just found it pretty boring. Quincy does awesome music though.If you liked this book check out all of Quincy Jones's Cds"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Q","review":"Quincy Jones is amazing. He has done everything in the music business and it's easy to understand why after reading this book. His tough childhood and struggle with relationships shaped his music. He is very very honest and that is what I liked best about the book. He is the kind of guy you would like to meet and have lunch with because he has a million stories about everyone famous in the music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you do not want to put down","review":"Of course I knew of Quincy Jones before I bought the book, but I guess if I am honest I did not really know why and would have struggled to name anything other than his work with Michael Jackson. Once you get into the book you realise just how much of an influence he has had on Music production over the last three generations, spanning from big band through to film scores and of course music of many genres. I found the book fascinating and inspiring, but it also confirmed that even such public figures are human and do not get everything right. Jones admits himself that he was not as present as he should have been for his children and as a result they have struggled with their own demons, it is unusual to find someone so successful who does not have a mega-ego.I recommend this without hesitation, find out more about how he has and still is influencing almost everything we hear on TV and radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a Count Basie Jones","review":"I came of age in disco but cut my teeth on Count Basie and Duke Ellington and am blessed that not a week goes by that Basie does not \\"swing\\" me. Quincy was given a gift and he accepted that gift and touches every corner of the world with it. He touches the world through his music, his arrangements and his ability to love and hold on to others. He used that gift to light corners and to leave a legacy that will hold us in this world and in beyond. Q was able to put a little of his \\"gift\\" between two covers and to allow we readers to take a little sip. For that I am grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice with grace and elegance","review":"This is a lovely collection of songs by the late DeGaetani. She and Kalish, her accompanist, had worked together on numerous occasions over the years. The experience shows in the near flawless melding of piano and voice; two professionals who understand the music and each other. DeGaetani doesn't bully you with her voice; she wins you over with her simple elegance and enormous charm. She has great sympathy for these works (which are fortunately translated in the liner notes), with thoughtful phrasing. All in all, a wonderful introduction to these two great talents, and these delightful songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Read","review":"I purchased this book to get myself in the 'mood' for a trip to Savannah, Georgia. I found the stories unengaging, the attention to detail poor (Interstate 80 is not in Georgia), and the writing style did nothing to make the mainly second-hand narratives exciting or interesting. It was all I could do to make it through the Savannah portion. The stories are bland and the retelling is even more bland. This book's ghost stories make 'America's Most Haunted City' Savannah sound like your average city. If you're looking for good ghost stories, this is not your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"wrong author","review":"This set was written and revised by Fathers Hugo Hoever and Thomas J.

My grandson now has that one in his room and I bought a new one for my office, which was put in my computer room in 2005 so I bought another one for my office.

They are far superior, and have a 1st-rate continuo ensemble backing her up (the ASMIF Chamber Ensemble)."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure, beautiful tone!","review":"The beauty of simplicity. Such clear, beautiful, resonant tone.(just listen to the first four notes of the F Major!)It takes my breath away. What a great example of what the violin CAN sound like. His ornamental/improvisational ideas are great to listen to - he certainly isn't just regurgitating the same old Handel sonatas! A refreshingly different take on the sonatas. (I for one am not interested in hearing the same old interpretation one more time!). This is unique and amazing. I'd like to hear more classical artists add their own personal touch in the way that Andrew Manze can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically proficient but not much more","review":"I was disappointed in this book of erotica, because frankly no story ever felt very erotic to me. The book felt as though it was the result of the author making a list of possible sexual situations and setting a deadline and as each piece was finished, checking off that item on a list.Short stories are always difficult as they require the author to establish scene and characters very quickly as well as to equally quickly invest us emotionally in the characters and their relationship. The author fails to do that -- the writing feels continually detached from the characters and renders them two dimensional.Failing that, the sex in an erotica book needs to be hot. Truthfully, I have read far hotter sex scenes for free on internet erotica sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"GUARNERI STILL SHINES","review":"I find this recording of the A minor and D minor Shubert quartets to be outstanding. In their later years, they go a little slower than they once did, but to the service of the music. Get this recording. you won't be disappointed. The 2nd mvmt of the A minor alone will make you glad you bought it. And the Menuet of the same quartet would surely gain Schubert's approval."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE funniest book I have ever read","review":"Read it!!!

HA HA HA","review":"What, are these reviewers Joe Keenan's personal friends? This book reads like a really lame sitcom. Plenty of hit-me-with-a-brick foreshadowing, clever quips paced every two pages, wacky characters. I think Mr. Keenan clearly envisioned this piece to be made into some sort of movie (most likely, CBS Sunday Movie sort of thing). Maybe the old group from Three's Company is still available. This would be an ideal John Ritter vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Frenetic Than Funny","review":"Gee, this book is like watching a sitcom - and not a particularly funny one. Maybe it should come with a built-in electronic laughtrack. I give it one star for trying so hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough books like this","review":"Funny, witty, and well written. It is a lot like Wodehouse, but translated into a different period, and with enough about it that is different that it merits its own accolades.When travelling I long for books like these, and there are very few that meet this level of quality.My only criticism is that he has only written two books. He'll need to do at least 8 more before BBC would ever consider turning them into a series."},{"rating":"2","title":"More cinematic than literate","review":"This is frothy fun. The characters are likable, and the author has a witty turn of phrase. One distracting aspect of this book, however, is that it reads like a movie, as if that's what the author had in mind all along; no one has much of an inner life. Still, there is enjoyment to be had, if you need a bit of a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keenan is national treasure","review":"Actually, I am far from the type to peruse gay, broadway-based novels. Quite the contrary. But by the time I figured out what \\"Blue Heaven\\" was all about, I was laughing too hard to quit.I can't remember just bursting into laughter so often reading a novel. Keenan ranks up there with Christopher Moore and Tom Sharpe as one of the handful of funniest writers alive.It was only after reading his books (and fretting for him to do more) that I realized he was also the writing genius behind the \\"Frasier\\" TV show, certainly one of the better-written shows ever.I won't try to impress you by layering on verbiage here: just get this and read it. Make sure you don't have any liquids in your mouth at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Heaven: One of the Funniest Books I've Ever Read.","review":"I'm not a literary critic so I can't speak to its technical proficiency. Some of these kinds of criteria seem to be a sticking point for some of the negative reviewers. \\"Blue Heaven\\" is a light read that is silly, fun and, at times, laugh-out-loud funny.It was interesting to note that new work by Joe Keenan seemed very hard to come by for quite a few years. As it turns out, he had gone on to write for, and eventually help produce, a little sitcom known as \\"Frasier.\\" ... You may have heard of it. As you get to know the characters in the book, see if they seem a little familiar.I have read all of Joe Keenan's novels. I would ration them over time otherwise it is too much of a good thing one right after the other. However, they are ALL great fun and well worth the time but \\"Blue Heaven\\" will always be my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"CARTOON TIME","review":"I bailed halfway through this novel: if this is gay fiction, the hell with it. Though there are plenty of laugh lines and clever phrases, it's just a cheesy cartoon; you don't care about a single character; and the experience of reading quickly becomes tedious. We'll see if his other two novels are any more substantial. Comedy, by itself, is not enough. The author is called the gay Wodehouse, but Wodehouse bores me, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe, Please Write Another One!","review":"OK...so it's not Proust. But I defy you to find a more entertaining, funny book! It is a guaranteed laugh-outloud gay romp. In fact, some of the lines are so memorable that I pick up the book and re-read them (which I, of course, have highlighted) when I need a pick-me-up. I just wish that Joe Keenan would dump TV's \\"Frasier\\" and give us another book as terrific as \\"Blue Heaven\\" and, to a slighly lesser extent, \\"Putting on the Ritz.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money.","review":"It's a white bulb with a yellow tinted plastic cover.

This piece is the culmination of techniques used in those earlier pieces. He has developed a unique method of investigating his surroundings and exploring movement. I have never seen anything like it. It is an exceptional piece of avant-garde film making.I sought out this disc when it was first released and it knocked me out. Stephen Arthur shows the viewer a seldom seen world of moments in time linked together through the motion of an automobile. In this movement the viewer connects to the world outside of the car in a very different fashion from what is typical of experiencing your surroundings through the picture window of the windshield.On occasion film makers achieve through the frame a new way of seeing. Mr. Arthur's work rises to that level and is both a technological exploration of film and a beautiful piece of art. Through this ability he provides the viewer a unique and marvelous immersive experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money, snaps fall off before even using them","review":"They are super soft but as I opened them up to toss them in the wash before using I had 3 diapers that the snaps just popped off and flew across the floor.

These might carry the Bummis name but once you get them (and u can see it in the Amazon picture, look closely) the little blue tag says TotsBots which is in the UK and they don't make any diaper I have tried that is any good.

Cook's 1991 book, \\"Night Secrets\\" certainly doesn't indicate the vastly talented writer he was to become. His later books, including \\"Chatham School Affair,\\" and \\"Places in the Dark\\" are outstanding examples of his expertise in writing the mysteries that involve incidents from the past and their effect on the present.However, \\"Night Secrets\\" is a meandering, slow-paced yawner involving a burned out PI named Frank Clemons who takes on a \\"day case\\" involving a mysterious woman whose husband suspects an affair; his \\"night\\" case involves a mysterious gypsy accused of murdering an old woman. Frank's daughter committed suicide, his wife divorced him, and his lover married somebody else. No wonder; Frank is one boring guy. His insane desire for the mad gypsy woman is completely unfounded and preposterous; the denouement is really overwrought and unsuspenseful. A real sleeper, indeed. Beats Sominex."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kakuro breaks all the rules","review":"I purchased this game for the Kakuro part, since there are several other available Sudoku games. The puzzles don't follow the rules of Kakuro, so it's virtually unplayable. There should never be a point where you can only get the answer by sheer guessing; you should always be able to work out the number given all of the other clues. You might have to temporarily guess but by following that path you should be able to verify or disprove your guess.The interface is, um, unique, but it is useable. I wouldn't have given it one star for that. It lets you operate with the buttons rather than the stylus and it takes a bit of getting used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this is a very disappointing version of Sudoku. In addition to their complaints, I would state that I get the same board offered multiple times (both Sudoku and Kakuro). I don't know if this is because I haven't met some minimum time? Speed is inhibited by the navigation of the game (at least it does let you wrap around from the top of the screen to the bottom, etc.).One thing I do like about the game is that, being new to Kakuro and not very quick with math, the game tells you when your math does not add up. When I get more proficient with Kakuro, this may become a \\"leave me alone, darnit\\" feature, as it is currently on the Sudoku side of the game.Brain Age's version is soooo much better - can't those folks just put out an independent Sudoku?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!!","review":"Couldn't wait to get this, but right off the bat was extremely unsatisfied with it. The worst 2 features of the game are: 1)The game doesn't allow you to write little notations to yourself - a must in more difficult sudoku puzzles! 2) The game immediately lets you know if you've placed a wrong number & there's no way to turn this off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this bad game!","review":"I agree with the other current reviewer. I really was hoping this would be a good Sudoku game, but not being able to put in small numerical notations is just unbelievable. Plus the user interface in not that great either. The people that programmed this should be ashamed of creating this bad game. I am really sorry I bought this! I should have waited for reviews, but was hoping for better. Brain Age Sudoku still beats the pants off of every other such game for the DS so far. That is sad! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"This Kakuro has multiple solutions which should never happen!","review":"Any good Kakuro game has only 1 unique solution. I've tried several in the easy section that have multiple solutions. Why would the game developer not understand the first and most important rule in Sudoku and Kakuro? Had I known this before I bought it - I would have saved my money. I'd give it 0 stars if there was that option!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I pre-purchased this game after going through all the Sudoku in Brain Age. This couldn't be farther from the quality and playability of Brain Age if it tried. The game doesn't allow for guesses in the square and you can't see the numbers unless you have VERY good eyesight and it just isn't fun to play. If you liked the Sudoku in Brain Age, you will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"This could have been a great game for Kakuro alone. Unfortunately the interface isn't very good. It doesn't allow you to place potential answers in the blocks and that is essential for any Kakuro puzzle to solve. Try Brain Buster Puzzle Pak for the DS or import a Kakuro game [..] for a better game experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!!","review":"I don't want to repeat what the other reviewers said, but they are absolutely right. I was really disappointed in this game and, like the others, wish that I had waited for the reviews.Why any of these developers can't come up with a Sudoko and/or a Kakuro game with a similar interface to Brain Age is beyond me.The worst part is that the game board is on the non-touch screen and moving around is extremely cumbersome. Whoops!! I'm repeating what the other reviews said -- sorry!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh..Are you kidding?","review":"One honestly has to wonder if the makers of this game have ever played sudoku.

It features a serious introduction to most aspects of DreamWeaver, and ushers readers onto more intermediate topics. It isn't too much, and it isn't too little...its coverage of DreamWeaver is just right.The only complaint that I've got (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) is that I would have liked to have seen a litlte more emphasis placed on DreamWeaver's coding tools.

Not only does it cover Dreamweaver from the most basic topics (adding text, images, etc) to more advanced topics (DHTML, intro to databse sites), it also has some great design oriented content as well. The first chapter in the book talks about the basic principles of interactive design...something that I think is missing from many web tool books.Overall, the book is written really well. The author obviously knows exactly what he's doing, and knows how to transmit that to a reader. The topics are organized perfectly.

Yes, the book is clearly written, but if you are an absolute novice like me, the \\"WHY's\\" of what you are doing are missing. The book explains in detail this step and that step but WHY are you doing it? The author does not show the final outcome of your actions. Therefore, your exercises have no meaning. So many computer software books are written this way today by people who expect the reader to know something about what they are trying so desperately to learn in the first place. My advice to them: lighten up, come down to earth like the rest of us. If you have something to say, say it with purpose. Put yourself in the place of the people who are actually buying your books.

This is a great read--the chapter on tying your own leaders is worth the price of the book. \\"Presenting the Fly\\" and \\"The Correct Approach\\" are essential reading for every fly fisher. Whitlock offers more tactics, and Joe Humphrey offers great insight, but Art is the most gifted writer on the subject of fly fishing. Buy it! Read it now. Read it each winter.

That being said, if you're just interested in hearing some bizarre and quirky arrangements of popular songs, then you might like it.

I loved them all, even after listening to them every time I worked for almost a year...except one! Cover the world, drove me up the wall the first few times I heard it. Now, there are a few good songs on here (\\"Ain't no sunshine\\", is my fav) but overall, not for long term listening in my opinion.

David Bronstein's love for the game comes through in this book. There are very few things i'd change about the book. Some pictures would have been nice, the font is not my favorite, a few other minor things as well.However, overall this is a great book. There are not a ton of variations, so us weaker players can go through the games without too much trouble. The book was not written for instruction, but I think it has a lot of instructional value. However, even if you learn nothing, it's still a very enjoyable book to go through. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"For intermediates and up!","review":"This is one of the better books I own, partly because of the strength of the players involved in the tournament, and partly because David Bronstein is one of the best writers about chess. His analysis is very instructive, touching on simple and advanced concepts as he goes through ALL the games in the tournament. Granted, not all games are extensively commented, but the most instructive games and detailed and explained.Highly reccomended for players that are already confortable with intermediate chess tactics and strategy.

Nxe5?! +- and where the author doesn't explain what's going on... Bronstein is an excellent writer that did more than to keep a record of a tournament with soul-less annotations and without realizing it compiled a book that shows how difficult is the game of chess when the level is high. In these games we see more than a textbook exploitation of a good knight against a bad bishop or games where one of the players was highly cooperative with his/her counterpart allowing him/her to demonstrate a win by simple means. What we see here are games where ideas in the opening clash and where important material in the middlegame is reviewed. This book is a classic and it is by far one of the best games compilation in the market. I strongly recommend playing solitaire with these games and enjoy the game of chess with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth 3 times its price","review":"..and they're are not many chess books you can say that about.

Therefore, if a manufacturer is claiming Whole Grain and Whole Wheat all over their packaging, they have no business making white flour the primary ingredient. Since they don't tell you the ratio, they can add as little as 1% whole wheat and still be able to put it on the outside that way.This is an extremely prevalent practice & needs to be regulated. Food companies are deliberately deceiving the public into thinking that they're getting something more nutritous than they are.Unless a package says 100% whole grain or 100% whole wheat (Wheat Thins & Triscuits have them), then they're likely not.I can't have white flour and it takes me forever to shop because all these companies have jumped on the whole grain bandwagon & are attempting to fool consumers and they succeed most of the time.Shame on Nabisco.

Apparently these 3 episodes were chosen due to popularity (and similarity to the 1968 film \\"Destroy All Monsters\\") but if you aren't already a fan of this show you're going to be hopelessly lost, since these episodes come from the middle of the first season and make a lot of references to things that happened previously.Due to the few episodes and the lack of any setup or introduction of the characters, this DVD is only going to be of interest to people who were fans of the original cartoon or to very young children who'll probably enjoy seeing the monsters fight each other (but may be very bored by all the human \\"drama\\"). Ultimately this disc seems like a quick attempt to capitalize on the upcoming 50th Anniversary of the original Godzilla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Show, Bad Feature","review":"I'm a fan of the animated series.

I was able to audition a Boston Accoustics center,a Definitive Technology pro1000, a Klipsch Icon xl-12 and the Klipsch RC-10 IN MY OWN LIVING ROOM! The Boston couldn't handle the power,the Def Tech was good but didn't have the high frequency detail,the Xl-12 was clean but lacked warmth and bass. The Klipsch RC-10 had it all;power handling,good bass and warmth and high frequency detail.It sounded the best of the four and was the most efficient.

Rather, it's a sweet set of original, inventive instrumental fiddle tunes (and one gorgeous vocal number featuring his ever-lovely partner, Kate Rusby)... A simple, understated album, and one that successfully sheds the sometimes-dour sensibilities of his old group, the Battlefield Band. Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good...","review":"I've read most of Serviss' work and this in my opinion is his worst.

It is a self-indulgent, poorly written rant devoid of any sympathy for of the people she writes about (co-workers, not actors or producers). They end up being one-dimensional cardboard caricatures, with no attempt at a greater understanding of their lives or indeed a reason why we might care to read about them at all.Far from zipping through the book in a day, as I had originally thought when I bought it, I was surprised to have to struggle to make it through the first chapter. I finally gave up 70% of the way into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful awful awful","review":"This is the absolute worst book I have ever read, bar none. The spelling is atrocious and the grammar is sub-third grade. The \\"story\\" (such as it is) merely lists the \\"author's\\" complaints regarding her co-workers and supervisors in the video replicating business. That's right, the video replicating business. There are many, many petty squabbles going on, none of which are interesting or even about the porn industry. It's like sitting next to a person who just complains constantly about how horrible their job is. Here is a sample of the bad writing and trivial complaining, from page 33: \\"In the office Clinton had a national sales manager, John. He was a wolf in sheep's clothing in many peoples [sic] mind.

There's almost nothing in the book about the porn industry. It's the experience of an uneducated woman's job as an editor in the business but her perspective is so limited that she could be talking about any business. It's 200 pages - large font and double spaced. One look inside and you'll know you've been scammed. Doesn't Amazon have some responsibility to its customers not to shill such books for publishers? This is my second experience here of paying a premium price for a highly touted book that ended up being ludricrously misrepresented."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Game is sold not Told!","review":"This book reminds me of a poorly written romance novel it has great intentions but the end result is ones unique experience at love gone wrong.

I had high expectations for this offering because of its focus on Elvis' early life and relationship with his mother. However, I found the general tone of the book to be sensational. The sex \\"revelations\\" don't seem to be anything more than lurid details the like of which can be found in any tabloid. Everyone knows Elvis was a wonton womanizer. It's hardly news at this point. I found there to be many mistakes and inconsistancies throughout the book. One is so careless as to describe Elvis' first girlfriend, Dixie Locke, as a blond then two pages later she is in picture showing a girl with black hair. The whole thing just read like a trashy novel to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If he is Elvis' cousin, I'm a monkey's uncle","review":"Out of all the dozen books I've read on Elvis, this is the most fictional of the bunch. According to the author, he was Elvis's right hand man and secretary, yet he was never mentioned in any other book I've read. The whole thing is a lie and his books should be classified as fiction instead of biography. He talks about Elvis dying his hair black in High school and singing at Beale Street clubs to get started.

My three-year-old developed a rash shortly after I had done a couple of loads of laundry. At first I thought it might be winter eczema, perhaps brought on by a sudden spell of cold weather, but when the weather warmed up, the rash actually got worse. Hydrocortisone cream failed to clear it up. Finally I wised up and washed all of her clothes with another detergent (Arm & Hammer).

For those who have been following Andrew Bird's divergence from his Squirrel Nut Zipper days, the experimentation and evolution of his previous albums, Weather Systems and The Swimming Hour, finally reaches a benchmark with The Mysterious Production of Eggs. An album that will leave you both satisfied and hungry for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"and there will be snacks...","review":"You know, you really cannot go wrong buying any one of Andrew Bird's CDs. Just don't expect the usual. He's doing something different. It seems he's always doing something different. But, and understandably so, it's hard to capture all that's amazing about Andrew on a mere CD. So my advice to you is to check his website daily - and if he comes to a town anywhere near you, GO SEE HIM LIVE! (If you've never seen him live, bless you, you're in for a real treat.) Prepare to be left speechless. After the show, buy a CD directly from him - he'll sign it! (He may even write some molecular formulas.)

Bird is a true crooner in the Bing Crosby-sense, with a honey-smooth voice that never strains to be note-perfect. The soundscapes here are extremely inviting, encouraging a second play once the first is finished. It has been the perfect soundtrack to the grey, rainy days we've been having in the Bay Area. It would also be a great compliment to a summer morning camping in the woods, complete with coffee and cigarette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eggceptional","review":"My favourite of 2005. Every song is musically complex, layered and interesting - yet so easy on the first listen. The lyrics also appear to be quite simple and whimsical but are actually dense and impenetrable - difficult to fathom without concerted mental effort and a spoonful of intuition. Then you might begin to get some kind of clarity, something may take shape, though still elusive and curious, a puzzle that might not actually have been intended for resolution - perhaps in order to avoid certain classification and inevitable sorting into an appropriately sized shoe-box where it can be neatly stamped \\"case closed\\" and pigeon-holed, ah! problem solved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not original but beutiful","review":"The first thing that comes to your mind when you listen to this album is \\"I recognize the influence\\". And it is not difficult to spot whom Mr. Bird is borrowing from. To name a few: Radiohead, Beatles, Paul Simon, Beck, XTC. When Andrew Bird sings \\"not just another day\\" actually it sounds like \\"just another day\\" by Paul McCartney. The album however is wonderfully crafted, and it is hard to stay indifferent to the overwhelming harmonic attack. So, it is not very original, but still extremely beautiful. Definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a wonderful record","review":"All I have to say is listen to Myrna Loy.

The unit shipped with ample packaging from buy.com (unlike the steel door cover, beware!) so it arrived in one piece and all the necessary fasteners were included.I would add some other components to the buy list, such as a duplex outlet, an external cover for it (because it will hang outside the enclosure), and the bevy of mounting hardware that channel vision offers.What makes this product less than perfect is some of the channel vision design choices that I scratch my head over. For example, they include trim rings for the knockouts, but none of the trim rings allow you to attach standard 3/4\\" tube connectors to the cabinet.

There are certain things that just don't want to be seen. Other than the throwing up I really liked this movie. It was weird but fun.

Stylistically, it was very much like \\"Napeoleon Dynamite\\"--no surprise since they were made by the same team. What I found disturbing about both films, however, was their portrayal of Americans as a bunch of quirkly, ineffectual buffoons. The erstwhile filmmaker was the worst--he literally made my skin crawl every time he was on screen. Some no doubt find this to be an endearing quality of these movies. The characters in these movies don't represent the America I know--nor one I would ever want to live in. I suppose it was 'cute' the first time, but this time round it really got on my nerves.

The rest is completely forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This was not worth watching. I turned it off after 5 minutes. Way crude and not even funny. I thought since this was the director of Nacho and Napoleon that it would be good.... Thumbs down all the way to the trash can. Not even worth giving to a thrift store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad!","review":"Those who expect a funny movie like Napoleon Dynamite will be extremely disappointed.There are ambiguous scenes and the movie is absolutly boring.I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"at .99 cents this movie would to much!","review":"My wife loves bad movies. She really wanted to see this one. It was so bad she and the family dog gave up and could not finish it. I would like to re-gift the movie but there is no one one I dislike that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ever.","review":"The worst movie ever. My IQ decreased by 30 points after i saw this awful movie. It is a real disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very annoying film.","review":"I guess Salt Lake City was \\"lucky\\" enough to be one of the few venues they tried this film out on. My brother, a huge Napoleon Dynamite fan was very excited to see the film, so against my better judgement, I went. Trust me, as I am not a huge Napoleon Dynamite fan, this film is nowhere as interesting. The best part, in fact the only part is the Dr. Ronald Chevalier character. He at least has some of the quirkiness and novelty the main characters in the other movies had. The only feeling after this film was an overwhelming sense of being annoyed by the whole thing. I am pretty sure the other four people in the theater had the same reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie froze up quite a bit","review":"When we were streaming the movie it would freeze up and we would have to start the movie over. This occured several times. It was kind of disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It.","review":"This is another one of those movies where you will love it or hate it I think. I find it to be hysterical, it is over the top ridiculous. Mike White as the 'angel', the horrible Sci-Fi scenes and of course Jennifer Coolidge. All in all if you like these kind of films you will enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"Not nearly as funny as I was led to believe. However, I will sit through pretty much anything with Jemaine Clement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie","review":"It's quite low budget but I still liked it. The story line is a little strange but the characters had me laughing the whole time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let-Down and Waste of Money - Glad I Only Rented It.","review":"I really liked Hess' other films so I had high expectations for this one - what a let-down.The trailer was hilarious and I couldn't wait to watch, but talk about dissonance - it was a total bait-and-switch! The entire film wreaks of mindless dependance on 4th grade \\"toilet talk\\" - poop, gonads, mammary cannons? Are you kidding, Hess? - and stereotypes as filler; replacing the original creativity and masterful comic delivery we've come to expect from Hess.My recommendation: Don't watch this film. Well, you can watch it, but don't pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only laughed once in the whole movie","review":"I loved Napoleon Dynamite, and enjoyed Nacho Libre as well, however there was a good reason that this film went straight to video. I could relate to the awkwardness of the characters in Napoleon Dynamite and Jack Black made Nacho Libre work, but there is nothing to relate to in this film, I just sat and waited for something funny to happen, only problem was nothing really ever did. However if you look in the toilet before you flush and it makes you laugh then you will probably enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insanely Badainous (sic)","review":"The Chevalier character was great. Original, well acted, funny, etc. Everything else about this movie just didn't work. I really wanted to like this movie, but it relied far too heavily on the awkwardness of it's characters and crude testicle, poop, etc references to elicit a laugh or two from the audience.There's not a whole lot to say about this one. Any attempt at originality is so poorly executed that it renders this film unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid movie","review":"I did not like it at all, it was really slow and completely stupid humor.

It is a noxious mix of adolescent fantasies and tired cliches spiced with disgusting special effects (Bronco puke). I can't comment on the whole movie because we shut it off after the first thirty minutes in order to save lives (ours). I have always thought that \\"Zontar, The Thing From Venus\\" was the worst movie ever made but \\"Gentlemen Broncos\\" has issued a strong challenge for the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or your money","review":"This is a horrible movie. It probably appeals to junior high boys who still light their own farts. Avoid it like the excrement it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full disclosure recommended:","review":"This DVD is substandard for its' cost. It seems as though the DVD was recorded from a copy of the original version taken by the viewer as they watched it on a screen. The picture is difficult to watch, making you dizzy at times, many distortion lines running through the production and the picture is often off the center of the screen. I do not recommend the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"If this video didn't have a few minutes of Ethel Merman singing some of her signature tunes (\\"Blow Gabriel,\\" \\"You're the Top,\\" \\"Anything Goes\\") this would be a total waste of time.HUGE sections of the play (including subplots and songs) have been cut to fit into the tv time slot - and, Frank Sinatra is miserably miscast (though sings beautifully). Oh. And the film is grainy and dark.Worthy only as a curiosity.(2stars in stead of 1 because it IS fun to watch Ms.Merman)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A modernist twist on French Horn playing","review":"To begin, I have to admit I found the title of the album misleading. Instead of a mellow, Bach-like baroque deployment of the French Horn, I found myself surprised that it is accompanied by piano, more along the lines of a sort of bawdy Gilbert & Sullivan or Gershwin play/musical score.Trying to find anything I like or find suitable on this album... maybe it reflects a lack of good material for the French Horn. I don't know. But it could only have been cooked up by someone who loves this instrument.Solid 2 star rating.Ken Cybulska"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Romanovs: Love, Power & Tragedy","review":"\\"The Romanovs: Love, Power & Tragedy\\" is perhaps the best book on the last Imperial Family of Russia. Its aim is to not only tell the story through written text, but also through large, beautiful photographs - some which have never been published elsewhere, and most specially, through the very words of the Imperial Family themselves. It begins with the Tsar's and Tsarina's childhood, to their courtship and marriage, coronation, their family life, the 300th anniversary of Romanov rule, the Great War, and to the Tsar's abdication, his family's imprisonment and later their execution. It is not an ordinary book, but is so lovely and charming and will surely be treasured and cherished."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PICTURES!","review":"This wonderful book contains beautiful pictures of the last Romanovs. I own about 50 books related to Tsar Nicholas II, and this one is my favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This book is too good for words!!!!

I highly recommend this product, especially for Macintosh owners!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Performance","review":"I had difficulty getting this product to work initially, it would not read my Kingston Elite Pro flash card. It turns out this was due to a problem with Kingston memory. I tried it out on another pc and with other cards, it is really fast,faster than the usb2 products, but it runs warmer than other readers.

There are some tricks to making it work, but they seem a bit convoluted. Even when I did get it to work, it wouldn't work through the powered hub on my Cinema Display, but only when directly connected to my Firewire port on the laptop.

The game is like a golf simulator, it is very real.You begin as a novice with bad equipment and basic skills (like power or accuracy), then you can earn money and experience, but in the beginning is very hard to beat any golfer, so you have to spend a lot of time if you want to play (decent) in a tourment.Nevertheless in next realeases EA could improve the game with more courses, and with a \\"training mode\\" where you can shoot in special situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiger is full of fun!","review":"I love this game.

What had been the \\"first\\" side sounded just great. However, all of the following music sounded like I was listening under water because the sound quality is just miserable. Consequently I downloaded the album from Amazon for less than half the cost of the CD and all songs sound terrific. Can't recommend this particular CD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn To The Go-Go's","review":"After the hit or miss affair that Vacation was, the Go-Go's finally took a break from their rigorous touring schedule. They returned back on the top of their game with Talk Show. The album combines their punkish attitudes with a slick pop production. The pounding piano on \\"Head Over Heels\\" practically begs you to get up and dance. \\"Forget That Day\\" shows Belinda Carlisle's ability to perfectly portray the girl with the wounded heart. \\"Yes Or No\\" & \\"Beneath The Blue Sky\\" or good pop songs as is \\"Capture The Light\\". The highlight of the album, and possibly their career, is \\"Turn To You\\". The song is a perfect synthesis of their early punk rocking days and their recorded pop sheen. The song has a frantic driving guitar and slamming drums, but it also has a stop and go sound with perfect harmonies. A true triumph. Unfortunately the band imploded after this release, but they did leave behind three great albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, hard rocking album --- 1984's best","review":"Talk Show is a punchy, hard rocking, brilliant pop masterpiece. It was my choice at the time as 1984's best album, and it is the only one of the Go-Go's first three albums that still does not sound dated. The production by Martin Rushent is superb --- the drums slam in your face, the harmonies give you goose-bumps, the guitars jangle and soar harmonically and rock down 'n dirty. \\"Beneath the Blue Sky\\" and the great single \\"Head Over Heels\\" are the best tracks, but every one is a winner and shows off the band members' virtuosic songwriting skills. Truly a great album, and perhaps the best pure pop album of the '80's. A criminally overlooked work -- get it now !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely soprano, but...","review":"Heidi Grant Murphy is truly a soprano with a very lovely voice, but is this enough for this music? With every new recording of the famous wedding cantata the very first aria will tell you if the recording is worth listening to. And to be more specific: Do the soprano and the oboe sing their melodic part as if they'd rather be without the other or do they sing it as a duet?On this recording Ms. Murphy does not seem to approve of the presence of the oboe at all; \\"keep quiet and let me sing my part!\\"If you want to know what I am talking about just go to Elisabeth Schwarzkopf's recently issued 1958-performance with the Concergebouw and Otto Klemperer. But do not blame me if you never listen to ms. Murphy's recording thereafter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, where to begin...","review":"I really had high hopes for this book. So little substantive is available on the career of Simon & Garfunkle. Unfortunately, this childish, fawning tome is almost a waste of time.It's so hard to determine what the author had in mind. Certainly not the music of this duo. She spends more time on a plot synopsis of an Art Garfunkle movie than she does IN TOTAL on the creative process of the duo's groundbreaking albums. How they made their records, how the songs were created, life on the road - very little on their art is discussed. That seems not to be important to this amateur author.Since she had such access to Garfunkle, that must be why the focus is on Artie-minutia (and then she should have called it that!). But if one wants insight into the actual career of this duo, to learn about their music, their muse and their legend...look elsewhere.

The CD is a fusion filled mix of country, Memphis funk, blues and rock. The CD opens with a bang with \\"If Down Was Up\\" which features some punchy sax from a man they call \\"Jeff\\". The opener provides some contrast to the rather laid back feel of most of the other tunes on the disc. Brown manages to cover a couple of tunes from label mate, R.L. Burnside, \\"Miss Maybelle\\" and \\"Goin' Down South\\" and provides a stand out interpretation of Fred McDowell's \\"Shake 'Em On Down\\". Cedric Burnside, R.L.'s grandson who also plays on the new Mississippi Allstars CD, provides the drums while Takeeshi Imura fills the backbeat with his bass. This is some raw and potent stuff. Another Fat Possum winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal","review":"I am a long time of the North Mississippi style & sound. As did most, I came to know about Kenny Brown through his association with R. L. Burnside. Kenny Brown carries on the tradition of heartfelt, groove oriented, no frills, \\"real deal\\" music just fine on Stingray.

I'm sending the Nikon back. It's absolutely unacceptable. Any dark area on the picture is filled noise. I even forced it to use only ASA 100 and it looks like ASA 4000 or worse.

Sometimes it can backfire, but I feel that \\"Champion Sound\\" pulled it off wonderfully. There are some nice joints like-\\"The Red\\"-\\"Starz\\"-\\"Strip Club-and my personal favorite \\"The Official\\". I think the problem with this album is that it is hard for some cats to put it into a specific box and label it. It's new, and different, brave, and ambituous all at the same time.

It's so scary to believe that people in America actually feel (or use to feel) this way.

The genre of this book should be under \\"dark humor\\" not Christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Man's Brain Academy","review":"Except I don't know that it is actually cheaper. Brain Age and Brain Academy are much better games with much more variety. The story that is offered up doesn't add anything to it. There are only four different types of challenges (remembering a sequence of pictures shown, counting how many bouncing balls, adding several numbers to find the sum, and finding the two identical pictures among a group of singles). While they are different than the challenges found in the other two games I mentioned, they lose their appeal. There are four levels of difficulty for each game. They could definitely have a better way to keep track of your progress and your improvement. I haven't tried the Gamma Wave version of Brain Boost, but it looks to be as simple and lackluster.I'd skip this game and opt for the Brain Age and/or Brain Academy!

It only takes about 2 minutes to install the required files (2)on a computer running XP but might be a problem if you want to send the video to a family member since they won't have the dv driver and video codec. My son has made several short takes with only the TV for background light and they are fine. It will not accept any of my 2 gig SD cards but that may be because they've been used in other cameras.

It was a 2 person project to put together, but nothing that 2 non-handy people couldn't handle. She is now 27 months and still loves her bed. It is low enough that even if they do get out at night, there is little chance that they will hurt themselves.

Seems like it should've been sold at a reduced price considering... I was suprised to read that a couple of the shows included here were recorded to 16-track...they all sound like they're recorded on a portable Minidisc Player by someone in the auduence. Hmm...

The eyes of Snuggle Piggy just broke your heart as he saw his blanket get tossed to and fro by the mean thunder storm. There was love, turmoil and a happy ending, complete with a rainbow and good friends. Any child with a blanket or close stuffed animal friend will enjoy and identify with Snuggle Piggy and the Magic Blanket."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Upgrade on the Original Album","review":"I knew I wanted to get this updated CD from this classic movie because of the bonus tracks. I must not have read the customer reviews carefully..... I was extremely pleased with the content and the additional surprises.Those surprises were the extended music to various tracks, such as the first three. There were additionalmusic that lengthened \\"Diamonds Are Forever,\\" \\"Bond Meets Bambi and Thumper,\\" and \\"Moon Buggy Ride.\\" Whata pleasant surprise! I'll keep the original CD, but to have the additions is really cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think this is the worst of John Barry's 007 scores...","review":"I never really enjoyed the music during the film (nor, for that matter, did I enjoy the film!). Very tacky, dated, too much American flavour to the whole thing. Sadly, listening to the extended soundtrack has reminded me only of why I never liked this film!Particularly dislikable tracks included : slumber Inc, The Whyte House, Circus Circus.That whole excessive use of 'vibrato' (?) and other musical techniques sound so dated...I am a huge, huge fan of Barry's other Bond scores, esp You Only Live Twice, and OHMSS, Moonraker and others. I think OHMSS is the best. So wonderful, lyrical, exciting yet wonderfully romantic at times.Sadly, these Diamonds just don't cut it for me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably Fantastic Score Highly Recommended","review":"This CD has all of the soundtrack from the movie.I was amazed at how inadequate the original release was. I can actually visualize the scene in the movie as I listened to the CD. The remastering was noticebly improved. Some CD parts include Bond dangling outside of the Whyte House, the Peter Franks fight.This CD is so complete it even includes the sound effects when the women transforms into a Gorilla at Circus Circus. To sum it up James Bond, John Barry fans should love this one,I think it is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth 50 dollars not worth 20","review":"i got 1 of the giant things a few years ago it dosnt hold together and u have to take iit apart to transform it almost nothing works right =/ u shouldnt get it a collect transformers i have atlest 50 all r good but this 1 it crap so dont buy it i warn u!!!!!!!!!!!!1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst transformer EVER","review":"THIS IS NOT FUN AT ALL.

He got it - and was extremely disappointed. I was ready to throw it out the window just trying to get it out of the box!!!! The packaging is absolutely ridiculous - there was too many twist ties and too much tape! It took 1/2 hour just to get the thing free. Also, my son swears that in the TV commercial (I didn't see it) that Unicron talks - the toy does not. Try explaining advertising tactics to an upset child on Christmas morning. He hasn't touched the thing since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be careful!","review":"A terrific Generation 1 (or any generation) Transformers toy. this is a black-version of the previously issued Orange Armada toy, with the exception that this appears to be black and has a missile launcher from the chest. Be careful though, TOYS R' US seems to have gotten a whole bunch of their ENERGON UNICRON boxes mis-packed with the ORANGE ARMADA UNICRON. other than the mis-packing (which may or may not prove collectible in the long run), this black version is generally produced in much lower quantities than the first orange version. A MUST BUY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Repaint!","review":"I know a lot of Transformers fans hate repaints, but I'm not one of them. I like a lot of the repaints, and, in my opinion, THIS ONE ROCKS! Great repaint of an already cool toy! I haven't transformed Energon Unicron yet (it's tricky; I could do it, but it's not worth the trouble when he's so much more fun in robot mode!), but his robot mode kicks butt! While I certainly enjoyed the Armada Unicron (especially since his paint job matched the Movie version), I like this one better. The cool neon green, orange, & black make him more menacing a make for a much cooler looking toy. He has MAJOR articulation (wish he could bring his hand to his mouth, though, so I could pretend he's devouring TFs like in the Movie or issue #75 of the Marvel comic book, though.). One of the best TFs ever, and, either in its Armada or Energon version, worth getting! BTW, the Energon version may be hard to find, because A LOT of Energon Unicron boxes have the Armada Unicron packed inside instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toy purchase for my money ever!","review":"For all of you who had trouble transforming Unicron, you need to talk to my six year old. He got the yellow one last year for Christmas and has played with it literally almost every day since. He was able to transform it right away all by himself without instructions because he can't read yet. He puts it in planet mode and back to robot mode over and over again. He loves it so much that he is begging for the black Unicron for his birthday. He doesn't want anything else. The only flaw was that the horns did break off easily, but that hasn't stopped him from playing with it anyway. Although I thought it was quite expensive, it has been worth the money and I think I'm going to get him the black one for his birthday."},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't register","review":"I got two of these as replacements. Kind of wish I'd just spent the money on a new set. One of them never registered, and is just a paperweight now.

However over the last year and 3 months I have bought atleast four cartridges and one refill set...and I have printed maybe 5000 sheets of black and white pages. Never used it for color printing but now the printer is dead- in other words there are too many white lines etc making it almost impossible to use it for final printing.Tried all the tricks in the manual. Staples was kind enough even to replace the cartridge but didnt help. So i have to get rid of it. You decide whether you think this is value for your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lexmark Color JetPrinter Z11","review":"This is an excellent printer for the price.

Part of the old-school revival with Jurassic 5, Blackalicious, Non-Prophets, et al., Later That Day... oozes funk as sticky as molasses and as authentic as Afro Sheen with smooth production that suits the often innocent late seventies/early eighties sound. Less spiritual but more graphic than the Gift Of Gab, Lyrics Born has a better flow to his precise rhymes than the river Thames. The album has a distinct sound of a man raised on Earth, Wind & Fire, the Ohio Players, and Funkadelic who is determined to do his influences justice as opposed to Snoop Dog and the like who preach respect of those gone before but exploit it to the worst of their ability. So those who enjoy topical lyrics and honest music would be advised to pick this up or forever hold your piece [like a gun...get it?]."},{"rating":"2","title":"If hip-hop still was funky..........","review":"This album has some fresh tracks on it.. Hello and Callin' Out are both hot, hot, hot. Throw those tunes on and ladies and gents will dance. Baby!There are a few weaker tunes on the disc - but you can tell Lyrics definately put a LOT of time and energy into this album. His spliff-soaked voice is an octave higher than TonLoc's - but it's got the same feel to it. \\"Get down! Get down!

Throw this thing on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sample this album before buying!!!!!!","review":"I made the huge mistake of buying this albumn before actually listening to him at all. I bought this albumn stricky off of reviews and interviews i read. I wasted 15 bucks on something i will never listen to fully and i am a huge underground hip hop fan... but this is almost not even hip hop.... he sounds like a mix between Whitey ford and Kid Rock meets instrumental hip hop ...on crack. if you are looking for a lyricist look somewhere else...there is more singing on this albumn then anything...This is just an opinion but it speaks the truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"anotha quannum brotha does it again","review":"Well lets look at this album and compare it to lyrics born of the past, damn his delivery and all out lyrical skill has greatly approved, he didnt sell out and start aiming his songs toward the mainstream like blackalicious did. He also produced this album which i must say is masterful. The beats are tight and if you buy this album you will definitely want to bob your head to every track. So for those underground heads that sleep on this album, you might as well go listen to 2 quarters, i mean 50 cent. Cause lyrics born does stuff that only those mainstream C-rappers dream of being able to do. Even better yet, if lyrics born comes to a town near you, go see the show, i promise you wont want to leave, and besides, usually Joyo Velarde is with him and damn she is one fine singer, and not just her voice neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern hiphop classic!","review":"THIS IS A DOPE ALBUM!!!!

Malhar gives an unmistakable feeling of the rain -- the clouds clashing with each other, the sound of the rain drops, the dullness and confinement created by the rain, the pangs of separation... Structurally, this Raga is very difficult to be played an an open string instrument like Santoor but the effects created by the maestro are just amazing.

Honestly, they could pass as a Sabbath cover band pretty easily. The vocals are almost dead-on Ozzy with a bit more of a \\"grrunt\\" sound. That being said - they do it extremly well. This album is full of hooks - and that's what won me over. The songs get stuck in your head. Definitely worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually...","review":"These guys are very bad. I saw them live with Dio and Anthrax (two actually good bands) and they sucked bad. Every one of their songs were the same... bad. Not only was not a single person in the crowd there for this band, they practically got boo-ed off the stage. The only time anyone cheered was when they mentioned Dio and left the stage.Everyone else who wrote a review for this cd must be a member of the band because nobody who listens to metal could enjoy this. There are hundreds of better bands than this so think twice if you are considering buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta have more cowbell!","review":"I love this sound!It is a nice amalgam of Sabbath and early Monster Magnet.Is it the most origional thing in the world?

And amongst all the retro/stoner rock groups out there these guys are not reliant on funny cliches about drugs or psyhedelic imagery, you know, the kind of [stuff] you hear on so many stupid 'sabbath worship' bands. What stands out the most on this album is the guitar riffs which make me think vaguely of Black Sabbath (like a lot of these bands) but more melodic and upbeat along the lines of Captain Beyond. No overkill on distortion or fuzz here, the tone is rather crisp. Rota's vocals remind me vaguely of Josh Homme's, easy on the ears but steady.

I found it book boring and predictable. A Total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regency romp--with vampires","review":"This was the first Teresa Madeiros book I've read, and her skillful plotting, dry humor and appealing characters make a satisfying package.Ms. Madeiros takes the standard romance trope of impoverished heroine, handsome hero hiding a Dark Secret thrown together in a mysterious castle and makes it new. The spirited repartee between the main characters, some nicely handled misunderstandings and a shadowy Really Bad Guy it will take everyone's united forces to defeat make for a highly entertaining read.The strength of this book is in its economy. There is nothing extraneous and nothing that does not further the plot. There are some liberties taken with 19th century mores and class distinctions, but they're all in aid of the delightful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best","review":"I don't think this book is as good as her usually wonderful stories. The hero I felt we didn't really get to know that well, her usual Hero's have more play it seemed to me. Also, this story seemed very predicable in comparison to her creative twists.Considering how much I adore her writing this wasn't that bad. I just don't think it was her best. The next book that takes after this one looks like it will be a step up. This book followed tradition in the sense that her background characters shined in it.I thought the vampire idea was fabulous and she did it just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"So frustrating","review":"I really like the style that Medeiros has shown in the past, but this plot left me cold. I was waiting for an interesting twist as to why the hero was nocturnal. Instead I get the ridiculous scenario I got (no plot revelation despite those of others).

I like historical fiction that makes me feel like I've experienced a different era, not implausible nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?????","review":"I have been a fan of Teresa Medieros for years but this is the worst sort of fluff I have ever read. I really expected much better from this author. Her other older books are really great but this was absolutely atrocious. The sub story of the sister was more interesting.

After midnight is certainly not up to these standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually pretty good","review":"I'm a former fan, I had stopped reading her books years ago after being disappointed by the time travel witch books she wrote years ago.

Three-fourths of the book is a plant reference, and most of the plants are not cold hardy below 20 degrees Fahrenheit, making about half the book wasted paper as far as I am concerned. Also, a lot of xeric standards for this region are missing.If you can, check the map on pages 2-3 to make sure that you live in the Low or Middle regions (as I write this, the map is included in the scanned pages here on Amazon, but isn't displaying properly). For the High region, I recommend instead any of the books by Judith Phillips, who writes toward climates that are slightly wetter and somewhat cooler than the ones that are the focus here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Desert Landscaping","review":"This is a great book for the desert landscaper.

Some people might not like this, but I like that I can still hear what's going on around me when I'm listening to music. The headphones fold up into a very compact form, which is convenient for carrying them in your pocket. The only problem is that the little joint at the top of the head band stands out. It feels a little uncomfortable to have this joint jutting into your head, but it's a relatively minor problem. The joint is necessary, because it allows the headphones to fold up, but you can feel it when wearing the headphones.Overall, I would recommend them because of their great sound quality and folding ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound but not a snug fit","review":"I bought this headphone set because of the reviews that said it was great for the gym. The sound is very good and they fold easily to fit in my pocket or bag. However, if you are working out and bend over - you're going to be picking this 'puppy' up off of the floor! The headphones are very comfortable, but not nearly snug enough to stay securely on your head. (And I don't have a real small head) This is the only reason that I rated it at 4 stars - certainly not because of the sound quality.

Kind of a Hooker-ish guitar line, and that deep, drawling tone of voice, quite alright with me.John did pick some interesting covers: Freddie Hart's \\"Easy Lovin'\\" got a very different workout, somewhere between country and blues, Tom Waits' \\"Gin Soaked Boy\\" and a couple of George Jones tunes, \\"Color of the Blues\\" and \\"Just One More.\\"Augie Meyers and David Hidalgo (Los Lobos) figured in the recording and it's really a good recording.

Hammond also manages to cover two Wait sounding tunes written by David Hildago of Los Lobos's for his blues side project \\"Houndog\\". The two tunes are \\"No Chance\\" and \\"I Brought The Rain\\". Throw in a little country, \\"Easy Living\\" a little Willie Dixon, \\"Same Thing\\", Mick Jagger's \\"Spider and the Fly\\", one original \\"Slick Crown Vic\\" and some odds and ends and you have another Hammond success.

I'm actually fine with cursing, but to this extent is annoying. This author is obviously a writer, so she should have some creativity. It is geared mostly to butches and girls interested in butches. The material is very very basic. If you've ever been with a woman, butch or other, you will know these things. This would include summer camp at 11.

This comes pretty close to being a perfect fit. Diverse enough to be interesting, with a smooth enough flow between most tracks to not destroy a mood, this is on of the better chill out compilations. With some nice jazz touches at some places, smooth soundscapes at others, whispers, voices and occasional vocals weaving through the textures. I'm not familiar with many of the artists represented here, but the vast majority of the tracks fit just fine. Even some of the suprises work well, like the No-Man track Only Rain (No-Man comes from a somewhat different genre if you could call it that, but compliments this compilation well)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fancy watch but not good as a dive computer","review":"Kind of disappointed.

If not, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"First class","review":"One of the earliest, and very well written, accounts of life on the upper Missouri River. This is a classic of the fur trade era. Bradbury, a botanist, went up the Missouri with the famous Astorian overland expedition of William Price Hunt, Ramsay Crooks, Donald McKenzie, naturalist Thomas Nuttall and others in 1811. His descriptions of Indian life, geology, botany, geography and overall life as it was in 1811 being so far removed from civiliztion is incredible. He was a very articulate and keen observer of the world around him. Bradbury gives further insight into Manuel Lisa, John Colter, Henry Brackenridge, trading with the Indians, etc. The last chapter he devotes to the soon to be mass immigration into the western parts of the United States. His thoughts on this are ahead of his time. There is simply too much good to say about this timeless masterpiece. The book itself may be somewhat difficult to find, but it is worth looking for.

I unplugged both the parent and child units for the monitor, but my phone is still not working. The phone is downstairs in the kitchen and both units were upstairs in the bedrooms. My phone has never shown OUT OF RANGE in the 12+ months that I have had it.

If you are like me, you research and review purchases like this one. This is the fourth baby monitor we have bought and is by far, the very best. I can't imagine having any problems with this. No static, great reception and great features. The rechargeable \\"no memory\\" batteries are wonderful. You do not have to wait until they are running low to recharge. We use the battery power during the daytime nap and then plug in each night. You'll love it! The parent unit \\"finding\\" button is nice, but the parent unit needs to be on for it to operate.

Well it does have good range but there is so much static and interference that I can hardly stand to use it. I called The First Years customer service because I thought there had to be something wrong with it and they simply said, if you have a 2.4 GHZ cordless phone in your house, this monitor is not for you. I wish I knew that before I got it! I got it as a gift, don't have the box anymore and have to go out and buy a new one. I told the customer service rep that I also have a 900 MHZ phone in my house and she said then I need to get a monitor that is not in that range either.

Since the monitor and the phones are on the same frequency, the result is a constant static/clicking noise that is horrible. One solution: unplug the phones at night (or when you're using the monitor)... but make sure you have an \\"old fashioned\\", corded phone close by in case you get an incoming call. Also, if you decide to unplug the phones, you'd have to reset the date & time every day if the main unit has an answering machine built-in.

Considering how expensive this monitor is, I wish I had shopped around a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was so excited when I first bought this baby monitor. After using it only a few times, the parent unit started making constant clicking sounds. No matter how high the volume is set, the clicks continue just as loud as before. It is annoying to say the least. With that said, I also found that I couldn't hear the baby as clear as with my older 900 megahertz monitor. Unfortunately, we threw away the packaging when we first opened it, or else I'd take it back and get my $60.00 refunded. We never use it. If you buy this model, don't throw the box away until your sure it'll work properly for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much interference!","review":"I purchased this monitor because of the 1500 ft. range and, of course, the rave reviews. I was very disappointed when I plugged it in. The clicking, static &amp;amp; hum was so bad I could hardly hear my son in his room. I found out the problem........the monitor was interfering with my V-Tech 5.8 GHZ cordless phone. (Even thou the monitor was only a 2.4 GHZ) So the monitor had to be returned. One of the only times I can sit and enjoy a peacefull phone conversation is at nap time. That is when I would be relying on the monitor. The search for a good monitor continues...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"I paid a lot of money for this and it worked ok - while it worked. I dropped the parent unit on the floor once: it fell from my waist onto a wooden floor and it never worked again.

My baby was left in his crib crying for the first time in his life due to this. 3 times it happened!

Although we did not have any problems with the two monitors interfering, this monitor has so much static that it is barely functional. I don't see any improvement in the range over our original First Years monitor that we owned and loved. The static of this Clear and Near monitor is so horrible some nights that it makes sleeping difficult. We have debated throwing it out and starting again many times, but given how much we paid for it we haven't done it yet.

Please, don't believe the beeping is a small fluke. I'm on my second parent unit, and it's begun doing the same thing. (Last night at 2am, actually.) It sounds like a high-decibel smoke detector going off. I actually tried to rip down my smoke detector the first night the monitor acted up, because I thought the smoke detector was malfunctioning. Of course, it was the monitor. This isn't a small inconvenience, it wakes you up with your heart racing and is very, very disruptive to the household. They really should take the item off of the market until the problem is resolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much interference, not enough range","review":"I put this monitor on my registry thinking it would be an improvement over the Sony monitor I have for my 2 1/2 year old. Well, I was definitely wrong. I had so much static. The monitor picked up every creak and sound in the house, except the baby. When the forced air heat came up it made the nursery sound like a wind tunnel. And I had to hold the monitor up to my ear to try to hear over that noise to hear the baby. The last straw was the interference. When the only noise was static, and the monitor was out of range less than 20 feet from the base, I had to sleep on the floor of the nursery to ensure my baby's safety. I returned this peice of junk and bought the Sony baby call 27 channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This monitor is awesome!","review":"We received two different monitors as baby shower gifts. This monitor is way better thsn the other Fisher Price monitor that I received. There is absolutely no interference with our 2.4 GHZ cordless telephones either! What a great system!

Then at 3:00 a.m. a piercing alarm sounded from one of the new parent units - just as others have described. Bizarre. I don't have a 2.4 Ghz phone or other obvious interference. I'll be returning both monitors unless I get a fix from First Years."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR","review":"Do not waste your time or money on this monitor. As reported in almost every review, the product is defective. The locating device for the \\"parent unit\\" (receiver) will go off for no reason. It is a very loud beeping alarm. I have spoken to the company about this and they claim my \\"child unit\\" (transmitter) is defective. They are sending me a replacement at their cost. I am dubious. Maybe it is interference, as another poster has suggested, but why should I go searching for the cause? And even if I found it, I'd never waste my time unplugging my answering machine every night. There are plenty of other good monitors on the market. I've never had any problems with my Fisher Price Sounds and Lights. You don't need to hear a pin drop in your child's room.

I did not believe the other reviewer and went ahead and ordered this product, thinking \\"How could Leica sell a case that did not fit their camera?\\" I was wrong. This case does *not* fit a D-LUX 3 at all. Moreover, the quality is so poor that Leica should be embarrassed to put their name on it. It feels like it is made of cardboard with a thin layer of leather glued onto it. Even if I were able to force the camera into this case and somehow managed to close the cover, which latches via a magnet, the camera could easily fall out.

I was swayed heavily by the raves written by other reviewers prior to ordering this fan. After a week of living comfortably with it, I was confident enough to toss the packaging out. This turned out to be premature....the fan soon developed an annoying problem. The blade will not rotate unless you start it on 'medium' or 'high' speed. After it runs for a few minutes, you can cut it back to 'low'. I am very disappointed in this development and if I still had the box, it'd be on its way back to Hunter as soon as the weather cools off. Also, being a 'fan' of American-made products, I was also chargrined to find out that, despite the nostalgic tone and 'family pride' found on the packaging, this fan is made in China!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled.

Without warning, it stopped reaching normal speed on M and on L. It often wouldn't even start unless I started it on high first. Now, any speed other than high is barely a whisper. I contacted Hunter (which happens to be a local company here), they said the fan cannot be serviced. Well of course not. Things aren't made to be serviced; they're made to be replaced. Ridiculous. I'll try to see if it's worth taking it to a small appliance repair shop. On a related note, I also had to return a programmable thermostat manufactured by Hunter. Total junk.

Dirac makes minimal assumptions about the reader's prior education (appropriate, since the first edition was published in an age when a thorough scientific education comprised Homer, Virgil, Euclid, and Newton), so there are none of those annoying allusions of the form, \\"from which, of course, the insights of [famous name X] allow us to conclude that ...\\" In fact, there are extremely few footnotes of any kind, and they are not needed, as this work is neatly self-contained.Dirac is marvelously careful in calling attention to the guesses he makes along the way, so the careful reader can see what Dirac's premises are as well as what can be logically derived from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but HARD!!!!!","review":"A lot of stuff in the beginning is accessible and some of the later stuff is possibly accessible if you've had a great teacher who followed this book (and they won't because they find it excessively hard themselves) in their course work. Even Feynman said \\"They had these great formulations in Dirac's book and in Heidler's. I couldn't quite read the books. They were too hard for me. \\". So if you are lulled into complacency that understanding everything that's in the book is something that you'll carefully read page by page, you are kidding yourself. A lot of the stuff is simply ruminations on research that PAMD was doing then and some of it that wasn't. Anyway, its a QM book for the mathematically proficient. A QM book for researchers and mathematicians. For all else, there's Shankar and Griffiths. However, I'd pick up the book for Chapter 1 alone.

On the face it claims to disprove Evolution in lieu of Creation.

It is propaganda, plain and simple. The fallacious arguments put forth in this book are hardly worth refuting if you have any actual understanding of the science of evolutionary biology, but for the average, non-scientific individual this book pulls out every dirty bit of sleight of hand there is to convince them of it's message: evolution is evil and atheistic, creation is the only answer.They misquote people, misrepresent evidence, quote quacks and frauds, play games with probabilities, claim that scientists \\"don't know\\" things that have been known for decades, and do an awful lot of hand-waving to distract the reader from the fact that they are not making any sense.A horrific crime against reason and dignity.

If I were leaving for that desert isle, I think this might be the Mozart set I'd take. It's not a big name label, probably only a few hundred people in the world will bother to pick it up - but they're the ones in the know.

I thank God that after 25 years someone can still lift praises to the Most High and share their praise with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A special treat for long-time Walter Hawkins fans...","review":"After 25 years, Bishop Walter Hawkins proves that the fire of the Holy Spirit is still alive and well in him and in the Love Center Choir. This first of this 2 CD set introduces new tunes by the Love Center Choir which are sure to join the long list of standards and favorites from years and years gone by. In addition, the second disc reuinites members from the original Love Center Choir for joyous covers of some of their best-loved songs. With the exception of some sound problems and a bit of confusion with the song titles as listed in the liner notes, this is an excellent production, well worth adding to any Walter Hawkins collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaf Canister","review":"This product seems to have a problem with being airtight. I don't know if it is a defect in the particular one that I received or if it is a problem with all of them. I try to work around it, but it does cause it to float to the top of the water, and possibly may not work as well as it would if it remained near the bottom. However, it does filter out large debris, such as leaves, pine needles, and twigs. It does not filter smaller debris, so I have added a cloth bag from an old venturi vacuum devise, which does filter smaller debris quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hayward Pool Vac","review":"This pool vac standard leaf canister by Hayward is a well made product.It does an excellent job, altho I wish the openings in the basket were a little smaller, to catch the small things.

I've seen some pictures of it with long-end 1-1/4\\" hoses inserted inside and I'm going to track down one of those hoses to try.

This book offers practical advice on expanding your spiritual life in a way that is not tied down by the strictures of the Christian Church (I'm not attacking the Church, but some people want the freedom to seek an alternative).

It is, though, a great resource for understanding the inspirations in his life, and his trademark style shines well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"As a fan of Frederick Buechner, I found this volume in our church library and secured it anticipating a summer weekend of ecstasy, reading this book on the back porch while sipping lemonade. I found it disappointing, as he focuses on his collection of Buechner family memoribilia. As hard as he tries to universalize it, making it accessible to all of us, for me, it just didn't work.

Anyone who thinks The Obituary Writer is a book you sit down and read once and that's it, is not reading so well. Sometimes reading takes a little work, especially when it comes to restraint and subtlety. (But then, I don't believe that readers should be lazy.)Here's a thought: you don't have to write a spew-all non-edited-Zadie Smith type-Rushdie-knockoff to have a full and deep book.I read The Obituary Writer a couple of months ago and it's still in my mind, especially Gordie Hatch the main character and also that ending! (Hey, a couple people gave away the ending in their reader reviews. That's not cool!!) In an intriguing way, the smoothness of this book is a challenge because it's deceptive. Because the events and characters sure are not quick/easy to read/ smooth.I think this book deserves some major props!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good start but doesn't deliver","review":"I found this book on the shelf of a used bookstore and was immediately intrigued. I identified with the main character of \\"The Obituary Writer\\", young aspiring journalist Gordie Hatch, following in the footsteps of his father - an accomplished newspaper man whose life and career were cut short. But after the first forty pages the story line turns predictable, the dialog clunky, and the characters fail to develop. Shreve is a talented writer that keeps you turning the pages but the novel never delivers to its potential. The novel is reminiscent of Raymond Chandler and so my hopes were high. In the end I concluded that this was written more as a movie script than a serious novel. It was close, but no cigar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, easy, entertaining","review":"Porter Shreve's Gordie keeps the reader moving throughout.The writing is simple, yet deft and the reader will appreciate the subtle humor while becoming close with Gordie's obsessive habits and destructive decisions. Although exaggerating somewhat, Shreve does an excellent job of detailing a journalist's ambitions and using them to carry the story.Since the entire book can be read in a lazy Sunday, I recommend it to anyone wanting a few hundred pages of pleasant mind candy.... I felt Shreve abandoned some crucial aspects of the book while introducing others only halfway.Overall, though, it's a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well-developed","review":"This book seems like an outline for a novel.

His next phrase was \\"Mommy stuck\\" and the screams began. Ok, now, I know I am a good mother but I laughed because this was ridiculous. 45 minutes later it became scary that an emergency room visit was in my future. This thing was not coming off his skull.

We have another seat that fits onto your regular toliet that is really cushy. She just loves that one and is very comfortable by the padding there and can sit for up to 25-30 minutes while I read her books, but she can't even sit for a 30 seconds on the little potty. She also has red marks on her behind from the seat. Great price but uncomfy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsturdy","review":"I like the fact that my son can use the seat as a toilet, and then my nephew when he comes over can use the stepstool to reach the big toilet.

I liked the 3-in-1 features. But now I see two major downfalls: 1) As others have commented, it may be too small for some kids. The bowl does not have a large opening, so in many cases you child may not get lined up just right (especially boys). 2) This is the reason that finally made me get a new one-- I really don't like how you have to take it apart and use it upside down as a step stool. My son \\"throws\\" it apart about 10 times a day to use it to get to the sink.I just bought one that has a lid that functions as the step stool instead, and it's working out much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"TINY TINY","review":"We bought this seat for my 2.5 year old son, who is tall and skinny. I tried to sit him on the seat and he fits but can't pee into it.

The biography is full of Southern Gothic characters as someone else here wrote, including Toole himself, but most noteably his mother and father. Really, it's a glimpse of life one generation ago in New Orleans as much a look at a strange and fascinating man and how he constructed his life in the face of a mother that seemed to exemplify the words: stage mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Desecration: Ignatius Rising","review":"This pseudo-biography is filled with misinformation, with misquotes (for example, attributing a Poe poem to the wrong story) and to the wildest kind of speculation.

If you are a fan of Toole's work and life, this is not the place to get your info. The majority of the work is neither footnoted nor substantiated in any way. There are a tremendous amount of assumptions, speculations, and what appear to be outright fabrications, that would paint Toole to fit their convenient image.

After he became concerned that this resource seemed to conflict with most of his other sources, his mother and I began to scan through the Meltzer biography. We didn't find an unbiased review of Carnagie's life building the foundations of America's infrastructure and steel industry. We didn't find praise for his significant philanthropic support for libraries, learning and art. We found an unremittingly negative slant on virtually all aspects of Carnagie's life which sounded less like biography and more like socialist rant. Meltzer certainly has a message in this book- all capitalism is a self-serving, arrogant and socially destructive force. Meltzer is free to advance his revisionist diatribe for any mature readership- but not to my eighth-grade child.I do not recommend this book to anyone as anything but propaganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT","review":"I had a miss fire code indicating that one of my engine cylinders was out.

This book has a number of good qualities such as one fly pattern per page, large print( for us older fishers), and a good description of the fly and the process. However , all of this is overshadowed by the absence of colour photos of the flies. This could have been accomplished by including a colour photo on each page or at the very least several pages of colour photos for reference.

The details of the story seem pretty appropriate for the time, if not totally true to life (I don't think any 21st century woman would be comfortable in the totally true to life shoes of a regency woman), Ms Matthews' heroines don't act like modern women or assume modern viewpoints, but they aren't passive either. The heroes are very likable from the start (no arrogant aristocrats that suddenly become nice guys at the end - not that these can't be fun) and there aren't pages and pages of explicit details on anyone's love life.

If you are interested enough in the making of the Musashi that this book would appeal to you, then you probably already know more than the book offers.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Georgeous Watch","review":"My new watch appears to be both beautiful and durable.

It is pro big business and does not take the critics of advertsing seriously. There is little historical analysis either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sound, confortable, reasonable price","review":"I bought these to use with a laptop computer and they work well. They are small enough to fit in the laptop bag without taking up too much room. The frequency response and tonal quality is good enough for watching movies or listening to music on a portable media player, and they are comfortable to wear. I can't stand earbuds, so if you are like me and insist on over-the-ear headphones for a portable media player, these will work well. The cord isn't very long, so plan on using them with an extension cord if you are going to be more than a couple of feet away from the sound source. For the under-$10 price, the build and sound quality are as good as any of the other similar Sony portable headphones I have owned over the last 20 years or so. I have owned other brands of similar portable headphones and mostly they aren't as comfortable, and feel flimsier, than Sony's, and the sound isn't as clean, even when they cost somewhat more. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great","review":"Bought these since our great room is open to the upstairs bridge and TV sound travels at night into the bedrooms.

I recommend them as an inexpensive headset for use with cell phone, but not for us with computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphones for music listening","review":"Because this headphone set is so inexpensive, I will give it 2 stars. However, the audio sound is quite weak, therefore, the set really should receive 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value from sony","review":"These headphones lack the sound quality of my sony mdr-nc50's but they cost about 1/10th the price. The sound is good especially for listening to books or talk radio/tv. At $9.99 a pair you can't go wrong. They're great for traveling and camping or for any occasion where the possibility of loss or damage lurks. I've owned Koss and Aiwa but the sony prevails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum for Sony","review":"I don't care to spend a lot of money on my headsets for the abuse they go through on my commute on the train daily. I use them to listen to tv shows on my train ride. In the past I have bought even cheaper pairs of Coby branded headsets that I have actually thought had pretty decent sound quality, but they are made out of a cheap plastic that I break every so many months. I decided to try a slight upgrade to this pair, but the sound quality is way too tiny and not full enough. Back to the cheaper Coby brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"These are not high end studio earphones.

And things anyone can use like introducing a new kitten, breaking bad litter pan habits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing book","review":"Having recently purchased a Persian I thought this book would be a great place to start - how wrong I was! Only 2 pages dedicated to their behaviour and understanding them so not much use at all to me really. Also it is important to note that (apparently) European Persians have a tendency to have very different personalities to US ones, also in the US Persians are less likely to be 'extreme' (i.e. flat faced).No information at all on special the dietry requirements of a Persian(in the UK, premium foods such as Hills, Jameswellbeloved etc are recommended by the experts, but no mention of this in book).Lots of breeder information which is great if you want to breed but it only relates to the USA. Probably a book worth 2 out of 5 in you live in the states, but for UK or European readers i'd give this book a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally different","review":"I actually loved this book. I found the darkness of the romance to be totally different from all the other stories I've read over the years. Personally, I felt the characters were genuine. I felt they both changed by the end of the book and found that satisfying. Some readers take issue that he \\"raped\\" her in the beginning, but I did not think that was the case. It was not like in so many other romance novels where the hero REALLY rapes the heroine - holding her down and forcing her. There is nothing violent about their encounter. I dislike rape storylines. This, to me, was not one of them.I encourage readers to give this story a chance. Read it for yourselves and draw your own conclusions from this \\"dark\\" romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting plot, Engrossing Hero and Heroine","review":"Well after reading so many \\"dark\\" comments about this book I truly expected it to be so overbearingly DARK that I almost didn't purchase it.Well I must say that I'm glad that I did. The plot is one that is incredible. The Hero is such a unlikeable person from the start of this, his reasons for helping the heroine out are purely selfish. It was nice to picture the evolution of this Heroine though she had become invisible even to herself that to see her transformation, was one of the better parts of this book as well as the transformation of the Hero.I don't wish to say to much about the storyline the other reviews on Amazon does justice to the plot but I must say this definately a Keeper.Happy Reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"He's a monster","review":"The \\"hero\\" rapes the heroine multiple times.

The characters of Rachel and Sebastian are very complex.The love scenes are disturbing and highly erotic. Actually sitting in front of a fan while you read, may not be a bad idea.

In addition, it has a great battery life and is packaged very well. However, it does not do a very good job of shaving. I found myself spending more time shaving in the morning and not getting a good shave. I would then have to follow-up my shave with a regular blade, to clean-up the patches it missed.Bottom Line: Excellent at cleaning the razor. Bad at actually shaving your face."},{"rating":"1","title":"close, but . . .","review":"I've tried several times to give this thing three stars, but the interface seems to be a piece of junk.

This gozmo is as good as any Ive tried. I get as close a shave as I can manage with a blade, and with a lot less trouble. The self-cleaning mechanism is very cool, though I'll have to buy refills for it once a month or so . . . haven't checked out how much those will cost yet.The shave's no worse than I get with anything else, but I was hoping for something significantly better. Maybe I'll go back to just having a beard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"I had this shaver for only a few weeks and the charging stand/cleaner stopped working and engaging the shaver.This is a terrible design and overpriced!!!Worst thing I have bought this year.

While the shaver itself is the best on the market, the cleaning mechanism does not work as it should. The spring latch breaks and will not allow you to charge or clean the shaver. Read some of the other reviews. I'm not the only one experiencing this obvious design flaw. I was very dissappointed and have returned it to Amazon.com. I also called Braun customer service to register a complaint. The engineers on this product need to go back to the drawing board. They have the potential for a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great razor, but...","review":"I love how close this razor gets and how the cleaning system does a great job. BUT, if you plan on buying any of the braun syncro shavers be VERY careful(on the cleaning system part)when you press the blue release button. If you push the button while even just barely holding it down, the spring will break inside the machine and there is no way to open it up to fix it. I have broken two of them already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have had 2 break in a year.","review":"I have had two of these razors. They shaved well enough but 4 months into use with my first it started to get really loud and not shave well at all.

Recently the battery started to perform abnomally. I decided to purchase a refurbished one of the same model when I had a trip to go. Unfortunately after four times it was used with about three minutes for each time, the battery was dead. I am very disappointed at it because I totally unexpected this to happen. I suspect that they did not change the battery when they refurbished it.Of course now I want to know if the battery is new for the refurbished device. I will not buy it if the battery is not replaced with a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great shaver for its time, but that time is now up","review":"For under $70, this is not a bad price for a shaver of this design with LCD display and side pulsing technology. But this is just the shaver by itself. It does not come with the cleaning station it was originally packaged with. But even worse, it does NOT come with the charging cord! I checked with the supplier. You get ONLY the shaver. This is being sold as a replacement unit.Besides, this is the older 7000 series model, several generations behind the latest Braun shaver model. Braun has made some really nice improvements at this point. I strongly suggest not wasting your money on this older technology. Invest a few extra $$ and at least get the 8000 series or the newest model. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Shave, Bad Cleaning System","review":"I am convinced that a lot of these reviews are written by people on the Braun payroll. I've had the system for about 18 months. It never did a good shaving job. It missed a lot of hairs. Now the cleaner stopped working and I am stuck with all these extra cartridges and replacement blades. Shame on Braun. They used to make a good razor, but not anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"First, I'm reviewing the book, not the movie as those above seem to be doing.Zane Grey is hit and miss. I don't like Riders of the Purple Sage (which seems to be the book by him most people read first), but this is one of the great ones.You really feel for the hero (and heroine) of the story and Grey really brings to life of freight haulers who made settling the west possible.For comparison, I also really like Twin Sombreros and Knights of the Range (about Brazos Keene)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on personal finance!","review":"Hoxton manages to transform complex personal financial concepts into easy to understand axioms.

After reading them I still felt like I didn't have a strategy and didn't know where to begin. Hoxton's book is different. It is concise and easy to read. It has great examples written from a common sense standpoint. After completing it you feel like you have a financial strategy roadmap and you know what to do next. Let's face it, most people DON'T want to know every last technical detail of what makes a great financial plan work but they DO want to know the details to the point where they can distinguish between risky/bad advice and prudent/good advice. Hoxton's book educates you quickly on what you need to know so that you do not have to suffer through bad financial advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Interesting","review":"This book is a fascinating account of not only union busting but a man's descent into greed.

Thumbs up !"},{"rating":"2","title":"after a few days hard use","review":"I've used this light for a good 20 or so hours. It works well, I really like it so far. I would have given it 5 stars but for two things. The hook could be a touch better but this is not really bad. Secondly, when the battery becomes discharged the light just shuts off. I believe this is common with these kinds of lights. A warning of some sort like an induced flicker or a beep would be great. If you are going into a totally dark hole or area, bring a backup light just in case you run out of juice with this one. I recommend this light but it is made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps going off - won't stay lit.","review":"Bought this as part of a set - worked well to start with then light kept going off at crutial moments.

The ballast was defective and the light will have to be sent in for repair. I assume that this is an exception for DeWalt products. Very disappointing.Update: I took the light to 125 Tools Inc. in Plaistow, NH, a local DeWalt service center. They replaced the base and I have not had any problems with the replacement. I am happy with the light as well as my other DeWalt tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed crazy/ price increase","review":"Aside from longer battery life i see no advantage for this light as it does not provide enough DIRECTED light and is expensive now as amazon raised the price from $23 to $50 , that is over 100%!

My only wish is that Melissa & Doug could make this a sliding case so there would be a place to store those 30+ magnets (ABCs + numbers) that inevitably get scattered.

The board shipped quickly, but she was unable to use the chalkboard because the chalk just took the paint off the board and left little to no chalk on the board. It is completely useless to her because she is too young to be trusted with the dry erase markers. I would suggest buying a different chalkboard if that is what you are going for.

The layout with the screen on the back is useable, but a bit akward. You have to use the same finger (R thumb) for both zooming and rec/stop. More importantly, you generally have to use two hands, unlike the typical one-handed strap designs on most cams. So don't expect to use it while bike riding unless you like to ride no hands. STILLS: The still capability is cool but don't expect to use it for more than email-grade snapshots. DV cams are designed for motion, and the resolution on most is generally only around 0.3 megapixels. BATTERY: As with many cams, the supplied battery is small, so I purchased an OEM double-capacity ... The VL-NZ150 and 155 come with an extra battery (double-capacity). I am happy with the VL-NZ105 and am satisfied that it was a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"qiang wu","review":"I am a Chinese, in pass the mail order's way in Michigan on March 12, in your place address for purchasing first set SHARP DV, now I already return toing China, but SHARP DV however badly, needing fixing, but I can't again go to the United Statesing, pleasing telling my this problem-solving way? if can mailing you fix, pleasing telling me mailing.Please accept our thanks for the trouble you have taken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp VLNZ105U camcorder","review":"This camcorder has a wealth of features and is easy to use.

I couldn't care less about all the other bells and whistles. I used both video cameras to film the same scenes indoors with all the lights turned on and the shades open (from what I've read MiniDv's need lots of light). To my amazement the 8mm had a much better image. The colors were vibrant on the Sony. The colors on the Sharp VLNZ105U were washed out and the skin tones were greyish. I returned it and will probably look at a higher end Sony. The lesson I learned is that it doesn't matter what format the video is stored (MiniDV, Hi8, 8mm) if the optics are not up to par, you will not get a good image.

One major negative about the nipple brush is the wire that it is made out of is rusting at the tip.I would not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sprays water everywhere with standard bottles","review":"Perhaps they should advertise this as the wide mouth bottle brush because everything I read in the reviews is absolutely true. Water gets sprayed everywhere and it is gross. Thank goodness these were given to me and I didn't waste my own money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all purpose brush","review":"Not sure why all the mixed reviews. Maybe due to wide variety of expectations. I LOVE this brush and started using it for cleaning the babies' bottles. It has turned into an all-purpose cleaning tool and has taken the place of my sponge. It dries out well (unlike a sponge) and conveniently stores in the upright position to save me sink room. YES...it does get old and worn over time and the nipple cleaner gets rusty...but such is life. With my every day heavy use, it lasts me about 2-3 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit into Dr Brown bottles and bristles are too stiff","review":"the subject pretty says it all, but this brush doesn't fit into the opening of Dr Brown's bottles and is too short to reach the bottom of an 8 ounce bottle anyway. and the bristles are so stiff that they hurt my hands. and the nipple brush hardly has enough bristles to clean a nipple. poor quality, poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't get the bottle fully clean","review":"The bristles and wand are so stiff that they do not allow for any manuverability. The bottom of the bottle does not get fully cleaned. The rounded outer part of the bottom of the inside of the bottle stays dirty. I wish I could post a picture of the residue left behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Munchkin Deluxe Bottle Brush","review":"I bought this to clean our bottles and it does a very good job. The only issue I have is that the top bristles are starting to flatten and that's probably because I am jamming it in the cup to scrub some things that are stuck to the bottom. Other than that, this does a great job at cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bottle brush","review":"I really like this bottle brush, it's one of the better ones I've used. I love how it stands on it's own, it keeps the brush cleaner than traditional brushes. I would buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for plastic but good for glass","review":"This bottle brush has extremely rough bristles!It scratches up the insides of every plastic bottle I tried it on (including Born Free, Dr.Brown's and Avent).The bristles are so stiff that when you pull the brush out of the bottle neck, it sprays water in a mist everywhere, even with the wide neck bottles.Because the bristles don't hold soap like typical sponge material, I have to reapply soap often.If you use glass bottles, it won't scratch obviously, so this is an okay choice if you don't mind the spray."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't fit in Dr. Brown's bottles","review":"This brush does not fit inside Dr. Browns bottles. It fits in Avent bottles and does a good job, but since I use both Avent and Dr. Browns bottles it isn't ideal. I just wish it were a bit smaller so it fit in Dr. Browns."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!!!","review":"I have been using this brush for years. It is the best, most durable, effecient product. The scution cup attached to the nipple brush is a great feature. I definitely recommend this brush!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jammed thumb","review":"I bought this brush because I feel like I'm constantly trying to figure out how to get my breastmilk bottles free of the milky slim (and smell). At first I didn't think it would even fit in my 5-oz Medela breastpump bottles. It fits. Sort of. But each time I used it I banged up my thumb. Finally I jammed the thumb against the bottle so badly that I couldn't sleep and set up holding ice on my finger half the night. That was a month ago and my finger still hasn't fully recovered. I no longer use this bottle brush. But it did work really well on the bottle, which is why it got more than 1 star. I'm back in the market to find something new. Maybe a cleaning solution to soak?"},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"Very disappointing purchase. The head is too big and doesn't fit in small bottles and the bristles are too hard and squirted everywhere when I used it. The small brush is a little better but the big one is absolutely unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"I use it to wash baby's milk bottle everyday. But it's a little bit too big. You have to force it into the bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible bottle brush for me","review":"I purchased this bottle brush due to not being happy with the Tommee Tippee bottle brush that I had. This brush is terrible and is very difficult to use. The bristles are way too stiff to use with Medela breast pump bottles and there is no way to get the bristles all over the bottom inside of the bottle. It was very difficult to use on my Playtex Vent-aire bottles, as well. I have very weak wrists and hands and this bottle brush just made them hurt worse... The only thing I did like about the brush is the suctioning capability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too stiff","review":"I just replaced my OXO bottle brush with this one, but I like the OXO much better. This one is very stiff, so much so that it is difficult to shove the brush inside the bottle, and pulling it out sprays soap and water all over my counter. I would not buy this again... I'm definitely going back to the OXO next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought a second one... I liked it that much.","review":"1) This brush has been great for cleaning baby bottles.2) The mini brush in the handle is good for cleaning nipples.3) The suction cup is well done.Actually we leave it suctioned to the counter all the time. A simple twist leaves the bottom half on the counter, and then you put it back on the minibrush when you are done.its really a well thought out product, and now we use it on SIGG bottles, nalgene bottles, and many other bottles that we use regularly. It barely fits in a SIGG bottle, by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the money IMHO","review":"I like this brush. I have several. I think it is sturdier than some other brushes. I would like if it were a bit longer, as I use one for cleaning baby goat bottles (they are taller than baby bottles). I also wish the little nipple brush included in the end of the handle would stay put better. When cleaning bottles, you need to twist the brush back and forth to scrub, and this motion also tends to release the little nipple brush in the end. I have lost a brush down in a bottle before, and it can be annoying when the end comes off while cleaning. But as a whole, I like the brush and I use it multiple times daily!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold on suction holder","review":"I like the design of the brush, but the suction part that sticks to the counter or wherever developed some sort of mold. I tried to bleach it and it did nothing to improve the condition of the plastic. If you aren't expecting to use this brush for longer than a month or two, it's fine, otherwise it's a little creepy. I've had mine about a year, but it got the mold after a few months. It stayed on the counter top where there was water but water only. The nipple brush does rust as well. It's too bad because the brush works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE this bottle brush!","review":"Would give this zero stars if I could. Every time I wash a bottle, this brush flings soapy water everywhere--all over the sink, counter, and my face! And the nipple brush is way too thick and the bristles are too hard. A double-sponge bottle brush is what I had before (a sponge tip and sponge at base, with bristles in between), and that's what I'll be going back to. And by the way, the tip of the nipple brush rusts right away, as other reviewers have mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Clean Breast Milk Well","review":"I guess I should have gotten one of those brushes with the sponge at the end because this brush does not completely clean my bottles or nipples. Unlike formula, breastmilk has water resistant fat in it, which this brush does not always clean off. The bristles are too course to clean the bottle and nipples effectively and I end up using a paper towel WITH the handle of the brush to make sure it is fully clean. Also the bristles are so stiff that every time I take the brush out of the bottle, I get soapy suds sprayed all over me! The tip of the nipple brush rusted right away too. I like that the big brush has no metal to rust, so I gave it 2 stars, but I hardly use the big brush besides using the handle to reach down to the bottom of the bottle with my paper towel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"This brush doesn't fit most bottles, you have to push very hard to make it fit, when you pull it out it splashes soap everywhere. The rubber on little brush falls off easily. Don't recommend this brush. It's a terrible design and expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard","review":"I think it's too hard for plastic bottles. I was afraid it would make scars on bottles so stopped using it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and sanitary","review":"This brush cleans really well, and the suction cup is wonderful - very sanitary and convenient. I agree with the reviewers that the brush doesn't go in as easily as others, but the trade-off is a really clean bottle with minimal effort, thanks to the firmness of the bristles. And if you hold the bottle with the opening facing down when pulling out the brush, there really isn't that much spray. As for the issues with rust that other reviewers have mentioned, I haven't had that problem, but I've only been using this brush for a month, so perhaps I'll have to amend my review at a later date. I also use this brush on my wine glasses - it's nice to know I'll be able to keep using it once the bottles are gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't reach the bottom corner","review":"When you use this brush to clean baby's bottles, the first thing that you may notice is that it is very hard to put it into the bottle. You need to push hard in order to do it. Then, the second thing that you may notice is, you can't clean the bottle's bottom corner due to its shape. Its round brush head can not reach that area at all. For these reasons, I will only give this product one-star.The only good thing about this brush is it can stand by itself very well. So you don't need to worry that it will touch any dirty things after you wash it. I give an extra credit for this design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Munchkin Bottle Brush is great, Nipple is terrible","review":"The bottle brush works great, however the nipple brush has a bent metal portion that rusted after it was sitting in water overnight. I realize perhaps I should not have had it in water overnight, however it seems to me that anything made to get wet should not rust. I threw this out next day and bought a cheap plastic brand that will not rust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit through bottles easily","review":"I actually don't like this brush and I'm going to purchase a different 1. The bristles are so stiff that it is very difficult to push it through the bottle (I use Dr. Brown's) and when you pull the brush OUT of the bottle soap suds splatter EVERYWHERE b/c they're flung by the stiff bristles. I like the idea of the nipple brush incorporated into the brush itself though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This brush SUCKS","review":"This brush doesn't even get the bottles clean and trust me I scrubbed quite vigorously. It's too big and the bristles are too stiff for normal bottles and water sprays everywhere when you pull this brush out of a bottle.

Then I purchased the oxo brush which worked much better and also stands up."},{"rating":"1","title":"STIFF bristles can't clean pump parts","review":"The colored bristles on this brush are so stiff that it's unworkable for cleaning Medela pumping pieces or even the Medela bottles -- you can't get it into most of the crevices of your pumping parts or the flanges, and although you can shove hard and get it into the bottles, when you pull it out you get splattered with water and soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes a little push to get it in the bottle","review":"This brush has hard bristles; prepare to give it a \\"good push\\" to get it inside the bottle. I just figured that out after I wrote a bad review. Now I'm editing it to say: yes, it does work but it's too hard. I guess if you forgot to hit the gym just try to clean your bottles with this baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works and fits my medela bottles....","review":"The product is works and fits into medela bottles just fine. I've tried using the non-scratch brushes but its impossible to actually get them in the bottle. The little suction cup on the bottom works fine to store in upright between washes. Just rememeber, you should boil everything about once a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase for 4 oz. bottles","review":"This brush is too thick to fit into the 5 oz.

These tracks have a beginning and an end, where Carpal Tunnel was an experience and should be treated as 1 track, this new album definitely can be broken up. Comparably, the sounds and beats are somewhat orderly as well.

The only things that save this record from being among the worst things released in years are \\"Photosynthesis\\" and \\"Pt. One of the Cowboy Trilogy\\". I don't understand all the great reviews this disc has been getting; it's overproduced bubblegum pop and unfortunately it took $15 of my money to realize that.

When I got the album and listened to it, I haven't yet been able to find any redeeming qualities - good melody hooks, lyrics that connect (like you get with Julian Lennon). There is a track or two that I like, but its just not worth wading through the rest of the songs. I hope his next effort is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean Can't Sing!","review":"This album is virtually unlistenable...if you like Hip hop or 90's music, I'm sure that you could find much better places than a guy who inherited from his Dad only the name, and from his Mom, his vocals....I hope there are no more albums in the works...I'm giving away my copy to my brother who actually likes it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean is coooooool","review":"I have loved this disc since it came out. My friend told me I should listen to the Beatles, the group that Sean's dad was in, to hear where Sean got his influences and I have to say something that a lot of people are thinking but not saying. Sean's music is better than the Beatles. I like the Beatles but I think that Sean is a better songwriter than his dad. \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" is a good song, but \\"Into the Sun\\" is better. I think that Ringo could sing better than Sean, but Sean's knowledge of hip-hop is something that could have made the Beatles a better group. The Beatles just don't have a groove. Their message, Peace, love. etc., was good. I think that Sean can take it further than them. He's kind of like Lenny Kravitz. Paul Mcartney said that all we need is love but Lenny said we should \\"Let Love Rule.\\" I think that Lenny says it in a way that people can understand. Lenny and Sean should do an album together where they rap cool songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a boring combination of sounds, the music drowns Sean","review":"If you took the name off, this album would never sell.

He has no talent whatsoever, like his mother!!1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the sun?....into the bin more like!","review":"I bought this album roughly about the same time I got his half-brother Julian's album 'Photograph Smile'. It doesn't work at all! Sean may have played most of the instruments to some substantial credit but his inability to write or (even worse) sing had me gritting my teeth. Bossa nova, Jazz? what is Sean on? Maybe its the fact that I hate Jazz but to me it seems as if Sean has inherited Yoko's talent and not an ounce of John's. Don't dare compare this to any of John's work because it is in a totally different league altogether. There is no groove, no bite, no melody, nothing!!! 'Mysery Juice' and 'Home' prop up a weak first album to little extent but it is a waste and a feeble attempt to cash in on his fathers good name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money-Waster","review":"Don't waste your money on this one unless you like to hear excruciating, unintentional parodies of Brazilian music, and like a nice dose of self-conscious nonsense masquerading as music. One star is too high, but the lowest rating avaiable to give on this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the?!?","review":"Embarrassing, ludicrous junk. Although I wasn't expecting much, I was still bowled over by the sheer, consistent, seemingly deliberate lack of musicality of every track. Like Julian (who could at least sing!), Sean Lennon is destined for the bargain bins, at best. Worst album of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of Yoko's vocal genetics","review":"He sounds a little like John but I think that can be attributed to the person who produced it. The vocals are almost inaudible and sounds like whispers. Sometimes there is a bit of volume and you think Yoko is singing again (God help us all). I belive the album was produced such that his vocals are not highlighted and that seems to be a good reason.Advice to Sean: Drink a 32oz jar of glass and maybe you can sing acid rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yup","review":"This album's pretty good. I've had it since it came out and I still periodically take it out and play it. The only song I can't listen to is Breeze, that song is simply horrible and I don't know why they put it on the disc. Everything else is really catchy, eclectic, whatever you want to call it: its pretty decent. Something that I put on to relax and maybe fall asleep to and that is all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellowed out tunes, great for any mood","review":"This album is one of my favories because the tumes are so vibrant, and yet i can listen to them in any atmophere"},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique mix of sound and style","review":"\\"Into the Sun\\" demonstrates the very pleasing abilities of Sean Lennon. In his songs, he drifts through a number of music genres, making full use of many different instruments and techniques. Chameleonesque variety, clear in this collection, is a rare and admirable quality in any artist. A refreshing and enjoyable listen overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I don't know what to say. Were it not for his talented parents' names, this record would never have been made. Sean's singing is whiny, and, quite frankly, the music and its accompanying videos just left me really confused. This is terrible! And this is coming from a hardcore Yoko Ono fan! Without John's name and Yoko's money, this CD would never have seen the light of day.And I have a question: an earlier review said \\"If John was so great why didn't he invent hip-hop.\\" Not only does that comment make no sense, but for anyone to insult John Lennon is to commit mortal sin against the Church of Rock 'n' Roll. John Lennon was a genius and anyone who says otherwise is beyond hope of enjoying music. No surprise that that person liked this sad excuse for a CD.Sean, quit while you're behind. Mommy's got enough money to keep you set for life. Please don't insult the listening public any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insubstantial","review":"Poor Sean,seems to have acquired Yoko's artistic talent, which is non-existant.

Biffy Clyro strike a great balance between grunge and emo (is that a real genre?!) and is definately a good bet for someone who likes music along the lines of bush/nirvana etc. what makes them stand out though, is that although they draw comparisons, they have a sound all of their own. great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unoriginal","review":"I have been hearing hype for this band for the past year.

Maybe that's why this jerk has gotten so much press, people don't understand his mystical Eleusinian sensibility and are curious as to what he knows that the rest of us don't. Well, here's a secret I'll be glad to share. Often, people with below average talent or inspiration tend to try to veil their inadequacies in whatever way they can.

On \\"Lamentations\\" the sound is pristine. I think that this album would give someone who is unfamiliar with Tavener an excellent introduction to his unique yet traditional Orthodox voice. So purchase this album, turn off the lights, light a candle next to your favorite religious icon, and let this music draw you into eternity..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Byzantine chant mediated through Tavener,","review":"This would not be one of my favourite Tavener CDs, being a kind of Byzantine/Tavener hybrid but without the input of the english choral tradition which is evident in a lot of Tavener's work. Like all Tavener music, it is highly meditative and evocative, it smells and taste of the East and of transcendence but it does not quite have the hearftelt quality of the Veil of the Temple. It is definitely to be recommended if you are a Tavener fan. If you are new to Tavener, then pick up some of the Naxos CDs instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Seen Worse","review":"Bottom line, it's not very good, but it happens to be the very last film (TV or movies) that Eleanor Parker ever did.

This book is for anyone who loves a good story.Of course all of her books are wonderful. The only thing I don't like about them is that thereisn't enough of them.I also suggest reading her short stories.

I have some news for people out there who aren't aware...Shy women *are* intellegent and they *do* have pride.Even if I do suspend my disbelief or try to think that this book was merely a flight of fancy, it doesn't change the facts. Alexandra is belittled, smothered, and controlled by a husband who seems to have all the earmarks of a sociopath.I realize that most books of this time period are hardly going to be feminist statements. Nor, for the sake of at least *some* realism would I want them to be. Unfortunately, the cruelty seems to be a bit on the extreme side here. The book would have been far more interesting to me if Alexandra had left Jordan, and taken some self-esteem with her. Sometimes love just isn't enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Something!!!!","review":"I LOVE this book. Love defeats pride, there is so much feeling and story in this book.

Ladies did not do that back then, but Alex did!There were moments in the book where I felt so heartbroken, when Alex did, and so happy when Alex did. At the end, when Jordan is bearing his soul to Alex, I wanted to reach in the book and hug him and kiss him, and give him all my love!JM did wonderful with this story.

However, it's THE SAME SOUND. Unless all of your MP3s are of pre-1958 recordings, I would not recommend this adapter for the Treo 700p.

Even though no successful statesman ever behaved like a saint, they often felt compelled to hide their horse trading, scheming and deception behind a facade of morality and high purpose. Nick Machiavelli pulled back the curtain and showed what was really going on. J G A Pocock has drawn another curtain over what happened, a curtain of pompous academic prose. Human motives are more emoptional than intellectual, especially in highly competitive situations like politics and 'statesmanship'. Professor Pocock prefers to remain high in the academic clouds, raining polysyllables down on us. It's a poor read, a poor treatment of an interesting subject, don't buy it. (I must confess, I haven't finished the book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Machiavelli?","review":"This book is a masterful testament to man's ability to become immersed in the importance of the force of history. After reading Pocock, there is no way to deny that this same historical force eclipses everyone in its path. It will be years before speaking or writing about Machiavelli apart from his historical moment will be possible. Any student of Machiavelli should avoid Mr. Pocock's book for this very reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replaced the old unit just fine","review":"My old garage door opener worked fine, but the remotes were shot.

I am a self-professed bass junkie, so I REALLY like my bass. These earbuds have a frequency response of 5Hz-25kHz and if you didn't know most of the higher end AKA more expensive buds(Shures and Bose for example) don't even have frequency responses of that magnitude. With that kind of frequency response, you get deep rumbling lows (like a subwoofer) and clear, crisp highs and don't forget awesome mids. Some people complain about the asymmetrical cord design, but I really like it. It is meant to wrap behind your ear, so you can take the right one out if you need to hear something...like answering your phone without the cord pulling down on your other ear. If you are an active person and you can appreciate great bass (genres such as techno, hip-hop, and R&B) you will really like these headphones. With the price Amazon offers, how can you refuse?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No No No No No Wrong!!!","review":"All you five star people!! What are you thinking. I dont get it. Its plane and simple.

I have been using the EX71s for a year or so now. But wanted to splurge so i order these MDR90. Iv been pulling my hair out trying to figure out why my 71's sound so much better. All that tech jargon is worthless TRUST ME!! These MDR90's sound way muffled campared to the 71's. It seems like none of these reviewers have actually tried both models (71's vs 90's) I have!!!!!! with the same player ,same song. Go with the 71's 0r 80's. I hate getting riped off.

The -EX90's deliver marginally better bass and clarity over my old headphones, a difference far too small to justify any price increase, let alone $70 worth. They are also far less comfortable: despite using the same size ear caps, which are made of the same material, the -EX90's created sore spots in my ear canals after only 3 uses. Finally, the -EX90's are a bit less capable of blocking outside noise.Not to mention, unlike my previous earbuds, the -EX90's don't come in matching Apple white.These are now on their way back to Amazon, where I've since purchased another pair of MDR-EX81's (in white, of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely fell apart!","review":"I just ordered these a month ago, and for a month enjoyed pretty decent sound and liked them a lot. The wire to the left bud is far shorter than the right, which I do not like (it's meant to wrap around your neck, but i don't like to do that), but other than that they seemed like very high quality. A week or so ago, though, one of the earbuds completely fell apart--I mean the top half came unglued and was dangling by the wire. Plastic pieces fell everywhere when I just tried to take it out of my ear gently. I thought this was a fluke, and set them aside in my bag and got a cheap pair at walmart in the meantime. Next time I picked them up to examine them, the other one fell apart! I have since glued them back together with superglue, and they still sound okay, but honestly . . . obviously the product is so cheaply manufactured that it can't even stay together. I shouldn't have to superglue my expensive headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be very wary","review":"I ordered one of the very low-priced offers from an affiliate (who was exceptional about it and has removed their listing). As at least one of the descriptions notes, these are in non-US packaging. While the label was for an EX90 and everything looked right, what I received was NOT an EX90. There is no way possible anyone could have reviewed the product I received in the manner that these are typically reviewed. They sounded roughly like a $4 generic -- clipped highs, muddy mids, and distorted lows. According to the vendor, their whole batch was like that. I'm wondering if they're either rejects that someone packaged or counterfeits.This is not to say the EX90 sounds bad. To the best of my knowledge, I've never heard one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment....","review":"I'm tired of spending money buying headphones and I thought that maybe spending a little more and getting these Sony MDR-EX90LP I would be done with my long period of researching and dissatisfaction.

I simply hate that!!I really should just return this after paying almost $90 and not having exactly what I am looking for... I guess I'll just pile them up together with all my other ear buds headphones that I've been buying in the past year.... The iPod ones I've already bought 3 of them... No more!!! ...

Sad.I paid somewhere around $100 for them and at the time felt that was a decent price for the sound quality. 3+ years later I feel like I got one hell of a deal; I've abused these things to no end and aside from the broken strain relief they show virtually no sign of wear.

At first sight, the ear buds didn't look authentic and sound was tinny. Th earbuds were not comfortable and my ears started to pain a bit and also developed slight irritation in the ears. I contacted amazon and they were kind enough to give me a refund. The worst part is that in few days, I noticed the differences in the earphones that I have from the authentic sony MDREX90LP earphones. I was surfing through ebay the other day and to my surprise I came to know that nowadays fake sony MDREX90LP earphones are being sold by few people. I found out that my earphones were fake ones.

The middle range, 250Hz-2.5kHz, washed everything out. The bass response was poor but I took that with a grain of salt since my current earphones are known to be bass heavy. I could make them sound really good with some major EQ adjustments in iTunes. Once I had the EQ dialed in they sounded great. Very clear. The bottom line is my $15 Skullcandy earphones sound almost as good and don't require the EQ to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like shoving hot pokers in your ears","review":"I bought these after looking at several reviews. Most reviews are positive toward the sound quality. And I do agree with that, the sound quality is pretty decent.However, the comfort of these things is horrible. I kept thinking it was the tips that were bothering me and kept trying the different sizes. Also ordered comply tips. After much experimenting I was looking in the mirror at them (while in my ears) and realized it had nothing to do with the tips. It is the circular metal housing just behind the tip. Much too large. It presses against some of the other protruding parts of your ears. Within 5 minutes these things are becoming uncomfortable. Within a few songs I was ready to get these parasites out of my ears.Look elsewhere.

The whole room had a BAD burning electronics smell. After moving the monitor I realized that the burning smell came from the Masterpiece Plus. I disassembled the unit and traced the problem back to the master power switch. The contacts failed to make a good connection and had overheated and charred the board. You could see the plastic case starting to melt. What if this had happened when we were not at home? (We often leave the computer on so I can remoltely access it.)

I also enjoy the wood handle.Remember steamers do not work like an iron so dont expect it to be as good. It does get rid of wrinkles but takes slightly longer. This works great for vertical fabrics like curtains, background material (for photography) or clothes on a hanger. I have also used this to steam fondant on my wife's cakes.

Not so here. The songs sparkle, effervesce and delicately brood, each track satisfyingly unique and distinct. I am still enchanted.Of the nine tracks, easily four of them mine aural gold and justify the CD's price. That said, there is not a bad track on this CD and any MUM fan will be blissed in the rain and wash of analogue-driven sounds and spangles. This is music with which to drive late at night or lose some part of yourself at home, eyes closed and the body moving: sway into slow rock.

It also occasionally stops for no discernable reason. The battery life is truly abyssmal.I hope to still get use out of this unit as a music source on my boat, but as a wearable for the gym or working on projects, it's a failure.

Very ligth in weight, easy to use, you just drag and drop the files properly labeled in to the player (like a pen drive)and it organizes them for you. The radio feature is very good and the menus very intuitive. You can also expand the memory up to 3 GB and use it like a regular pen drive; these features add value to the player compared with other brands. The only thing I don't like very much is the armband, specially when you work out in the gym, but I've overcome this issue using a belt clip holder of a regular cellphone, much more confortable for me...Overall, I recommend this player as an excellent product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool","review":"Its a cool player. It is a combination of a cool MP3 player with FM. The WMA compatibility helps a lot if I want to rip musing from a CD and carry on with it. I just played with the equalizer and it is superb.

It is not the battery, and not the extrenal SanDisk 1GB SD I placed; the Sansa just does not startup.While working, the product was OK: feels a bit flimsy, but I thought \\"what can you expect from a low priced unit\\". I was wrong.

I put on lots of different songs by different artists and it screwed almost all of it up. Songs were not put in the right albums and tons of other thing s were totally not right.

This is really frustated espeically when i am on the treadmill, i can just stop fix the battery.

It is amazingly easy to use, and with about a third of the memory left I have 102 songs. If you do the math, that equates to about 153 songs, which is pretty good for someone with a small library with a S100- budget. Extras include time, stopwatch, and FM radio.

The ease of copying songs from the hard drive is very nice, especially for Linux users.

I am assuming that the author is a much better TV producer then author or there is no way he would have a job with CNN.The book was dull, there is no way around it. The author kept focusing on his drinking and the issues with this ministry and that ministry - not the most exciting.

He is an attorney and a visitor of Sierra Leone. So his book about an Indianapolis attorney and his son in Sierra Leone as a Peace Corp volunteer gone native, seems quite appropriate. His son's hapless but headstrong friend makes the book worth reading. As an anthropologist, I thorougly enjoyed the book, especially one character, an anthropology graduate student who chose to stay with his study population. He's a stereotype of so many arrogant and cynical anthro student I encountered in graduate school! All in all, this is an above average book, but the end of the book is unsatisfying. It's almost as if Dooling ran out of paper. The end is abrupt, and as loose ends are quickly tied up in an almost campy conclusion, you'll feel cheated.

It almost qualifies for science fiction.Dooling writes some funny stuff. Most of it about Lawyers (admittedly American cultural whipping boy icons). However, I wish he'd write about something else. The techno-lawyer background plot is growing stale.

The insights are not very original or insightful; Cohen comes across as more of a college admissions observer than a college admissions insider. Never-the-less, this book could have been a good overall review of the process if it weren't for the tone. Her tone is one of arrogance and condescension, and I'm surprised that it got through the editing stage (one would think an editor would have improved the tone to improve the book's mass-market appeal).

She rarely mentions the political context of the era except to assume all Islamic leaders were absolute tyrants.

As long as we were doing all that, we opted to get a new granite Blanco sink. Now, Blanco makes racks especially for their sinks but they are VERY VERY expensive. The sink is extra deep--much wider at the top than the bottom and the drain is toward the back of the sink so finding something that fit was very difficult. Bed, Bath and Beyond has about the best selection of countertop accessories that I could find locally. I purchased a dish drainer but, it has metal feet. Metal feet rust and are likely to stain my new sink--as I found out less than a week after I purchased it. I checked on Amazon and found this one. It works just fine. It has NO metal so rust is not an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent view of the lighter side of Ronald Reagan.","review":"Some very funny clips of our 40th president.

Scott's sensitivity to the revelatory realm has brought us a mirror to see what part are we playing? What role(s)have we become?

And it is obviously a Scriptural account of one that God gave Scott MacLeod. I just wish he had taken that word from God and expounded upon it. He needs to give instruction on how to respond to this word. And although I find no fault with anything God said in the vision (although some of MacLeod's wallowing in unworthiness was a bit much), it is simple holiness in lifestyle that is being promoted. Why the vision when three or four verses from the Bible could be expounded upon in more challenging form?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what the other reviewers are thinking . . .","review":"This book isn't that helpful, at least for someone who wants basic advice about New York neighborhoods, ways to find an apartment, etc.My spouse and I have visited New York several times, and have a good idea of what neighborhoods we want to live in.

He adds so much depth to the characters in all three of his books in the Eyes of God trilogy, that you can't but help to feel sad when something dramatic happens to one of the characters.

The ending felt rushed. It seemed as if the author was just trying to hurry along the end of the novel by killing off characters left and right without rhyme or reason (or at least no GOOD reason). Throughout the series I would try to picture the characters and felt that it was difficult to get a true feel of how they would look. The action scenes were done fairly well and were somewhat exciting, but was all very telegraphed as well. You could see what was coming a thousand miles away. Not the most spectacular series I've ever read. Though there were some somewhat interesting characters it was all very cliche.***spoiler alert***The ending was very disappointing to me...

This last one in the trilogy was incredibly disappointing. The writing was shallow and unimpressive. The battle scenes and any that involved strategy of any kind were the worst.

The cover and movie description lead one to believe this. The movie starts out very slow, and proceeds to get even slower. The characters are dysfunctional and unlikeable. The acting is poor. The focus of the movie is not the horse; rather it is about this dysfunctional family trying to deal with their father's Alzheimer's.

I have many other kinds of headphones and have never run into this problem before, so it is a faulty design, not the shape of my head. I would stay away from this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eep","review":"They work, but that is about the best I can say for it.

Fungi are presented in alphabetical order so you have to know what you are looking for. The other downside is that there is no information on yeast (mold only), so you have to buy another book for that.

Sadly, there are no other books on the subject yet but Mark Phillips book on science-fiction TV encyclopedia contains a lot more inforamtion. Count on McFarland Publishers to crank out an over-priced book and give you very little. (I already disappointed in their \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Twilight Zone\\" book.)The author of this book needs to check out books like \\"Night Gallery: An After Hours Tour\\" by Benson and \\"The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic\\" by Grams to get an idea of what people expect out of books like this.

After only a few days, Popeye's head fell completely off. And my children were not especially rough with the toy - they basically had the Popeye gang living in the doll house. It appears to just be a design flaw, the thin neck on the Popeye figure cannot support the big head.Considering the inexplicable dearth of Popeye toys out there, I was really hoping this set would be a winner. But with the main character's head falling off after only a few days of moderate play (and Gorilla brand super glue was of no avail), I have to urge folks to avoid these toys.

Ron Grainer's pulsating theme fashions our character within \\"The Village\\", just as we remembered the bizarre cues from the show.

I've listened to this album at least a dozen times and still can't find any melody I can remember; any song worth significant airplay; or any growth as a songwriter. Cross has an incredible ability to write great pop hooks but they're no where to be found on this album. Lowering your voice an octave on Hunger was a nice approach but the song itself goes nowhere. Producing yourself as an artist can be dangerous. Rob Muerer plays in Cross' road and studio band and fills in the gaps on many of Christopher's songs. A producer - he is not. And it seems either is Cross. And waiting 3 years to write an album of this insignificance is a shame.

Not for me.","review":"I was intrigued by Piccioni's standout cuts on the great BEAT AT CINECITTA compilations, and captivated by the Mediterranean psychedelic langour of IL DIO SOTTO LA PELLE, and haunting, romantic CAMILLE 2000. FILM MUSIC is the first Piccioni CD that has disappointed me. Most of it is harsh, busy '60s jazz, with little of the intoxicating undertow of despair that defined his later, poignant music. Plus, many of the early tracks are mastered from noisy vinyl copies. The three short tracks from SENELITA are the exception; these haunting orchestrations resemble Milos Rosza's best. I recommend IL DIO SOTTO LA PELLE as a starting point, followed by CAMILLE 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lali Puna - Tridecoder","review":"If there were ever a sub-genre called glitch-pop, Lali Puna would be the ones to own it. Even from their first album, TRIDECODER, you've got the quiet melodies, clicky rhythms and Valerie's icy vocals floating atop. Melancholy permeates this album. Even the uptempo, spoken word \\"Rapariga Da Banheria\\" or the pumping house of \\"System On\\" have a quiet sense of sadness lingering in the background. \\"Fast Forward\\" brings that feeling to the forefront, and it sweeps through the entire track. Subtle, and sublime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"I bought this on a whim, after hearing a few 30 sec bites. It sounded good enough to give a try.

Bottom line, if you already understand glass blowing and these advanced techniques you will probably get a lot out of watching the DVD.

Utter crap. The author summarizes the books but even that is poorly written. My daughter and I are intense fans of this series having read the books and seen the movies multiple times and I can tell you there were so many mistakes in this book. Things like when the author describes that the students in the wizarding world wear typical teen attire (jeans, tshirts and tennis shoes) under their robes....no they don't. They wear a school uniform. Then the author tried to compare each character to corresponding characters/Gods from mythology. She says that Hagrid can be compared to Poseidon for his command of water. WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?? Hagrid didn't have a command of water. Many of the assumptions in this book are downright wrong. If you have it and you have a fireplace, toss it in the fire to warm your toes while you read the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting......","review":"I started this book and almost fell asleep. The author could have made this a bit more interesting! As I read through it, I noticed small things that arn't correct. First of all, when she was talking about Draco Malfoy's buddy Vincent Crabbe, she spelled 'Crabbe' wrong. She spelled it 'Crabb'. That is something that any TRUE Harry Potter fan would pick up automatically, since through out all of the books, Vincent Crabbe is known as Crabbe.This book is good, though, in helping kids, and adults, really think about what they are reading (i.e. the questions about each chapter in the books). I recommened this book to anyone who is not familiar to Harry Potter, but don't be disgruntled by one person's point of view!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very difficult job well done","review":"Well, it seems like I am in the minority here. I was impressed by this book for a number of reasons. It is extremely difficult to to write an overview of a series of books BEFORE those books have all been published. Elizabeth Schafer has put it together before it was all there! That takes a lot of insight. She has acknowledged the shortcomings of exploring a work in progress and still has managed to give adults and mature child readers an intelligent introduction to literary criticism and analysis. The book also helps readers review details that otherwise would be forgotten because of the delay between Potter volumes. I look forward to future editions of this sourcebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting reference work on a magnificent seires!","review":"The Harry Potter books are fantastic! Just as I did with the Chronicles of Narnia and Lord of the Rings, whenever I find a series I absolutely adore I always like to find analysis books regrading that series. Most of the analysis books I've read on serieses that I've liked, such as Paul F. Ford's Companion to Narnia, have been very good. This is one such book. At the beggining I learned some very interesting information, such as the fact that due mainly to the influence of Harry Potter, sales of children's books in general have gone up 24%! I love to read an analysis book and think to myself \\"Yup, I realized that.\\" or \\"Wow, how interesting!\\" or, \\"I hadn't thought about that but it makes pefect sense.\\" This book is highly recommended. The reason I did not give it five stars is that's what I would have given the Harry Potter books themselves and no analysis book, no matter how good can take the place of the series itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"congratulations!","review":"The author needs to commended and congratulated for the courage shown in exposing her intellect (or lack of it) to the wide world. It is either that or a very obvious way of cashing in on popularity of another book. The cover says that the book was not approved by JK Rowling. One glance inside the book is enough to tell one why. The author has covered all bases and compared with every possible fictional and non-fictional character...including James Bond (and why not?! I can see the similarity...007 and Harry has seven years in Hogwarts). If I were to use one word to desribe this book...drivel is what I would say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mythguided nonsense","review":"Oh, how I am loving the Harry Potter series (over and over again...) But great steaming dragon bogies: this 'sourcebook' is too much! Inspiration-spotting really isn't a spectator sport, I guess, but the whole 'Harry was once in a boat, so the author OBVIOUSLY intended us to be reminded of Jason and the Argonauts' approach is just shoddy thinking, surely? There ARE genuine mythical and spiritual roots to the Potter stories - but you won't find them here. The fact that the disclaimer - 'not approved by J K Rowling' - was hidden in gold lettering on gold background on the cover design suggests to me (alas, spotted too late!) that the book is trying to pass itself off as something it isn't. A blind guide. For goodness' sake, hold out for something Rowling DOES approve - and in the meantime, let's trust our own imaginations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding.","review":"The author attempts to draw parallels between Hogwarts' institutions and Nazi Germany, going so far as to suggest some of the names of characters and institutions are meant to put readers in mind of the SS and concentration camps.There's little substance here and what substance can be found is insulting nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy","review":"Unfortunately I found the sourcebook to be too hastily put together.

Sure it has its uses, but I see its flaws as outweighing its virtues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great book to pass the time for Harry dreamers!","review":"This was a really good book! The discussion topics included for each chapter of the #1-3 books kept my friends and me talking for hours! The explaining of the greek gods and other parts of the stories was most intringing. This book is a excellent buy for young and old Harry fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploring Harry Potter","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read! The style is clunky and awkward; it even has errors in grammar... As to substance, it has none. It is very vague and general. Very superficial presentations of classical mythology, ancient and modern history, science, and everything else you can think of are thrown in, although these topics have no relation to HP. Comparisons are farfetched and strained--not to mention strange. Harry and his friends are compared to British children who were evacuated from London to rural areas during World War II. Why does the author do this? Your guess is as good as mine. Don't buy this book. Save your money and buy a good reference book on classical mythology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this junk!!","review":"I love the Harry Potter books; my kids love the Harry Potter books. We've each read all the books many many times. We bought four copies of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I thought that this book might be an intelligent, insightful analysis of the books, but it is mostly irrelevant, mumbo-jumbo thrown in apparently to fill the pages of the book-- the examples given in the other reviews listed here are just the tip of the iceberg. It manages to be pretentious-- in its claim to be a scholarly examination of the books, and insulting-- through its weird repetitive simple sentence structure and vocabulary-- at the same time. I tend to be a book hoarder and I will almost always finish reading any book that I start, but this one is going out in the trash, and I haven't read much of it. Any teacher who knows anything about children's literature or teaching reading doesn't need this book, and no kid would be interested in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you want to read one person's view","review":"But there's precious little from the book which hasn't been debated and analysed on the egroups.com harry potter for grown ups mailing list - and it's much more fun to get to discuss hidden meanings and make predictions with other people, rather than read what one woman thought about the books.

Which do you think is more relevant to a story that takes place in the British Isles?"},{"rating":"1","title":"who did her research?","review":"The only thing that I liked about this book were the discussion questions at the end. I am not sure who did her research, but some of the basic facts were wrong in her overview of characters. It is one thing to speculate on the nature of the stories, that is to be expected in this kind of book, but facts that have been spelled out in the books are not open for debate. for example, she misidentifies several characters. also, the last section of the book, when she speculates on the future of harry potter, is nothing more than filler material. it serves no purpose other than to use up a few more pages. save your money. if you are interested in it, go to the library, it isn't worth the cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let the Kids in!","review":"Umm, what about us? I read the reviews here and most of themcame from adults. I really liked this book. It helped me understandHarry Potter better and the connections really gave you something tothink about. You older people may not have liked this book, but theonly good reviews came from kids. No book is trash. That's what I'velearned. And I want to be an author when I grow up. Those who havealready grown up sometimes don't give books a chance. I'll admit- ittook me two weeks to get into Redwall. But what about the goodqualities of this book? There's a complete list of every singlecharacter in the first three books. I must have skipped over orforgotten lots of them! There are great discussion questions- I nowhave ideas for my website.

As with her Massive Sudoku, you get 16x16 puzzles (using numbers, not letters) as well as the jigsaw sudoku variation she calls \\"Squiffy.\\" The big add here are several of the variation known as \\"Killer Sudoku,\\" which require some minor math to solve (as with the new Kakuro puzzles, clues are given as sums and you must deduce the number pattern from the sum provided, still following the other traditional Sudoku rules.)Was that confusing? That, I suppose, is the value of the book - Vorderman provides solid instruction and very good solving tips for the new variations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great player for kids.","review":"My 8 year old son bought this CD player for himself based on looks and price, and he's been very happy with it.

It has gone thru many reincarnations on RCA then as a complete opera release on London/Decca. This time a good highlights recording has been released with the addition of new technology.

Each piece contains all the movements so it is complete. There are about 19 sonatinas and it may take an average student about two years to learn every piece. Therefore, this book is a good buy for students who liketo try some fresh pieces.This book was published in 1970s so the price is pretty affordable since these days some piano music sheet with 80 pages can be over nine dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neotech Wireless Pouch, Small","review":"I've been using this pouch to hold Lectrosonics' LMa transmitters on both Electric and Acoustic Guitars--it fits the pack perfectly and has held up well for the past 6 or so months.

Actually, Little Lion is pretty amazing too -- glad he finally did an all-instrumental album. I have no idea what happened here, like another reviewer. His voice is very muted on all the songs, like he's whispering almost every song -- a singing style I've never heard him do recorded or live. And it just doesn't work. The songs themselves are good; he did a super live show recently that I enjoyed immensely. This recording, however, is a great disappointment.

Some of the museums most farmiliar painting are included, along with a very rich selection of literature. Its fun to compare the responses, especially those that have been derived from the same painting. In one case, The Eye of God by Minnie Evans draws not only the most rich and descriptive narrative of the book, but the coldest of the poems as well. My favorite is the recollections of David Sedaris on his cildhood trips and Mrs. Kingman's colorful guidance through them. This book- as the North Carolina Museum of Art- is truly a store of joys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solo Flight","review":"Her music is great!

The author applies lessons from Gandhi's life to the practical tasks of leadershi. Nair provides guidelines for a leader's standard of conduct and for making decisions and taking actions based on moral principles. According to Nair, even when we are in the role of follower, it is our responsibility \\"to raise our standards so our leaders will have to follow.\\" This is not a book heavy on skill building. The author's purpose is to challenge us to abide by a high moral standard in our roles as leaders and followers. Reading this book is an act of self-reflection from which all of us can benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was inspirational and easy to read.","review":"The author uses the example of Gandi's life and leadership to call us to a higher standard of living and leadership.

We are asked to commit to absolute values, to the journey, and to training the conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite albums","review":"I was thrilled to find this gem on CD though I still play the vinyl version occasionally. The Dirt Band is one of those uncategorizable groups that just makes great music. Many folks may only be familiar with their version of \\"Mr. Bojangles\\" and its blend of popular music and country. But they are so much more and this album is among their best. The version of \\"The Battle of New Orleans\\" on this album remains my favorite.Bluegrass, country, cajun, classical, even a bit of Calypso - they do it all. I'll agree with the other reviewer about the imagery in \\"Ripplin' Waters\\". The image that sticks with me the most (experience?) is about the old second hand chair and people picking out the stuffing \\"when they sit down, 'cause it passes the time\\".Check out the thunder on the opening cut.

It was published in 1897 and it is now being replicated. The translation of the poems, one should not be too surprised, are basically in King James' Biblical English! She (Gertrude Bell, the author) actually uses the words \\"ye\\" and \\"thou\\" and \\"o'er\\"! The sensuality of Hafiz is thus systematically eliminated! Read Daniel Ladinsky's \\"The Subject Tonight Is Love\\" to see the difference.The introduction, on the other hand, is a delight, and it is worth the price of the book itself. It gives insight into the Victorian mindset, allowing one to triangulate a position in respect to the Divine, given the simultaneous thoughts of Hafiz in the 10th century, Bell in the 19th century, and the Beloved Reader in the 21th century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully woven tapestry!

But when Riven cam out, and I began to not want to leave the computer playing it with my mom, I decided I'd try The Book of Ti'Ana. Anyone who is a MYST fan must read this book. It is beautifully crafted together in a wonderful way, Rand Miller is a masterful writer and writes and intricatelly done, compelling story of friend vs. friend. Of truth and betrayal. If I gave away any of the plot, it wouldn't be fair, you'll just have to read it for yourself.

This book kept me hooked for three days. I couldn't put it down, and it explains a lot about the games and the book that comes after it, The Book of D'ni (Pronounced DUNNY in case you didn't know). At school I had to keep people from touching my book I was so afraid they might ruin the spine or cover, that was how protective of my book I was, I couldn't hardly let anyone else touch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made me tired!","review":"This book was a tie with \\"The book of Atrus\\".

That's why it made me tired!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending!!!!","review":"The book started like the first one, jumping from here to there and I believed that it was going to be the same, but after the half of the book, everything changed and I found myself unable to close the book until I finished in one afternoon. I'm glad about the way this second book came about."},{"rating":"2","title":"book of atrus","review":"If you have done played the computer game, you might understand the world(s) that are Myst. The books give dimension to the computer CD-ROM games that I know so well. The books tell you the stories of what happened to the worlds in the game, and it is very helpful and interesting how someone could come up with such wonderful, descriptive worlds. These books take you into a world that you can only imagine, that you can only think about in your dreams. I absolutely love these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual and entertaining sci-fi about rock dwelling people","review":"Sci-fi adventure and romance involving rock dweller and young woman who inadvertantly intrudes upon a people living in caverns within rock formations beneath the earth's surface. The woman, Anna, is taken ionto the household of Kahlis, father of Aitrus, in the underground city of D'ni. The love which develops between Anna and Aitrus is poignant. Veovis, once the friend of Aitrus, opposes the marriage of Aitruis and Anna. The plot is never predictable and the imagery of linking to different worlds or ages through panels in special books is compelling. This is not the type of book that I usually read, but once I got into it, I found the story fascinating. This was a good read for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One line just won't be enough...","review":"This was possibly one of my favorite books. It starts off fairly slow, but it builds to a poignant end. I remember crying at the end, I was so drawn into the vividly depicted world of the D'Ni. I don't know what else I can say, my words will probably drop far short of my feelings. This truly is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Want Imagination? So Do I....","review":"You'll get all the imagination you can get in this book. This books has more than one theme though. It has love, horror, action, evil, imagination, fantasy, fiction, and many more. Whatever taste you have, you'll enjoy this book. If you want to see the fairies dancing in the moonlight, or the Peruvian gods in all of their might, or the fragile thread that weaves all sight, read this book. The ending can never truly be written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ti'ana shows promise, falls only slightly short of stardom.","review":"As we can see, \\"Myst: The Book of Ti'ana\\" has little to do with the world of Myst itself. Ti'ana (as I shall refer to the book henceforth) is an incredible prequal to Atrus. However, the book tends to be slow in the begining and hard to follow towards the end. I believe a healthier medium could be set. Still, I found the story of Veovis, Agaeris, Aitrus (this is not a misprint, read the book of Atrus to know why), Anna, and the fall of the D'ni (pronounced DUH-NEE, I recently discovered) empire intriguing. If you read this book, you are up for a great story, but you will probably have to backtrack a few times to fully understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the siries","review":"This is a great book. It gives wonderfull discription of the D'ni civilization and how it fell. One warning though, it does tend to lag on at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book - D'ni is a great world.","review":"The Book of Ti'Ana is great. It makes you feel like there is a D'ni out there. Only great writers can do this, and the writers of the Myst books are a few of them.

I knew I had to buy them. I then found this one and The Book of D'ni at a store. They were mine before you could say bob's your uncle! I was reading another book, but I just had to read this one. The only times I put it down were the times I got a bit car sick from reading too long in a moving vehicle. The plot is just so good. One of the best I have ever seen. The ending is sad, but very well written. I could almost cry. Don't miss reading this book. It may become unavailable then you will have missed such a golden oppertunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"journey out there","review":"A pretty unusual, but stellar mix; spoken word excerpts, film sound tracks, blank tracks, a polished journey across sadly uncommonly charted territory.

At [$$$], it has Pro Logic II, a feature not usually found on other systems with similar price, which actually converts your normal stereo sound to 5.1 surround (now my TV sounds surround!). It also has progressive scan too, a big plus. It plays MP3, VCD, CD-R/RW beside DVD. Furthermore, the player looks very cool with its metallic casing.On the minus side, the speakers look mediocre like some [low-end] computer speakers, but the sound is clear and crisp. The remote that comes with it look like [low-end] plastic, very unattractive.

As with many Japanime & manga series, this one is chock full of ghosts, curses, mystical storylines, & occultic overtones. Though I know many young readers will disagree with me (& that's quite alright, as I've read these books & know what's in them), this series is simply not appropriate for young ones, especially Christians. If you simply do not want your child reading Japanime porn, but you're not concerned with the occultic issues, then you will probably be fine with this series.If you're looking for something similar, minus the aforementioned details, check out the Serenity series by Realbuzz Studios.

In some respects, such at total conclusion of films from the popular to the absolutely obscure, this succeeds. BUT, as in the sequel, sigh, the author keeps using the silly term, CANNIBAL ZOMBIES. I hate this term. The entire word Cannibal (yes I'm nitpicking), means one who preys on the same species. Thus a human who eats humans in a cannibal. A zombie doesn't eat other zombies, or there would be no problem in Romero films and The Walking Dead. Zombies eat us. They aren't cannibals. I wish the author would go back and edit both volumes and remove this hackneyed reference. Not only is it wrong, but he uses it SO MUCH. Would I say not buy the book? No, it's a fine reference, but as a zombie fan and author, that term simply has got to GO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd hoped","review":"It would have been better if it was more in depth on the more popular zombie movies and less on the lesser known.

He does quite a good job with the reviews (there are some laugh-out-loud funny one-liners, and the requisite pack of odd bits of trivia that only dedicated film fans would know), but he does miss a few major films (Bio-Zombie and Wild Zero being the first two that come to mind) and a slew of minor ones. That aside, though, what's here is a great way for the zombie movie fan to find a number of releases he or she probably missed over the years and commence hunting them down. Dendle's views are at times refreshingly counter to the norm (he finds use for Oasis of the Zombies, for example, and considers Fulci's Zombi 2 superior to the same director's The Beyond), and overall this is a valuable addition to the book collection of any horror film fiend. ***"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading with Tequila","review":"Why read: Received for review from LibraryThing Early ReviewersWhat impressed me: I enjoyed that Dendle put his own voice and opinions in the reviews. It felt more personal that most movie encyclopedia reviews.What disappointed me: The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia is terribly out of date. Why publish a book in 2010 if you haven't updated the information since it was first published in 2001? A huge amount of zombie movies have been released in that time period, all of which would be of interest to zombie movie fans. Reading the reviews, Dendle often sounds like he really doesn't like the genre. He favors a few classics, but for the most part the reviews are negative, telling potential viewers not to waste their time.Recommended: No. I'd recommend reading any other zombie film review book as they would most likely be more up-to-date and written by someone who actually enjoys the films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Book but BIG Concept","review":"Excellent Book!Changed the way I though about my business and customers.

Although Lesbians on Ecstasy toured with Le Tigre this year, the two acts are from completely different worlds - the former is clearly more associated with Le Tigre's latest partnership with corporate demons Strummer-Universal and MTV.Don't fall for the catchy name or \\"hip\\" album art.

I agree with the reviewer who said it can be messy to apply, but it is easy to clean and is so worth this minor inconvenience. It looks so natural that no one could tell that it's not real, at least for my color hair and type of application. I couldn't judge for someone who is trying to conceal a large bald spot.

And the crowd that sounds like 8,000 people shouting their name; c'mon guys. Slaughter usually plays clubs now. Be honest. Look at Dio's live album.

Exciting music is also available in tracks Bond Look Alike, Chase Bond Theme, The Palace Fight and Yo Yo Fight. Bond Meets Octopussy and Arrival at Octopussy Island are slow and sound very well. All Time High returns again as the 11th and last track on the CD. The only complaint is the rather short amount of 11 tracks and 36 minutes of music.

The first few times I used them, everything wiped off easily with a sponge. After that, food started to get baked on so I soaked it, over night. It still wouldn't come off so I ended up having to scrub the whole thing to get it clean. I got so tired of scrubbing the \\"nonstick\\" pans that I tossed them.

I ordered three and was upset they weren't the ones I wanted. I plan to return the ones I didn't use, and will figure out a non-baking use for the one I already tried, unless I can return it as well.

That is, the coating fails to release baked-on drippings from meats baked on a rack placed in this pan. With some urging, the bulk of the drippings comes off, but permanent dark spots remain. After a few washings, the coating at these spots begins to peel off. So the coating is not only ineffective, but fragile.In addition, the pan warps when heated, thus spilling greasy drippings on the oven floor. Apparently the pan was not heat-treated to relieve stresses once the metal was formed into the final shape of the pan.Perhaps this pan would be OK if it were just used to bake cookies. It is of heavy construction to distribute heat evenly. But for my uses it is unsatisfactory, and very short-lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the quality I wanted","review":"I bake a lot, so I'm kind of picky about the sheets I use. I thought these were the thicker, higher quality sheets from Baker's Secret that I am used to. They are not. They are very thin and as a result you don't get the consistency in any cookies you are trying to make. The nice thing about them is the size. Two can fit on the same oven rack while still allowing the oven door to close. These aren't garbage by any means. Baker's Secret makes solid stuff.

It has been an excellent performer in this time period, averaging about 6 secs per day fast. The watch has a very readable face and the nylon band is quite comfortable ...it's so light, you almost forget you're wearing it. I have 4 other Seiko 5 series watches and of all of them, this one is the most accurate and cheapest one of the bunch. Get it on sale if you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I've owned several Seiko watches over the years and this is the first one that really dissapointed me. I liked the looks and the fact that it was self winding, so I bought it. Doesn't take long for for the leather strip surrounding the clasp holes to deteriorate and become discolored which makes the appearance quite unattractive. More importantly, it doesn't keep accurate time. It gains about two minutes a day. I can only guess that this is because the self winding mechanism doesn't function properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids Watch","review":"The face of this watch is small. Not even close to being a good size to be a men's watch. I do not have a large wrist. This would have been something I wore when I was 9 - 14."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but total DUD for accurate time","review":"I bought this watch on Amazon. The selling points for me were the classic styling, the low-key looks, and the self-winding movement. Well, I hate to say it, but this watch has been a complete dud. It is horrible at keeping accurate time. For example, it requires a daily reset of the time. I set it this morning in sync with my iMac (which gets it's sync with the Apple time server, so I know thats accurate). This was at 10:43 AM. Now, with my computer showing 11:26, the Seiko watch shows 11:30. Now, I understand that a mechanical watch will not be as accurate as a quartz watch, but a gain of 4 minutes in less than an hour is ridiculous. It essentially makes the watch useless. It seems counter-intuitive that a watch would GAIN time after being wound, but if I wear the watch for a full day, by the end of the day it can be almost an hour AHEAD of the true time.Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"G A R B A G E","review":"liked the look.....but my sundial keeps better time...I am better at guessing the time than this \\"watch\\" is at keeping it.

I do not want to and cannot generalize on my experience regarding this item. I only register my experience, and therefore the title of my review.A.

Sent it back to the service center and although it will still go to sleep during normal wearing, it will stay awake if I 'exercise' it by doing forceful arm movements until it is fully wound (I can hear the winding mechanism at work).I've had Seiko self winding watches since the early '60s when I was a soldier in the Far East. This behavior is not typical of the breed. I'm quite disappointed in the purchase.Added later on. If I wear the watch on my dominant wrist, then it stays wound. That is not as it should be as I'm a reasonably active person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the watch","review":"This watch is fantastic and I love everything about it. Very lightweight for an automatic watch and is not loud at all. It's got a great look to it, which I was unsure about with the tan strap.

Seiko really made a good product in this one and I'm even tempted to buy a different color!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Elegant Watch","review":"This watch is very nice and elegant.

I think the green would have been a better option."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice watch","review":"After searching for a quality watch with an acceptable case diameter, I am glad to have found this watch. I have a small wrist. Unfortunately, as the years go by, case diameters seem to get larger and larger, leaving customers such as myself with few options. This Seiko 5 is an excellent choice. I have owned it for about a year, and it has been accurate (within fifteen second per day) and comfortable. It also does not seem to scratch very easily (though I certainly do not abuse my watches). Overall, this is an outstanding value and a true five-star watch. I wish other makers would provide more selection in the sub-40mm case diameter size (especially 36mm-38mm)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking Good !","review":"Received this fine watch today, packed well, with the watch in working order.I had needed a good, reliable work/semi-dress watch for some time.And I hate having to pay someone to replace batteries every 6-8 months.The watch had to be water resistant and have a date/day option.So, after reviewing 20+ pages of Sales watches, I found one.With a brand name like Seiko on it, I'm sure it'll last me till my son inherits it.PS - I have large wrists and the band fits to the 2nd or 3rd hole. Just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch","review":"Nice watch, gains a couple minutes a week, but I like the self-winding feature, and the look of it.

It was much cheaper than similar style watches you might find at J. Crew or other stores. It keeps time well for an automatic watch. I have taken it off for a whole day at a time, and it still ticks along at the proper time when I put it back on. The face is a nice neutral color, so I can pair it up with different colored canvas straps. All in all, I am satisfied, and I hope it lasts a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice watch!","review":"I bought this watch for my husband and he just loves it. It's his first mechanical watch and he loves being able to see it working through the clear back cover. He says it feels as though it's alive lol. It came in an attractive Seiko box with the tags still attached, which I wasn't really expecting at this price point to be honest. The Lume paint on the hands is nice and bright. He did replace the band with a brown leather band which looks fantastic against the tan face of the watch. It seems to be keeping excellent time so far. In my opinion these Seiko 5's can't be beat for the money. For about the cost of a Timex I was able to get him a well made, Seiko mechanical watch. What more can I really say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Beautiful watch. Bought it for myself, but the wife loves it and it also fits.

Mac's are great machines, but Apple can't seem fit to include even the barest user manual at purchase. For almost 2 grand, this is a major omission. William's book showed promise, but as a novice user, I found it quite lacking. There's nothing included that spells out what to do when things don't work well, and Apple's in the same boat as Microsoft--it don't always work well. More troubleshooting would be helpful. (ie: what's a Fetch error. Had to call Apple on that one.) Too many examples to write about in this short space. Her visual example of the screen does not match what's on my flat-panel with OSX and that's frustrating. I recommend trying someone else's book if you're new to Macintosh.

So I strongly guess this pen was unsealed by someone else, and the converter was left behind. When I received the pen, I had no time return it, cause I have to leave.

The downside is that except for the glass base, the candle lamp is made entirely of wax, and I fear that it would melt if I should burn the tea light. The lamps might work well anyway in a dark room in a home where there are no small children, and where they can be monitored carefully while the tea lights are burning. Also, I would probably use these candle lamps away from the dinner table, since they have strong vanilla scent, which could compete with the flavor of a tasty meal.

In additon to being child-friendly, though, it's PARENT friendly. Unlike other repetitive, irritating, mind-numbing kid CD's, these songs are fresh, well-sung, and downright hilarious. We put this CD among the selections in our car's CD changer, and I think my husband and I enjoy it as much as my son!

It's such a great deal: 19 songs, all of them eminently singable, with funny, witty, un-dumbed down lyrics that put many a Top 40 song to shame.

Not BAD mind you- just not GOOD. Also lyrics are less than powerful,and guitar, drums and keys are forgettable at best. Don't waste your money.

So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment. Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans).

That is, it was a love story. Yes, a slightly twisted love story. My view is that interaction between our main characters was love indeed. In any relationship, there must be a willingness to give and take, to stand firm, to compromise. The attention that they pay to each other during their 'sessions.' Remember, the beatings was only part of the retinue, it functioned as their appetizer, their main course, their dessert.Another point that I'd like to make. A reviewer commented that the man wasn't really masculine at all (skinny, wimpy...). This is exactly the point of this 'man.' Because of his size, it shows that while he is a man, he is also small enough to be 'handled' by the girl (in the movie, you'll see what 'handled' means!).

The movie does start out in that direction, but soon spirals out of control into whipping and beating. (Not to mention the low point of the film: A scat kiss.) The character J at first seems to be a sadist, as he begins whipping Y prior to having sex with her. Later in the film the whip is turned on him and his true colors begin to emerge. As this relationship progresses it seems more and more like J is just taking advantage of Y's desperate circumstances to satisfy his own obsession with the whip.

Frustratingly, there is no way to override the pop-up except uninstalling the product - shocking - more like adware than a friendly good product.

None of the sets are dressed in a 1930s style. The film looks and feels like the early 1960s, which is when it was made. And the sixties is not my favorite era for films. I bought this because I saw the trailers and they looked really good, like a gritty, late '50s neo-noir. It isn't gritty and there's nothing noir about it, except maybe, visually, some of the scenes of Falk in jail.

To write a book that says you can bypass this is misleading. However, I do believe there are certain cellular and DNA memories from past lives and current lives that CAN be released.

These pads are unique because a small flat end cap snaps into place and that cap is the actual bearing surface. When these glides wear out, it will be these flat caps that wear out. These end caps are not replaceable.I fastened the SlipStick glide pads on with their adhesive foam disks, but then also with the supplied wood screws.

These are perfect in that regard, and are very attractive too! The measurement listed, 35 mm, is from the tip of the dangle to the tip of the fishhook that goes through your ear; the dangle or charm itself is about 25 mm.

If this song doesn't stir your emotions (brought me to tears), you are an automaton! Most of the CD is very upbeat, with excellent songwriting that rivals the best rock bands today.

Yes I knew what it was about. But it's the explicit detail that the author gives everytime he is with one of his daughters. I personally DO NOT think he needs to be THAT specific to tell the story, and tell it well. It doesn't matter wheather incest is common, or misunderstood, whatever. I still think it's way to detailed. But, if you like that kinda thing, and like reading about incest, then buy the book. But I think anyone reading it is going to be shocked at first by the detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"To be sure, this is not a good book. Schmidt overwrites, overanalyzes, and overexplains, providing an effect much like suffocation. Despite being fairly short, this book is a long read--it takes time to slog through Schmidt's self-indulgent excess. He could have excised entire chapters without significantly changing the story. Its sheer, numbing badness makes it easy for me to believe this man is indeed a television writer. Daddy fails as a novel and it fails as erotica.For what it's worth, I do think this is a memoir, rather than poorly-executed fiction, if only for the rather cynical reason that none of the three main characters changes very much. The elder daughter gains enough self-reliance to hold a job and keep an apartment, but the three of them finish with the intense egocentrism they begin with. As the joke goes, \\"Truth is stranger than fiction, because fiction has to make sense.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like the subject matter...","review":"...you will like this book.There are some points where it reverts to the type of language expected from online-rub-one-out-quick erotica, but all in all it is a decent story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly insane to think no harm was done.","review":"I am appalled at the cavalier attitude taken toward incest. It is sheer madness for the author to think that by romanticising this heinous and evil act; that feeding his selfish lust will have anything but tragic consequences in the lives of his daughters. His ego is so tied up in bragging about what a good, kindhearted lover he IS; I'd like to hear the truth about how his daughter's are faring emotionally and spiritually now. The claims are all anecdotal and fly in the face of all current research on child abuse and incest. All parents should catagorically reject this book as pandering to pedophilic lust."},{"rating":"2","title":"milwaukee 48_00_1303 sawzall blade wood 5 teeth. a great blade and good deal..","review":"i was unable to get the blades any where so found on your site. they are just great.Just what I needed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I bought these to take out the Russian Olives that got a foothold on our back property when we went three years without mowing it.

Living in Northern Minnesota, we wear hats constantly, but so many of the hats in this book were so old fashioned!

Forced to get herself together before she can be trusted to be a mother again, Peri and her entire family must confront generations of demons to reknit their brokenness.** Tragic as the entire situation is, there is an emotional distance and lack of sympathetic characterization that results in a wholy depressing, despondant read.

Each magazine gives you the exact same checklist and timeline for the wedding so you really only need to see it once. My favorite part of the magazine was the last page where you were given a little list of such things as best new dance songs, wedding traditions in different cultures or new DIY ideas. And every magazine would have a couple of pages (literally) that you could apply to your wedding.

It really seemed like it was gonna be a good film about following your heart and destiny and finding your path in life and instead became the typical soppy, cotton wool, American fare churned out en masse by Hollywood. The direction was quite good and the Chinese scenes were especially good. The characters tended to act, well, out of character at times, you'd build up an image of them and way they'd behave and the they'd do the complete opposite. At just over 90 minutes this film is the perfect length, anymore and you'd get bored and frustrated. An OK film for those lazy afternoons and when you don't want to think too hard. Don't get your hopes up in the first hour and you should be fine!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"Being an Asian American, i can identify with nearly every scene in this movie.

I am a huge hockey fan and love the rougher side of the game (ie fighting, checking). This game does not disappoint. It is basically NFL BLITZ for hockey. You play 3 on 3 with a goalie and a couple of players on the bench. Some of the cooler parts game are: 1. the SPEED - speed is amazing, your fingers never stop moving, you are always trying to catch up with the action 2. the CHECKING - some of the best checks EVER, you can send guys through the glass and into the crowd! 3. the FIGHTING - there's plenty fighting and it's easy to win 4.

This is the best hockey game since NHL Hockey for Sega Genesis, do not hesitate for one second......BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Hitz and Lightning Speed Action","review":"Ever since I got this game I could not put it down. My favorite part of the game is the records page in which me and my brother continually compete for the top spot. The fast pace makes this game incredible with never a dull moment. Another amazing component of this game is the interactive crowd. Instead of the dull blur of the crowd in other games, this game features an interactive crowd that has seperate animations for each situation in the game. (such as a big hit a a goal score) This is the 1st game ever for this feature. The fast pace and exciting games make this game a winner. Being a hockey fan myself helped me love this game.

That said, this game makes me embarrassed to admit to loving Star Trek. This game takes place during the Deep Space 9 Star Trek series and, much like the series it is based on, is absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to Star Trek. The plot is weak, the voice acting is paper thin, the gameplay is worse than a second grade play, and the game suffers from what I call \\"too much, too soon\\" syndrome. What I mean by that last part is it attempts to \\"drawn\\" you in Star Trek by throwing far too much at you at once. It doesn't even get the conventions of its genre right. I don't really remember much about it in detail, but I do remember this piece of junk left me cold after playing for just the first 2 or 3 levels. I regret playing it and owning it to this day.

Also you always have to keep a savefile when you are selecting your crew and ships. The reason for this is after you start your mission there is no way to go back and change your crew or your ship selection. I also found out that you can't control your ships fire. The computer atomatialy controls it unlike kilgon acdemy in, which you basicaly control everything.

Then, I went looking for the patch I needed, and it wasn't there, however there were what looked like dozens of other patches there. It was obsolete, they said.

I considered that it might just be that I was first exposed to the Mary Martin version of the musical, but a few friends (who don't particular care either way) said that it felt like it tried to be too \\"big\\" and misses the Neverland magic.The cast is fairly decent. Hook is fun enough, most of the cast fits their roles quite well, and although I'm not a huge fan of Cathy Rigby's voice, she makes an athletic Peter.Maybe the live performance has more magic than a video can capture, but personally, I'd rather see a reissue of the Mary Martin version."},{"rating":"2","title":"peter pan","review":"If you haven't done so, and I'm sure alot of people haven't seen the live version of Peter Pan.

The La Mirada Theater for the Performing Arts is a great smaller scale professional venue and the filming of Pan filled it to the brim.....hope you all enjoy the hard work of cast and crew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie / poor condition","review":"Received this DVD suposed to be good condition but it was from a library witch had been checked out numerous times and the case had bite marks on the corners where it looked like a dog had been catching it and the DVD itself is worn. Hope it last a little time for the kids. Would not even resell it on Amazon as I don't think it should have been sold in the first place. VERY POOR CONDITION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why is the question I aksed myself throughout this production. WHY did the producers feel the need to take the simple, charming, and exquisitly structured book and revise it, adding humorless schtick and confusing plot devicesw (aka: the mermaids and that whole rock scene)? WHY did the director consistantly choose to go for the cheap laugh instead of keeping with the natural charm and humor of the original version? WHY was the choreography so chaotic and bland? WHY did the producers feel the need to butcher every song they touched with new vocal arrangements, such as the increasingly tedious \\"echos\\" in \\"I'm Flying\\"? Cathy Rigby proves a worthy successor to Mary Martin, but the rest of the cast, particualrly Cpatain Hook, does not do nearly as well by comparison to the original production, and Rigby simply isn't good enough to carry the production by herself. So the real question to ask you self is, WHY watch this one when the superior original is still readily available?"},{"rating":"2","title":"See the show if you can then buy the dvd for everlasting rememberance","review":"Cathy Rigby as Peter Pan? Cathy Rigby IS Peter Pan. I've seen Mary Martin as Peter on tv. Took my daughter to see Sandy Duncan as Peter when the tour came to my area and through she was great. Now took my granddaughter to see Cathy Rigby (is) Peter when this tour came down to my area and I have just one word for the show.WOW!!! So much better then Mary Martin, and EVER so much better then Sandy Duncan.Cathy, is 59. Unbelievable the things she does. Handstands, summersaults, the flying secquences, She plays drums, sings. is there anything she can't do? Sorry to say, this 2012 tour is her last. Peter Pan is retiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter soars again!","review":"I have watched this video twice since I bought it and each time I see something new I like in it. I think Cathy Rigby as Peter is just supurb. I too remember and have a copy of the earlier version with Mary martin (hallmark hall of fame 1960) which I recorded from the tv presentation and as much as I like Miss Martin's rendition of Peter I have to admit Cathy is better. The Uga-awug-wa dance and drum sticks chorus with the Indians, lost boys, and Peter is great and makes you want to get up and dance with them. Cathy can play that drum too. The flying sequences are just awsome and best of all you don't see the cables which, unfortunately, you do in the TV version with Martin. How a California girl can talk like a true cockney and make you believe it is astounding. You'd sware she'd been born in Soho. I highly recommend this video to anyone who loves stage plays and children's tales. Cap'in Hook is just great! I bought the VHS version and it is great. Thanks A&E.

Passion, wisdom, humor, and compassion are the hallmarks of his writing style that walks you through essential steps in creating the practice of your dreams.Just as in chiropractic we tell our patients to please try chiropractic first before doing expensive, needless surgery, I suggest that D.C.'s read this gem of a book first before attending an expensive seminar.You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you miss My Bloody Valentine?","review":"This album isn't groundbreaking, but they've got their shoegazing noise act down pat.

There isn't any jargon or high-end analysis. It's not a heavy scientific text; the sample size is small but detailed. The book is written in a down-to-earth, familiar style with very believable couples as examples. I loved the variety of relationships shown in terms of age, time together, race, partner preferences, origin and history. There are 6 content chapters in the book (The Unconscious choice, To Commit or Not to Commit?,Setting Out, Crossroads, Conflict and Ways of Being) and the last chapter (7) is the Interviews and The Interviewed describing the process of writing the book.

I would recommend \\"Freeing Your Child From Anxiety\\" over this book. I felt I walked away from that book with actual tools to put into practice to help deal with her anxiety better.

I have a good stereo setup, components, but as an extra (or even as your main system if you don't have another setup), you can't imagine how fabulous the sound is that emanates from the AZ1560. I was blown away when I heard it at my brother's, who's a real music / equipment buff and only uses the best. I could swear it was coming from his regular stereo system. I believe the AZ1560 has recently been discontinued, but was able to get one of the last three units they had. I'm sure some of Philip's other boom boxes sound great, too, and I wouldn't hestitate to buy any Philips product. But, if you can get your hands on this model, it's the very best sound I've heard from a boom box and I've owned four.

For someone who is not intimate with the negotiations of the art world, the book is informative and surprising. It may not have been the author's intention, but I also felt a thread of sadness and melancholy, as though the artist and the subject still have an investment in the future of the canvas. Perhaps it is the awareness that all the owners eventually gave it up and that the current owner has removed it from sight. The author of this book has given us the facts, but has also invested those facts with meaning which speaks clearly about the impact of the artistic process, if one is willing to consider beyond the obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, Starry Night would go for 100,000,000$!","review":"She veers off into things that really don't pertain to the needed info about Vincent V.

In no respect could this be considered a valid international collaboration, in which each performer works with others in the creation of something unique.

It definitely does not live up to it's description. It touches on (one paragraph) many different topics, many of which I would have liked to know more about but just read about what I already know. It's not horrible, just basic. It most definetly does not prepare one for a trip to Spain or if you plan to move there(as I am doing).

The Jingle Cats sing all their own lyrics, although the use of backup singers, Snowball and Fluffy, certainly help deliver a broad range of rich feline tones lacking in the Jingle Cats first holiday-inspired record, Easter Cat is Coming to Town. Here, we see the success of that first album forced record execs to give into the Cat's desire to experiment with Me-ewe and Me-yau sounds, in addition to their basic but improved Me-ow. Unfortunately, the overly dramatic buildup throughout \\"I Want a Clean Litter Box for Christmas\\" proves to be overkill, lessening the emotional impact potentially felt by its haunting lyrics.

That is to say, the lyrics of Christmas songs are meowed by cats. It's fake, though. Cats' meows were recorded with a sampler and played back on a keyboard. There are also a few dog barks thrown in here and there. All the songs are old, public domain songs, so Mike Spalla doesn't have to pay royalties to the songwriters. It is somewhat amusing for one or two songs, but it gets pretty tedious after 50 minutes. \\"Angels We Have Heard on High\\" is the most amusing song here, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meowy Christmas","review":"The Jingle Cats are an adorable cat ensemble.

It's so funny.The music is well orchestrated and dogs are featured on a few tracks.Very very cute, and very original.For those who are confused by the concept of the Jingle Cats, it's just music put together by incorporating different cat meows. There's a whole range of cat noises. From high pitched kitten meows to low growls and dog barks.My favorite tracks are, Hava Nagila, Dance of the Reed Faries, Dance of the Sugerplum Fairies, Carol of the bells and Waltz of the Flowers.And the music on track 4 (Up on the House Top) is particulary fun, this track also includes purring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a Holiday Smile!","review":"I am a volunteer DJ in public radio, and since I bought this album in 93, I have always begun my music program with Jingle Cats the two weeks before Christmas.

My favorites are \\"Silent Night\\" and \\"Up on the Housetop\\"... good guitar solos in the latter and excellent meowing in both. The other tracks are entertaining, but inconsistent in quality. Some don't really have enough cats in them and lack in musical inventiveness. Some are darn right crazy and hilarious, like the \\"What Child Is This?/Hava Nagila\\" medley... the accordian is just as amusing as the cats and dogs.Really, if you are a fan of Kitties and Khristmas... you must own this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilariously awful","review":"This is one of the most stunningly bad records I've ever heard, and I enjoyed every minute of it.

It is composed only of voices, but it does not sound like a voice recording at all! I believe Jonathan had the singers visualize love and light when this recording was made, and love can definitely be felt in this recording, it is very soothing when played at moderate volume. When played at higher volume, it is very healing. I have experienced some emotional healing with this recording, and it was partly responsible for curing my sensitivity to gluten a few years ago, although this can be an uncomfortable experience as the emotions are released.The real OM vibration is the bridge between human consciousness and Cosmic Consciousness, according to Paramahansa Yogananda. The real OM can be heard only in deep meditation, and there is a special technique Yoganandaji teaches for hearing it.My other favorite healing recording is,Mantra for Healing - by Sacred Sound Choir, which is absolutely Divine."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the beauty of a broken refrigerator...","review":"It sounds like what the \\"composer\\" did was to sample a minute or two of someone chanting \\"OM\\", switched his synthesizer in loop mode, cranked up the reverb, then recorded an hour's worth of the resulting noise. What he captured was a monotonous, droning hum that bears absolutely no resemblence to an authentic chant.Although the liner notes pay lip service to the benefits of chanting \\"OM\\", the composer doesn't seem to understand that OM really consists of four sounds: A-U-M followed by the silence between repetitions. The liner notes also do a little too much advertising of other products and seminars available from the composer.Recommendation: Find an album of real chanting and immerse yourself in it. The \\"Ultimate OM\\" is the absolute height of New Age drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Relaxation","review":"This is a great CD for relaxing and sleeping. I do prefer more tones and differences in tracks than one continous sound that is produced on this album for the full length to the extent you cannot hear the actual voices that are saying the mantra.

However, it is very relaxing and great for keeping meditation with it's peaks to pull your mind and spirit back to the right track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synthesizer loops and no trace of human voices!!!!!","review":"Very misleading editorial review saying that the album contains the sound of hundreds of voices chanting \\"OM\\"in unison, etc..... when in reality there are only synthesized sounds looped in a mechanical, monotonous pacewith no natural variations or any resemblance of the OM chanted by human voices.The best OM recording I came across so far is Robert Gass\\" \\"OM NAMAH SHIVAYA\\" album which - on track 2 - contains17 minutes of a continuos OM chant done by a choir of beautiful, real voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent product meet my expectations arrives on time also as vendor describes.Thanks for your kindness, I will purchase from you again.Willi Estefanes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"Ok so it VHS so the quality isnt amazing but...

It took me a little longer than usualto read this book (it is a lengthy book). I blame it on the holiday season and my work load.

I liked the fact that he did not show any bias in his writing. He could have taken the oral history of the Ball family as fact, but he decided to collaborate his findings with the former slaves families. In doing so, he found out that many slaves where actually blood relatives of his.I didn't buy this book (I borrowed it from the library), however after reading it, I will purchase it, because if I ever plan to research my family history it will help me to organize my findings.

About a fourth of the information would be better saved for a Ball family reunion. Another quarter should not be included at all (like the description Ball gives of the old house he stayed in while visiting Charleston). Still, the point of view IS unique and strangely interesting. I would not try to convince someone to read it any more than I would try to talk someone out of reading it. The best part is the oral history of the Ball slave's descendents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A historiography as well as a geneology","review":"I agree with the readers who have recognized the different style Ball uses. However, I took that very differently. Once I saw the way the book was going to unfold, I accepted that he was taking us on the journey he travelled while researching the book. The book is as much a chronicle of the investigation as it is of the Ball family. Besides, after reading Faulkner, I have learned not to critique Southern writers for non-linear writing structure! That's not to say the format wasn't at times frustrating, but I do think it well-served its purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most powerful book I have ever read!","review":"I picked this one up on a whim after seeing it in Time magazine's top ten list. I was mesmerized by the story of the Ball family. The accuracy of and amount of data is a precious commodity for anyone interested in the history of the South. Ball makes no apologies for his ancestors and their behavior; he simply tells us the way it was. The fact that he helped some black families trace their lineage sent chills down my spine as I thought of the cruel circumstances that brought the families together in the first place. I have plans now to further research done by my second cousin to see just what my family history has to say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a courageous and engaging book. highly recommended","review":"I found this book fascinating and admirable. Mr. Ball's research is impressive in its thoroughness and breadth. For example, how did he discover that many \\"loyalist slaves\\" who fought with the British in the Revolution and ended up in England had written memoirs of their lives? Ball gives the full sweep of his own white family history, but can only give partial histories of black families. When he only knows a fragment of someone's life, he gives that fragment, without apology, as testimony to the large, tragic gaps in Black History. This book is courageous, honest and moving. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Made Real","review":"Edward Ball made a courageous journey into his family's past when he researched and wrote this book about their slave owning history, and took the step of searching out and meeting descendants of their slaves. This paperback edition includes an insightful follow-up exchange between the author and one of his black relatives about the writing of the book, their relationship, and how their views of race relations have and have not changed since its writing. The book inspired me both to think deeply about my attitude towards race and to read more about southern history, using the prism of slave ownership and my own family's southern geneaology as a focus.

Desperately earnest and well-intentioned, fascinating family info, yes. But Ball can't resist regaling us with every fact he ever knew, just to show off his prodigious research (\\"Philadelphia was founded in 1682\\") and his much-praised interviews with the slaves' descendants are composed mainly of \\"business\\" (they look at the floor, they smile, they take a breath), descriptions of people's eyes (melting, warming, they sound kind of like pancakes), and such profound explanations for slavery as \\"Because people are cruel.\\" (Oh, that explains it.) How this ever got the National Book award is beyond me -- the judges must have been so snowed by the \\"honesty\\" of a book about slave-owning they couldn't admit to themselves that even honesty can be badly written, trite, and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Correctness learned at Brown???","review":"I eagerly picked up Slaves in the Family hoping for a good read about a topic that has had little written about it. The organization of the book was so poor that one had to continually look at the family tree(s) in the back of the book to keep track of everyone.

The liberal concept that we are somehow responsible for the actions of our ancestors is ludicrous."},{"rating":"1","title":"historical researchers \\"substantiate\\" -- they do not \\"assume\\"","review":"The author assumes many thoughts & actions, usually negative, of his slaveholding ancestors, all without any basis in fact/record...and all to support his politically correct assertion that Southern slaveholding families are unworthy of redemption for their failure to grasp 20th century conventions. As a historian, he seems curiously unable to accurately assess history within its time and place.

This book is excruciatingly exact in details, but they're not details of general, historical interest. True, there are just scraps of information to go by, but they could have been fleshed out by what is known from other sources. Ball limited his book to what he found and what people told him, and painstakingly details what he found and who told him what. This is boring.

To his credit, he told a story whose time is long overdue, he just needed a better editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically impressive story-telling","review":"I would give this book 5 stars for the amount of research and heart that went into it's writing, but only a 3 for it's ability to stand on it's own as a piece of literature. That gives us an average of 4 stars. No doubt, I am envious of Mr. Balls techniques in learning the facts and his entire family for the foresight to document their lives so well. Maybe the latter was due to a feeling of self-importance that seemed typical of some of Mr. Ball's ancestors, but the genealogic consequences are amazing. I learned much from this book and feel that, as a sequence of short-stories it works quite well, which may have been the authors intent. Regardless, this was well worth the effort for me, a person born and raised in the South."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting topic & approach, not well executed though","review":"Good subject & interesting approach, but it reads like an exceptionally, exhaustingly long newspaper article. I thought the book was designed for readers with short attention spans & no taste for scholarly history, however well-written. The book has many scholarly-type facts strewn about its pages, in no particular order & with no particular line of argument. But it doesn't seem to bring any startling new & interesting interpretation to these facts. Not quite clear on why a jury thought this was one of the year's best books. But I though \\"A Civil Action\\" was a similar book that received such critical plaudits too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim","review":"The Wen arrived sooner than expected whch was great for me.

I LOVED this album and used to listen to it (even without chemical enhancement!) on headphones all the time in '82 and could not understand why it wasn't a hit. From the cover photo to the up-late-at-night-playing-piano ballad \\"Breaking Away from Sanity\\" this CD is an ahead of its time classic! Way more personal and rockin' than anything out right now.

The picture quality is OK, but there's quite a bit of video noise in the image. It's not bad, but it should've been better than this.Still, if you want to own this on DVD, here it is and it could have been worse.

This way I think a lot of people are missing very good movies they otherwise would have bought. There is no other way tomake this clear than by giving 1 star in the hope that the companies should see it and give us subtitles, this could not be so expensive as the price if those bare-boned DVD-R's is expensive enough. And they must realzie there are a lot of peo-ple for who subtitles are necessary.

I recently had to run this unit off of a generator for a week after Hurricane Sandy and the unit dealt with the less-than-stellar power provided by the generator without issue. However, just be aware that the unit is loud. This is quite normal for \\"double conversion\\" or \\"online\\" UPS units where the battery powers any devices connected to unit and street power is used only to charge the battery. The inverter required to do this normally requires a decent sized fan and is noisy in an of itself. In an isolated wiring closet or server room this is no problem.

This book is not anti-semitic, this book is anti-propaganda. Almost every reference which shows the Israelis in a bad light is a direct quotation from an Israeli leader. This book is heavy on facts, Hirst has many reference points, he does not make things up out of thin air. If you are looking for a book that tells you how the Palestinians are such horrible \\"terrorists\\", this is not that book. He is light on his criticisms of the Arabs, who have done their share of wrong. That's not what this book is about, though.

Probably not. Levinson's playing is flat, colorless, and seemingly devoid of any musicality or feeling. Add to this liner notes that are as cutesy as cutesy can be, and you have a CD that is bound for the bargain bin. Save your money - or better yet, purchase Kovecavich's or Kocsis' wonderful recordings of these pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all Music Fans are correct","review":"Sorry, Music Fan, but I have to agree with the other reviewer. I bought this CD having heard nothing but wonderful things about Levinson's playing and am incredibly disappointed at the result. After a single listening I took it to a used book store and traded it away. As a Regents' Professor of Piano, I too have played many of these works and am afraid that Levinson's performances are not even up to my students' standards, let alone mine.

Cook's new book \\"The Apocalyptic Literature\\" is an invaluable asset for preachers, teachers of religion, and any interpreter of scripture who is seeking greater spiritual understanding of apocalyptic writings.Cook firmly sets aside the limiting stereotyped understandings of the origins and meaning of \\"end time\\" writings: that apocalyptic writing is to be understood primarily as consolation for persecuted peoples, or as a coded \\"timetable\\" for an imminent end of the world in our times. Instead, he uses cultural and spiritual background to depict a richer context in which the \\"apocalyptic spirit\\" is an integral part of faith, not simply an unnecessary and uncomfortable addition.The book's comprehensive survey of apocalyptic writings offers great material for those teachers and preachers who are willing to take the challenge of enriching the spiritual lives of their students and congregations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interested in Nelson Eddy?

Content-wise, it is more of a career planning guide for first timers, & not a systematic comprehensive life/work planning guide as suggested in the secondary title of this book. This was my mistake, as I was attracted by the latter. I originally thought that I could pick up some winning fundamentals of life/work planning.Worst of all, this book used the old-fashioned typewriter fonts, & was printed in a manuscript format, which further aggravated my reading process.Fortunately, my copy is a used one, which I have bought very cheaply from an online shop.On the whole, I have been very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Fun At All?!","review":"Sweden continues to prove itself as the world's second California as far as modern punk rock goes, producing great bands such as Millencolin, Satanic Surfers and the increasingly successful No Fun At All. No Straight Angles is a very impressive album by the Swedish surf/skate core punk outfit. The album plays at a very fast pace, and you can hear the adrenalin being conveyed through their music. This album reminds me a lot of Pennywise during their Unknown Road / About Time era. The contrast between hardcore guitar riffs and the melodic vocals of the singer works a treat. The album stays consistent and every song will have you jumping round while listening. The two best songs \\"I can't believe it's True\\" and \\"It won't be long\\" are back to back. A great album to listen to when you want to get all that bent-up energy out of you!

However, I do think there is one significant flaw in the design: once the cap is plugged in place (either in the writing or storing position), the cap oscillates or wiggles laterally against the main body of the pen. This can be annoying as it does make a noise, and it gives the feel of a \\"sloppy\\" fit, although the cap of course is securely held in place in both positions and will not come off.

The legend has been rewritten to serve as political commentary (i.e., propaganda) disguised as an action series. Robin and his men are terrorists according to the Sheriff who is also fond of prattling on about the need for law and order and etc., etc., etc. The fight scenes more resemble the \\"rumbles\\" between the Sharks and the Jets in \\"West Side Story\\" than medieval combat. As if all this were not bad enough, we also have shallow characters and poor acting.

It may not be historically accurate, but if you suspend disbelief you will fall in love with the actors and the comical aspects of the show. I am at episode six and the show has found its flow. The first few episodes spend time to set up subplots and characters, and it is worth it. Marian is wonderful in this version of RH. I think she brings a streghth that really is a good role-model image for younger girls. She can take care of herself and doesn't hesitate to go into action to protect the people around her.

I also enjoy the lead actor as Robin Hood, he adds the perfect mixture of arrogance and being a hero. If you enjoy the time frame then you'll enjoy this and the way they add a little modern twist to the costumes and scenes. It also helps that the actors are younger, making the story more appealing to the young demographic! Im definately happy that I made the choice to get into this series, and hopefully will get to see season 2! Long live Robin Hood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I'm sorry, but this series is just not that good. I have watched all three series, so I'm not giving my opinion from having only watched a couple of episodes. To keep it short, every episode feels almost exactly like the one that came before it; or after it for that matter. The Sheriff kidnaps someone; Robin Hood and his merry band attempt a daring rescue - episode. The Sheriff has some hidden gold; Robin Hood and his merry band attempt to steal it, daringly of course - episode. The Sheriff lures Robin Hood and his merry band into town; surprise! It's a trap! Daring escapades ensue - episode. And on and on it goes, over and over again. Episode after episode. I would not have watched the entire series, but did so because I am a completionist. I took one for the team. So save yourself the time and save yourself the torture by not watching this crap. You'll be glad you didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Robin Hood, hero of medieval England. Should be good, right? But this show is so badly filmed, and so badly directed, that its character and mood are completely out of place. I keep expecting Robin Hood to pull out a SmartPhone and update his FaceBook status. As a photographer, I know good lighting, and this show is not well lit. The lighting is flat and obvious. The actors are equally without depth. I feel like I'm watching British teenagers in fancy dress. It just isn't believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most entertaining shows!","review":"Don't hesitate to buy these DVDs, the show is great. While it's not perfect and there are some annoyances (like the obviously fake doll baby in one episode) it's still wonderful. Jonah Armstrong is perfect as Robin Hood, he's cute, sarcastic, and fits the role perfectly. I also enjoy Lucy Griffiths portrayal of Marian, who has phenomenal chemistry with Jonah. All of the cast is great, and the characters work well together that its a really enjoyable show to watch. Even the Sheriff is the epitome of a love-to-hate character because he has all the best funny lines.Great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth $20 new.","review":"There's a reason this is available for $20 new, you get what you pay for, or in this case not even that. At that price I thought I'd give it a try, expecting something at least matching the quality level of Legend of the Seeker. Boy was I wrong. What a horrible waste of time. Tedious, repetitive scripts, cheap sets, and horrendous editing, to name just a few of its many negatives. What an unexpected let down from a modern BBC series.I've been an Amazon customer for a long time and this is the first review I've written. I felt it was my duty to warn others to avoid this tripe. Don't be fooled by the inexplicably positive reviews or the interesting cover art, this is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please shoot me...","review":"Please, someone shoot me. I love the Robin Hood legends and I love period films. Unfortunately, this Robin Hood is lame. Low production, (think Xena and Hercules...but least Xena and Hercules look like they can handle their weapons). This is certainly NOT a period series. Supposedly this Robin Hood has been given a 'modern twist'and thats ok...but it makes me crazy that we are told this takes place in the middle ages, yet our characters continually use VERY modern terms. Kinda kills the 'period' idea. Oh, did I mention the terrible acting and the fact that none of the characters are likable. I just didn't feel anything for them. Mel Brookes' \\"When Things Were Rotten\\" was much more amusing and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"For children only","review":"Let me begin by saying I am a great fan of the legend of Robin Hood. From Errol Flynn to Prince of Thieves, I love the story and adventure. If you are a fan as well, check out Samuel Goldwyn's series \\"Robin of Sherwood\\" starring Michael Praed/Jason Connery.This new version has good production values,ie cinematography, costumes, sets, etc. However, the writing is geared towards 8-12 year olds with painfully predictable humor/storylines/stunts as well as single dimensional acting. I rented the first two seasons and only made it halfway through the first episode and back they went. Do yourself a favor and RENT IT FIRST!Robin of Sherwood: The Complete Collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for realism, this ain't it.","review":"I purchased this based on the rave reviews published here. I will never make that mistake again.I think this was created for people who dislike all the violence and nudity in period movies made these days. They want to watch something that looks and feels like the TV shows they saw as children. Well, this certainly fits the bill. It's like a Robin Hood Tv show from the 1950s, complete with unbelievably cheap and tacky sets, costumes and fight sequences. The stories are so simple a four year old would be bored. There is some clever dialogue, but the amateur acting kills it before it leaves the actors' mouths.If you long for the good old innocent days of early TV, this is for you. All others, beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"takes political correctness to a whole new level","review":"The series sure makes you miss Errol Flynn. It is packed full of violins and bloodshed, I believe I saw someone skin their knee. The only fatalities in this series is when Robin and the sheriff talk their audience to death. So politically correct you want to run out and vote Democratic. The sets and the scenery are nice, but I'm 66 years old now, and I don't want to see a Robin Hood I could beat the snot out of. Richard Greene made a more believable Robin Hood, at least he shot people. Well, back to the series, I believe I'll start rooting for the Sheriff of Nottingham."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love watching the Robin Hood Series.","review":"Whenever there is nothing worth watching on TV, we watch another episode of Robin Hood.

Every episode is so riveting that you forget you aren't onscreen yourself, fighting the sheriff alongside RobinIt shows the hero side of robin hood (what robin hood worth his salt wouldn't be a hero) but also the real struggles he would face. He's not a perfect hero, maybe... but certainly one that has chosen to make a difference in his world.And when Robin can't accomplish the task with his ingenious swordplay and/or arrow volleys Maid Marian dons the disguise of \\"the Night Watchman\\".

This production has no attention to detail and it shows...

The characters were developed well and though Maid Marion is more modernistic and feministic than the period of the 12th century would ever allow,(she looks more and dresses like a modern Brit than a 12th century lady) its all in good fun if they dont get carried away into political correctness.

Anything as long as the villains are; Christians, men, white people, merchants, lawmen, aristocracy, and on and on...\\"We don't punish thieves, the Sherriff does that,\\" pearls of wisdom from Robin, after villagers capture thieves robbing their village, and then he lets them go, so they can rob Marion's home...Add amateurish-unconvincing dialogue and even more dreadful fight scenes (Robin fighting holding a baby looks so bad as to embarrass the audience for watching), makes this my pick for \\"Worst Action Series Ever\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show for 10 year old children.","review":"It just seemed overly childish.

This bone keeps our dogs' teeth nice and clean, and it takes them awhile to break it down. Now, it is not totally indestructable. And Nylabone does disclose that. It does break down into small shards that they say are safe and they pass through your dog's system rather quickly. It will save you a lot on dental cleanings if you choose this bone!

I bought this chew toy about 5 weeks ago and it is definitely his favorite chew toy. I've tried other chew toys, but this one is the one he always goes back to get. After 5 weeks of almost daily chewing it's broken down and needs to be replaced. The pros: my dog loves it, it keeps him busy, it's the right size for him. The con: it didn't last as long as I had hoped it would. The other thing is, while the dog loves to chew on the ends, he doesn't like the rubber round ball in the middle. I've offered the toy to him by covering up the ends and making only the middle available, and he won't touch it. He'll wait until I've put the chew down and then he'll snatch it up by the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Power Chewers!","review":"I have a 3 year old Doberman who loves to chew.

It's rated for dogs up to 25 lbs., something the package doesn't clearly show and the product description leaves out. This toy should be labeled \\"small\\", not \\"regular\\", and the description amended to clearly state what size dog it's designed to suit.No way will my 55 lb. collabradoodle get this--it's too small to be safe for her.

The characters were very unrealistic. Effie, for instance, varied between being a mindless piece of fluff to a responsible, enlightened citizen with a social and moral conscience. Nadine, Alice, Greg were so stereotypical as to be one-dimensional. I only finished this because I wanted to find out the ending. The mystery was alluded to on the first page and resolved at the end, but lots of what went on didn't further the story or heighten the mystery.

This is an album you can pop in your cd player and let it play straight through. AWESOME!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to depth","review":"This album is disappointing. It lacks the lyrical depth of The Moon is Down. The guitar is still awesome, but not as distinct as The Moon is Down. Overall, The Moon is Down is a much better album for those of you who crave meaning and relation in lyrics. Also, check out Dashboard Confessional... Chris Carrabba is amazing with words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely more mature than TMID","review":"First off, here's the obligatory bit about the whole Chris (Dashboard) vs Jason (new vocalist). Chris' range was good for the slower stuff, IMO, but Jason's voice is more versatile (again, IMO).Musically, I think they \\"mesh\\" a little better. I do miss the stronger, more complex drumming of TMID, however. Still, the new album is a lot more cohesive than their first effort.Can't wait to see 'em live in March"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Even without Chris, FSF kicked up another notch. This is the perfect album for the emo guitarist. Not only that but they held onto their Christian hue as well. A beautifully masterful album... a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Honestly, I dont know why everyone is jonesing over this band. I bought this one giveing it every chance in the world. Sure the lyrics are good, But all of the songs follow a similair inharmonious tone. It gets real old real fast. The new vocal guy does a MUCH better job than Chris Carrabba did but, it doesn't do much for this album. I listened to \\"The Moon is Down\\" still couldn't figure out why everyone liked these guys, This one totally hasn't changed my mind in any shape or form. Don't by this unless you have some twisted taste for bad music.2 stars just because they recruited a singer to fit their....style?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A major improvement over the last cd","review":"First off, I'd like to say that I am a huge fan of Dashboard Confessional and own FSF's first album, \\"The Moon is Down\\". Although I love Dashboard, I wasnt a big fan of \\"The Moon is Down\\". Although the vocals are beautiful, the music was harder than the singing should have been accompanied by, and it didn't match. However, this time around, on \\"How to Start a Fire\\", the vocals are not only different because of the new singer (Jason Gleason), the vocals are a little rougher. I feel Gleason's voice is more suited for FSF's sound than Carabbas's was. This album is an excellent cd on its own right. Really cool songs with searing vocals, intelligent lyrics and catchy choruses. I really like the new direction that this band is taking. Higly recomended for fans on DC, FSF's first album, Taking Back Sunday and other groups alike.Best Tracks: # 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insincerity as a band name","review":"The title of my review says it all. This is not the Further Seems Forever of The Moon Is Down. My one star review is not a comment on the band's new singer or style. I haven't listened enough to the new songs to judge that. I'm just warning people not to expect anything similar to the band's earlier work. I don't know why they didn't just change their name, because if I didn't know better I'd say the music from The Moon Is Down and How to Start a Fire had been written and performed by completely different bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its just not very good.","review":"I really liked the moon is down, and Im not really comparing this directly to that album. Further seems forever have completely redone their sound on how to start a fire and it sounds newer and seems to keep with the trends of where punk is going, but they just dont seem to implement their talent very well. Another reviewer said that its more screamy and I agree but it sounds more like a new age dream theater than a another thursday. The lyrics I really didnt like either, I felt they were trying to be really deep but just didnt pull it off, sounds like bad poetry. Overall I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This cd is awesome, i have been waiting for the new release ever since i heard about Jason's coming to the band. His work in Affinity was great and i was anxious to hear the new sound. I was impressed with every song on the album, especially \\"a blank page empire\\", \\"the sound\\", and \\"on legendary\\". This is a must have album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but the first one is better","review":"I got this album the second day it was out, and I was not dissapointed. The new singer is great. I still think \\"Moon is Down\\" is a little better. This album is harder than \\"Moon is Down\\" also. The album reminds me a lot of the Juliana Theory; \\"Understand This is a Dream\\". If you enjoy that Juliana Theory album, you'll enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!","review":"FSF rocked with Chris Carabba, but I think Jason Gleason does a GREAT job at filling his place. This record shows their progression as a band, and although a bit different from the first, obviously, it is great never the less. Also, you have to love the artwork, and the poetry by Chad's sister (I think it's his sister...). Anyways, this is a great CD, so give it a chance even if you didn't like FSF when Chris was singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss Chris!","review":"I miss Chris' music with FSF. Now there's a new singer who doesn't even reach the emotional vocal range that this style of music requires. The CD is alright for the 17 bucks I paid for it, but I just wish that Chris would take a break from Dashboard and come back because that would kick major butt. If you want to hear Further Seems Forver buy \\"The Moon is Down\\" if you want to hear Further w/out Chris then pick up this CD. I liked this CD but I still miss Chris's wonderful voice that made me want to cry sometimes! Good CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm... yeah... good album title? ....","review":"One spin of this steaming pile and one can understand why it wasn't entitled How To Make a Good Album.

The first show I saw them in they were really lacking, came out strong but had almost nothing good to play towards the end of the show. The second time I saw them, they rocked and put on an amazing show so I was motivated to go out and buy the album. The first two songs are great, but after that it's like the tempo of the album comes to a screetching hault and it just stops rocking so much. It's a good effort for changing frontmen between two albums, but it shows a lot more potential then it is actually good. With the improvement between their two shows I saw, I have a feeling their NEXT album will be the one to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mmmmm.....ediocre","review":"Okay, so about a year ago I bought this CD after much thought and deliberation, I listened to stuff from the moon is down and I loved it, but turns out they got a new singer who IS good, but they music and singing just get monotonous. It just is completely the same. They are releasing a new CD very soon, and they got the sense field singer, which is a good band, so maybe he'll bring some fresh blood into the band that was previously mono-emo.I should've bought the moon is down. I tried hard to like this CD, I really did. I have pulled it out numerous times after i bought it (a year ago) and still dont like it. Didn't grow on me. Lets see how the new CD shapes up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris Carrabba- The Band's Neccesity","review":"when i first heard 'wearing thin' off of FSF's cd Moon is Down, i was blown away. i could not stop listening to the song. i heard more songs and grew to like the band. after a while i had heard that chris left to do dasboard. i went out and bought this cd without listening to one song... that was a mistake. on the previous cd, carrabba brought life to the band with his powerful vocals and the music was much more upbeat. with this album it was not that way. no dont get me wrong, jason can sing.. but as for the musical part.. there is none. this album really slowed down to a more mellow tone compared to Moon is Down, with an except to one song, 'Pride War'. Thismade me regret buying the cd. if youre into mellow music- or the exact opposite of Moon is Down... buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"F.S.F. Turned Into Mediocre Radio Rock","review":"Yeah, the new singer can sing, but there is a definate lack of depth to the lyrics. If you enjoyed Further Seems Forever due inpart to the contribution of Chris, you may be let down by this new installment. The heart and the spark of the band left when Chris left for Dashboard Confessional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Terrible......Save your money","review":"If you want to know what this Album sounds like? Okay, take their first album (Moon is down), Make carraba's voice a little more winier (if possible) and make the songs sond exactly the same, and there you go. It does not even sound like they tried to grow as a band at all, like they tried to duplicate their old album. No thought was placed into it, no creativity, no time, and it shows. You can buy it if you are a hardcore FSF fan, but then again those people probably already have it. I would give this album 0 stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely worth a listen","review":"I picked up this CD out of random curiosity. I can't say that I've ever cared for Chris Carraba, so I am objective in that respect.Considering Chris' ties to the group, I wasn't expecting to be particularly enthralled, but I was pleasantly surprised. It definitely isn't perfect through and through, but the music is great and the vocals are sincere. I find the song structures and lyrical content to be very intriguing. Some of my personal favorite songs thus far include \\"The Sound\\", \\"A Blank Page Empire\\", \\"Against My Better Judgement\\", and \\"Insincerity As An Artform.\\" I'm glad that I got this CD and the replay value certainly isn't failing me."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good, start to finish","review":"i eagerly awaited this ablum... looking forward to listening the new material they had put together. i had seem them live a couple times in the summer/fall of '02 (in FL, before i moved to TN), and had seem them numerous times during the strong arm years. they always bring a good live show. this cd has some good rock grooves. my favorite so far is: against my better judgement. coming from the success of the group's first album, many would figure it to be too difficult to come back in solid and true form, which they have done brilliantly. only reason i didn't rate this a 5/5 is at times it was difficult to distinguish some of the riffs through the over-amplified distortion... if they had softened some of that distorton, many of the songs would truly shine- holding their rock banner high. heck, and for 10 bucks,it's worth it anyway. get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GAME IN THE WORLD","review":"I got this game really cheap off amazon and played it to see what this type of game would be like and it was AWESOME!!!!!!!Get the game NOW and play it 24/7!!!!

A 3-part Suite opens with a brass chorale leading to Tom Scott cooking on flute (Scott doubled on many of the overdubbed sax parts), then the band takes it to a gently bopping Marvin Stamm solo. Closing out with a beautiful tenor sax by Scott. We played this chart in college jazz band back in 1976, so it was particularly exciting for me to play the closing solo.\\"Mr. Smoke\\" is as the name implies; it SMOKES! The chart opens up with a cool harmonica solo provided by Tommy Morgan a la' Rockford Files (wah-wah guitar in the background). Tom Scott takes over with another bop cooking flute solo. Marvin Stamm follows with a pensive muted trumpet solo. The brass and saxes open it with a tension-releasing, smoking soprano sax solo by Scott, with the ensemble closing it out with a rousing climax.And On The Sixth DayThe WitchThresholdA Lady Beside MeMr. Smoke"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Gone John","review":"I agree that Tom Scott and Marvin Stamm both made outstanding musical contributions to this album, but let's not forget about the fabulous drumming on John Guerin.

Recommended for serious collectors and casual listeners alike, though I believe that if you are new to this kind of music, you might want to start with bigger names (Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, Johnny Burnette, etc.) and then work your way deeper into the rockabilly vaults..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween Wee Sing much better","review":"I bought this after having bought the Halloween wee sing and my kids loved it. This one is disappointing. A lot of the songs are sung by adults unlike the Halloween music which is fun and sung by children. Some of these Christmas songs are sung by children but overall I wasn't very impressed with this cd. Most of the songs are slow not fun songs. Not that I'm opposed to the songs but for a children's cd it's not very fun.

I remember really liking the Wee Sing Christmas so I ordered it this year. I should have read all the reviews where someone else mentions that they don't sing all the verses on some of the songs. On the first 5 or so songs I played, they didn't sing all the verses in any of them. This CD will sit on the shelf and never get played- a waste of $10. Who wants to listen to incomplete songs? I certainly didn't remember that on the old cassette tape they gutted the songs, so I don't know if this is new to the CD or not. If I could rate this a 0 stars I would for the simple fact that they sing one or two verses out of 3, 4, or 5 or more verses. Again, a waste of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Dissappointed","review":"Having been long-time fans of the Wee Sing franchise, we expected nothing less than the high-quality, fun and energetic music that we'd previously experienced. The Wee Sing for Christmas, however, was extremely dissappointing. Not only are the fun and light-hearted songs few and far between, but most of the songs are sung by adults. Whatever this is, it's not an album for kids, and, in my opinion, not even for adults. It's just boring and mediocre. Do not waste your money by adding this to your collection of children's music. It's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wee Sing For Christmas","review":"Not as good as Wee Sing For Halloween. I expected more songs oriented toward young children.

I bought the book on the strength of the author's Colefax and Fowler connection, only to find that the author is a designer at one of a number of subsidiaries of the corporate Colefax and Fowler Group, and apparently has never worked for the Colefax and Fowler design firm. As a result, her style is nothing at all like traditional Colefax and Fowler, with its period furniture, lush fabrics and liberal use of trimmings, antique accessories, paintings and engravings. If that is what you are looking for, don't buy this book. Instead, look for \\"Colefax and Fowler\\" by Chester Jones or \\"Interior Inspirations\\" by Roger Banks Pye."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldnt even plug it in","review":"The DVD player is a SATA plugin, and thats normal.

The strap is unique to Skagen and is actually secured by little screws. I searched some sites on the web only to find out that Skagen no longer supply replacement straps to any reseller. The only way to get a replacement strap is through Skagen itself. I contacted Skagen and they told me that they no longer ship replacement straps. The only way to get a replacement strap is to ship it to their repair centre, run by Metro Service Repair, who will charge you the standard fee for a repair, approx $30, and it could take up to 5 weeks to complete. So I will pay shipping costs both ways plus $30 and be without my watch for 5 weeks!!

When I put it on my wrist, the crown dug so uncomfortably into my skin whenever I moved my hand the wrong way, that it took me about 20 seconds to know I'd be returning it. I'm surprised more people haven't commented on this flaw, as it's a very poor design. All they had to do was have the crown sit higher (away from the skin), and it would be fine. I'm so unimpressed with the design that Skagen watches are now off my list entirely.

However, I'm taking it to be cut and refinished and I'm sure it will be perfect afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"This watch is not expensive, can be used with casual or formal clothes, it's comfortable, and looks nice.

When my wife took the watch to a watch repair shop, they quoted $55 to replace the broken crystal. That's five less than the sale price of the watch - no thanks. Oh well, it was nice while it lasted, but I won't buy another one to replace the first - twenty bucks a month is a bit high for a watch rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Watchband","review":"I liked the slim line feature which is why I originally purchased this watch.

Maybe superglue would work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this watch","review":"I have friends who've bought Skagen watches, and I've always liked the simplicity and understated style of these watches, and after seeing this one on line I bought it.

I've very glad I didn't because of the three watches my son received he likes this one the best. Wears it all the time, and like me, he loves that it's very classy and professional looking with a terrific leather strap, but is slim enough to fit comfortably underneath the cuff of any shirt even the tight ones that are a little tight.Great watch.

Thanks so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent watch, proprietary band costs too much","review":"I have a similar version of this watch, a 331 series. The problem with all Skagen leather banded watches is the proprietary strap. You have to go back to Skagen to get a replacement as none are sold on the open market. And you cannot order a strap from them, you must send your watch to them, shell out $32 and wait 4-6 weeks to get it back. If you add the cost of shipping+insurance to send it to them, you're out around $40 for what is a poorly made strap. What a 'bargain'I know this all to well, I just went through it a this month with my Skagen. Never again; when this strap goes so does the watch. Do yourself a favor and avoid their watches. The watch itself is nice and keeps excellent time, I just refuse to play their silly game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great dress watch","review":"It is an understated dress watch with a refined look of an expensive dress watch. My only complaint is the watch seems small on my arm and frame. I am 6 ft. tall 215 lbs. and the face of this watch would be better proportioned to a smaller man with smaller arms and wrist. The stitching on the leather band is a nice touch. This is my second Skagen, and the 1st is larger and I wear it most often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skagen Men's watch","review":"The watch has the clean look and slim profile that my husband was looking for.

It gives you in depth insight on how to build a strategic and rewarding golf course. George C. Thomas has the courses to back it up as well. A perfect example is The Riviera Country Club, which I have worked at and played many times. It is the epitomy of a strategic course that this book exemplifies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross Section of Friendship","review":"Well, I guess the underlying message here would be that what one thinks of their friends and friendships may not be the reality of it to the other. In other words, Gemma and Esther's relationship was not what Esther was telling us. In fact, both girls have two seperate realities as to the depth and understanding of their friendship. The author weaves this message into quite a tale of travel, discovery, and tragedy. We are told the story of these two on a trip to India through Esther, who thinks of her self as a world traveler. She takes along her childhood friend Gemma out of guilt. They meet up with other travelers, and so the story unfolds. Esther ends up going back to England alone and distraught. But the story doesn't end there, as Esther has to put closure to losing Gemma five years later.This is a great read and quite entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tense read","review":"Two young women, friends from childhood, go back-packing to India - exotic at first, then increasingly sinister.

Set aside at bit of time, this is not the kind of story you can just casually read, you'll want to know every morsel until it is done.The story of Esther and Gemma is beyond fasinating. I don't mean to be so vague but I just don't want to give anything away. Since you've looked this far at the book...just buy it and read it, you wont be sorry!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, predictable ending, derivative plot - skip it!","review":"Losing Gemma starts out with a good premise - what happens if you go to India with your best friend, then come back without her? But that was where the suspense died. The pace of the book was off, the characters were cardboard cut-outs and Esther, the main character, was annoying and unbelievable. But the main thing I find truly surprising was how flat and dull Gardner made India seem. I also doubt very much if she's spent much (or any?) time there, as it read to me as though she had simply picked up a few colorful descriptions from a DVD on travelling in India.I would have loved to have given it a couple of stars at least, as the plot idea was original, but nothing about the book brought that originality to light. Pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor poor poor editing.","review":"Someone else wrote that the book starts off well and ends poorly.I have no idea if that's true.

It is a gripping mystery, though the ending is not quite a surprise, it does not take away from the story, the characters, and the sharply written prose. Two girls go to India, meet up with a third, and one of the original two does not come back. With India as background, the anxiety of travel without tourism, the coming of age, the secrets, mystery, and guilt, this is a fabulous book. You can read this book in a day, simply because you will not want to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"This story was a disappointment for me. Besides seeing the ending coming from a mile away--I mean, how many hints do we need??--the narrater has a tendency to say the same things a hundred different times. \\"I felt so guilty about Gemma,\\" or \\"I was nervous about Gemma\\", and that kind of thing get repeated and repeated till you almost find yourself skimming. Her reemphasizing her emotions at every moment was a serious case of telling, not showing. In short, this book was no \\"The Beach\\". But I will say that it had a good premise, and the author never pretends to have any writing style. She is very matter of fact in her story telling skills, with little pretension. Still, I think I could have used a lot more complexity and mystery in the way this story was told. Bottom line: potentially excellent plot, poorly executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Guide to Air Tools and Compressors","review":"This book is a welcome guide to air tools for the beginner.

Again it switches to a recording session featuring our heros in a jam session singing this awful song, as crow would say \\"Lyrics by Mrs. Smith kindergarden class\\". Tommy goes to look for more 'specimens' and comes across a giant egg and keeps it, when it hatches out comes trumpy the alien, whose brother is evil (origin of hatching unknown).

It's a glove you wear to protect your hand, and the little mice and toys dangle from the fingers for the cat to attack. My cat did play with it, but only for about 30 seconds.I think the main drawback is that the mice sit there, idle, until the cat reaches for them to pull them down. Otherwise, it's static, unless you yourself pull the mice down in front of them. Perhaps if this were a more hi-tech glove, there'd be raise and lower buttons in each of the fingers to give control, to create movement and entice the cat into playing, but that would be a much more expensive glove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Therapy in a Glove","review":"I suspect that before I adopted Ansel that he had been abused.

I bought this toy because he loves interactive play, but I didn't imagine that he would also love to have his face petted and ears and chin scratched with the glove on. He doesn't associate the glove with the human hand so he doesn't feel threatened by it. The mice can rain and dance all over him, and he's as happy as can be to either lay still and be petted or grab and bite at them. The blue mouse with the elastic tail is his favorite.

I used the same methodology (adding a new printer rather than using the installed USB printer) on my Vista machine, worked!To me, the trick is to add a new printer, rather than converting a existing printer installed on your computer into a print server affiliated printer. Now I have two printers installed, one is my printer server printer which I can print wirelessly, the other is the good old stand alone USB printer.

I don't know if this is going to cause a problem if the internet or router goes down. I suspect the Net gear will always assign the print server the same IP anyway.It works and I am happy that my wife can print from her computer without mine being on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IOGEAR GPSU21 Worthless POS","review":"What can be simpler? Simply translate TCP/IP to USB. We'll, the box says \\"Network Printer Management Solution\\". But it doesn't work with All-In-One printers. In addition, all firewalls must be disabled while installing - It seems incredible but my firewall detected the IOGEAR install program contains Malware! On my XP machine it never finished the install process and on my Vista machine it said that it was happy with the install process only to crash any application that attempted to print! Finally, the happy cardboard card that had the customer support number turned out to be not so happy when I was put on hold forever and finally just sent to voice-mail. Please read this and don't buy this - it has wasted 7 hours of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did't work for me","review":"I bought this with the hope of making my Canon MP830 wireLess.

My hope was that this little box would eliminate the need to repeatedly connect my printer via USB, but I have had nothing but trouble with it. After doing some research, I've found many Mac users had trouble with it as well, and while some have posted possible solutions, I don't have time to mess around to get this thing to work. Very disappointed in this purchase. I should also note that the Mac setup is of no help whatsoever. You have to use Windows to even locate the IP address of this thing, and even then it's not recognized with a static IP. It worked for a day with DHCP but after the weekend now it cannot be detected. This is a waste of money if you use a Mac. Just buy a network printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"IOGear worthless","review":"I could not get it to work. customer support was never available.

I'm only rating it as a 1 star because I couldn't go lower. I have a Windows 7 Pro and a Windows SP Pro network setup. I need both PCs to talk to my printer. This print server was supposed to easily fit that bill, but no matter how hard I try I can't get the software installed. When I click on the Installation Wizard, nothing happens. I disabled my Norton Firewall... still nothing. I downloaded the driver from the IOGear website... nothing happens. On either machine! Tech Support is like talking to a 4 year old... they simply read from a script. Requests to escalate the call fell on deaf ears.

The printer queue dialog box says that the print driver processed and sent print files and all is just dandy, but the printer never blinks its green eye.The very nice gentleman at tech support said that my router is not set for DHCP. He was of course unable to give me any hints on how to do that, if it is feasible at all.The IOGEAR Web site and manual are pathetically useless. Web searches yielded no helpful clues.I'm stuck.

If you don't run DHCP you're out of luck. Most TCP/IP print servers allow you to connect to a default IP address and reconfigure to your network. Not this one. The setup software is completely dumb.

It is simply taking a signal over TCP/IP and translating it back into USB for use by the printer. Tech support took a bunch of info from me then said check the driver and compatibility list. This makes no sense, this is like saying check that your lightbulb is compatible with your extension cord. I have an HP P1006, straightforward laser printer. Not listed, unknown to IOGear. Didn't work. Makes no sense to me, a 20 year networking guy who has installed numerous devices on networks. However, I am a cheapskate, so bought this on price.

Had to turn off the bidirectional to get the printer to print 1 test page that the printer paused after every 2 lines (even on draft mode). Could not print any more.
