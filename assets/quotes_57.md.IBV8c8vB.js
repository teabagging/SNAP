I have returned to her book time and again in my personal journey, to \\"check in\\" to see if my thoughts and feelings are common to those of my Enneagram type, for reassurance, and for suggestions on moving forward.

Several years ago I lent the book to my sister-in-law, an elementary school teacher with a basic understanding of the enneagram. As she and I discussed her reaction to the book, I realized how its insights could also inform the consumer about the basic processes of therapy and the benefit of choosing a professional provider with a compatible counseling approach. With her straightforward narrative style and case examples, Ms Bartlett has managed to write a book accessible to the lay public as well as professionals.

You see Jackie Chan in Young Master and then Twin Dragons, and that's it! Than a little bit of Bruce Lee in about 2 or maybe 3 films and that's it! It never even shows them off, you only see Jackie do one descent stunt when he runs over the car and that's it, where as a real film on this subject would show just about all his big stunts.

He said that is was a recording of great historical importance because none other than the three biggest names in Nazidom - Hitler, Goering, & Goebbels - sat in the front row. Furtwangler hated the Nazis and did his best to use the occasion to protest against them. As a result, this performance is incredibly dark. In the final movement, just before the Turkish March, there is a molto tenuto on the word \\"Gott\\" -- \\"God.\\" Furtwangler stretched it out just as long as was humanly possible.

It sounds like the writer was working on about four separate songs and then decided to randomly splice them together for the radio cut. The vocals are drenched in electronic effects like reverb and chorus - Kim sounds like she's a robot in an echo chamber. What are supposed to be vocal hooks end up annoyingly piercing to the ears and seem somewhat off key. I hate to say it, but Kim is no Jocelyn Enriquez nor is she M:G.

In 1978 the federal freedom of information act was passed and the FBI's massive failure in allowing, if not causing the death of Viola Liuzzo would be public. I'm not a conspiracy nut claiming the gov't made this movie but the timing is convenient and it is an abomination of the real history.

DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"This \\"documentary\\" turns out to be a sophisticated attempt to undermine the work that Darwin did. It focuses on Darwin's younger years and a constant theme is bringing out errors that Darwin made. It began with his telling of tall tales as a 8 or 10 year old. The DVD makes a lot of the fact that Darwin collected in the Galapagos but didn't record the islands where the various specimens were obtained. Nothing was mentioned about how he overcame this deficiency. More \\"errors\\" Darwin made were emphasized all the while \\"praising\\" his genius. A far better approach to understanding what Darwin did and where he went astray is in the documentary, \\"What Darwin Never Knew.\\" My suspicions on this DVD were aroused when I discovered that the \\"documentary\\" was made by Creation Ministries. If you never add this to your collection, you won't have missed anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda piece","review":"When the disk first started I saw \\"Creation Ministries International\\" flash across the screen. Huh? What? At first I thought this was an examination of Darwin's influence on the philosophical world, Then I thought this might be an examination of the Darwin vs. ID people. But as the commentators became more fanciful and convoluted in their rhetorical back flips, I found myself reaching for Occam's Razor. Indeed, the extra material rips the face mask off-all of these commentators are Intelligent Design apologists. Throughout the \\"documentary\\" these commentators ascribe thoughts to Darwin, that I have never heard before; the extra material makes clear that this is just tea leaf reading-the same sort of thinking that they use to interpret the mind-of-god when reading the bible. This more than anything proves that faith is no substitute for facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Nonsense","review":"If you want to know why I am giving this one star, and if you think your faith can handle it (Of course it can, right?

Keep an open mind, and you will be surprised what you can actually learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped-off by Creationist group","review":"Like others have said it is a propaganda DVD made by creationists nothing more.

The plot varies little: much explicit sex, murder, mayhem, using/selling drugs, greed and materialism to the max, and the usual twists and turns of gangsta life. Unfortunately, it is becoming quite clear that if one reads one 'hip-hop novel', one has read them all. I feel that Thomas has a lot to offer and has a talent for writing. i would hope that he would broaden his genre; to limit one's self to one topic can become stultifying at the least.

The disc provides three different versions of the film: color 3-D, black-and-white 3-D, and a really good color print in 2-D. There are also interviews with cast and crew members, and a nice documentary about 3-D that even provides a 3-D trailer preview of THE MAZE!The film itself is a typical softcore flick from the late 1960s. Some of the actresses include Christina Hart (who is interviewed in the accompanying featurette), cult fave Monica Gayle, and Nancy \\"CINDY AND DONNA\\" Ison. THE STEWARDESSES was perhaps the first American film of its kind that played mainstream theaters. Because of that, I consider it to be the first film in the \\"porno chic\\" movement, although many film historians award that distinction to DEEP THROAT (1972)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy but fun","review":"Wasn't around when this came out but glad I am here to see the new release.

Then again, it has almost no plot or story. The budget for the film was $100,000 and it grossed more than $25 million at the box office. There are several alternate versions of the film. The film is a part of pop culture. It was spoofed on SCTV. The Stewardesses was one of the first movies filmed in Stereophonic 3-D. Many Hollywood 3-D movies were filmed in Anaglyph 3-D. This Shout Factory DVD does deliver in quality. The film claims that it was based on a novel, but that is not true! The film has many filler scenes. People play pool or have fun at a carnival.

Your theory and scales and modes are OK when taken in small chunks but that isn't where great a bassist comes from. It comes from inside you and what you feel in the music, not from a book on theory. He makes sense the whole way through and admits right off the bat he knows very little theory. It was nice to hear the truth spoken from one of the world's best bassist.

The mystery plot in itself all right, but all the characters that populate it are all stereotypes -- e.g., holier than thou Jews; overly friendly Witnesses; people who moved to New York from other states; and gay, pretentious artists -- and we never really find out out people's motivations for what they're doing, particularly when they seem to be violating their own religions' dictates. This book reads like it was written by someone who's seen a documentary about life in Brooklyn rather than someone who's lived it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bush had no \\"Plan of Attack\\"!","review":"This was a great book!As many Americans are already aware, Bush had no plan of attack for Iraq. In \\"Plan of Attack\\" you will understand how the Iraq war was \\"planned\\". The book describes many arguements between administration officials about the war. It describes the suspicious relationship between President Bush and The Saudi Royal Family.One thing i thought was suspicioud that the book mentioned was how the Saudis knew we were going to attack Iraq even before congress or the American public.IF you liked this book i also reccomend \\"Against All Enemies\\" by Richard Clark."},{"rating":"2","title":"the 'right' are wrong","review":"Bob Woodward's claims in his book are being refuted by the White House. He didn't become one of our nation's pre-eminent journalists for nothing. He has hours of taped conversation and full transcripts to back up his claims, (including taped conversations with Powell himself). He said he will keep them private, but I'm sure, if push comes to shove, he will make them public to silence his right wing critics. He did not set out to bash bush, but was obviously very disturbed by much of what he saw and heard first hand in the administration.\\"To announce that there must be no criticism of the President. or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is treasonable to the American public.\\" (Theodore Roosevelt \\"editorial\\", Kansas City Star, May 7,1918)A republican president no less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced Reporting","review":"Plan of attack seems to be a very thorough and balanced presentation of the process, which led up to the Invasion of Iraq. I say it was balanced because; I started reading the book with a very negative view of President Bush and finished the book with a higher opinion of him.The book gives a lot of information about the planning process, which was started by Cheney and Rumsfeld as soon as they took office, long before the 9/11 attacks. The book also presents the efforts of Powell to arrive at a diplomatic rather than military solution.This book may become a future \\"must read\\" for understanding the Second Iraq War."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"Woodward is back at his finest with facinating in-depth documentation of FACT FACT FACT, straight from the sources themeselves. For over 30 years this highly credible reporter has brought us the inside working of the white house however, clean BUSH AT WAR or dirty PLAN OF ATTACK (if you tend to see it so) it maybe. Woodward actually writes rather unbiased but it pretty much backs up the other current affairs books topping the chartsHOUSE OF BUSH HOUSE OF SAUD, AGAINST ALL ENEMIES, WORSE THEN WATERGATE, PRICE OF LOYALTY, on and on. I am thankful Woodward has come forth with this documentation - I really wish it was sooner. WHY DID HE TAKE SO LONG? This book is great. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK except for a serious editing flaw","review":"Plan of Attack adds many details about the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, although the emerging picture of the principals' role is in all essential points consistent with previously available information.Unfortunately, the work is seriously marred by the frequent and wholly gratuitous use of foul and offensive language. It is regrettable enough that national leaders, supposedly gentlemen, would revert to barracks speech when under great stress; but repetition in a work amenable to reflective editing lacks excuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S ON BUSH'S RECOMMENDED READING LIST!","review":"If Bush is recommending that everyone should read this book about himself I amagine he has a reason.I found it was a cover and an attempt to hide the fact that the invasion was planned in Texas long before W got to DC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plan of Attack, by Bob Woodward","review":"We returned this book because it was sent to us minus the first twenty or so pages. We did not read this book. This is not a critique of the book, just an observation on why I cannot, at this time, offer a review. I have just edited my review since a disgruntled reader took offense at what I had written...sorry...you can please some of the people all of the time, but only all of the people some of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Republicans Need Apply","review":"I haven't liked anything woodward wrote since he produced the major trojan horse of the 20th Century in \\"deep throat\\". I don't believe much of anything he says and doubt really sincerely, after reading what supposed members of the cabinet were purported to say, that he ever talked to them. Bobby seems to have forgotten 9/11 and the fact that the US has remained safe so far under Pres. Bush's watch. Not to say it won't happen, but Bush is doing his best. bobby's keen sorties into political naughtiness only seems to emerge when Republicans are in office. How very odd and the trojan horse stays empty. There is no more there, there, if he can ignore the clintoon years, the carter mess, he has no prowness as an investigative reporter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right or left this is an informative read","review":"Woodward shows the President in a mostly favorable light. After watching 60 mintues I expected this book to be more anti-Bush propaganda. But was suprised, Woodward depicts Bush as a serious leader, surrounded by the best of the best, making difficult decisions to protect our nation and fulfill his duty as President. Woodward also highlights Bush's interest in the accuracy of the intelligence provided him by his intelligence services. Much was was made on 60 Minutes of Bush's desire to improve the lives of people around the world. The book showed this as well. Isn't that great? Is there a problem with this? You can be certain that if a democrat President said the same thing, he would be kissed on the forehead by a beaming Mike Wallace. Apparently the complaint isn't that a President might say or believe in the betterment of our world, but rather that he would take action to make it happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unbiased Account","review":"Bob Woodward does an excellent job of examining the buildup to the latest war in Iraq, while leaving out his own opinions and judgement. If you supported the war, you will probably consider this to be an account of a strong leader enforcing his will and getting things done. If you are against the war, you will probably find strong evidence in the timeline to show a predetermined action sold to the American people, Congress, and the world largely through coercion, deception, and assumption.Either way, it is a useful look back and a detailed account of what it takes to go to war in today's society. I found it especially interesting to get an inside look at the interactions between the Departments of State and Defense, military, CIA and to learn of the differences of opinion by those involved in this endeavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, and maddening","review":"Brilliant, as one would expect from Woodward, and maddening to see how right Powell and Franks were, yet how easily they gave up the battle to reign in the zealots.

Furthermore, Woodward's Bush At War was relatively objective and the writing was very lucid. This book on the other hand is clearly Woodward's attempt to determine the outcome of the November election at the expense of a portion of his reputation of being an objective, respected, insightful writer/journalist. This book would have been more interesting had Woodward relayed the account without such strong liberal undertones.Not worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"An open canvas for NeoCon lies","review":"Just shows when you let Lying Repugnantcans tell their side of the story, you get a lot of posturing, a lot of lying, and greater obscurity of the facts.

Little did I know how lucky I was, because Woodward is an absolutely horrid writer. So horrid, in fact, that he made me forget what a ludicrious person George W. Bush is -- and that's not an easy trick, folks. So really what this hackwork boils down to is a piece of inadvertent Republican propaganda. Them conservative warmongers are clever little devils, ain't they?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Story Behind Iraq!","review":"This is an interesting coverage of the planning and thinkingbehind the decision to invade Iraq.Woodward tells about Secretaryof Defense and Vice-President Cheney being gung ho about going towar in Iraq.You are also told of Secretary of State Colin Powelland General Tommy Franks being hesitant about invading Iraq.Theauthor Woodward tells how intelligence provided by CIA directorGeorge Tenet pointed to the existance of Weapons of MassDrestruction.He also shows how this was used to justify invadingIraq.Woodward also tells how Bush was intent on toppling SadamHussein.This is excellent coverage of the arguments and planningthat led America to go to war in Iraq.A very interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It never arrived","review":"I still haven't received this book! I tried canceling it from the vendor because it was taking too long and my daughter no longer needed it for a school assignment but they told me it shipped already. That was over a week ago. Now I have to chase up this order."},{"rating":"2","title":"An clear unbiased report ...almost unbelievable!!!!","review":"This book falls into the 'must read' column. Well written with almost unlimited access to all the major players (with direct quotes!) this book lays out an objective and even handed account of the planning of the Iraqi war. I must admit that I was surprised that Woodward was given so much insider info from the Bush Adminstration and that so many of the normally secretive leaders (Rumsfield, Cheney in particular) were willing to openly say what roles they played. I am sure that both the Bush fans and foes will find plenty of ammo to feed their particular bends. But Woodward has written good current history here, the facts are laid out clearly and objectively, there is no attempt to slant the hot button 'events' (WMD, Powell, UN etc) one way or another. And it is fascinating to glimpse how crucial decisions are weighed and finally made in the Bush White House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Be In Everyone's House","review":"This book is non-partisan really, Woodward just records what he sees and then writes it down, this not really an opinion piece, he is just telling what he saw, Granted I am a liberal and sometimes it's great to realize that what this man is saying gives me hope. But I know that this man doesn't have an agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"reader, commenting on comments","review":"If this is all \\"Lies from the Left\\" as many reviewers are calling Woodward's book, then why does President Bush endorse the book on his re-election site? Very interesting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Insight","review":"This is one of Mr. Woodward's finest works. His access to the decision makers, their support personnel, and others involved in the job of supporting the President is stunning. It is very clear in reading this book that Mr. Woodward took the time to check and recheck his information.Regardless of what you think of the President, or the war for that matter, if you care about understanding how everyone involved in this historical event behaved, this is the book for you. It is as fair a job of reporting as I have seen in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Accurate - No Attibution","review":"This book places Woodwards credibility in the dumper with Richard Clarke's. The quotes are not attributed and therefore lure the typical intellectual lightweight into believing all that is written here. Unfortuanetly, this is just another partisan attempt to nitpick the fine details involved in the decision to remove Saddam from power after UN sanctions did not work. This book lacks important context such as:Years of violated sanctionsWe were attacked on 911Bush went to congress - passedBush went to the U.N. - passedSaddam has WMD - Ask a Kurd about theseSaddam was developing a nukeUnfortunately, Woodward focuses on simple details out of context, reducing him to another partisan policy weenie.

It was boring because I knew what was going to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe this is the best Pepper I have heard","review":"Art Pepper was introduced to me as an accident many years ago. I collect his music and have found no other to match is courage and charisma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Listen to the Others","review":"Don't listen to the others. They're just cranky. Combine inspiring music and awesome pictures of the plaets and what do you get? A great movie that surpasses the ratings of two fellow watchers. Hey, there were bad reviews for EVERY great movie, but sometimes, you just have to look for the good ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"out-of-date","review":"One should expect that an important achievement such as the journey of voyager I and II through the planets would bring unvaluable data and reveal exciting images from other planets. However it was rather disapointingly to watch a great scientific event through pale images in the age of digital video and poor data information in the turning of the century. If you wish to have an up-to-date news about our solar system and see astonishing images I would recomend \\"The Planets\\" produced by BBC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great DVD... if it was made by a 8th grader!","review":"The only thing that saved this DVD from a single star rating was the fact that you can turn off your video and listen to the music. This is by far the worst proffesional production I've ever seen.Here is the idea... take some pretty cool voyager pictures of planets... cut them out and place them on a make believe star field. THEN super-impose cheep 3D renderings of the voyager spacecraft. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!That's not to say you won't be entertained... you'll get a good laugh. The most spectacular thing about this DVD is the number of people in the credits. One guy in his basement would have made sense...Seriously though, it would have made an excelent 8th grade video project.Please please please... save your money and buy a DVD that took more than a week to make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Award Winning Documentary chronicles the Voyagers","review":"The Voyager Odyssey was named in the top ten documentaries ever made by Entertainment Weekly. It's not surprising, it defies every cliche of documentary programming. It's closer to Fantasia than the average television doc. A work of art that will endure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this unless you're looking for a screensaver","review":"Terrible as far as space docs go, even accounting for the 1990 creation date. No audio narrator, all info presented as horribly obnoxious overcapitalized roman font. Bad organization, inconsistent from planet to planet, corny unrealistic motions of the probe, and they gave asteroids a whooshing sound. AWFUL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was released on LD.It is a very poor compilation.It has no structure, the music does not fit at all, and the sloppy editing does nothing to enhance this film. There are very much better space compilations on this subject on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than real","review":"All I can say is that this album is amazing. I have been known to listen to nothing else except for it. It is the perfect music for any time, place, or situation. This is the kind of music that makes you want to crank it up, or curl up with the head phones. Everything about the music is a complete masterpiece, the lead singer has the most amazing voice and is equally as talented during his lead guitar rifs. Love It."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for (and I didn't even know it!)","review":"What a delightful discovery! This book served to effortlessly broaden my knowledge about applied mathematics. I have to recommend this book to all - and especially towards those, like myself, who are frustrated with our own mathematical ignorance... I am a bit of a compulsive book buyer and I don't always make an effort to read each book in my huge collection. I'm very happy I made the time to thoroughly read this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"Reviewers Reviewed\\" by E. H. Reynolds","review":"Having now read everything that Alexander H. Stephens had published, I found this book very readable. As Stephens was a \\"strict constructionist\\" of the the United States Constitution, his positions on this document I found most interesting. For anyone not having the time to read his 2 Volumes on the War Between the States, this book provides, in my opinion, an excellent summary, and, I believe, should be required reading for any serious student of the Law or Political Science.Sincerely,Ed Reynolds"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so bright","review":"i wish these would have been brighter then they were, you can hardly tell they are on and they are about equal to the stock lights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who hasn't been there???","review":"I usually dont buy or read poetry, but after searching for stories about tragic romances, I came across this book and thought I would give it a shot. It is so relatable. We have all been in the position of falling in love so hard that it consumes you and many of us have been treated badly. This book takes you through the trials of it all in a cool way. It makes me want to read more poetry like it. Maybe it has changed my views on poetry. Before this, the last time I read any was in high school!! Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Good book. Emotional, pretty images, deep feelings, romance, sex, it has everything. Start to finish it is one long story, so it reads like a novel more than a collection of poetry. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully dark sexy book!","review":"This is a beautiful, dark, sexy book that I loved. The imagery is great and I bet you'll like it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully rhythmic book","review":"My son loves to hear this book. The drum line undertone is very well orchestrated. A brilliant poem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEADING","review":"I ordered several of these board books thinking I was getting a great deal. SO disappointed when they came as TINY, ABRIDGED versions of the real stories. These should be labeled better! I shouldn't have to sort through 100 reviews to realized they're not what they appear to be. We bought 4, paying almost $20 plus shipping, but only got $9 back after paying return shipping costs. Biggest rip-off ever! If I had wanted books to put in my diaper bag- these would have been great. But as it is, I just feel swindled. Amazon- PLEASE clearly indicate that these are not the original Dr. Seuss books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Dum dum dum\\" is smart smart smart","review":"This board book is a nicely condensed version of the original. It would be ideal to retain all of the original material (for example, you don't learn Jack and Jake's names in the board book), but it would be too heavy to tote around! The original rhythm and rhyme is preserved, making this version a happy, durable introduction to a book that was one of my favorites a generation ago, and that entertains the current generation just as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still have a copy","review":"Hand, Hand, Fingers, Thumb is one of the great literary works of the twentieth century. Well, that might be an exaggeration, but at 30 years old I can still recite the whole book from memory. I don't have any kids, but this book is still on my book shelf. It has a good rhythm and hilarious illustrations that are sure keep the youngsters happy.And how many adults can say there isn't something comforting in having the verse \\"Dum ditty dum ditty dum dum dum\\" running through your head all day.\\"Hand in hand, more monkeys come...\\" Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 14 mo. old loves it!","review":"I first thought she was too young, but it's the first book along with \\"Oh, the Things You Can Think!\\" that she has sat still for me to read to her. I'm very excited that she seems interested in the Dr. Suess books. She's super active (physically) and its difficult for me to read to her sometimes. I think she enjoys the monkeys in this one along with the rhymes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hand Hand Fingers Thumb","review":"I have had the book \\"Hand Hand Fingers Thumb\\" since I was about two. I must have read it 500 times. It was a regular bedtime story for me. It is a very easy book to read. The words aren't very big and they are repeated so that the young kids can learn the words easier. The book has very good flow and great pictures. All of the pictures have monkeys in them and you know every kid loves monkeys. The rhymes are very good such as; \\"Hello Jack. Hello Jake. Shake Hands Shake Hands Shake! Shake! Shake!\\" There isn't much of a plot to this story but I think it is a very good story anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite passed on to the next generation...","review":"My son would NOT sit through a book at 15 mos. old. I decided to bring out my childhood favorite. It's new name is the \\"Monkey Book\\" and it is read several times a day, every day. He's 18 mos. old now and has it memorized. The book doesn't even have to be open and he knows the next line. He loves this book so much, that sometimes he just gives the monkeys kisses as he looks at the pictures, narrating when he feels compelled. Highly recommend this book to anyone having trouble getting their young ones to appreciate reading. My son now has a love of reading that I thought would never blossom 3 months ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"best toddler book ever !","review":"This book was a favorite of my children 25 years ago and is now the one my grandchild picks up first. The illustrations are great and the text meets many criteria established by reading researchers for phonemic awareness such as rhyming, repetition, and rhythmn. The board book format is especially good for small hands. Definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unusually Well-Written Rhythmic Easy Reader","review":"This is an unusually well-designed rhythmic book with a simple theme of monkeys using fingers and hands to produce rhythm on drums. It begins with one monkey, then quickly expands to a sea of monkeys, all drumming their drums. As the complexity of pictures increase, the mood and energy of the text picks up, with lots of vocable sound effects which augment the text with fun and humor.This is an easy reader, although the story appeals best to a preschool audience. It would be a good choice as reading practice for a child who has enjoyed the book before learning to read. It comes in paperback, hardback or an abridged board book version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book was a favorite with my children many years ago, so now as a grandmother, I was excited about the prospect of introducing it to my grandaughter. Like so many others, I was surprised and disappointed to see so many pages missing. Wondering if any of the used books available could possibly include the original? Now I'm on a search for the original!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Abridgement","review":"In case anyone is interested, here is the text that's missing from the six pages that were cut from the Bright & Early Board Book version:Monkeys comeAnd monkeys go.Hands with handkerchiefs.Blow! Blow! Blow!\\"Hello Jack.\\"\\"Hello Jake.\\"Shake handsShake handsShake! Shake! Shake!\\"Bye-bye Jake.\\"\\"Bye-bye Jack\\"Dum dittyDum dittyWhack! Whack! Whack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our 16 month old LOVES Al Perkins","review":"One of the first books our daughter would sit through from the time she was four or five months old was another Al Perkins classic, \\"The Nose Book\\". She's also loved \\"The Ear Book\\" since right around the same time. I'd never heard of \\"Hand, Hand, Fingers, Thumb\\" until we saw it in the waiting room where my car was being serviced. Sierra LOVED it! We must have read it twenty times, and it really helped to pass the time. When we got to the page that read \\"dum ditty, dum ditty, whack whack whack!\\" she giggled out loud and brought smiles to every face in the place. Santa will definitely be bringing this one along in his sack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Children's Book","review":"I can read it with my eyes closed. It was my boys favorite book when they were younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original version","review":"My son absolutely LOVES Hand, Hand, Fingers, Thumb. It was a book that my mom and I adored as children as well. I wanted to buy it for him and saw that this item was priced pretty low. However, it is an abridged version and my son was rather irritated the first time that I read it to him. He thought that I was \\"skipping pages\\" since he practically has this book memorized. I would have given this book five stars if it was the full version. It should be listed somewhere in the description that the bright and early books are not the full versions..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our favorites","review":"This is a fun, beginner book for baby/toddler. Our girls never tire of reading this book! It is my husband's favorite, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"My mother read this to me more times than either of us could count. My child loved it and my preschool classes still love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child, so I was happy to get this board book version for my little one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Family Favorite","review":"This was my grown daughter's favorite book when she was a toddler and now both my grandsons love it, too. I would recommend it for babies around 9 months to 2 years. The hardcover version is longer and I like the missing pages, but you can't beat board books for durability for little ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite in this house","review":"Both my babies love to have this book read to them. I've found both boys trying to read it to themselves (even upside down).The illustrations are great and so retro. The rhyme is easy for kids to remember so it's fun to pause and let them say the word.The storyline's interesting enough. I love the dum ditty dum ditty dum dum dum. The whole rhyme, the whole story, has a beat to it; a rhythm to it. It's a good book. It's a great way to get your kids to love reading, love the sound of the language, and love the rhythm of the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"good condition","review":"Received in good condition and timely, but I didn't look closely enough, I was wanting hard cover and this is a board book. Still love the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"This is one of my favorite books from my childhood, and I was thrilled when they started making a board book version! I bought this for my 4-month-old daughter, and she loves it! The pictures are bright and colorful, and the verses are very rhythmic. You can almost hear drums when you read it (I know that sounds weird). My daughter coos at this book the whole way through, and loves holding and turning the pages herself. Excellent vintage, Suess-like book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"I am only reviewing because of the three star review. This is a 5 star performance video in my opinion. Great performances and music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugar Twins","review":"I buy the Sugar Twins for my mother and she does not drink any hot or cold beverage without this product. She cannot find it in retail grocerie and resorts to Amazon. She could not be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are wrong","review":"I dont know how the other 3 reviewers treat thier computer accessories, but I have never had an issue with my drive. I have used my external every day for 2 years now and it has never once given me any trouble. It gets carried back and forth from college to home, it gets plugged into multiple computers, and its been hit by surges before, and it still has not died. If this one did die for whatever reason, I'd buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead from the start","review":"I agree with the other reviewers, this drive does not work at all. I returned my drive the day after I bought it -- it simply didn't work.I bought it to back up some MP3s and photos, but although my computer \\"recognized\\" it immediately, I could not write to the drive at all. The operating system showed that the files were writing to the drive, but they were actually writing to a temp file on my C: drive.After several attempts, I just gave up and returned it. Considering the other problems people are having with reliability, I just could not consider giving it another chance. This isn't a great product and I recommend that you wait for better USB drives before getting into this category.I just plan to wait for something better, although the IDEA of a USB drive, where data will be easily transferrable to another computer and ease the current congestion on my current drive is a great one. This product just didn't work at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for catastrophic data loss","review":"This drive worked beutifully in the first 10 months in on of our school research laboratories, regardless of the infrequent unexplained miscommunication with the PC. After they trusted it for work and research data backup, done just once every 2 weeks, it suddenly gave clicking sounds and stopped working. After extended agony with the customer support, they simply got nothing. Surperisingly, when they talked about this subject with some of our collegues in our University, they discovered that many of us, in defferent departments, suffered from the same problem with different models of the Wistern Digital external hard drives (USB/Firewire).After all the frustration and the torture with this piece of junk, I can say for sure, Buy WD if you are looking for the best machine to lose your data? Beleive me when I say Western Digital Hard Drives are absolutely the worst for your data storage. We've been there before."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fundamental issue in your beloved collection!","review":"This admirable effort made for Music and Arts has been one of the longers expectations of all of us who pitifully still were not born or simply we could not to have the fortune to be here.Fortunately, this edition contain pieces of unthinkable artistic value. All what I can tell you it won't be enough to the simple and delight pleasure and joy of living produced when you be the owner of these historical treasures.Acquire this album and the Vol 2 too and you will be always rewarded ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is mean spirited and bad for kids","review":"I agree with the review that talks about how bad this book is for kids. The boys fight over which balloon is best, they say they \\"hate\\" a girl who gets in the middle, they kill their balloons until they are \\"dead.\\" It's really inappropriate for the young audience it's aimed at. My husband read the book to my daughters first and couldn't believe I had bought it. I took a look and threw it away. That's what you do with (garbage). Trust me, don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously horrible","review":"Quite possibly the worst children's book I have ever seen (and there are some bad ones out there). The message is horrible, and the characters are rude. I have to disagree with reviewers who say this is how kids behave. Not only do my children not act this way, if they did, I would reprimand them - not encourage them by having them read this book! The only book I have ever thrown in the trash because I felt it was too awful even to donate. Read the reviews and ask yourself how a simple, short phonics book could possibly be controversial unless it was truly cringe-worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book's not sick, just the reader's mind","review":"Both of my children read this book when they were younger. They are now grown with children of their own. The reviewer who wrote the review must have a perverted and narrow mind. After I read the book after several years time, I cannot see what the reviewer say was bad. It's natural for children to say that their property is the best and for boy's to tease girls. That's life, get on with it and stop looking for hidden agendas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird book...","review":"I am one of those parents that didn't appreciate this book at all. When I read it first (with my daughter), I was really surprised with the content. Some teachers on this review forum say that that's how the kids actually behave. Well maybe that's how some of them do behave, but I have not seen my daughter or her friends behave like that. In-fact my 3 yr old showed no interest in this book. I have never done this before, but I think I will have to dispose of this book :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters are not the best examples for your children","review":"My daughter is a beginning reader. After completing \\"Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons,\\" she was able to jump right in and read all but 2-3 of the words in this book. HOWEVER, the two boys in the story are mean spirited. Also, my daughter was frequently confused by the illustrations and had trouble making sense of the pictures in terms of the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doll house for Christmas","review":"First of all, I have to say that I ordered this late for Christmas and it was predicted I would receive it on Jan 4th. Instead the product was here in 4 days a week before Christmas, with normal shipping. I was really excited to get it.We decided to put it together Christmas Eve for the big Christmas reveal. Big mistake! 2 1/2 hours later with frustration and sweat, it was finally together. I'm not sure if it was due to lack of sleep or bad instructions but it was not going together easily.Christmas morning, my daughter was in love! She was so excited. It is a great house and is definitely gigantic (hope you have a big spot to put it). I'm glad I got this house versus one made out of plastic, I just wish it had come with furniture."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Barbie lives in the projects this is the house for you!","review":"If you are looking for a doll house that says \\"Daddy loves ya and since you've been such a good girl, here is a gift\\" then this probably isnt the house for you. I admit I paniced when I could not find the Barbie doll house she had mentioned and it was getting close to Christmas so I bought this one.It is flimsy. The manufacturer put the part label stickers directy on the design overlay. If you are not careful you will tear up the design. The only parts that are wooden are the outline frame, everything else is thick cardboard with a printed sheet to depict different rooms, etc. glued over it.It will work for now, but Im not pleased with it all around. It will however make a great template to build one myself with all wood construction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart upon assembly","review":"The house was not difficult to assemble, however it came unglued. There are only screws and dowels to use to assemble the product but the pre-glued areas came undone and the whole thing fell apart. It is a nice house, I would just be prepared to re-glue everything and wait for it to dry, then assemble."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful","review":"I agree with the other reviewer who gave this a single star--chaotic is the best way to describe the workouts here. The instructor spends a lot of time talking in between exercises, but what she has to say provides no help with the execution of the exercises. It also interrupts the flow of the workout in a very irritating way. The one time I did the workouts, all I kept thinking was, \\"get on with it, woman!!\\" The faces of the other people in the video seem to say it all -- they don't look to be enjoying themselves in the least.I would consider myself to be an advanced pilates practitioner, but I don't think this has anything to do with my judgment of this dvd: I fear it would turn off any beginner from pilates!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather be big than doing this chaotic routine","review":"(disclaimer: I am NOT big, I am actually quite trim but I'd like to keep it that way and therefore I use home workout tapes in between gym sessions.)After you get through a solid 12 minutes of spam, clips, and advertising, you are finally presented with a sloppily thrown together, uncoordinated poor excuse for Pilates. Beginners (which I am not) would be lost altogether as the instructor doesn't demonstrate her steps. The mat work is marginally better but not enough for me to ever touch it again. Therefore, this tape and the other ones I also bought from this series in the same purchase, are going in the \\"Goodwill\\" bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dinnerware...","review":"I really like the dinnerware, it's solid and tough feeling, but very cute. The only drawback is that I haven't been able to find any additional pieces, i.e. cream and sugar, butter tray, serving pieces, etc.For an everyday dinnerware, it's wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"I ordered this book as soon as I came across it. Was not disappointed. Filled in the blanks and gave a good look at what these heroic men went through after the war. These days it isdifficult to find such men in leadership roles. It's the bad oneswe hear about. Major Winters is in the Top 5 list of men I admire.And only wish to meet someone of his caliber in my life.Tom Becker"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding read","review":"For those of us who enjoyed the Band of Brothers, this book is an excellent follow up. It tells of Major Winters from when he was young to present day. You get to hear from him how things happened on D-Day. I also enjoyed reading the parts that the series got wrong. He is a hero and this book shows why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biggest Brother","review":"This book is a fine complement to the book and HBO series entitled BAND OF BROTHERS. It presents a full background on the man who initially led Easy Company into combat at Normandy and follows him throughout his time with the division as well as his postwar years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still reading...","review":"I have a vast collection of Band of Brothers books on my kindle. I have yet to get to this one, but all are great so far so 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing book","review":"I am a huge fan of Band of Brothers, both the book and the mini-series; so naturally I bought this biography of the larger than life hero Dick Winters. Overall it's a very good book, however there are some clunky transitions. I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in World War II, or enjoyed Band of Brothers. Certain stories, and keeping people straight can be confusing if you haven't seen/read Band of Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biggest Brother, the biography of Major Dick Winters","review":"This has to be the best book I've read. Everyone should read this even if they haven't seen the miniseries or read Stephen Ambrose's book. This book was certainly one of those that you'd find hard to put down. Even though this is Larry Alexander's first book to the best of my knowledge, he has undertaken a fine job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biggest Brother","review":"One of the best books I've read on the second world war showing the daily life of the line soldier. Highly recommend, especially if you enjoyed the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing More than Regurgitation and Plagarism","review":"I have 3 major complaints about this book: 1. The author has abused his accidental access to Major Winters and often brags about his friendship and access to the Major and thus, particularly in the opening, attempts to make the book about him (the author) rather than about Major Winters. 2. This book is mainly regurgitation of material already in print. There is no or very little original research. Not only is it regurgitation, there are many lines that were blatantly plagarized from other sources, verbatim or nearly verbatim, and the author did not properly quote those other sources. 3. It is completely unforgivable for the author to completely skip over D-Day. It makes the work unacceptable and not credible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigggest Brother","review":"Too many innacurate facts. I recommend \\"Beyond Band of Brothers\\" by the man himself, Dick Winters. I don't think he totally approved of \\"Biggest Brother\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Absolute Band of Brothers Fans","review":"Overall I am disappointed by the biography of this great man. It doesn't really do him justice. If you have read Stephen Ambrose's book on the experiences of Easy Company of the 506th then this book adds very little more. Therefore only buy it if you want to complete your collection but it is in no way as rich as Websters or Donald Burgetts offerings.There are disappointingly few additional anecdotes to compel the reader. The only ones being that the rumours about Cpt. Spiers were all true and on the night of D-day Guarenere didn't prematurely start the ambush on the German patrol as the TV mini-series shows but did minutes later shoot 3 German PoW's they had just taken.You do get some brief insight into the man by the quotes to his letters home. Unfortunately it tells you little about him which you didn't already know. Personally I wish I hadn't bothered to buy it given what is in my collection already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read for Band of Brothers junkies.","review":"This was a very interesting book for me. As someone who has read \\"Band of Brothers\\" and seen the TV program, I was very interested to learn more about Major Winters--his life before the war, what he was thinking during the war, and what he did after the war. I also wanted to learn more about what his friend Nixon did after the war. This book answered all my questions and made me admire Major Winters even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read about a great man","review":"It's refreshing to read about someone with principles in a leadership position. The book was well written, uses sources that weren't available in the Band of Brothers (112 letters) and paints a picture of what Major Winter's and Easy Company went through. It also talks about after the war and the process of writing and later producing the Band of Brothers. If you liked BofB, you will like this...great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Biggest Brother","review":"A well written straight from the heart account.

Blake is a fine singer, showing his smooth side on tracks like \\"Stand By Me\\", \\"This Time Around\\" and \\"Great Pretender\\" while getting funky on \\"I Got to Find Me a Black Cat Bone\\".

So, I looked up Mehdi in Amazon and was pleased to see so many positive reviews. I was lucky enough to see this CD at my local library and decided to check it out before purchasing - am I glad I did. I'm not sure what all the hype is because this CD is really no more than elevator-poppish-mood music (Ugh - clap-track??!! C'mon).Check out Pacific Moon's performers such as Jia Peng Fang, Jalan Jalan or Mizuyo Komiya and you'll find top-rate quality compositions that will soothe or uplift your spirit.Sorry Mehdi but this CD is glorified elevator music at best, which is dissappointing because I did enjoy Ekova.

Intrigue, double-dealing, strong characters, high finance, environmental devestation, head-hunting; what more could you ask for?As always, Collison renders an authoritative and sympathetic vision of the Indonesian people, while taking Indonesia's rulers to task for their greed, corruption, and amorality. This is where his long experience in the country pays off because he knows Indonesia and its people as well as any author, and he is the only person to write about this multi-ethnic collage from the standpoint of direct knowledge.Every one of Collison's books is a gripping read; this is simply his best to date.

A weight loss of twenty pounds in a month as seen on the Ananda Show was supported by the author. I find this appalling especially since most of that weight was most likely fluid and muscle loss. Also, most women know from their own dieting horror stories that fast weight loss is usually quickly gained back and then some. Losing any more than 2 pounds a week would send most women's bodies into fat storage mode which is exactly what you are trying to prevent.

Having been to Italy before I can tell you that her descriptions of Italy and the surrounding villages are what you might expect to find in a small Italian village. The idea that a young American woman is sent to Italy for summer vacation to get to know her Italian family, and in the process falls in love with a young Italian man is riviting. Their story of love, finding a path to follow, and whether the young woman will return to America at the end of the summer keeps you reading. The setting, and character development is wonderful. The whole idea of foreign romance and the lazy feel to the book as if you were their with them is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monardo's Novel Filled with Cliches","review":"Although it is hardly worth taking the time to mention, I feel I must take a few minutes to relate my complete and utter disappointment with this novel. Not only is the entire concept of the book cliche, overused, et cetera, but the character development is weak and the plot is predictable.

Is this junk considered Prog Rock? Mostly lemons from \\"Signals\\" and beyond, its only value is to notify you that Rush lost its mojo at some point and not all the original albums are worth collecting.All in all, ideal for the Rush novice and a great prospectus for those considering which original albums to purchase.

You've got all the hits from the radio plus some lesser known titles, so it's a good introduction to Rush if you're not willing to ante up for one of the albums. Still, everyone else who loves Rush seems to say the same thing: You gotta get the albums and hear the songs from beginning to end.I was worried the sound quality might be bad because hits albums of older artists are often remastered and ruined but this one doesn't seem to tread too heavily. I doubt it's as well done as their original albums but I'll take what I can get for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush through 1987","review":"Great compilation with most of their best songs from 1974 to 1987's Hold Your Fire. But this in no way is all the best of Rush since half of their 10 best albums were made after 1987. Counterparts from '93 is the second best album Rush ever made with 6 great songs on it. Their two latest releases, Snakes and Arrows and Vapor Trails are both great. 1991's Roll The Bones and 1996's Test For Echo are also among their very best albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He was/is a Rush fan and he said this CD is definitely \\"Awesome\\"!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars: Only because its Rush","review":"Nothing new here, just another egregious and shameless attempt from Mercury to get more money from old fans and hopefully win a few new ones as well. I give it 5 stars because every song on the compilation is golden and smacks with the integrity the trio have constantly placed into their music. With the business being the way it is, I doubt if we will ever see a true retrospective collection of Rush's music. Mercury and Atlantic will forever be at odds in this department, unless of course one monster decides to buy out the other monster...If you're new to Rush, then obviously this is a great place to start, but please don't stop here, the deeper cuts on their albums warrant as much serious listening to as do any of their \\"popular\\" songs.From a radio interview back in the 80's: (paraphrasing) \\"Okay, Geddy, let's wrap up this interview and end the show with a hit\\"Geddy: \\"A hit?

Also, all the verb formats for each verb are on the same page. There were also errors in the very beginning of the book which make me hesitant to trust the rest of the book. I think the book 501 Spanish Verbs by Christopher and Theodore Kendris is much more helpful. Do not waste your money on this book invest in 501 Spanish Verb and buy actual flash cards if you want them.

The 48 different palms were photographed incompletely and it was difficult even to spot the royal palm by its light, magnificent trunk.

As an illustrated guide, it fails miserably. The pictures are small, blurry, sometimes over-exposed and most are not representative of the subject. Worse is the fact that most plants are not even illustrated! You are left wondering what a plant really looks like. I have had to research most of the plants mentioned via internet or leafing through other books.Another fault is the hardiness zones of some plants are incorrect. The authors need to redo this information. My particular pet peeve is the mention of plant pathogens-- they give a list of plant ailments, but do not tell you how to prevent, or treat it.I gave it only two stars because of all these faults.

These 2 kinds of work need different skill set. That's why separation of Data and Presention is very important to JSP web site design.The author of this book carefully avoided to include much JSP code in HTML pages, but his design leads to another extreme: almost every control (forms, buttons, links) are generated by JSP code.

The book's topics are perfect - now someone needs to go through it with a pitchfork to weed out all the errors.

In fact, the author had the audacity to change the downloadable source code after the book was published. Therefore, you can't even get the code source for the examples in the book, and the new code comes with no instructions! In addition, the author does a poor job of explaining the concepts he is trying to teach. M&T Books should be ashamed for publishing this poorly edited text.

This book is written in the attempt to bring scientists and EE closer to the truth on what is missing in physics to unify the three fields: QM,GR,EM (what Einstein was trying to do but failed to achieve Bearden explains why). I would recommend this to everyone but only those who are truly interested in physics, Tesla, Einstein, & perhaps technology would find this work to be of much helpful knowledge. For myself personally, Bearden has showed me the path that no one has done before. For myself coming from a Tesla background Bearden goes a step further and describes how physics was side tracked and how to get back on the right track through the many many references that is cited, all coming from a man that devoted his life for science.

With their book Beyond the Birds and the Bees: Raising Sexually Whole and Holy Kids, the Popcaks have given our families a true gift in the form of counsel and wisdom on how to faithfully address some of the most important issues of our time.

There are actually relatively few figures in this book, but when encountered, they are often interesting.

It is excellent for those more interested in building a physique for athletics than bodybuilding (a real rarity in the weightlifting book field). Bryzcki cuts through much of the hype and myth associated around weight-lifting and points out many of the differences between an athletic and a bodybuilding program. He teaches you how to build more overall muscle using only two to three one hour sessions a week and get equal or better results than those spending 4x that amount of time in the gym.

One wishes his discourse wasn't quite as rambling as it sometimes is, which leads to some repetitiveness. Well illustrated but with amateur level photography. He interestingly breaks the exercises down by equipment used but I found the manual resistance section to perhaps be useful in a campus course but of little to no value to an individual weight trainer. A better use of book space would have been to cover more machines, including from Cybex, which isn't even mentioned, and other manufacturers.

The map is to put it simply, GORGEOUS!!! Run out and get it laminated you'll thank me. All the lands, and territories are explained in reasonable detail, and some other exotic lands are touched upon, Kara-Tur anyone? Yes the book is a little pricey, but the information provided is in my opinion invaluable!! The only thing missing is sadly the Saurials didn't make it to the final draft. Well, maybe for 4e!!

On top of that it breaks down the population by race, so if you want to play a dwarf or elf you know which land he would more than likely call home. If that weren't enough it also has a map listing the major commodity trade routes all across the Realms (useless but cool). The only thing the book doesn't seem to list is what Elminster's cat likes to eat. More important to actual gameplay, though, are the new prestige clases and spells.

The modifications for the general races are one twist to making new characters for players. New magics and specializations for classes give characters a little bit more of a reason to try new things. Plus, any free maps are very cool.My only dislike (although quite necessary to game in Faerun) is the background on the world (literally takes up 2/3 of the book).If you want to game in this world, this is the book you'll definitely want.

The Philharmonia are their usual brilliant self - and Horenstein's brilliance at the podium is in complete contrast to the stumbling, gaunt Klemperer recording made only 2 years before.For Mahlerians, this CD along with the ultimate Das Lied recorded by Horenstein a few years later are essential items in the collection.The sound is decent, but the performance is unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic performance","review":"Horenstein's August 29, 1969 Prom performance of Mahler's seventh symphony is one of the classic performances of this enigmatic work, and needs no further argument for Mahlerites.It has appeared on disc several times.

Worn it swimming many times, in the the shower, smashed it on all sorts of trash and plastic barrels, got into a biking accident with it...and all there is to show for that are some light scratches on the face. I'm no watch expert; I'm a student. I just wanted something that was affordable, and would run while still fitting my usual earth-tone \\"style\\". This fits the bill. My friend who sells watches is actually jealous!

I mostly use my cell phone as a time keeper so keeping up with batteries was driving me crazy. This is a simple, easy to read watch that is fine for business or casual wear and the band has so many holes that even my small wrist was a perfect fit on the very last hole. It runs fine, is easy to read and does exactly what i wanted it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"really nice","review":"hubby wanted a wind up watch, so i bought him this one. he really loves it. band is pretty nice and comfy. keeps great time. read a few other reviews and they said it ran fast. ours is right on the money. he really really likes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knights of Christ","review":"This is a good book from Osprey done in 1984.

I purchased this per recommendation of a friend and now I know why she was insisting that I check it out. His version of God rest ye merry gentlemen is powerful yet lot's of fun. We three kings is jazzy and very kool and what child is this will give you images of the perfect Christmas.

I get alot of requests for this every time I play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Treasures~~ Mehdi","review":"I am very disappointed with this CD. To me, it sounds as though someone playing with a keyboard went through and picked out the background music which is very repetative, then added the actual Christmas songs. Very Disappointing!!! If you want something really good, stick with TSO or Gary Hoey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up...","review":"You may have alot of Christmas albums , but I know that very few are as fun as this one.

I was thinking \\"Yanni..., maybe even Manheim Steamroller\\", WRONG!!!If disco is your thing, maybe, go for it. The best word I can come up with to describe this is... CHEESY. It sounds like the forty dollar keyboard my mother bought for my kids. It has a \\"play along with\\" button that supplies accompaniment with known songs including Christmas. Perhaps Mehdi should not have used the freeware accompaniment software that came with the midi soundcard interface. Yes, it is that bad. This disk is destined for the bin where I keep all the AOL disks that I use for target practice. The only other possible use I can think of is to send it to the Pentagon to send to Iraq. They could play it over loud speaker while surrounding Fallujah (SP?). The terrorists should come running out screaming in short order. Please, give our troops plenty of hearing protection. Perhaps someone could possibly like these recordings. The only thing they envoked in me was nausea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Pop","review":"I am a listener who generally eschews the popular genre, I was taken in by the fawning reviews that I read about this CD. I knew when I heard the first synthesized \\"thump\\" that I had made a mistake. It is totally lacking in spontaneity and virtuosity. I don't mean to be too hard on what I know most people like but to me this is commercial, populist, mall music. I prefer my \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" by Dave Brubeck and my \\"Christmas Song\\" by Dexter Gordon. This will teach me to listen to samples before I buy in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Unique !","review":"This musical compilation, in my opinion, is truly a masterpiece. Forget about boring Christmas music, you won't find it here. I actually purchased it brand new by clicking the link above \\"New/Used\\" from a seller on Amazon Marketplace. I had it within a couple of days and for much less. highly recommend both Treasures 1 & 2 !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"With all the amazing Christmas music available out there, don't waste time and money on this garbage. It's musically empty and devoid of emotion, the result of a machine-like synthesizer.The description may mention instruments like piano and flute, but I guarantee they do not mean an actual flute or piano were used.I chuckled at the reviewer who mentioned how much her one-year-old enjoyed this cd. That about sums it up, I think. I'm a little concerned at the number of reviewers who are not only willing to listen to this and enjoy it but to go out of their way to write a positive review.Treat yourself to Christmas music with some more emotional and musical depth... have you heard Jim Brickman's holiday cd's? Mannheim Steamroller? Lorie Line?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a great Christmas album !","review":"This Christmas album has everything you could want from the classic songs like Hark The Herald Angels, Or We 3 Kings. My favourite being Deck The Halls.I bought this album when it first came out as I didn't have any Christmas albums with popular hits on it and I love it. Definitely an album to be played every Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bestor is better.","review":"My expectations for this CD were unrealistically elevated by the reviews on Amazon. The choice of songs was unimaginative, and the percussion was so repetetive, I felt like I could have done it on my electric piano by pushing a single button. Some of the harmonies also gave me the electric piano feeling.We Utahn's are spoiled to have the opportunity of attending a Kurt Bestor concert every year. Try his Christmas Vol. 1 CD and listen to his extraordinary, emotive piano and intrumentals. His CD's are less expensive and better than Mehdi, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"No musicians were consumed in the production of this product","review":"This is electronically synthesized, disco pop trash. Fits right in with the pop-culture christmas of today I suppose. Don't purchase without listening to the samples."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Favourite","review":"I originally came across this title on Amazon and heard it in the shopping mall in 2002. It had all the shoppers humming. I have played it every christmas since. It contains some of our favourite chritmas songs with a bit of a swing to make them sound that little bit different. Everyone who hears this music enjoys it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep those kids off the keyboard!","review":"This cheap, cheerful little CD is disappointing only if you expect, say, inventiveness or variety in your Christmas music. Use it at a holiday party, when it can add sparkle without anybody actually listening to it. Anybody who does will find it sounds concocted by 11-year-olds with music software. Grown-ups will likely find it as gaudy, and as deep, as wrapping paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD, BUT AS GOOD AS DAVID ARKENSTONE...........","review":"I BOUGHT THIS CD THINKING IT WAS MAYBE AS GOOD AS SOME OF DAVIDARKENSTONES' MUSIC BUT WAS DISPOINTED. THAT IS NOT TO SAY THISIS NOT A GOOD CD. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO THE FOLKS INTERESTED IN SOME GREAT \\"NEW AGE\\" CHRISTMAS MUSIC TO BUY DAVID'S \\"ENCHANTMENT\\"OR MEDWYN GOODALL'S \\"SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS\\". NOW THERE IS SOMESURE ENOUGH GOOOOOD MUSIC. THIS CHRISTMAS MUSIC REMINDS ME ALOTOF THE \\"HOOKED ON\\" MUSIC OF THE PAST. YOU KNOW HOOKED ON BACH,AND HOOKED ON CLASSICS. IT IS STILL WORTH HAVING BUT DON'TEXPECT ANYTHING GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chritmas on caffeine","review":"After I read the glowing review by a self-proclaimed national music programmer, I was anxious to hear the instrumental genius known as Mehdi. What a disappointment. Instead of fresh new takes on yuletide classics I got Christmas on caffeine. The persistent background beat on display in even the most traditional and sedate carol rendered them unrecognizable and frankly annoying beyond all reason. I highly recommend this album if you wish to be even more stressed out than you were from your last minute Christmas shopping. Drink up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKY CHRISTMAS","review":"I BOUGHT THIS CD ON RECOMENDATION BY AMAZON. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I EVER BOUGHT IN THE PAST THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT I HAVE NO TASTE IN MUSIC, BUT THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ENJOY THIS. I LOVE CHRISTMAS MUSIC FROM ROCK TO CLASSICAL; THIS FALLS INTO NOTHING MUSICAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas in July!","review":"I will actually listen to this album any time of the year. This is one of the koolest CDs , there is no doubt in my mind. However, it doesn't seem like he is well known like some of the others. His playing is just so fluid, and so unexpected. The reason I say this is because his music takes such nice, tasteful turns. Who else could pull off \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman\\" the way he did?I would say that anyone who likesChristmas music, or someone with a sense of Christmas Spirit would like this album. Funny thing is, this album reminds me of a banana in that it has a few soft spots in it that I'm fond of, namely the fact that it's upbeat. But just as people's taste in food varies, so does their taste in music. So while I think that the So, if you want a Christmas album you can listen to year-round because it is full of great arrangements , get this one right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alpine garden lights problem","review":"There was a wire that had not been connected and therefore the lights would not work.

In the first book, you are constantly on edge about whether the guy you're following is actually Jason Bourne, and whether or not he is a world-famous assassin or a fall-guy. The writing keeps you interested and keeps you turning pages deep into the night. In book #2, he's back, and struggling for his life again - even more fascinating reading, which is tough for a sequel. Book #3 I have yet to read - hence why I bought it! This is the kind of book that creates sleepless nights, staying up reading because you just can't put the darn thing down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought I was buying all three books as listed in the description. Only one of the books was actually shipped to me: The Bourne Identity. What happened to the other two books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy Vay","review":"Interesting for the insights into Jewish society and history, but I found the extended dialogues between and among the investigators and the witnesses tedious, the dialogue between Michael and his love interest just bizarre. At times I had difficulty following the discussion and the actions of the speakers-perhaps a translation difficulty, but nontheless distracting from the flow of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad book on magic indeed","review":"In my whole life, (quite long), I have bought a lot of books. I have also bought a lot of magic books. I have never returned a book to a store and asked for my money back - until I bought this one. Not only is it a bad book, but it is actually distasteful. It is very reminiscent of his performance which I saw on a TV talk show - his only object seems to be to denigrate magicians, which he did by performing magic very badly. Even Valentino was more entertaining than this man and his book. Avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Myths: Excellent Sourcebook","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I've seen come out of Dallas Texas since the Sangrael Foundation published Dr. Regardie's works. \\"Three Myths\\" is not only interesting but also informative and would make an excellent sourcebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything in a Nutshell!","review":"I have several books on floral arts and this tiny book is the most concise.

I mean, being a horror aficionado, I had seen most of the movies represented in this book, but if I hadn't seen them, I would have been considerably upset at having the endings to such classics as \\"Psycho\\" ruined. Additionally, I find that the book is occasionally awkwardly written. It's quite accessible though, even for casual fans of horror and the list of movies and people/characters critical to the genre is comprehensive.2.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to the Horror Genre","review":"I have been a die-hard Horror Fan since I was a kid, so when I bought this book I was very surprised to see aspects of the genre not readily covered by most horror books. It speaks of the 19th century influences on the genre, and also doesn't dwell on only the slasher flicks of the 60's onward, and the author writes everything in a very easy manner, nothing too difficult to understand.

It perpetuates the solipsistic world that is current art history, and continues the tradition of art historians cranking out yet another perfunctory publication in the interest of self-promotion and tenure requirements. Anyone without an already knowledgeable grasp of of the workings of the art history field (a field no longer strewn with thorns but with snakes instead) will find this book impractically arcane.

In this book each story is clearly meticulously researched and presented in far more detail. This creates a far more satisfying read.

I truly enjoyed the pointless plot, the unbelievable characters and circular arguments between Callie and Wade. \\"It's my child....no it's mine...no mine....you'll never get him...\\" This arguing becomes even more obnoxious when you consider the child was a bratt that \\"screamed the roof off.\\" The only slightly compelling character was Lilly, and she died before the book actually started. There is very little romantic about a convict who impregnates a woman in prison and then proceeds to take another hostage upon his release. This book is a wonderful examination of how not to write (there is a typo on the first page and several other incongruities throughout.) It could be viewed as amusing if it wasn't such an insult to my intellegence. In short...buy your own copy, because the margin comments you can scribble into this book are much more amusing than the actual writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Drivel","review":"Callie's Convict, while not a complete insult to my intelligence, was quite possibly the most irksome reading experience of my lifetime.

I anticipated the problem when I put in a DVD in my living room, before I even tried it in the car.Note: Unit doesn't come with a 120V adapter, but does have a stand for putting it on a table.

You shake it and you can hear all the parts rattling around inside. It was a disaster from day one. You could never hear it and the picture quality was always poor.

This is an energetic 21 piece band that sweats enthusiasm, led by the percussionist Carlos Kanno. Seven of the nine tracks are cover versions by composers of the highest standard. The first track was written by Mario Bauza, so Kanno obviously has good taste. This is an CD of well played grooves which reminds the listener of bits and pieces of latin jazz history.

We're not seeing a mass exodus or extermination of Arabs. I can only wonder why Hoffman did not choose to bemoan the fate of the Germans in World War 2: surely the huge number of German deaths would to him have been proof of a Jewish genocide of the Nazis, rather than the contrary.When Jewish populations in the Levant began to increase in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries due to the success of modern Zionism, Arabs tended to move to regions of high Jewish population. And Arab populations have tended to increase in those areas since then. This is at odds with a hypothesis that Arabs are being strongly oppressed there! Truly oppressed people would try to avoid that region or even flee it.In summary, this book has little to do with logic or facts. It seems that the author had a different agenda in mind, namely a malicious attack on the Jews of Israel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neo-Nazi/Revisionist Material","review":"At all costs - avoid this book.

Each generation of Jew-killers has a cheering section of those who congratulate themselves that they don't actually do the killing - they merely invent reasons for others to keep it going.

Along the way I learned a great deal, but most importantly was not that I couldn't use the pastels, it was the pastels I was using were not very good, hence my frustration with them.

What comes out in the wash, is a lazy, self consumed, pot bellied, balding, alcoholic shaman, mooching off his rich friends, continually making a spectacle of himself. Minus the drugs, and mooching off friends, we have a 1st century Jim Morrison.There is ample proof that Jesus' family supported his ministry, however not the case in this author's opinion. And I find the author's interpretation of scripture, and or events do not always follow that of widely accepted scholarly opinion, such as the above mentioned family support. To each his own interpretation, freedom is given, but the picture of the Jesus this author represents, himself a priest, I am glad he does not represent me.\\"The Historical Jesus of the Gospels\\" by Craig Keemer, is the book I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Culturally Correct Jesus","review":"Bruce Chilton has offered a plausible analysis of the gospel events in their appropriate Jewish setting, answering age-old questions about the \\"missing years\\", and helping readers to understand what Jesus might have said, and might have meant by what he said, in the context of first-century Jewish culture and religion. The author uses his vast knowledge of Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke, and the Targums, the oral Hebrew Biblical tradition known to Jesus, as aids in his analysis. Woven throughout this narrative of Jesus' life are clues to what the parables meant to Jesus, what his deep spirituality and his relationship with God were like, and what he really meant when he said \\"this wine is my blood and this bread is my flesh\\". A must-read for thoughtful Christians!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Plausible Narrative","review":"If you've ever wanted the straight poop about Jesus, this is probably as close as you'll ever be able to come. Before reading this book, you'll find it helpful to familiarize yourself with Ezekiel's Chariot Vision (Merkabah) and Zechariah's visions because, according to the author, these visions were at the core of Jesus' beliefs and motives.It seemed to me that the closing chapter was a rather flimsy attempt at apologetics. Otherwise I found the book immensely intriguing and informative.Gene L Warner, author of ...Solutions for Secretaries of Small NPO'sThe Manitou Passage Story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"It's reasonably clear that Chilton wrote this as popular historical fiction, rather than as a work of scholarship. As a Christian, I find it engrossing. What DID Jesus do in the years prior to the bulk of the Gospel narratives? Was he indeed a disciple of John's? Was Jesus's theology one of purity and the so-called \\"chariot?\\" While I don't buy into a lot of Chilton's theories (all presented in a pausible narrative format) the gritty humanity of Jesus is far more appealing (to me) than the transfigurated figure so often portrayed from medieaval times to the modern era. If that appeals, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing the flavor of Christianity","review":"...my souring impression was that Chilton has lost the ingredients of traditional Christianity, in favor of a chique Jewish-flavored version.

I was amazed the author is listed as a clergyman. I hoped the book would provide accurate information about the time period based on archaeological research, but the author's flights of fancy called the other information into question.If the author had listed the book as fiction/fantasy, it might have had some credibility, as a biography, it is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book for the open-minded","review":"I grew up in a non-religious household and am in the process of studying all religions in search of what I believe. This book was an excellent place to start. Was Jesus the illegitimate child of Mary and Joseph? No one can say for sure (whether they want to admit it or not), but I found Mr. Chilton's explanations to be realistic and believable. I enjoyed getting to know Jesus as a human being. Perhaps the people who were appalled at this book need to understand that some of us appreciate being given something to think about, instead of having one belief jammed down our throats."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This is a very deceptive book. I thought I would like it. The picture alone made me want to buy it. Yet, after I did a little background research regarding what was written in the book, I am glad I didn't get it. Chilton reduces Jesus the Jewish Messiah, and God in the Flesh to a crazy magic wielding rabbi. I didn't care for it. He denies almost all of the historic christian doctrines, that are very rooted in in the tanakh (OT) and can also be proven by extra biblical Jewish resources.

Portraying Jesus as hysterical, a failed exorcist, a rabbi who bullied and whined at his disciples, just to list a few of the outrageous claims... this author denies the virgin birth, the resurrection, and everything we as Christians believe in and hold dear.

What I find is conjecture and information taken out of context in an attempt to prove his theories. The basis for my Christianity is that God sent His son through a virgin. This had to be done because Mary was a virgin, in a sense sinless, and the mother passes the blood. Joseph would have passed tainted blood to Jesus. To do otherwise defeats the entire purpose of sending Jesus. The second point that destroys my interest in this writing is that the author claims that Jesus went to John the Baptist and became his Talmid. John was 6 months older than Jesus as demonstrated by Mary coming to Elizabeth. I have trouble believing Chilton believes in the God of the Bible.

For instance, he said that the years between Jesus's teenage to his mid twenties were spent with John the Baptist, yet he doesn't even attempt to show how he came up with this idea. He minimizes the reality of miracles and looks almost exclusively at the spiritual meaning. However, the gospels state that many were converted through his miracles. If one compares this with Vermes book, Borg's, Wright's, or (especially) Meier's books on the same subject, this book comes up short on credibility.

Unfortunately, I have no choice but to use the text because it came with my class and I have to do the assignments. However, my husband has loaned my some of his books that are written much better and fill the gaps that this book leaves.

I decided to try this books and found it very helpful, it is very precise in regards to the topic under discussion and the tutorials accompanied with the Chapters are very good as well. The reader gets a complete picture of the topic and only after completing the topics in the book can manage to write it's own source code without any need from any other source. The Comprehensive edition of the book is more indepth for the ASP.NET and database programming concepts using ADO.NET. Definately a good book for beginners and middle level programmers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, but maybe helpful","review":"I felt the Author spent too many pages on telling stories of things he had heard that others had done in this business. Very few things seem to be from the personal experience of the author.

The first 100 pages were purely motivational: Stories of people who have done well with rentals and the repetetive \\"I've done it, and you can do it too!\\" mantra that you get in cheap infomercials. The rest of the book provides little useful information about buying and managing rental units. I read the entire book in an afternoon. It amazed me how little information could be packed into 306 pages (though large print and many pictures of properties did help).Don't regard this review as mean spirited: there are many very good books on investing in residential real estate, but this one is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory at any price","review":"We had 8 of these timers purchased new in the Spring of 2006 for our drip irrigation system. 5 of them went bad after a few months of use.

WRONG!!! To get straight to the point--It seems that the author used the title and cover to mislead people into believing that the story revolves around pugs. It does NOT. This is a story about a woman and certain aspects of her life with pugs just thrown in there.As I was reading, I got into the woman's story, but then out of nowhere, pugs are mentioned and it threw me completely off balance. I even said out loud, \\"What the heck do pugs have to do with that?\\" As I said, it seems like the author wrote a story, but to sell it, she added pug things every now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless drivel","review":"I wanted to like this. Really. As a fan of all things pug, I perked up when I saw the cover. Truth is, the characters are bland--except the dogs. The dogs have sizzle, personality, and passion. But the humans--who cares.Add to that the fact it was either horribly edited or the author hasn't mastered your vs. you're, and I was entirely agitated.A wasted few hours, other than pondering the little beasts and the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't go anywhere","review":"Pug Hill is the kind of book that never really takes off. It doesn't go anywhere. In the beginning we learn that the main character Hope is really unhappy with her life. By the end of the book nothing much has changed. I bought this book because it was a popular read at my Pug group and I alot of us had the same complaints. The slow pace, the lack of a good and developed story, and the main characters inability to make changes in her life. The story is about pugs but the main character does not own a pug which was pointless to the plot. Why did she not have a pug if she loved pugs? Why did she not have a dog at all? How can you have a book about dogs when the main character doesn't own a dog? It is one of the many questions this book raises with no answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly funny!","review":"I carried this book title in my purse for years after reading a good review of it. I had forgotten about it and then saw it in a bookstore. I'm so glad I chose to read it! I really couldn't remember what made me want to read it from the review but it was a well written, funny, sweet, completely entertaining book!!! The main character is flawed but likeable. I caught myself cheering her on in her attempt to overcome her fear of public speaking. And the pugs really add to the charm of the book....especially if you are a dog lover. The effect the pugs have on her is completely believable and recognizable if you love dogs. Read the book.....you'll love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enamored.","review":"I am completely enamored with this novel. An avid pug owner and lover, I spotted this book at Target. The cover alone displays a cityscape with tons of pugs congregating atop a hill. I knew that I just had to have it!Although, Hope uses Pug hill in New York City as a reprieve from her daily life, Pugs do not really take the center stage in this novel. Instead, Hope takes the center stage with her boyfriend dramas, fear of public speaking, and general angst at finding a suitable life partner.I really feel that this was well written with good humor sprinkled throughout. Alison Pace did a great job at helping you identify with the Hope, the main character. She was true to life. Hope seemed to have a lot of crushes. No main love interests until the end, which was absolutely lovely.But, I'll leave you to conjecture your own feeling on the ending. Trust me it will put an big smile on your face. The same smile that I use when I look at my pug, Pikachu. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a sweet story","review":"This book got my attention and kept it the entire way through. I adored it. The novel centers around Hope McNeil, a young single woman in NYC who has a lot of fears in life including public speaking. Throughout the novel, we watch Hope grow as a person and slowly find the courage to face her fears.It's been a long time since I read a book in which I really identified and connected with the main character. Though Hope's life isn't all that similar to mine (except that I too, adore pugs) I still felt a bond with her. Something that should be attributed to Pace's writing and her ability to create a real and reliable narrator.\\"Pug Hill\\" is a simple story of life; a story about Hope's flaws and shortcomings, but also about her feelings and triumphs. I couldn't put it down. Two thumbs way up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boss 2000 Mobile DVD Player","review":"I installed this item in a boat for a customer.

The book is filled with interesting examples that support Keith's point that the down low is only new to the cult-like group now embracing it. Many of us have known about the down low long before it became popular. In fact, what is now considered down low is not really that at all -- at least not in the way it was previously used. Back then, no one would ever acknowledge being on the down low -- it would defeat it's purpose.Using history, politics, and everyday people, Keith inspires us as a culture to look within ourselves enough to open up about HIV/AIDS and the down low. He asks us consider the plight of black gay and bisexual men and how society has groomed the very down low behavior it now condemns.This book is truly inspirational, and after you finish reading it, you will have grown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaping and Bounding to Unsubstantiated Conclusions","review":"Boykin's blog is filled with misinformation, i.e., at one point he stated West Hollywood is the product of White Gay gentrification, forcing people of color out of the neighborhood with high rents and property values.

Yes, one serving of 9 sandwiches contains 7g of fat (but no trans fats) and 140 calories, though few could possibly stop at just one serving.Despite the dietary red flags, I've got to give these pretzel sandwiches five stars, just because they taste so good.On the positive side the first ingredient is not ordinary wheat flour, but unbleached wheat flour. Less processing with the unbleached. The peanut butter inside the pretzels is just sweet enough and moist enough to be delightful.If one keeps his or her appetite in check, these can be quite the enjoyable and special snack.Warning: This product does contain peanut products and is processed on equipment that makes dairy products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great snack but ...","review":"These are our favorite pretzel sandwiches and very difficult to find locally but the item is listed as 10 oz packages (12 packs) but what we received was 8 oz packages (12 packs).

Considering the bike came out of the trash.... well, you get my point.Don't think that your going to get away with a good HG53 chain. This chain is nothing but junk. Don't waste your time or money on this. Steer away. Don't make me tell you that \\"I told you so\\".

I have been around horses most of my life and a few years back started into the 'Real Cowboy' cattle ranch scene too! Mr. Parker has done a great job at describing in wonderful and funny detail what it is really like. Add in the history he has put in there and his very personal struggles makes for some great reading and a book I could not put down until done!

I wish him well on his next adventure and will be looking forward to his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, Rambling Mess That's for Cowboy-lovers Only","review":"This book has nothing to do with Jameson Parker's acting career--it is a rambling mess that is 90% about him taking care of horses and cattle, with the other 10% being interspersed comments on his depression. There is nothing linear, so things are all mixed up and dates are not given. You don't get to him being shot until page 175, which actually happened years before he became a cowboy. He refers to his depression and being suicidal earlier in the book but it makes no sense in context because he hasn't explained why. It is a big disappointment if you are looking for something about his career. Why couldn't he say something about the projects he has been involved in or told more about being married to the famous Darleen Carr? Instead, if you want to read boring, detailed stories about the cowboy life then you might enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tall in the Saddle","review":"For many years during his long-run as A.J. in the top-rated television show, \\"Simon & Simon,\\" Jameson Parker projected an image of a certain prep-school glibness. The persona he gives us in \\"An Accidental Cowboy,\\" the real Parker, is something far different. This is an ironic, bemused, funny, affectionate, anquished, and ultimately enlightened, and enlightening, tale of one man's odyssey from the unreality of a Hollywood life, through the near occasion of violent death, into the light to be seen from the back of a good cow pony. And the many hands who populate the ranching world Parker encounters are never less than fascinating. By all means, do not let this horseman pass by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parker proves himself as a real \\"hand\\" at writing!","review":"I have been around the people and lifestyle Parker writes about in this book, and I appreciate that someone with his talent for writing has immortalized them, and the California way of ranching, in these pages.

I removed the other 2 feet easily just by lifting them out and immediately secured all four feet to the bowl with super clue. Now, that aside, the set seems to be produced of very substantial material. The bowl's sections are large...2+ cups each. I intend to use my chop and store set to make veggie toppings ahead for my salads.

Then, after just one week of working (or lack there of), the motor went out! It quit blowing air, and then all it did was sit there and make a loud humming sound.

We tried everything suggested by the allergist: I dusted, I vacuumed, I washed bed sheets/blankets, took out the stuffed animals, used the right pillow covers and mattress covers. We tried OTC allergy medications and prescription medications. THEN we purchased this air filter for his room. Amazing ... he sleeps through the night peacefully, nasal passages clear. I'd give this air cleaner 5 stars except for the fact that there is a slight odor in his room from it (probably just because its new ... its that kind of smell) and it does tend to warm his room up slightly w/ it running all night long, so I keep our a/c turned down a bit more at night now.

It does do all of that, however, the replacement filters are $25.00 a pair and they need to be replaced quite frequently depending on how dirty your room is. I should have spent the $400 plus dollars on a Sharper Image machine instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and useless","review":"Bionaire is the worst company to buy a filter from. If they don't do it right away, then you're lucky, but eventually they will begin to buzz at almost any speed. They also seem to do nothing about the dust or smell in the air.Customer service is the worst part about Bionaire products. They have two centers and if you talk to one one day chances are you will not get the same one the next. So if you fax in a copy of a receipt and call for confirmation, then you have to hope to get the same service center otherwise you will have to try calling again because they cannot transfer you or tell you anything about what is going on in the other center.

I guess it's fine from an Anglophilic point of view, but most serious scholars turn to the work of J. Gordon Melton. Sure, even Melton agrees that there are (at least) four competing OTO's, but would one argue that there isn't some agreed.upon vision that identifies each as \\"OTO\\"? Do the many dominations of Christianity not agree upon certain basic principles? And given the involvement of L. Ron Hubbard in the Pasadena chapter of the OTO (pre.Scientology), how can the organization not be considered significant in any comprehensive study of ... post.ancient religion?

This book is really not worth your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT about *real* druidry","review":"If you are truly interested in learning about Druidry, please stick with authors who have honest academic backgrounds in the subject...

It is lazy and self indulgent, and has the unmistakable stamp of drug use all over it. Many of the songs have cool arrangements, and lots of weird noises, etc. But the songs just aren't up to snuff. Topping that off are the bland beyond belief vocals of Ms Landry and you have an exotic mess of psychedelic pastiche that really holds no value. Even the bonus disc of demos with Smith's new vocals on the old demos don't hold any fascination for me, a longtime Cure fan. This one could have stayed in the vaults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real deal","review":"(FIRST EDITION) There are many significant shortcomings in this interactive DVD game. I do not recommend it at all. It is not at all like the real Feud. The most frustrating shortcoming is that you must get the answers in the right order, since it reveals them in order, or you lose. No steals, no strikes. Sadly, I can't return it since its a DVD game. I hope the newer versions are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resources, some drawbacks","review":"This book has a lot of good points - writer's tip sheets, suggestions, markets that not everyone has heard of.However, there are some drawbacks. The most notable comes from the sheer volitility of the publishing market - editors rotate, move around, leave jobs, etc. And writers, using a contact name several months or years old will look foolish to the people they are trying to impress with their proffesionalism. The other drawback I found was in incorrect information. For example, they list president names of RWA chapters. Only the person they listed as my chapter president hadn't been president for more than three years. In another spot, they list a phone number for a publisher. I called to have a tip sheet sent to me. Only, it was an incorrect number.I felt the drawbacks, though, were merely inherent in the style of book. I would, therefore, still recommend it to a writer trying to break into the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst","review":"I bought this book because its on Bill Gates, and was I disappointed or what? The style of writting is very bad, and suits a small article not a book. It is not a biography at all, but an absurd trick to cash in on Bill Gates' Name.You are much better off reading other books on Microsoft and Bill Gates, which go into at least some details on the events of both the company and the man himself. This book was more like a brief news item.For me it was a waste of money. The only reason I am giving it a one star is because I cannot give it any less."},{"rating":"1","title":"used book from a library","review":"disappointed because the book was thin and was written for kids. didnt know that, there was no preview or at least it wasnt in my face so bought this book by mistake. also this was a used book from a library"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Gates","review":"I would give this book a five-star rating.

An improvement on image resolution and commentary would be a good reason to wait in anticipation for a more revamped edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"A text and an atlas...good at neither","review":"This text tries to be both a text and an atlas in one and is unfortunately good at neither one.

Ms. Battle's explorations of a troubled mother and her adult daughters, intensified by the anxieties of the Christmas holidays, kept me turning the pages at a fast clip.

So the mother decides she needs to have her daughters home for Christmas to make amends before something happens to her.What else can I say I hated the book. It was very depressing and annoying. I couldn't even finish (which I never do no matter how bad). Everything probably turned out wonderful for the mother and her daughters but I couldn't bring myself to sit though it. To sum it up........I hated all the sisters. If you like a story about bitter selfish miserable people (that just keeps going on and on and on about it) you will love this one.I hate when people give bad reviews but don't recommend something good.

All but the youngest sister--who was never \\"fleshed out\\" enough to become \\"real\\"-- are well developed: after the conclusion, you wonder how their lives are going."},{"rating":"1","title":"bed and breakfast","review":"This book was looooooong and tedious.

If sales for this set are low(and from what I hear the sales for Season one were a dissapointment)maybe the greedy studios will get the message and price these sets more reasonably and in complete seasons!

It became sort of a cult show to watch. When I saw the price of Season 1 I just had to buy it. But there's no way I'm paying the price they're asking for the season 2 sets. I'm amazed when production companies have a really good product that consumers want and they hammer a nail into their own coffin. I'm sure they'll come down in price one day and I don't mind waiting until then. I don't have to have it right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greedy, greedy Fox.....","review":"It is no secret that the first season of the Big Valley was released with all the episodes for a very good price. I guess they must have sold alot of these, which promted Fox's greed to set in. The second season has been released with half of the episodes and for a few dollars more than the first season. I hope Fox knows how greedy they are. It is blatantly obvious here.I guess the many, many millions of dollars that they have is not enough. Companies such as these make me sick.Thank god to Encore's The Western's Chanell. Now we can burn the episodes uncut for free.

No!","review":"Don't get me wrong--I love Big Valley, it was one of my favorite TV shows right up there with Magnificent Seven, Bonanza, and Highlander, but I completely agree with previous reviews--I will not pay what they want for both parts of the second season. $60 for Highlander was worth it--they put tons of information on every character in every episode, filled the DVD with all kinds of extras, from deleted shots to interviews with the script writers and actors. All the extras made it worth the price.But I am NOT going to pay $60 for nothing but the episodes that are of a quality that I can at least match with my home computer! Like the others who reviewed--I got the eps off of Encore westerns and I'm fine with those and won't pay for the second season unless Fox puts more on the disks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Biting the hand that feeds...","review":"To me, this series is a solid 5 stars. However, as many have noted, after releasing the entire first season in one pop, the studio decided to go for a money gouge and split up the second season into two parts, this first part virtually the same price as the entire first season.And you'll note that they have not come out with the second half of the second season. I can only assume it is because of people refusing to pay as much for half a season as for a full season.Which means we're all screwed, basically. We don't get the rest of the show, they don't get money. This is what happens when greed backfires. Hopefully the studio will give themselves a good shake and go back to releasing the rest of the series at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Valley Season 2 Volume 1","review":"Picture quality was very good, sound was good, no glitches or blurriness.

It leaves me wondering if Season 1 was really complete and if the remainder of Season 2 is really in consecutive order. I can't tell you how upset I was when I opened the package to find repeat episodes! And there's no way to tell what you're getting until the package is completely opened because the titles are not listed on the outer package. Titles are listed on internal DVD vases.

Granted, the A REALITY TOUR has a more extensive set list, but the editing of this video - the processing of every minute of the video to make it look unreal - ruins the experience by distancing the viewer from the performance. One complaint about the performance is that I'd rather have seen Bowie have a full range of backup singers rather than employing whatever tricks were employed to flesh out the sound. That probably would not have seemed a problem if the rest of the video (the visual treatment) had been more honest.

The second DVD gets a little better with some cool licks and string skipping sequences etc, but the 3rd DVD is just mind blowing to me.

I figured the complaints raised would be addressed in the new edition. So I went to my local bookstore to check it out. The book seems popular because it was hard to find a copy; however, when I did I find a copy I was very disappointed. This is a brand new edition but they reference sites and restaurants that are no longer in existence. For example, try to find the Chicago rib shack. According to the web this place no longer exists and is now a Japanese restaurant. If you need further proof, go to the index and look up Syon Park. The book says pg. 183-4 yet nothing is there. I did find the Syon Park info on pg. 181 but then what's the point of the index??? At this point I threw the book down in disgust and walked out.

So it's good for that, with minimal insight into the man, or if you want some insight into the man who made these amazing and breakthrough paintings. what his inner demons were and why and how they affected his work.Not the book. Some deride \\"Jackson Pollock: An American Saga\\" the Pulitzer Prize winner Bio by Steven Naifeh and Gregory Smith, as gossipy. Well, mostly because they don't say, but present some evidence that Pollock might have had homosexual tendencies.That says more about the people and reviewers that say that, and their homophobic attitudes, than what is actually in the book. Heaven forbid that the man who changed American Art was Gay. If you want pretty, good sized reproductions of Pollock's work, this is the book for you.

My favorite part was making bugs. I really liked the big monster that came out at the end when we had to find the crackers with the right fractions.While playing the game I learned that opposites are called Antonyms. I also learned that insects have three parts, head, abdomen, and thorax.The part I did not like was the mining section where it moved so fast I had to get Mommy to do the work.

The basic information section of the study guide is followed by practice tests designed in the same proportions to the NCTRC exam. Test results in these practice tests further serve as invaluable reviews/study. In addition,current references to other study materials are noted.

Faced also with an interminable daily commute and inane radio chatter, I decided to kill two birds with one stone and order the audio package. Bravo! Propelled predominately by John D. MacDonald's elegant yet wistful prose and bolstered significantly by Darren McGavin's at times powerfully emotional narration, through my radio Travis McGee came to life as he never had before. The earliest fable, \\"The Deep Blue Good-by\\", written some thirty-plus years ago, suffers slightly from minor out-dated references, but rarely. \\"The Lonely Silver Rain\\", the last in the series, is completely relevant, perhaps more today than when written.

My toddler would not even notice that she still had these goggles on after she's done with the pool. Headed to the sand box wearing these goggles. Easy to adjust straps, won't tangle with hair.

For the first couple of weeks they were great and I was a big fan. I rinsed them after every use and stored them in the original packaging. However, after about 2-3 weeks of use both of them started leaking and I can't seem to figure out why - other than the gasket has already lost its shape and cannot form a complete seal anymore.

Our family likes the way they fit like a mask vs regular goggles. But to say they don't leak is a bit misleading. All 4 of my kids have had some issues with leaking. If they don't make the mask as tight as they can and literally push it onto their face to make a suction, they will leak. I am also a bit concerned at how easily the lenses will scratch. The plastic seems very soft. One good toss across the pool decking and they are going to be scratched. Don't keep them in the case after use and they will get scratched by putting them in a bucket or box with all the other swim toys. The straps are nice and easy to adjust but they don't always hold their adjustment. To be honest, I am not all that impressed with these as the end all be all for swim goggles etc. Good but not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Goggles for a kid","review":"These goggles are excellent for my 6 year old.

This year we got another pair for her and one for her brother who's just under 2.

There's no way you can pronounce these words by just studying letters in those couple pages.

Some of the papers consider particular castles, like Hedingham and Orford, or fortifications in particular areas, like Scotland or the Welsh marches. But castles didn't exist in a cultural or political vacuum, so there's also quite a lot here on the Bayeux Tapestry, Alan of Brittany and the honour of Richmond, the Anarchy and the building programs of Matilda and Stephen, and the effects of castle architecture on later, nonmilitary construction projects.

I don't have any words to say about the specific episodes other than, if your a child of the 70's you know how good going back to these great episodes will be. And if this is all new to you, sit down and take a wild 70's ride to fun and good times that will keep you smiling...Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy Drew & Hardy Boys review","review":"These are great movies if you are a mystery lover.

The comfort and price were ideal. I absolutely loved the design and the side cup holder made any mothers life a dream. My son did not give me any trouble in this car seat. The arm rests on the sides of the unit flip up which will make buckling your child in a lot easier. My only complaint was the wideness of the seat making a tight fit between the car door and the seat belt. I find myself occasionally having to skirt the seat over slightly to be able to successfully buckle my son in.

It has yoga push-ups, plank exercises. I like the clock that appears at the 5 minute mark during each section. I only wish that the video ended with a stretch. There is a short stretch at the end of each section. I just would've liked a 10 min. stretch as well.

I'm no hardcore audiophile, but I appreciate good sound. They provide a nice full range, even at low volume. Since I'm working in an office, I don't need to crank the volume for a party, but these still provide plenty of power if I want a louder sound after hours.

Sound can fill the room, works well with a variety of music. The price just can't be beat.

More than once an English-to-Greek translation requires a grammatical construction (i.e., different case endings or different tense/mood) that has not been introduced. The tapes devote about four times as much airtime as necessary to the Greek alphabet (which is not at all difficult to learn) before they, too, wander off into the ozone. Many important questions of usage and grammar are dismissed as being \\"beyond the scope of this book.\\" Almost anything beyond the Greek alphabet seems to be beyond the scope of this book.I know this is harsh, but this book could be a real confidence-destroyer for some who hasn't had much experience with languages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A challenge","review":"This book needs some work if it's going to be useful to anyone just beginning Greek.

The Colloquial series and the Greek in Three Months by Hugo series are both done by Ms. Watts.

I'm sorry, but even if you're tall, no one wants to be called an Amazon!

Molly (aged 10-13) acquires a young mule as a suprise, thanks to her father's wise faith in a lean, older mare. Even the local bully grows up to respect both girl and mule.

However, Dvonte and Janessa are the worst match, she and Dvonte agreed to sleep with each other on their first date, so everything went downhill from there. Tempest and Geren both have secrets that may destroy their relationship and Janessa and Dvonte's relationship is held together by a piece of string and sex.

Dvonte was a player for real, and I am sorry that that girl gave him a child. If he was acting like that, and I am not a big advocate of abortion, I probably would do that and call it a day. Temptest was a great character, but she had to go through a lot of trials. For one, she had to come clean with Geren on stuff that would have made him run for the hills,but he didn't. I had started the book around the 4th of July, and put it down until recently, and read it through.

What a waste. I'd like to return it to the bookstore for a full return. I was amazed at this author's juvenile style of writing and description lacking characters. This was one of the worst books that I have ever read (read it while delayed in an airport for several hours)!! I have not read any of her other books and based on this TRASH, I don't plan to read any others. Some of the characters and stories in the books were simply unbelievable (midgets/coat hanger abortion in the 90's) cmon!!!My suggestion to those who are entertaining the idea of purchasing this book, DON'T!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT TRUE TO FORM","review":"I read Addicted and loved it. I had everyone in my office reading the book. It was one of the best books I have read in years. I was so excited when this book came out that myself and several of my co-workers brought the book right away. We read it and we all were thoroughly disappointed. It was a cross between a B movie and a bad romance novel. I think the erotica and unexpected ending was my attraction to Addicted but this paled in comparison. I had a hard time finishing it and when I did my reaction was WHATEVER!! Please Zane go back to your old format that's what readers loved about you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average Seekers","review":"I definitely felt like a below average reader, spending my time reading this book. At first the book started out pretty interesting with Tempest descriptions of previous relationships with losers. After that the book went down hill. Not only was the book very predictable, but also like a children fairytale. I do believe in happy endings, but lets get real..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book!!!!!","review":"This book was different from Addicted, yet, it was a very good book. Through reading this book I learned how to appreciate my significant other more. Zane has a style of writing that is very unique. I find that lessons can be learned while reading her books. This is a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, I still enjoyed it!!!","review":"This was not the usual Zane we all know although I really enjoyed the story line and the characters. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY MISLEADING TITLE","review":"I guess when I picked this booked up (and paid full price for it) that I was looking for total erotic and a little more flavor. I was sorely disappointed!! Throughout the book, I kept wondering, \\"When will I get to the good part? Where's the vivid ... scenes?? Where's the peak story line?\\" Didn't happen!!Zane's faceless characters lacked depth. The first chapter of the book was somewhat juicy, but then \\"Tempest\\" did a personality 360. I had to wonder if I was still reading about the same character. Someone needs to tell Zane that readers are not picking up her latest effort to read about self-proclaimed celibacy. Geez!!The entire book read like amateur writing. There wasn't even a story line. What a flop!... Better luck next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book after reading the other Zane novels. This novel was found to be a very big disappointment. This book did not live up to the name that Zane has made for herself. The story line was very easy to see through and rather boring. It lacked the passion and intense story line that this author has produced in the pass. I know that there will be ups and down, but this was a big downer! And it lacked quality, in other words in was way too GHETTO! I believe the infamous Zane got over on us on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Dissapointed!","review":"I am a very big fan of Zane, but OH MY GOODNESS, I think someone else wrote this book for her! Nothing in it was like her previous works. I eagerly awaited the release of this book and even had it on order here at Amazon before it was released... IT [DISAPPOINTED]!! I absolutely never abandon a book because I always need closure, but I couldn't even finish it! And can someone please explain to me my girl ZANE's obsession with \\"midgets?!\\" I was very suprised to find that some readers gave this book 4 and 5 stars. The \\"secrets\\" that were \\"revealed\\" regarding Tempest and Darren... BORING! I read Zane's other books in 2 days or less... It took me 2 weeks to read Heat Seekers and I still didn't finish it. Every time I put it down it was too hard to pick back up. I'm looking forward to the next Zane novel because I believe she will make a come back! There's nowhere to go from Heat Seekers but up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Seeking the Heat","review":"I have read all of Zane's book and I must say Zane is a captivating author. From the begining of the book till the end, she will have you at the edge of your seat. I consider her one of the greatest authors of this century. She is graphical and helps a woman discover what is missing in a woman's sex life. She makes the reader feel passion and the excitement when reading.However, HEATSEEKERS was very disappointing. It lacked Passion, drama, excitement, life, thrill, and all the other elements that make her books great. I was very suprised at Zane because her books are always very good. Hopefully the next book would make up for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zane is soooo....","review":"Weak as a writer. The Heatseekers had the potential to be a great book with a decent story line but, Zane does not possess enough talent to pull it off. The entire time I was reading this material I prayed that it would come to an end. Her writing is cliche at best and she offers no good use of imagery. I predicted the end just by reading the liner notes on the inside flap. I give this book two stars because I was able to read it from cover to cover without being totally bored to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait a minute, I read this before!!","review":"I know I read this before in my dreams or perhaps in my former life. This was all too predictable. I felt no compassion here. the story was preachy and not down to earth. geren was a character from the writers dreams, this black young millionaire had everyhing going for himself, i often wondered what he saw in tempest, didnt he say she had on a cheap black suit at first? and they met in a club of all places. anyway she has this gratifying job based on her past experiences and he is even too rich to pass for a broker. can i switch lives with these 2? janessa living in the projects with her brother who farts more than anything else, even has farting friends?? Janessa never tried to move out of her parents home in the projects even after applying to college. this SH!@#! is not REAL!! dvonte was the realest character and he sucked! To all my fellow Zane readers you know what applies here, say it with me, SHAME ON IT ALL!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me da heat","review":"There was nothing hot about this book at all. There was no steamy sex like it portrayed it would. All the of the characters were corny as all get out.Geren's secret was already revealed before you got to that point of the book and so was Tempest's, who he ended up marrying.Her bestfriend Janessa ended up having a baby by someone that resembled my sons' father (a deadbeat). By the ended up the book, homegurl seemed like she was getting ready to forgive him for all that dirt he did to her.This book was sooooo boring. Get it from the library....get it from the library.Later..."},{"rating":"2","title":"not what you think","review":"this is still a great book by Zane but it is not like the other books she has written this is a true love story not an erotic novel like her other books. I still think is worth reading it is a nice change."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THIS REALLY ZANE??!!!!!??","review":"I have all of Zane's books, and I love every one of them, so you could imagine how I felt when I purchased this one. I was in the middle of reading another novel and I put it down just to get into this book. I was very excited because I knew it would be off the hook!!! I'm sorry to say it's not. It is terribly boring!!! It does not even seem like she wrote the book. Her unique style and humor is not even there. What happened!!?? I would'nt waste my money or time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good to be true","review":"This book started off slow, but it picked up later. I enjoyed reading this Geren was too good to be true."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I'm highly disappointed, it's her worst book! Very boring and couldn't hold my attention. I would consider checking to see if it's at your local branch library before purchasing this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!!!","review":"Come on this book sucked with a capital S! After reading \\"Addicted\\" which is my favorite book, PERIOD, and Shame on it all and Sex Chronicles this book was BOO-BOO and Pure Garbage and it all is because she strayed from her erotic story telling to tell a very cute and perfect love story, Please save it cause I don't want to hear it. This book is definately for Lovers Only!Be Warned this is NOTHING like \\"ADDICTED\\" if that is what you are looking for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zane's worst book","review":"this book is awful. i was so disappointed with zane. how do you go from addicted to this mess......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Seeking","review":"Like a previous reviewer, I read Addicted and couldn't wait to read the rest of Zane's books. I was not enthralled when reading this book. I kept turning the pages hoping the story would pick up or that there would be some unpredictable twist on the next page, but the entire storyline was forseeable.You know up front everything that's going to happen: ...Geren's constant attempt to save every female character in the story is also very predictable.Save your $$$$. Get this one at the library if you must read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There was no heat!","review":"When I read Addicted, I was like \\"I'm reading all of her books.\\" Shame on it all didn't measure up to Addicted but I also read this one. To me it doesn't have enough imagination. Not enough drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical zane...","review":"Attempting to understand the popularity of someone is a daunting task when it comes to Zane. Her ridiculous tales, lackluster imagery, and corny dialogue amount to a huge waste of time. If you're interested in reading something quality, check out momowilly's newest book exclusively at lulu.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm so glad I borrowed this book from the library instead ofbuying it. I enjoyed Addicted, but Heat Seekers was a sloppy,vulgar follow-up. The characters are boring and Zane exhibitsa startling lack of creativity in this book. It's basically trashy and very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual ZANE!","review":"I was somewhat shocked at how this book didn't measure up to Zane's writing capabilities. This book did not hold my intrest and it lacked the humor Zane is know for. Unlike Addited and Shame on it all, she didn't use very much creativity. I am very displeased with this book overall. I wouldn't advise anyone to waste their money, unlike her other books, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the heat?","review":"I have read a few of Zane's books, and they have all left me disappointed. However, at least in the newest one, Skyscrapers, the plot wasn't transparently predictable. As I read The Heat Seekers, I was waiting for something to happen that I couldn't see a mile away. Nothing ever did. I could have been able to overlook that if there had been a little HEAT in the book. For a \\"sexy\\" novel, it was lukewarm at best. Some reviewers say this is because it was a romance novel. The romance she was going for wasn't there. With romance, there should still be passion. Also, it was much too unrealistic. Geren and Tempest fell in love for no reason, and are we really supposed to believe the whole Janessa and Dvonte situation? The novel was much too bland to swallow. If you have a few hours that you really have nothing else to do with, go ahead and read this. But, if you're looking to be entertained, please pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME ON IT ALL","review":"Shame on it all. I am very disappointed in this book. I have read all of Zane's other books and this last one does not even measure up. It lacked her creavitive thought and humor, that she is known for in her other books. It also lacked her exotic flare and romance compared to her other books. I feel the author did not but her all into. I hope these reviews are taken seriously by the author and we as reader do not have to see a repeat of this book. On this note, I look forward for the future books ahead and I hope there is a change for the better and not the worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama All Around","review":"Every time I read it I couldn't hardly put it down. Most of the time I couldn't wait if Tempest and Dvonte are getting together. It's a shame because they look like a very good couple. I can't believe Janessa made love to Dvonte and didn't use any protection. If she was safe then she wouldn't have \\"a bun in the oven\\" sort of speak. It's just too bad she lost the baby.Dvonte seemed so nice at first. He was just turns out to be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Tempest and Janessa realized that he didn't really want a relationship. All he wants is to have fun with every women he meets. Janessa really needs to learn how to stand up for herself especially towards Dvonte.This is the second time I read one of Zane's book. She never disappoints me. Once you read a Zane book you won't want to stop until you reach the end. I sugguest you read this book or her others like Nervous."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE HEAT IS NOT ON!!!!","review":"THEY FORGOT TO ADD THE HEAT TO THE PEOPLE WHO WAS SEEKING IT. THIS BOOK WAS NOT AT ALL GOOD!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Boring I Almost Fell Asleep!","review":"Wow! I'm still in shock. After reading some of Zane's other books, I thought the least I'd get from this book was reliable entertainment. I understand her not wanting to simply focus on erotica all the time, but my goodness, just because you take out all of the explicit sex scences doesn't mean you have to take out the action or the laughs too. This was one of the most boring, disappointing books I've ever read. I feel a little better knowing that I at least purchased it at a discounted price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good.","review":"I loved that this book was set apart from the erotic novels, yet it was still a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Returned It!!!!","review":"After reading Addicted and Shame on it All, I could not wait for the next book to come out by Zane. I was taking summer school college courses to advance in school and I put my school work down to read this book. At that time, Zane's book was more important than my school work. I WAS TOTALLY AND COMPLETEY DISAPPOINTED!! The book lacked everything from humor to the steamy love scenes that Zane was able to create in her previous books. The book was also just plain BORING! I continued to read it just based on the fact that I was praying that it would get better.The story line was just to fake for me. And I just could not even create an image in my mind of the characters because I got to the point that I didn't care about them after awhile.And the ending, I don't want to give it away, but come one, give me a break.....JUST TO FAKE!!!Well to make a long story short, I read the book and returned it once I finished and received a refund. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY, NOT WORTH THE MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"shame on it all!!","review":"I have read every one of Zane's book from beginning to end and was greatly anticipating heat seekers from all the other books she had written I just knew this book would have me bound to a chair fiercely reading until there was nothing left. Imagine my surprise when I went to the mall and purchased (at a much higher price then amazon!!) this book to be so greatly disappointed with it!!Shame on it all left me longing for more of the sister hood they had, Addicted left me thinkful for committed relationships and the Sex Chronicles left me (well you know). Sorry to say Heat Seekers had no heat, no major passion, and no major story line. This clearly was not Zanes best nor was it her average. I will continue to view her stories but something was greatly missing with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED WITH HEATSEEKERS","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Zanes and couldn't wait to get this new book and am very, very disappointed. It's NOTHING like any of her previous books which were all very good and kept me turning the pages until I was all done but with Heatseekers, I am MAKING myself read it just to see if it gets any better, which it's not. The 2 female characters seem like little young school girls instead of grown working women. There isn't any excitement in this book. Zane, please take your time next time and give us what we know you can give which is a 5 star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book was a wonderful book. This book kept me on the edge of my seat because I wanted to know what would happen next. Zane is one of my favorite authors and she has a way of keeping her readers tuned into the book.

His scenes are few and neither graphic sexually or sadistically. While I kept waiting for the all the \\"gay stuff\\" to appear, I genuinely got caught up in her storytelling.

The Diabelli, Eroica, and opus 76 variations are played with incomparable flair, color, and emotion by this greatest of Russian pianists. Performance-wise, you will not find better versions of these pieces. However, the sound quality could be significantly better, even from a live performance, seeing as how it was taped in 1970. It's not that there is a lot of static or unclear or muffled sound, it's just that the piano sounds rather distant, which is quite odd. Nonetheless, the poor sound cannot detract from these stunning performances of Beethoven's great variations, especially the Diabellis. Get this CD if you see it in the store because it is a rarity that you most likely will not find online. Highly recommended. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting biography","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, it kept my attention, and never got dull or dry. Very well researched.

I buy a new one each time because it is nearly as cheap as buying two new batteries. The drills have never failed and the batteries typically last me two or more years and I use them up to five hours a day five days a week.My work is rather light duty so the 9.6V drill is perfect. However, I can get all the torque I need using the slower speed and decent power on the high speed.I can install blinds in 30 plus windows on a single charge (that's 120 to 180 1 1/2\\" self-tapping screws). The drill is so light and comfortable in the hand (well balanced) that fatigue is never an issue (a big deal because I'm on the skinny side). Charging is very fast so when I'm on a large job I can charge a battery long before I use up the other one.I will keep using them as long as they keep making them and my living depends on my drill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dewalt cordless drill","review":"This is a smaller size drill with enough power for around the house projects.

They had lovely illustrations and LARGE print. This Children's Thrift series has such small print that Grandmothers have trouble reading them, let alone early readers.These books are old fashioned. They ascribe human thoughts and emotions to animals. You may find that off-putting. However, the natural history (how animals live and feed themselves) is realistic. If your child understands poetic license and anthropomorphism, these books are still charming.

People who write negative reviews are doing a disservice. This needs to be a five star book. If you cannot understand it, simply realize the fault lies mainly with your own unfamiliarity with the concepts. Perhaps you should read a simpler book which will not have as much to offer but will at least be on par with your current intelligence level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific~","review":"This book is one that I will definitely keep on my bookshelf for a long, long (long!) time! I bought it as a textbook for a class on transpersonal psychology. It has a great variety of topics in transpersonal psychology, short, intelligent articles that are challenging and weave well together.The editors have gathered writings by *the* big names in transpersonal psychology so that the reader has a good, foundational understanding of topics like meditation, transpersonal therapies, dreaming, and psychedelics. These aren't just a series of article written separately and compiled in a volume randomly, most (if not all) of the articles were written specifically for this volume and so they interweave and relate well to one another, sometimes referring to other sections or articles or authors to help the reader.This is an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clear Writing, Heh","review":"This book is touted as linking \\"us to the timeless wisdom of the ages.\\" Its wisdom is about the equivalent of a cow patty splatting on a flat rock.

About a third of the way into it, it starts to show a little promise, but the story never gets off the ground. The author had some inconsistencies in his plot and just rambled on a lot. I got so frustrated reading this one, that I actually came back out to Amazon to look at other reviews to see if I was just not getting it. Forced myself to finish it up and have already thrown it out.I'll give another Clark title a try, and if he fails me again he goes on my blacklist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I finished reading this novel the other day. I'm American and I say American Horror writers should read this to get an idea of what the true horror reader likes.

It has a mild gothic-like setting and this I really enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I made it about 100 pages into this snorefest before I could take no more. If it hasn't grabbed me in 100 pages then its just not going to. It was unforunate because this book had such a cool front cover, but Clark just went on and on and on about his characters and every now and then (very briefly) he would say oh yeah and theres vampires in the sewers. Then it was back to the characters sitting down for a chat AGAIN. I like developed characters but there is a such thing as to much. Its the same thing as going into a horror flick about vampires and thinking man I hope the first hour is a bunch of talking with some action in the last 30 minutes. Which is the formula I'm assuming this book followed because again I couldn't make myself finish it. Wow this book was just boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Memorable Story","review":"Jack Cady is the most underrated of American short story writers.

Ann Lee did very well in picking view, look those mountains and rivers, you will be really shocked by the feeling nature brings to us. That made those fight scenes in poetic sentiment indeed. You will feel an implicit aesthetic feeling about eastern. About its music, the composer is Chinese great musician Tan Dun and the performer is great cello-player Yo-Yo Ma. The score has beautiful melody and there are some Chinese folk instruments in the music. \\"Night fight\\" is a piece of drums, it's very cool, and the others are cello and orchestra. (Or Chinese folk instruments) The album sounds like a complete movement, very uniform. The theme song is romantic with eastern feeling.

This enchanting--and literally soaring--movie (incorporating the ability to fly) is stunning and it's no wonder it became such an international smash hit amongst critics and regular people alike. But, as in most everything, music plays an important factor to a movie's likability; and the beautiful and heartaching score tugs at one's emotions. Dun's melodies and Ma's soloing are superb in every sense--CoCo's singing (in both English and Mandarin) even soars despite an overall thin singing voice.

The music of a movie is so important; it affects your senses and helps you feel the way the makers of the film originally intended. I certainly can understand why this beautiful score received the Academy Award; it corresponds so eloquently to every part of the movie. Tan Dun certainly put his heart and soul into creating the perfect soundtrack, Yo-Yo Ma proved of his talent with those enchanting cello solos, and I thought it was so refreshing to see a new face, CoCo Lee, sing for a change.

Unlike the scores of most action films, it is not loud and percussive. Instead, Yo-Yo Ma's cello is soulful and melancholy, conveying the alternately tense and bittersweet feel of the movie. The final song, presented both in English and Mandarin versions, is emotionally stirring without being sappy (like the \\"Titanic\\" song!).If you liked the cello solos on this album, I would also recommend John Williams' soundtrack to \\"Schindler's List\\". The violin solos on that score, performed by Yitzhak Perlman, are as heartfelt and genuine as Yo-Yo Ma's cello."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music by great artists and composers","review":"That pretty much says it all.

So if you want a book that covers his whole career then this is the book for you.The essays are really interesting as well, with an analysis of his whole career, with particular reference to his later works.I really liked the number of later works that are included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition for Guston lovers","review":"This overall is a great book. It might not be the same quality that I have seen in a few other Thames & Hudson publishings, but it still is a great read and summary of Guston's work. Anyone that loves his work, this is for sure a book worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music of Nat King Cole","review":"This Man's voice is smooth as silk and inspires warm comfortable loving feelings. This album brings back great memories and never fails to bring feelings of love and beauty into my day."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright in basic function, but no import facility","review":"Willpower is acceptable, as far as its function goes. It provides a scheme for detailing your assets, and a boilerplate Will and Last text. It's not clear, however, that the scheme couldn't be done comparably with a spreadsheet. In addition, the Will and Last text often needs editing, for the legal language is convoluted so it can be massaged by a computer program to handle the cases checked.However, Kiplinger provides NO UPGRADE from one year's Willpower to another, something which you'd think would be important as laws change. I was talked into buying a completely new version, which I did. Guess what: The new version has NO MEANS OF IMPORTING INFORMATION from the older version. That means you have to enter all your property all over again.The lack of a means of importing information is why I rated this at One Star. Otherwise it'd get a Three Stars.I'm on the hunt for a third-party conversions program. I may write one myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poorly Executed Product, but Lots of Potential","review":"Though the interview process goes smoothly, Willpower prompts me with an \\"unexpected error - please save and quit\\" when I complete the interview. Willpower will not accept a simple file name for saving my finished document, and worse, won't print. The only way I could print my finished will is to export it in RTF format. Kiplinger Technical Support acknowledges the problem as a Java conflict - but claims that since I can eventually print my document, I can't expect anything else. I'm running Willpower on a G4 iMac, using OS10.3.8 - the latest OS.In summary, Willpower gets the job done, but only with some crude workarounds to get it to print. And I cannot save any of my files once they are complete - it only lets me save if I quit midway through an interview. Willpower could be a very useful product if Kiplinger just finished the details on the development of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creates a will, quickly & inexpensively","review":"By using a question driven approach, WillPower lets you create a will quickly, with no learning curve. And at less than $30, it's a lot less expensive than a lawyer. I wanted a product that would let me create a will quickly and without a hassle and this product did that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking . . . Quicken Better","review":"This software is lacking when it comes to making a basic will. It doesn't allow options for giving property away to certain people in percentages if my children and spouse were not living at the time of my death. Also, it does keep giving me an error that erases what I just worked on for 15 minutes. And it doesn't let me edit the will via the wizard after completing the wizard. If you want to make changes, you have to read through the entire document to try and find where it was that you needed to change something. I have used the Quicken product in the past. And while the Quicken product is not perfect, it is better than this software.

Pelican hasn't always done right with their accessories with other video game systems before, but this system add on is a essential tool.

Oil was dripping from me, from the ceiling, on & into cabinets, the floor, between appliances, everywhere! It sprayed 8 feet in some directions.

No amount of steam cleaning, hot water washing could solve this issue. The idea is good, but this particular product did not last. Don't waste your money. I now pour a scant amount of oil in the pan and swish it around with a silicone brush. Of course, the oil doesn't absorb into the silicone so it's better to use than a hair brush.My recommendation is to save your money and take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item should start with a letter \\"j\\" for...","review":"Very excited to finally have and use a mister for the olive oil.

Th=e issue with these pumps is the basic mechanism is the same in all of them. They just aren't designed to last and the pump has to be replaced every 6 months to a year if you are using it regularly. this work so well though when they are working it'sw worth the investment.

During the book Tornado the dog can do card tricks and do some pretty exciting things. I liked this book because, for one thing, I love dogs. Also because I like watching and reading about tornados.

Presumably it was recorded at night-when British aircrews flew solo sorties (as opposed to the American formation-flying during the day) at intervals which, to judge by the ak-ak, were from 3 to 3-1/2 minutes. Whatever the case, this is a spectacular confluence of art and history with the Greater Berlin Rundfunk Orchestra playing as if their lives depended on it. Detractors of historic recordings can't fail to be impressed with the beauty and majesty of the second movement, a stirring, soulful melody which, if you were not acquainted with the horrors occuring inside Nazi Germany at the time, might make you wish you could help pass the ammunition."},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning, intense, war-time Emperor Concerto","review":"This is just about the most intense Beethoven \\"Emperor\\" Concerto on record, recorded in Berlin in 1944. Gieseking's playing is truly overpowering (in contrast, for example, to his 1951 recording with Karajan). The thoroughgoing organisation and emotional logic and intensity of the orchestral contribution leads one to imagine that Furtwangler is on the podium in the Beethoven as well as the Schumann. The Schumann has been issued before (DG, paired with Schumann's cello concerto), but is rather flawed. The stereo (!) sound on the Beethoven is superior to most recordings of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Handbook of Groundwater Engineering","review":"A very conscientious textbook.

The big metal tubing had some huge dents from shipping, and an important welded on support for decline was bent beyond use. The second I tried to bend it back, the weld just popped apart. The top part of the bench is so short my whole head hangs off the end when it is in the incline position, and I'm just under 6 foot tall. I would have returned it but it's just too much of a beast. And the instructions were horrible, almost as if for a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The equipment arrived before Christmas which was great, however after opening the poor packing there were items that were damaged, some of the metal frames were bent and the seat was torn, there was visible damage to the packing showing multiple tears in the packing. We were not at home and the package was left so had no chance to report concealed damage. I figured to start assembly of the equipment but found the instructions not very clear and everything was in multiple plastic bags so you had no idea what went with what. After locating a number of items I started and it took quite a while, I ended up with a number of items that I had no clue where they went. Was able to straighten out some of the bends in the metal, so looks okay.Do I contact Phoenix direct for the replacement seat as I do not want a ripped seat. Not a happy camper at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect Problems","review":"Received in packaged torns to bits, steel bars damaged, seat cushions damaged, oil leaked throughout package. Called Phoenix and they agreed to ship parts right away, but then got \\"delayed\\". Jeff - was very nice about it all. Eventually got the replacement parts in good condition. Still many problems when finishing assembly. Grips for different bars are hard plastic and just split into pieces when you try to put them on. Chest bench not at proper angle to remove bar to begin exercise correctly. All padding/seating super cheesy.

It's a very \\"told\\" story, not shown, lacking in convincing detail. It may well be an impressive accomplishment for a nineteen-year-old author, but that is not saying much. The first person narrator is a sheltered girl of fifteen to sixteen, and the narrative is predictably dull as a result of her naivete, and of the remove. It was a waste of time for me, perhaps interesting as a period piece. Not entirely without insight, but there are so many better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"there's better stuff out there","review":"I've always felt that Nick Waplingtons work is erratic and overrated.

I have to admit I haven't made too many of them. I plan to though! I made the \\"benevolent buckwheat pancakes\\" and they were oh-so yummy.What I meant by \\"confused\\" is to say that many of the ingrediants in the book I had never hear of!

When I went to the asian market I knew what and how to cook many of the items there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooty","review":"This book is gorgeous to browse through, with interesting typography, and beautiful photographs. The recipes are very complicated and almost always use ingredients that I don't recognize. For some reason it also bugs me that they refer to soy sauce as Shoyu all the time. I've made two recipes from this book. One was a marinated, crusted and baked tempeh recipe that was very underwhelming for all the work it involved. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you want to flip through a book to get hungry and put it up and get take out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and overrated.","review":"This book was all pretty pictures and pretty bland recipes.

The layout of the book is simply wonderful, from the clear list of ingredients to \\"loving preperation\\", \\"variations\\" and \\"serving suggestions\\". I always feel like I'm creating a very special meal or desert when I use this cookbook. One of the things that I most appreciate about vegan food is how beautiful the dishes often are and Vegan Fusion shows you how lovely meals can be.The Bliss of Krishna Tropical Rice Pudding is the most requested desert at our house and I love to make Dream Weaver's Live Pie Crust when the berries are ripe here in the Northwest and we're craving tarts. Actually, this crust is so delicious that you'll be tempted to eat it without a filling! Try Vital Ital Green Banana Omelet for a special bruinch. Don't miss the Tempeh Reuben! This book will NOT disappoint!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared to try it again","review":"I have tried a few recipies out of book and none of them were very good.

I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Of all the cookbooks I've used this is one of my top two favorites. I picked this up when I first became vegan and was a novice cook, and it made me into an accomplished chef for myself and my family! It's written so well, in an easy to follow manner and offers great tips (how to roast veggies, blanch veggies, etc), has a glossary for vegan terms, and nutritional information on different legumes, grains, and so on.I think I've cooked nearly 1/2 of the recipes and they're all delicious! I love the wealth and variety of recipes (from broccoli bisque to enchilada casserole to that's amore tofu cacciatore). Not only does it give you the recipes for the titled dishes but each recipe also includes 2-4 variations you can make on it, switching out vegetables, adding/mixing different spices to recreate the dish, etc.The recipes are healthy without being bland or inaccessible, and the pictures are gorgeous.

It transports you to some heavenly place with etheral beings singing and playing for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring game with horrendous controls","review":"If you love LONG segments of nothing but talking this game is for you. Half this game is you trying to extract the right info from people and only one tenth of what they have to say is useful. The rest is the standard \\"shooting the breeze\\" that game makers think creates \\"atmosphere\\". Gothic held some comic value for me as I started to see it not as an adventure game, but as a bizzare excersize in making boring people get to the point. This is a useful skill to develop in this world so I give Gothic an extra star.Why do game makers feel the irrational need to make you learn a completely different control system for every new game? Gothic is the worst in this example of this trend. Sure there's SOME key binding customization available--just not for the actions you actually want. Not only are you banned from binding actions to mouse buttons, but Xicat breaks new ground in game control idiocy by forcing you to hold down TWO(2) keys to do practically everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"best i have ever played","review":"gothic the original was the best game i ever played, and from what i hear gothic 2 is supposed to be ten times better than the first but if you are going to buy this game get the original gothic first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best RPG since Ultima7!","review":"Since 15 years I play computer RPG's.

Read the Story of Gothic first so you have a better idea of who you are as \\"Noname\\", and then practice the controls in the walkthrough a lot before you leave the path through the mines. I preferred the \\"alternate\\" WASD keybd setting, plus I enabled RControl to share the \\"action\\" of LControl. Gothic is the start of what I consider to be the best PC game series ever written. You will follow the quests of Noname through Gothic 2, Gothic 2: NOTR, Gothic 3, and the soon to be released Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods, which will take us to Gothic 4 which is about a year away. Believe me, it will take you a year to do this, but you will enjoy every minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bad one","review":"This was a poorly thought out game. There a numerous bugs, which have kept me from playing for more than a few minutes at a time. The company's tech support does not respond to e-mail, and judging by other reviews, I'm not the only one. The graphics are okay by mid 90's standards. The control interface is horrible. There are no patches. The gameplay itself seems okay, but it's not really worth the hassle. Buy something else, it will save you lots of frustration and show these game companies that they need to start producing quality products."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star says it all.","review":"The game is very, 'buggy', with cumbersome and illogical keyboard controls. I could not use the mouse effectively. Never could get the game to run correctly on a 1.6 GHz machine with 512 Mb of RAM and a 64 Mb GeForce4 Video Card. A Shame 'cause what little I could see looked very interesting. Game originated with some obsure programers in Europe. With this sort of effort they will no doubt remain obsure."},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE BUGS","review":"I just bought this game and I am extremely disappointed. The box recommends a Pentium III with 600Mhz and I am running a Pentium III with 800 Mhz along with all the other requirements, so I was completely prepared to run this game. I have installed many games on my computer and have never had a problem. But I installed it 3 times and could not get it to run right once. I therefore am going to return this game tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk","review":"The days of just anyone making a video game are gone.A good game requires more than graphics.

The chorus lumbers through the Kyrie with such depressing lethargy that all subtlety is lost. At other times everyone seems in a desparate hurry to finish in time for lunch. Apparently Herreweghe believes that finding the most appropriate tempo is a matter of averaging out extremes. There are some fine moments to be found here, but they cannot begin to compensate for the willfull eccentricty of the overall performance.Maestro Herregweghe's self-indulgence interpretation reminds me of those theatrical performances in which the director, anxious to leave his mark on another type of classic, straps six-shooters on Hamlet and relocates him to Texas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you want a mainstream B-minor","review":".. let me spell it out absolutely clearly. This is a very unorthodox B-minor, and your mileage may vary. For me, Herrewghe's approach was a betrayal of Bach's core musical values. There was no clarity, no precision, no striving for a perfect offering to Bach's God. The Bach who wrote The Well-tempered Clavier or The Art of Fugue could never be the author of this soft, fluid, approximately-tempered, more-or-less-in-key production. A brave experiment? Maybe, but in my opinion a decisive failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Ray out on her own","review":"While Ms Amy Ray is one half of the dynamic duo: The Indigo Girls do not expect an Indigo girls type recording. Ms Ray has stripped down to the bare rock basics of two guitars, bass and drums. She has recreated the great tradition of the garage band (think neil Young and Nirvanna). Not only that but the music and playing shows that she is having a really good time doing it! I saw her in washington, D.C. and she broke a string. normally not a problem she just hands the guitar to a techie and gets a new one to carry on. well, this time she told the audience to talk amongst yourselves while she went and got another string and replaced it on stage! I have not seen that since high school. That is a bare minimum tour and she rocked out! this recording truly captures the spirit and sound of the tour. What we heard is what is on this recording. I recommend this recording to anyone who remembers great live recordings such as the James Gang and The Who."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really grows on you","review":"The first time I popped \\"Whole Numbers Play the Basics\\" into my CD player, I was unimpressed. The album, although well composed and compiled, did not live up to its critical acclaim and didn't have the flow or setting that seemed to come so easily for the groups contemporaries like Boards of Canada and Squarepusher. However, for some unexplainable reason, I didn't take it out of my player for a long time, and found myself listening to it all the way through quite often. Now, I understand what the critics were raving about. CvJ's sophomore effort is really an acquired taste, but it is quite beautiful and fits well in the great conversation of electronic music. Definitely worth a listen, just listen more than once (or five times, for that matter)."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS DISC!","review":"Truly Awful is more like it. I love to hear bands' interestng interpretations of other artists' songs, no matter how wrong-headed. But this disc simply offers anonymous bands (whose names sound familiar but only because they are close to other band names - ie Kylie Minow as opposed to Minogue) who recreate, quite badly, Miss Madonna's songs. And, somehow, I was unfortunate enough to end up with a two-disc set of this dreck entitled \\"Strike the Pose.\\" This \\"Simply Blue\\" disc is the same as disc one of the set I bought. Instead of this garbage, try \\"Getting into the Grooves\\" on Vitamin and \\"Tranceformed\\" on Strictly Hype Records (both of which I purchased today in a real store(!) and which are quite good) for actual interpretations of Madonna's music which are worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRULY BLUE-TRULY BAD get it for its cheesiness","review":"WHen I bought this CD in one of our local music stores in Tupelo MS, I also came across TRANCEFORMED and GETTING INTO THE GROOVES, so with a wild hair and money to burn(very rare for me)I bought all three discs. TRULY BAD...I mean BLUE sounds like karaoke, where everybvody sounds like crap on a paper plate. VIRGIN VOICES has it's clunkers too, the chick from Missing Persons needs to sit down, she hasn't got her squeak anymore, but I digress. Anyway, I keep wanting to throw this disc out, BUT since it is Madonna's music, and our future generations need to know of her impact(so I'm into preserving history)this is a good example of how bad interpretations can be. So get it for it's cheesiness, and if these chicks can get recorded while doing a drunken karaoke YOU CAN TOO!!!!

For many of us who live or travel there when time and traffic allow there is this fine book to fill in the grey areas.Unfortunately, regional history is not as popular to most readers as a spy novel or biography. This book bounces between the author's journeys in Kayak along the islands and coastline and the chronological history of travellers and settlers to the coast. There are humorous accounts of indian encounters, misguided settlers and an all too unpleasant tale of life aboard the Mayflower. Not all as we had once been told in grammar school.The endnotes are substantial and the book can at times seem more academic than entertaining. However, I passed this on to two friends and we have laughed and shared our favorite stories over beverages. A good book and a nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasant read, misleading title","review":"This is very pleasant reading, although it isn't history. It is more of a meander along the coast of the Cape and Islands. Paul Theroux expressed it well in his review in the New York Times, calling this a work of \\"intelligent peculiarity,\\" and complaining that the history of the Cape and Islands that we are promised in the title, is never delivered in the text. What we get instead are Schneider's rather charming musings about topics like Pacific whaling and first encounters between Amerindians and Europeans. As Theroux points out, if someone actually wanted to understand the region, this book would, at best, provide a place to start. I enjoyed it, but on the whole I preferred Reflections in Bullough's Pond. Talk about misleading titles! What were they thinking to stick a word like 'Reflections' on a really fine book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"snooze","review":"I disagree with the previous reviewers on all points but one. Meander hardly does justice. Schneider's prose is enough to put anyone to sleep.

Benjamin Franklin stated that \\"we have a republic, if we can keep it.\\" We may not be able to keep it much longer with the thoughts that Bugliosi and the Flordia Supreme Court espouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a bunch of garbage","review":"Well, well, great to see Mr. Bugliosi writing his opinion and arguing how he feels. What a load of baloney, boy has this man put out his partisan agenda or what! Gee, I wonder who he voted for?? Come on, tell us Vince. Bush won fair and square and you liberals know it and need to take a hike and get on with your grey poupon lives. You can not keep counting the ballots until you get the result you like. This was not Vegas pinball but the real deal. I thank God up in the heavens that Al Gore was not president on 9/11. We would still be trying to figure out a response to those lunatics while having someone like Pee-Wee Herman as Secretary of State. I am very grateful for having a strong and resolute leader in the White House!! Long live America!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vincent Bugliosi has brain made of junks","review":"This book is a waste of woods. The Supreme Court Undermined the Constitution and Chose Our President? I think Vincent Bugliosi loves to choose presidents through false ballots. He loves to play the guessing game. Oops, I just poked a hole here and here and here, but who did the voter choose? I shall psionically communicate with voters to determine their intention! Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No response, what shall I do? Mini-mani-no... Never mind, count it as gore's."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can it be?","review":"The Supreme Court makes a ruling, the only possible constitutional ruling, which upholds the constant result of every \\"recount\\" and cites the equal protection clause, thereby protecting every American's right to equal protection under the law, including Mr. Bugliosi's. So how can making a ruling which does nothing more than maintain the status quo rather than overturning the election results based on counting a handful of spoiled ballots from three or four areas which are controlled by only one side while totally ignoring many, many more, and calling that \\"counting *all* the votes\\" be considered choosing the president?A simple analogy: If you have one hundred pennies and you grab some of them and count them out and come out with 10, do you have a dime? According to Al Gore and his supporters you would. All the Supreme Court did was to confirm that what you in fact have is not a dime, but a dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on!","review":"I couldn't put the book down. What can I say. No one at work would talk about what was going on, and Bugliosi said it all. And he said it all in simple, concise language. He has inspired me to consider a career as a Constitutional lawyer. Seriously. No longer does everything seem abstract like it was when the Florida controversy was happening and no one was addressing the true issue. Votes were not being counted. People's rights were being dismissed. And after it all, after the Bushman is put in place, suddenly the media releases info. that the Supreme Court had received hate mail and people had actually sent their voter registration cards to the Justices in protest!! Where was this news when it was happening? This book makes the case, clearly, concisely - everyone making War on Terrorists should be indicted for falsely impersonating an administration. That said, read this book. It was fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Jr Hi boy","review":"Like a Jr High boy, Bugliosi has the information but comes to the wrong conclusions.

The correct reasoning comes from Art. II, giving the state legislatures the unqualified right to specify how electors are chosen. Every count of the votes in Florida conducted at leisure long after the election was over has confirmed Bush's victory. The Democrats stole Missouri, by having a dead man and a nonvoter keep the polls open late, but Florida was not as easy to swing. Just as Mr. Bugliosi thinks Me. Clinton was unfairly treated when the Court let Paula Jones enjoy her righhts, now he wants to undermine Mr. Bush."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your Liberal and need more hand holding read it","review":"I am sure that if the tables were turned and Al Gore had won the presidency by the Supreme Court ruling that Mr. Bugliosi would not have written this book. But I am sure a conservative would have written it instead. Mr. Bugliosi, being a lawyer has a job of twisting the interpretation of laws even Constitutional in the favor of what he is after. I suppose he did a find job at that, but again it is his \\"opinion\\" a conservative lawyer might to do the same in the oposite direction.The point is this the Supreme Court made a ruling based in its interpretaion of Constitutional law, and since Mr. Bugliosi didn't like it he chose to lash out by writing this book.My suggestion is that if you are a Liberal you should read this book because it will make you feel good about being a liberal and help cement in your mind how Gore was cheated out of the presidency.If you are a Conservative you should read this book to understand how Liberal's look at Conservatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected Political SLant","review":"Anywhere along the way in the dispute surrounding Flordia, Vincent Bugliosi and Molly Irins openly stated their desire for Gore to win. Reading this book is nothing more than Bugliosi name calling, making claims about the justices that he can't back up, and trying to twist information for his own purposes. If you're a die-hard democrat, you'll love the book because it strokes you. If you are looking for a thought provoking book, look else where."},{"rating":"1","title":"FACT: Bush won every count.","review":"I love the old excuse: The butterfly ballot was too confusing! Blame your own voters' stupidity if you like, but it doesn't change the fact: Bush won every count. The only reason the Supreme Court got involved at all was because of the renegade FL Supreme Court, which illegally created NEW law in order to delay the recounts... which wouldn't have mattered in the end, anyway. Much ado about nothing, except the ignorance of this book's fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly biased and inaccurate statement","review":"This brief book is a polemic from a viewpoint that does not accept reality. First, the Supreme Court of the U.S. voted 7 to 2 to throw out the Florida Supreme Court's 4-3 decision to extend the recounts a second time, without setting any standards. The 5-4 vote was on whether there was any time left for the Florida Court to have a third try to get it right, after the U.S. Court twice by large margins (9-0 and 7-2) threw out the Florida Court's redrawing of state election law. I strongly recommend the book by Bill Sammon, At Any Cost, as the most objective reporting on the Florida election. He is a reporter who had covered Al Gore for a year before the election, he was in Florida for the entire dispute after the election, and he lays credit and blame on both sides wherever it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"political pandering to make a buck.What's new?!","review":"Let's cut all the pretenses, please. If Gore had won the election the republicans would have been the ones screaming bloody murder. Since Bush won however, it is the democrats who are whining. This is merely politics as usual. (...) The election had to be brought to a close at some point.The arguments presented in this book don't prove anything except how arbitrary the laws and statutes of this lawyer infested country really are. (...) This book is a way to cash in on politics just as another book by a republican schill claims it was the democrats who tried to hijack the election. (...) Don't waste your time or $ on this garbage-unless of course you are a die hard democrat and want all your own rhetoric and prejudices and disappointment over your puppet losing the election justified. Be better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, no cigar","review":"If you're looking for an account of what happened in the 2000 election don't bother reading this book. He leaves out hundreds of relevant details. On the other hand, if you're looking for an understanding of the legal ramifications of the election don't bother reading this book. One of my colleagues made the comment that he thought the author did a good job breaking down complicated legal matters into layman's terms. In so doing, however, he also changed the meaning and intention of the law.I am neither a Republican nor a big fan of George Bush. Being a political junkie I did follow very closely the entire minutia that transpired in November and December of 2000. This book adds little if anything to increase understanding. I did give this book one star because it is interesting to see how a person's political bias can be so powerful that it skews their interpretation of everything they see."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIAS!!!","review":"It is very clear that Mr. Vincent Bugliosi, is only concern with his political bias point of view.It also very clear, that he does not understand the Constitution of The United States, or the Supreme Court. After reading this light weight essay, I re-read the Constitution. I strongly suggest Mr.Bugliosi, to do the same.The arguments he presents to discredit one candidate, can equally be applied to his candidate. In the end, it's a mute point!The Betrayal of America, is actually found in booklets like this, completly politicaly motivated. What a shame!I only wish, I hadn't wasted my money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It all depends...","review":"I'd say that if you haven't already read the original article in The Nation, this book is an easy 5 stars. The original article was one of the most infuriating accounts of judicial corruption and complicity that I have ever read, and for that alone this book is worth buying. However, as the author admits, all of the extras in the book (an introduction by the author, a forward by Molly Ivans, some additional evidence, a more comprehensive review of certain points made in the original) were hastily thrown together. And Bugliosi makes such a damning case in the original, that the additional points he makes (most notably, the fact that the Bush campaign didn't have standing to sue for a violation of Equal Protection) seem trivial. In all honesty, I'd suggest simply buying a back issue of The Nation, or reading it off of the website. But, that's not to say that the book isn't a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"rayjo@alltel.net","review":"I have just finished reading the book Betrayal Of America byMr. Buglioso. it is the best book I have ever read,and I have read hundreds if not thousands of book.

It appears that the media no longer has real news coverage but rather a coverage of titillating who done it stories that have nothing to do with our lives. I pray to God everyone out there who reads this work buys 10 copies and sends them to everyone they know, and encourages them to do the same, because God knows the media will never say what the truth is.

If you are looking for a well documented and well researched scholarly treatment of this subject, you will not find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the thinest pancake has two sides!","review":"The author claims to have risen above self-interest in viewing the United State's Supreme Court's decision in the last presidential election. However, his highly emotional denigration of the justices while reiterating only the views of the Gore defense team fails to distinguish him from any other individual who feels helplessly wronged. Meritorious arguments in favor of Vice Prsiden Gore were, in my opinion, better presented by his legal team than by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weary in Seattle","review":"Skip it unless you're in need of another liberal afirmation.

FACT: The U.S. Supreme Court voted 7-2 that the recounts being done in Florida were unconstitutional. Justice Breyer (a liberal, appointed by President Clinton and a friend of Al Gore voted as one of the seven.) What was voted on 5-4 was the time frame for the recounts in the 4 largely democratic counties. It really irks me when an author prefers sensationalism over the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Rubbish!","review":"This book is rubbish. The central theme of the book is that because Al Gore did not win the election, fifty million Americans had their votes rendered void. Of course, as Bugliosi well knows, this is nonsense. To say that votes are void and meaningless simply because they are not cast for the eventual winner of the election is nonsensical. Therefore, Bugliosi labels the Supreme Court's decision treason based on its supposed effect of voiding fifty million votes, and he labels these votes as void because they were not cast for the eventual winner of the election. Under this sophmoric analysis, any decision the Court made would be treason, as any decision it rendered was sure to produce a winner or a loser, and would by definition render millions of votes void. This is of course, rubbish. Save your money, this book is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good politics, bad bad writing","review":"I don't need convincing that Gore won the election and that the Supremes acted out of politics more than jurisprudence. I was hoping to read a savage dismantling of the Court's decision. But, I found Bugliosi's book to be so badly written that it was close to unreadable. It's his article from The Nation padded with inflated forewords and extraneous end-notes. Bugliosi calls people he disagrees with names (e.g., \\"mutants\\") and writes with all the grace of someone phoning in to a rightwing call-in show. His arguments are mainly explosions of anger and frustration, berating anyone who might disagree with him rather than spelling out his ideas. Also, the triple mixed metaphors in a single sentence do a Tanya Harding on the language, if you know what I mean.I should have been a perfect reader for this book: I agree with his politics, I'm damn pissed at the Court, and I love passionate, partisan writing. But this book is just baaaaaad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but simply wrong...","review":"This is a well written and thought out crtique of the 2000 election mess, however it just happens to be wrong. After the election, several news organizations conducted their own impartial recounts and every one determined that Bush would have won the election had the Supreme Court allowed the selective recounts to continue. The authors obviously know about these recent recounts and chose to ignore them. The truth would ruin the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deal With It","review":"Wow, great analysis, waste of time.

In light of this it's hard to understand what all the histrionics are about. The Supreme Court did NOT chose the President, the voters did. Mr. Bugliosi likes to engage in hypothetical speculation, as in \\" Would they have ruled the same if Gore had been ahead?\\" Of course in that case the Florida Supremes would not have intervened, and it would never have made it's way to the US Supreme Court. If you're a fan of 'The Nation' this will be heady stuff. If you want a more objective account of the Florida mess, pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Joke","review":"What a crock!

Even now, long after the election, the multiple studies and recounts by newspapers of all political leanings show that indeed, in any case, even with recounts, Bush would have still won. While I'm Libertarian myself and wish a pox on both of the paries, I keep this book as an example of the growing emotional hysteria of the Democratic party, which now greatly exceeds the Republican party. In short, a good book to find disgust in - disgust at Democratic hysterical tactics. I ESPECIALLY liked how the US Supreme Court telling FL to follow its own laws provoked so much Democratic anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"Just another Liberal trying to make a buc off an unfortunate situation.

But the swing votes came from questionable ballots - is it a vote if 2 corners are punched out? Three? The instructions to the voters at the booth said it must be completely punched out. And is a butterfly ballot clear?The Democratic campaign sought to recount these ballots, over and over, until they received the outcome that they wanted. The Supreme Court put a stop to this - and the election was decided by the voters at the last good recount. This was a wise decision - if the election showed Bush won twice and Gore won once, who is the President?To indict the voting system is fair.

(I have the original one with the oldies as the soundtrack.) It is a good workout and if you just had a baby you will be out of breath during it, so you know you are getting something out of it.. The only problems I had with it are ONE: alot of the things she does are grapevine and such and im not from that era and was having to learn the steps.. I was ok with most of them but there is one part of the video that I resort to jumping jacks because no matter what I do I cant figure out how to do what she is doing.. TWO: as one of the previous reviewers stated... she doesnt use enough verbal commands when changing positions especially when they are doing the strengthening.

The only saving grace to this video were the leg/butt and ab moves at the near the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the safest and not even 20 minutes of aerobics!","review":"The worst thing about this video is that the claim of 20 minutes of aerobics is false. There are only 3 5-minute aerobics segments. And, as some of the other reviewers mentioned, this video is not the best for safety. There are a lot of poor cues. Denise does a lot of twisting-type moves that I didn't think were necessary (so I left them out) and my knees are still killing from the parts I did do. Most of the aerobics moves seem more dance-oriented than necessary to get your body working. There is a TON of bouncing and jump-twisting and even when she does establish a \\"routine\\", she doesn't always stay with the counts. You know it's bad when even the people working out with her are getting screwed up. Even so, this video does get my heart going, but only after I make a ton of modifications, and now my knees are hurt, so I won't be doing it any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrribly unsafe, not a good idea","review":"this video is very unsafe....Austin is risky with the bouncy dance moves and i think you need to ease back into fitness, more like a Leisa Hart FITMAMA Postnatal workout.

You can't expect to learn the entire routine in one take, though. It is broken out into a warm up, the workout, a cool-down, and floor exercises. What I noticed is the workout is broken down into 3 mini workouts, the first few minutes is pretty low-key and easy, then she picks up the pace a bit for the second piece and picks it up a bit more again. So if you are just beginning, it is easy to stop and fast-forward to the floor exercises until you are strong enough to do the entire workout. I think it is a pretty good set-up. The only thing I have to say I don't like about it is that the cool down happens a bit abrubtly; not enough time to bring the heart rate down. Overall, I would recommend it :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be a dancer...","review":"The ab work on this video was good but the aeorbic workout left me making up my own moves just to keep moving during the 20 minutes. Although I believe this tape would help people get into shape I am greatly disappointed in a few things:1. You had to be well coordinated and a dancer to be able to do the steps.2. Being that it is targeting post partum women, coordination and quickly moving from one thing to the next is not something that is easy. I felt that she did not target the 80% but only the 20%.In comparison to the video by Becky Cortez, this video left me wanting the basics instead of the cute dance steps. I will stick to Becky and Gin Miller videos to get me back in shape ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too dancey","review":"Well, I can't dance at all, so I was totally lost in this video.

It should work in women who are very familiar with aerobic excercise because if you CAN follow the routine you are going to lose weight and tone your body.I bought a rebounder and a video with rebound excercises and that's a marvelous excercise, and also have other benefits. The best of all is that this excersise makes you lose a lot of weight with NO pain at all.

As my wife and I were on major highways it was nice to ask her what was at a particular exit and be prepared to get off.

I'd rather use an outdated Exit Authority, than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Next Exit isn't eXitSource book","review":"I purchased the Next Exit book thinking is was an update to the eXitSource book I have currently. I was disappointed. It does not follow the freeways through the states as eXitSource does. It is much easier to follow the Interstate than to locate each individual interstate while switching through the states. I also used the Next Exit while traveling through Utah and found that the exit numbers were incorrect and information was incomplete. I was very disappointed with the Next Exit. They should take a look at eXitSource and follow the format they use.

I think it's terrible for our use: we travel cross-country, and since this is not set up to follow interstates, we have to keep flipping to the states as we enter them and relocate our position in the book. It's probably okay if you only travel within a particular state, but as noted by others, there are too many errors to list. Traveling in an RV with a towed vehicle, we don't have the luxury of saying \\"oops, this is wrong, let's just back up and turn around.\\" Sure wish we could find the Exit Authority again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't Michael write this book a year ago?","review":"This book is great! I could not figure how to add international support to any of my VB applications, and the help files were useless.

But just before my review, I was able to waltz into his office, show him the book, and prove to him that a lot of people have this problem, and show him I had the solution. I like best that Michael (or does he prefer \\"michka\\"?) actually gave me a lot of answers to all the questions that my boss asked me.The one thing I want to know is why didn't he write this book a year ago?

There is NO consistent organization, NO clear explanations. The author assumes that the reader already knows everything. The code in the book doesn't work.

I managed to get it used, but as far as I'm concerned [money] was still too much to pay given the potential of the subject. I agree with some of the user reviews I've read about editing. Kaplan suffers from Stephen-King-itis, i.e., made a name for himself as a guru and apparently believes he's above editing and each word is golden. I agree with another review about it being a good visual title on the shelf, it's just too bad it lacks specific detail and workable code samples so you can be sure he actually knows what he's talking about. (Yes, he does often know what he's talking about, but if you weren't familiar with his reputation, it wouldn't be proven by this book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought Used For $6.

It suffers from the lack of good, solid editing. He rambles over some points and glosses over others. I can only recommend it to people who already have a slightly better than basic understanding of the material. This isn't a book a novice or hobbyists could learn from without a great deal of effort.

Here the writers reveal their personal struggles and successes with meditation. Such personal accounts are apparently rare in that those learning meditation are encouraged not to discuss their experiences.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about the practice of Buddhist meditation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect gift","review":"This book is the perfect gift - for an historian studying the intellectual history of the ancient Near East from a Feminist point of view.

I am currently doing a research paper on the possiblities of Mother Goddess worship in ancient times and this book has been very helpful. What makes this book different from a lot that I have read on the subject is that she shows many different sides to the topics she brings up.

My friends have stated that the mystery and role playing aspects in this module led to intense discussions regarding moral choices and decisions.Unlike a dungeon crawl, this module is a bit more openended after the party eventually arrives to the village, and as the DM, it provided me with some opportunities to spur thought about exactly what the group was really accomplishing. Since my group never follows the delineated path anyhow, and muck around with things unforeseen by module creators, this was the type of storyline that allowed them to excel at their craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a whole lot to it","review":"I ran this adventure as a DM.

Lovely dessert.Cons:(1) The bar gets smaller and smaller, while the price stays the same - as other reviewers have pointed out. It's almost half the original size now.(2) I consider it an unethical business practice to mail out products with an expiration date in 2 months, and fail to disclaim this piece of critical information in the description. The vendor should not sell nearly-expired products like this!(3) Please note that there are many ARTIFICIAL COLORINGS used in this product, and there is PALM OIL used.

I'll have to find something else before these bars are shrunk to \\"fun-size!\\"If Nature Valley would have just kicked the price up 10% I probably wouldn't have cared.

Since these are all 'no name bands' I was hoping for an 'alternative approach' to these Abba classics. But to my disapointment, all these artists try to copy the original Abba sound and arrangement - and they fail horribly.I guess the good thing is, that this proves, how brilliant the guys in Abba were. These two CDs are absolutely unnecessary. They sound like your below-average hotel lounge band, trying to imitate the originals, using a $ 100.00 Casio keyboard and a midi drum computer.Buying these CDs, no matter at what price, is simply a waste of money !"},{"rating":"2","title":"so you don't forget me","review":"Para que no me Olvides is a touching film about love, life, loss and relationships.

Los Vaqueros. Duo Dinamico did it again! I know there are other artists on the album but really it's the Wisin y Yandel show.The big hits - Pegao, Nadie Como Tu (with Don Omar), Yo Te Quiero, Quiero Hacerto Amor (on the special edition only)... HUGE!And then the hits by the other guys like Tony Dize with Quizas. Plus you also get Por El Telefono (with Hector el Father) which is a killer track too.This album was so consistent.

I cannot and would not recommend this particular game to anyone who has not already made the big mistake of purchasing it in the first place. It is tedious in the mechanics of switching back and forth between the keyboard and joystick controls and (I don't care what anyone may say about how wonderful mulling through an exhaustive array of written verbage associated with the instruction manual is) the game is hardly worth the investment of time and energy.

So, when it was time to merge, imagine my surprise when one of the members from the other tribe was somebody they had voted out back in the second round.

Many times when groups of yester year reunite the magic is gone. Not so with Culture Club. \\"Don't Mind If I Do,\\" is one of their best albums. Content wise, it is right up there with Kissing to Be Clever. My favorite song on the album is the reggae inspired, \\"I Want To Be Loved.\\" This is a great song. Other singles from this album include the reggae inspired \\"Your Kisses Are Charity,\\" and another song named \\"Cold Shoulder.\\" It's beyond me to guess why this album wasn't released in the states but if you get a chance, check out this album.

It will help business leaders understand why they should incorporate XML into their information structures now to be ready for the future.

A \\"sequel\\" of this video for developers already familiar with XML would be most welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful introduction to XML","review":"This video does an excellent job of explaining the evolution of SGML to XML with clear example of how they relate to HTML. In addition this video provides senior managers with a wake up call about the importance of properly using XML to provide the maximum international portability of their information. As the calendar hit 01-01-00 we clearly entered into an age where we'll see an explosion of multipurposed information available on virtually any platform.

That being said, however, there will definitely be some who are disappointed (these are the people who say that the Foo Fighters \\"sold out\\"). Most of the songs, with the notable exceptions of \\"Stacked Actors\\" and \\"Breakout\\" are slightly mellow, with great, memorable lyrics. The two songs I mentioned are more traditional Foo Fighters material. This is my favorite CD right now (right next to Fuel). \\"Aurora\\" kind of touches me personally...but enough of that...buy this CD!

Not that aggression is everything, but it WAS one of the high points of the Foo Fighters. A one-word summary is definitely, \\"Pretty\\". The changes between verses and choruses flow together ever so effortlessly, and the harmonies want to make you hold someone's hand. Would someone pass the vomit bag please? Just to let you know, I am a Foo Fighters fan. This has been a thorough disappointment. There is only one explanation for this, Dave Grohl must have lost his copy of \\"Mob Rules\\" during the writing of this album. Hopefully he'll buy another copy, I'm sure with the commercial success of this album he'll be able to afford it.

One song cannot save an album, and apparently, even Dave Grohl can't save this one.

I bought this CD on the strength of \\"Learn To Fly\\", and \\"Stacked Actors\\" . They really blew me away with the latter tracks raw, edgy sound. Yet \\"Learn To Fly\\" has this sweet catchy feel. On the first day I bought this CD I couldn't get past \\"Aurora\\". I recently read a interview with Dave Grohl who when asked \\"What song are you most proud of on this record ?\\" he replied \\"Aurora\\". And I can see why ! This CD is strong all the way through with \\"Gimme Stitches\\", \\"Generator\\" , \\"Headwires\\" and \\"Ain't It The Life\\" making this CD one great ride ! Although, it's not as angry as their previous albums it's a progression that will lead to a greater audience without losing it's identity and uniqueness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air.","review":"Having been dissapointed with the recent crop of rock albums, I bought this one with reservations. I do agree that the album is not as good as \\"The Color and the Shape\\", but I was pleasantly surprised at this offering. The Foo Fighters are still very solid rockers, and they haven't lost their knack for those memorable ballads. I love the way Dave Grohl can sing sentimental songs without drowning you in overly sappy pop(Can anyone say Goo?) While repeated listenings have begun to dull my instant affection for the album (the hooks are a little too repetitive) I still think this is a very solid offering and is well worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good progression","review":"I do like the new Foo record, but it lacks the power of the first power rock release and the Beatle-esque Colour and Shape. The songs are more melodic and this sounds like the Foo are maturing musically and as adults, as if it was \\"soul searching\\" music. Grohl and Co. did just fine this time...at least they haven't jumped on the techno bandwagon like some bands...hint hint (well known Chicago band) I recommend this release to even the casual Foo fan. It also sounds like good \\"road\\" music. Pick it up soon...disappointment will not be had, unless you're a Limp or ICP fan...you'll mature one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely as good as the first two albums","review":"Once again Dave Grohl and the Foos have delivered the perfect combination of rock and pop - songs with hard edges and swoony melodies. It's like they took the mood and feel of songs like \\"February Stars\\" and \\"Everlong\\" from Colour and the Shape and based a whole album around them - and yet, this isn't just a rehashing - there are new elements here. Grohl simply writes the best songs in modern rock. The arrangements don't seem to be as intricate this time around, but the guitars are loud and crunchy, the percussion is infectious, and oh, those choruses! If you loved the first two Foo albums, you will probably love this one. Early favorites are \\"Generator\\", \\"Aurora\\", and \\"Ain't It the Life\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"better and better every time","review":"This cd is a little better than \\"the color and the shape.\\" The songs in it are a lot more catchy and it is easy to tell that they really worked on this one. The music video is also on the cd, which I thought was pretty cool. Go buy this bad boy. you won't reget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"we are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams","review":"Ilo ved the last two albums, and There is Nothing Left to Lose did not disappoint me at all. It's a great album filled with emotion. I'm not quite sure what happened to our old buddy David since the last album, but it definately helped with his creativity. He was already very talented, and he took what I would expect of him, and multiplied it to make yet another great album, even better than the first two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever evolving.....","review":"One thing that I've noticed about the reviews is that fans either love it or hate it. I for one, love it. Having it play in the background while I worked I was compeled to stop and replay every track. Songs like \\"Stacked Actors\\", \\"Learn to Fly\\", \\"Gimme Stitches\\", and the hypnotic \\"M.I.A\\" are each unique and carry their own energy. Well written, well produced, and mine will be well played. In a genre that has many acts fearful of spreading their \\"musical wings\\", its good to see a group take on a challenge. Makes you wonder if those groups that never change are the sell outs playing for the almighty dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"If you are new to the world of the Foo Fighters and were raised in the 1970's, you will love this album. This is old fashioned rock with drums, bass and guitar. Dave doesn't need to waste his time - our yours - with leads or for that matter harmony vocals. Sonically, it is a giant with the bass drum and the bass dominating the rhythm. The guitars are subtle, distorted and contain just enough reverb/delay to cut through the mix. The vocals and melodies are with few exceptions excellent and reminiscient of the Beatles and Eagles with a good dose of punk to keep an edge. If you think all the \\"new\\" music is rap and (...), buy this and you'll change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Third Is Superb","review":"This has got to got to be the most commercial album to date. Most of the album is radio friendly, yet it still contains that raw edge that the Foo Fighters have always had. Containing the hit singles Learning To Fly, Generator, Next Year and breakout. This being their third album has proven that a group who dont really sell by the bucket load are one of the best groups around. (see also Foo Fighters and The Colour And The Shape)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ain't it the life!","review":"This cd is amazing. Every song is good. And the second half of the cd gets even better than the first. I love the mellow songs like Next Year, Ain't it the Life, and M.I.A. Reminds me of Pavement, which is a VERY GOOD THING. And it was amazing how it included the video with the cd. My computer is TERRIBLE and the video ran smoothly. Learn to Fly is an excellent song and the video is funny and creative just like all of theirs. The Foos know how to make videos. Does anyone know if Dave directed it like he did for My Hero? Hmm.....well.....yeah....GO FOOS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Foo Fighters have done it again...","review":"I was a fan of their first two albums from the continued grunge of the first album to the straight-up guitar rock of Colour and the Shape. To accurately yet simply define the sound produced on this CD, it has the rock/pop sound of Colour... and the angry grunge feel of the first one. Learn to Fly may be the best song they have ever done, as well as Stacked Actors, Generator, M.I.A. and Aurora. Some of the songs harken back to Nevermind in terms of pop rock. But the rest of the songs distinguish themselves WAY apart from Nirvana. The sound is awesome and the production is spiffy. Overall, one of the best CD's of the 90's and, without a doubt, the best rock album of the year. Brilliant! Dave Grohl has done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"All that a true Foo Fighter fan could hope for","review":"This album has all types of sounds and i love it... everyone should buy this record"},{"rating":"2","title":"foo's do it again","review":"this is the best foo fighters album ever put out. i've loved the foos since their first album, and they just keep getting better.

I just have to say that this album totally rocks. The first time I ever heard STACKED ACTORS I was hooked. It's absolutely fabulous. The FOO FIGHTERS are AWESOME! I first bought There is nothing left to lose because of Learn to Fly, but everything else on the ablum totally backs it up. Oh, and the new single, Breakdown is one of my favs. Not only does it rock but there's a story behind it. I'd give this ablum more stars if it were possible. Trust me, they deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly a waste of my twelve dollars","review":"all I can say is that this is the most dissapointing album that I have bought in a long time. Sure it is a decent album, but nothing more. The colour and the shape was one hundred times better. The songs sound like Dave, Taylor, and Nate just kinda sat down and wrote something that was forty five minutes long. It sounds like someone took their first album and put a flanger on half the songs and rereleased it. Maybe Nate shouldn't have left Sunny Day Real Estate after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"If you'd like to get a Foo Fighters disc, get \\"Colour and the Shape\\" - one of the best discs of the 90s. Unfortunately there isn't a song on their latest disc that's as good as anything on \\"Colour.\\" This late 1999 release got one play on my CD player, and then was put into the CD rack, afterwhich I went back to listening to \\"Everlong,\\" \\"My Hero,\\" and the remainder of \\"Colour.\\" This is not a terrible disc, just not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not receive","review":"wish I could post a reveiw, but I never received my order and I had no reply from the seller"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too popish and not enough rock","review":"Some songs were alright.

Kauf Dir nicht die CD. Die Colour and Shape war genial. Eine meiner Lieblingscds. Aber die hier ist Müll.

The first two cuts are vintage Foo and rock, but after that, it's a snoozer. Mainstream MTV adicts will love this, but rockers look elsewhere, namely the Hellacopters, Unida, and High on Fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Dave, you're a drummer, live with it.

I expected the foo fighters to keep rocking, but they let me down...bigtime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Foo Fighters","review":"I am ashamed of myself! The first few listens of this CD I was disappointed. I loved the colour and the shape and I was expecting more of the same I guess. I didn't think much of the first single learn to fly either as it was a bit too cute and cuddly for the FF. But after regular listens the whole CD grew on me. Stacked Actors is the best FF song to date, it has such a rough and raw feel to it. Breakout it is a lot like the older stuff, so this one hit me instantly. The slower songs such as aurora, aint it the life, next year and MIA fit in perfectly with the tougher stuff. Generator and Gimme Stitches are like nothing the FF have ever done before and now I realise this is why it is such an awesome album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it--it was Better Than Pizza.","review":"First of all, \\"Generator\\" equals good; it has a dandy little intro-thingy that sounds both good and nice. \\"Learn to Fly\\" is nice also; it reminds me of when I was President during World War II. \\"Next Year\\" on the other hand, reminded me of all the times I tried to staple two or more pieces of paper together--with a stapler. I guess the point of all this is that this album is very good and deserves buying. Also, it should be noted that I like pizza. Thank you for your time, and good luck reading more reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS","review":"There are not many cd's I can just pop in and let play from start to finish (except maybe greatest hits) but this is one I can. All the songs are very melodic, have a nice edge to them and keep the listener interested. My favorites? \\"Stacked Actors, Breakout, Learn To Fly, Gimme Stiches, and Next Year\\". This is the best Foo Fighters cd yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for anyone who buys CD's","review":"This album is very deep and thorough. Every song eventually grows on you until you crave it. I love the lighter approach there taking while keeping Dave's airy harmonies right on track. It's just a incredible rock record. Period. Dave Grohl is a genius who can write very listenable songs without sacrificing any creativity. I can't stand Nirvana but I love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listening to it on and on and on and on...","review":"This album, as has already been pointed out, is excellent. It's the kind of music you listen too when you're depressed, and then you feel really good again. It's music you can easily absorb. It flows into your brain and makes everything seem better. It's the kind of music you simply have to hum whaen feeling good. It's like non-chemical prozac.Hmm, maybe i have exxagerated my daily dose...I'm getting all excited...Maybe a bit of Aurora will calm me down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foo Rools","review":"I cant believe this one is even better than the Colour and The Shape. Every song is awesome and catchy with potential to be as big as Learn To Fly. Aurora is by far their best song ever. I agree with the person that said if you dont like Foo dont smear this page with your review bringing the foo down. I like bands like 311, Creed, Limp Bizkit, Pearl Jam, Oleander, and I love this. So if you like any of these bands Foo is for Yoo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new fan of the Foo Fighters","review":"My first exposure to the Foo Fighters was the song \\"Learn to Fly\\" and I am hooked. I bought the album and am impressed with their talent and style . I am looking forward to getting previous recordings and to future releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I've liked the Foo Fighters since their first album. I heard \\"Learn to Fly\\" on the radio and loved it. It had a good pace and great lyrics. The whole album is great. All the songs are catchy and Dave Grohls vocals are outstanding. I recommend this album to anyone who likes music that move you. Their are sad songs and fun songs. The video for \\"Learn to Fly\\" on the enhanced part is hilarious. I'd give it six stars if I could. buy it, you won't despair."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Foo Fighters gain a new fan","review":"I like the way the songs sound on this album with their mix of alternative, pop, and rock. STACKED ACTORS and BREAKOUT start the album off well, but most of the songs lack their own unique sound which i think would have made it better. I like the Foo's new pop-infused sound, which shows the most in GENERATOR and LEARN TO FLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Not?","review":"Dave Ghrol is true to himself. If this is the direction he is going in , more power to him. You can't be pigeon-holed in to one type of sound, if you are a true musician. This guy could play the banjo with his toes and I would still appreciate him. He sticks to his guns. It's also an added plus that Chris Shifflet aka \\" Jake Jackson \\" is playing guitar now. Keep on churning them out, I'll listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected change","review":"This CD is definately a departure from the previous 2. It is agood CD and still is obviously Foo, but it is more popish than theprevious 2. The 1st five songs are undeniably the best on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It might not blow you away, but there are some good songs","review":"This is an interesting album. The direction of the band has changed slightly, and with it the album is more well-rounded than the others. \\"Breakout\\", \\"Learn to Fly\\", \\"Gimme Stitches\\", \\"Generator\\", \\"Aurora\\", and \\"Headwires\\" are generally good songs. New drummer Taylor has filled Dave Grohl's shoes amazingly well. In short, with better songs towardthe end, this album could have been absolutely great. Instead, it will have to settle for being pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it several times befor judging...","review":"When I listen to this album the first time, I didn't enjoy it, in fact it collected dust for some time. However, after listening to it at a later date, I discovered what most reveiwers have been saying -- this is an AWESOME cd -- easily one of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foo Fighter There is Nothing left to lose","review":"This is an amazing cd. I also own the first cd by the foo fighters, and this one is better. Every song on the cd is good, and can be played straight through. Despite what some of the other reviews I have read have said, I think that the Foo Fighters are a better and different band from Nirvana. This is a good rock cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"The energy is missing.","review":"I was hoping for the energy of their last album. Unfortunately, that energy is gone. Many mellow tunes, but frankly, the music is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well... Let's see...","review":"Regardless as to whether this is a Foo Fighters CD or a George Winston CD or whatever, it just isn't a very good album. I give Dave, Taylor and Nate one star for their effort on changing their sound. It sounds like Dave had a great time making this album, and I'm glad that he did. Unfortuneately, the songs to me feel like they lack conviction and sincerity, something the first two Foo albums overlowed with. Everlong, February Stars, I'll stick around, Exhausted! I do feel that this album is much more radio friendly, and I think it will do well amongst the masses. The songs just don't feel powerful to me. Something personal was lost. But listen to it for yourself, don't take my word for it. If you don't have any foo fighters albums, don't buy this one first. Buy the self-titled. Then the Color and the Shape. Then you will see why this album falls short. Dave set the bar pretty high with the last two."},{"rating":"2","title":"FORGET NIRVANA","review":"DAVID GROHL'S BAND FOO FIGHTERS IS A BETTER LISTEN THEN HIS OLD OVERRATED BAND NIRVANA.

It ends up being an average,decent-but-nothing-special record, that still is better than most of the stuff on the radio. Most of the songs here are alright and amusing, however they lack complexity and sound too poppy and predictable, never leaving familiar ground. It isn\`t too risky or innovative, even if some moments, like \\"Generator\\", are worth a listen. All in all, \\"There Is Nothing Left To Lose\\" is another presentable rock album with a few nice songs and a lot of filler material. It could have been worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN - Easy Listening Rock","review":"It seems Dave Grohl is trying to become the Gerry Raferty, Gordon Lightfoot for the new millenium.

This is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generator","review":"When I first bought this cd, I thought it was gonna be like thier debut album. It's not. See, I had only heard the \\"Learn to Fly\\" song off it, which is probabaly one of the best songs on the LP, so I thought the rest of the cd was gonna be like that one song. They're not.But in my mind, the first song \\"Stacked Actors,\\" was hilarious, thoughtful & one of my faves. \\"Breakout,\\" Gimme Stitches,\\" & \\"Learn to Fly\\" are all the other good ones. The rest 'pretty' much [aren't very good]. {I'm trying to be honest here.} It's not Nirvana and it's not early FF. Instead it's a catchy, mellow, & experimental.

Next up is the number one hit Learn To Fly, a song most remembered for its funny music video featuring Grohl in three different roles on board an airplane. The cool songs keep on coming with Gimme Stitches, Generator, Aurora, Next Year and Ain't It The Life.In their ten years of making music together, There Is Nothing Left To Lose is by far their finest moment.Track picks:Stacked ActorsBreakoutLearn To FlyGimme StitchesGeneratorAuroraNext YearRecommendedA-"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Album to end the Millennium","review":"This Album is different and not as good as \\"The Colour And The Shape\\" because it's more slow and acoustic but it's still an awesome CD and the most mellow Foo Fighters album. 7 out of the 11 songs are a perfect 10 out of 10. The First 5 tracks rock. Tracks 6-11 are more relaxing and calm, they're tracks to rest too unlike the first 5 tracks where you could probably mosh too except the Grammy and VMA award winning \\"Learn To Fly,\\" you could do both.

One morning, while waiting to go to school, I caught \\"Learning to Fly\\" on tv, and was in awe by the song. I almost completely missed the comedy-filled video; I was so entranced by Dave's amazing vocals and guitar. At this time, I had no knowledge of Nirvana, so I didn't even know how musically talented he really was (knowing vocals, drums and guitar).I bought this album soon afterward, and it has become one of the mainstays in my musical collection ever since, even years later. The atmosphere of the album is what makes it so breathtaking, and ironically, I listen to it most on long late-night flights, where it mellows me out and puts me to sleep. It is relaxing and mature, and superb. This is what defined Dave Grohl to me, and what a perfect record to do it with."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is pretty cool","review":"This cd is better than I thought it would be when I got it. I didn't know anything about the foo fighters when I bought it, I only knew they're hit song \\"Learn to fly\\" but when I listned to it , it was really good. The day I got it, I almost listned to the whole cd twice. I loved it! My favorite songs on the foo fighters cd are \\"Stacked actors\\", \\"learn to fly\\" and \\"generator\\". Mostly all the songs are different so you wont get bored very quick. It's defenitly worth ur money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of the year, and instant classic","review":"This is one of the most well written albums ever created. The people who claim it isn't as good as the previous 'foo fighter' albums must not be listening close enough. It is a flawless return to the simplicities of rock music. Every track, whether it is a wonderful melody or a highly impressive drum line, has some great element to it. It is undoubtedly the best album of the year, and for that matter, the last couple of years. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave and Co. keep the Rock Alive!","review":"From the first seconds of their third album, the Foo Fighters send the listener into a rock extravaganza. From the brutal riff and great guitar solo, \\"Stacked Actors\\" starts the album solid. \\"Breakout\\" keeps everything rolling with Dave screaming into the outro. There is also the single/anthem \\"Learn to Fly\\", talkbox return in \\"Generator\\", and the rock out build up in \\"Aurora\\". However, I found myself going back to listen to the last four songs on the album. They are a little lighter to listen to but offer up some of the strongest Foo songs to date. Overall the band sounds tight. The rhythm section keeps it raw, and Dave's voice is golden as always. Fans of earlier Foo records and some Sunny Day Real Estate will no doubt enjoy this beautiful noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best album yet!","review":"This album is great. All the songs are really catchy, but not in a pop sort of way. \\"Learn to Fly\\" and \\"Stacked Actors\\" are both painfully good songs and I constantly find myself singing them. Buy this CD if you know what's good for you. Even those who aren't huge Foo Fans will love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had my expectations of this shoved down my trap so far....","review":"I must admit that I thought that Dave Grohl had bled the stone dry with the previous 2 records, which were great, especially the 1st album and thought that this was going to be a stale commercial version of before, and while it certainly is commercial (EVERY track could be released as a single and still do well), it's all done with emotion, style and attitude at the same time. I tend to judge albums by the vibe and feel of them and this record has a similar feel to the debut, if slightly less grungy (shhh)which quite frankly was a very pleasant surprise. I cannot stop listening to the damn record. Perfect pop music and one fine example of how to write songs with a familiar formula and make them sound fresh. Just get it, all right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Good as \\"The Colous and Shape\\",but still good","review":"I am a huge Foo fan.Upon first listen to this album,i wasn't pleased.I gave it a few more spins and realized i liked it alot more,its just one of those albums you've gotta listen to a few times.Definetely a change,yet very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice.","review":"I've listened to the disc over and over. As a huge foo fan, I had to get it within the first hours of release. There first disc was a masterpiece. I say this ranks second. It takes time to grow on you but it's a good buy. The first six songs are excellent. \\"Stacked Actors\\" sets the stage with its intense crunchy riffs which gets you hooked to listen to it over and over. Great performers and a recommended buy. A very cool band. Go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm ever so dissapointed.","review":"The FF's were easily my favorite alternative or modern rock band or whatever before this album. But not anymore; something went terribly wrong.For my money, Live-In Skin is the best cut on the album, although a lot of people seem to think it's the worst. I call those people stupid. But anywho, Gimme Stitches is also a good song; Stacked Actors, Breakout, and Generator are decent, although Stacked Actors plays like a song that was written to be hard, which I don't like.As much as I hate to say it, I think that the Foos have taken a turn for the worse. Maybe it's because Pat Smear left. Maybe it's because they wrote all the songs for TINLTL in the studio. Maybe it's because on the first two albums, Dave Grohl actually did the drumming. Maybe my tastes have changed. Maybe I had a total frontal lobotomy yesterday.

Many times the author would list a website that seemed interesting and I would try to go to it only to get the \\"page not found\\" message. Second, the book is stuffed with \\"lists\\" of useless information that seem to be put there to take up space rather than to be of any use to the reader. Third, much of the book is writen by \\"guest authors\\" each of whom have a product to sell (their book, their newsletter, their service, etc.) and their articles are shamelessly self-promotional. When we're not reading guest articles, the author herself gives us a hard sell on her other publishing services, books, etc. You feel like you're just reading a never ending series of commercials!

It is such a fond possession few things come close. I usually use Martin bronze strings. They can get bell-like tones when desired. The Elixir strings have a good sound. They are a little thinner than what most might call medium, but they sound very good. Though thinner sounding than the sound of the top Martin' strings I normally buy. The softer sounding Martin's are my goal, and these are not that. As far as how long they'll last, I'd forget to review if they last 3 times longer than I keep my Martins. Call these a light medium and you're right on target. But expecting a more bronze sound has me wanting the Martins. I would surely buy these again, as they are fun to play. but will have to have that bronze sound on this guitar again, at some time. .

I just couldn't enjoy the book.There are a lot of great medical memoirs, if you are looking for a good read about what it's like to become a doctor. For people interested in pediatrics, Dr. Meghan Weir'sBetween Expectations: Lessons from a Pediatric Residencyis a worthwhile read.

I do not need the wireless capabilities, but I opted for it for future expansion.I find that the print server is flakey in my setup. Half the time, the printer cannot be found on the network. To fix this, I have to unplug and replug the power cable. This seems to reset everything and I'll be able to print a few things before it happens again.Note that this is using the simplest of all possible network setups -- static IP address through ethernet, and I still have problems!I have been hoping that Linksys would fix the quirks and release a new firmware, but since it's been over a year, I suspect any future Linksys support is unlikely."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCOMPATIBLE WITH MULTIFUNCTION PRINTERS","review":"This product is impossible to install with multifunction printers like the HP PSC series.

First problem, which customer service could not figure out, is that I needed a cross over cable for the ad-hoc setup. No mention in quick or long version manual either.

Be warned that the unit only provides for WEP encryption; if you use the much better WPA encryption you are out of luck.If the unit should happen to lose power (e.g. the power switch is flipped, bad weather, whatever) the unit will need to be reset to the factory defaults, plugged into the network, and re-configured. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, terrible product","review":"Linksys had the idea.

I guess if you're lucky enough to have a printer that they support (there is no list, you just have to be lucky in the one you buy), then its a great product. Never even made it to checking out the wireless connection. I can't believe that Cisco/Linksys would let a product out that was this bad.

I tried this thing first with an HP multifunction printer, no luck, tech support, no luck, tinkered, got it to function with problems.

I also highly recommend JumpStart Preschool.My daughter is at the young end of the recommended age group, so maybe she will grow into it more. For 3 yr olds, I recommend staying away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Windows ME users!!!","review":"I purchased this game at Toys\\"R\\"Us and I installed it on my PC, it ran fine but when I went on-line the first time after the installation I could not get to any secure sites.

I had so much fun following this DVD Icouldn't stop smiling!!! Dolphina is a beautifulteacher with a charming, quirky personality thatmakes you feel good about learning. I adore thisDVD for the pure and simple pleasure of the oldstyle burlesque instruction provided.As for anyone seeking a belly dance DVD thetitle clearly states 'Cardio Burlesque' and imuncertain why one would be expecting to find abelly dance instructional. It is what it says itis, Burlesque! 98% of my instructional DVDs arebelly dance DVDs and I would have certainly beendisapointed if this DVD would have been bellydance and not burlesque. I like to change thingsup a bit from time to time and this was definatlya great investment for doing just that. Dolphinahas many belly dance DVDs which are all great soread the titles and you'll know what you will bein for. This one is just good old fashion fun!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good!!","review":"Luckily I borrowed this Dvd from the Library. Its dull and it doesnt bring up your heart rate. I believe this dvd is just to show you the basics of Burlesque. It is definitely not a workout. Do not waste your money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this DVD!","review":"This was the most fun I have had in a long time! I was looking for a departure from my usual belly dance DVDs and this was perfect. Dolphina is of course gorgeous but who knew she was so funny as well? As a fairly conservative person, I hesitated at buying this (felt a little silly...), but I was glad I did. I don't know that it is much of a physical workout but I did not buy it for that reason. It gave me a needed attitude adjustment so it was well worth the price. I think it would be great to do as a girls' night activity or for a bridal shower. Tons of fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I just got this on DVD today and watched some of it. It is okay, but Dolphina is irritating! Her little attitude sermons make me want to rip every hair out of her head. She reminds me of some airheaded, rich, snot nosed brat at certain points in the DVD. I'll have to try to workout to this DVD and see if it's worth my time. Personally, I like The S Factor series with Sheila Kelley and Carmen Electra's Fit to Strip series much better. If you want a sensual moves and a workout that works, go with the S Factor. I've gotten the most developed core and thighs by using that workout and my flexibility has increased as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste!!!!","review":"This was a complete waste of money. I'm not sure I would call her a belly dancer based on this dvd. She doesn't look like she knows what she's doing. Her performance is a joke.

Now, she's what you call a bellydancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"CARDIO???","review":"THIS IS BORING & I DON'T CARE FOR THE MUSIC,I WAS HOPING IT WOULD HAVE HADSLOW,SEXY BELLYDANCE MUSIC BUT INSTEAD IT HAS MUSIC THAT NOBODY EVEN LISTENS TO THESE DAYS.

While my lower back & knees are a little too tender right now to make it through the whole thing, I do what I can. I can't wait until I'm healthy enough to do it from start to finish because this is such a fun workout. Dolphina's moves & tongue-in-cheek commentary keep you smiling while you work out. This isn't a hard-core workout, but it's one that targets your tummy, hips, & thighs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a cardio workout","review":"This DVD is very slow-moving and despite the word \\"cardio\\" in the title, you will not get any sort of cardio workout. You don't actually learn much of anything from this DVD either - I was pretty disappointed. I felt like an idiot doing some of the stuff too. The instructor isn't very good at cueing although she is at least pleasant. I also own the Carmen Electra Aerobic Striptease DVDs and those are much more fun and you actually get a halfway decent workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Workout","review":"I bought this hoping to give my workouts a change and it has been that.

You have to know what you're getting your self into. It's good for a core workout, as it works your midsection and hips. I don't think it should be considered a cardio workout though. It is easy to follow, which is nice. This DVD could definitely be used by beginners (as I am one). I would use this in conjunction with your regular work out.The music. VERY slow and bland. Dolphia can be annoying with her pronunciations and performance. I gave it 4/5 for the fact that I would use this again. Just to work the core muscles and midsection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Goddess Workout","review":"The shipper is fine, got the DVD quickly. The DVD itself is boring.

I do a lot of dancing and have a collection of work outs on DVD. This is one I wish I could return. I didn't break a sweat unfortunately. The actual performance the instructor gives is pretty bad. It's like she wasn't even listening to the music or going to a beat of any kind. It was cute, but definitely not sexy.

The demarcation relates not only the class of customer, but also to the Aussies (Mrs Williams, Fay and Miss Baines, Patty) in Cocktail Frocks and the very Continental Magda in Evening Frocks. Enter Lesley/Lisa, a naive young thing doing a short stint during the holidays after completing her Leaving Certificate.We learn a little of their private lives and aspirations, and the attitudes of the time (especially how men and women relate to each other, and the education of women) are spot on.If you didn't live through this era, this book will make you feel as though you did.

Edward Norton and Jessica Biel have no chemistry whatsoever due to Jessica's lack of talent, which in turn, makes Edward look hammy and over-doing it.And really, was no one expecting the end? Did anyone really believe Jessica's character was really dead? I also don't think writers really allowed the childhood friendship-crush pan out so the rest of the movie is rather forced and predictable. I have great respect for Edward Norton and would watch anything he's in but sometimes, even his accent was questionable. The romance is painfully, and sadly comical but the technical point in which the film was shot is beautiful. If not for Biel's ability to ruin every movie she's in, and if the plot was panned out more evenly, I think this film would have been better. But for the most, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Illusionist","review":"Excellent movie, Edward Norton is excellent in this movie.

Had that feel of watching a show in Vegas where you know there are tricks behind the scenes but it takes some help to discover them. It immerses you on the plot, making it very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but Prestige was a little better...","review":"Enough has been said about the plot and I don't deny that the movie was quite good, definitely worthy of a viewing and of the four out of five stars rating. Jessica Biel, who has never been more than a pretty face even did a great job. However, Prestige came out within months of the Illusionist, both set in a similar time period and centered around a magician, but somehow I feel that Prestige was the better movie. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Scarlett Johansson had amazing performances to go with an incredible story. If you enjoyed this movie, I'm sure you'll love the Prestige."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, amazing","review":"I rented this at Blockbuster the other night and all I have to say that this is an amazing movie. Check out Prestige too which in my opinion is even better. This movie really had my brain thinking hard near the ending and after it. It has an interesting plot and his magic tricks are interesting. You have to watch this...a great movie that will give your mind a whirl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie... I had heard nothing about it nor seen any trailers for it. From the first scene, I was a bit sceptical but I was quickly drawn in. Ed Norton's Eisenheim was brilliant and the illusions were amazing. The love he had for Sophie (Jessica Biel) was heart warming, this love he carried for her since they were kids.I was so caught up in the story that I didn't even see the end coming.

Of course the critics hated it but when have they ever agreed with the general public? There are two movies out about Magic these days and the other is the Prestige. Both the Illusionist and the Prestige were awesome in their own way. The Illusionist had an awesome plot and the magic was very unique. I can;t give away too much here but one of the tricks in the movie makes you feel stupid, especially when they show how it's done. As they always say, always expect the obvious and well, that trick was tooooo obvious. One of the best movies I have seen in a while; romance, intrigue, plot and great Illusions. i cannot see how anyone would not like this flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Mesmerizing","review":"Nothing is as it seems here and throughout this movie, based on a masterful story, you are never sure whether Herr Eisenheim has truly developed supernatural powers or whether what he is doing is merely an illusion. Regardless of what may be the case, what he is doing has a tremendous impact and influence upon the minds and lives of people around him - winning the heart of a woman from a higher social class and affecting the life of the son of the emperor. Not only does he accomplish what those around him would consider impossible for a man of his social standing, but he does it with exquisite elegance. The movie is such a feast for my eyes, that I've watched it several times. Edward Norton is fabulous in the role of Herr Eisenheim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trickery as a polished art","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, maybe more so because it seemed such an understated story, but still with a strong balanced cast, inspiring settings and exceptional cinematography. The Illusionist is a motion picture work of art, and the sense I got from the filmmaker and cast was that they were purposefully aware in the way the presentation was made.Even if the ending was in my sights before the story concluded, the way it was concluded was so tasteful and still with some surprise that it made me smile, just as the Inspector did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"This is the kind of movie you might want to watch it a few times to see how could've you missed the signs the first time.

I really enjoyed it and is the kind of motion picture that I could watch over and over again, and never get tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Spoiler*","review":"This movie ends like the Sixth Sense. One can say the movie has two endings. The first ending, when Paul Giamatti finds out he also cannot touch Edward Norton, was very good. It would mean that Edward Norton himself was a ghost, sort of like Bruce Willis finding out he too is a ghost in the Sixth Sense. The second ending in which Paul Giamatti has a series of revelations (shown to us using flashbacks) was a bit too much for me, as it seemed too eager to end on a Hollywood-style high note."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" ARTFULLY DONE \\"","review":"AS ALL THE REVIEWERS HAVE STATED, THIS IS THE TURN OF THE CENTURY VIENNA .

This childhood love did not feel deep enough to carry over all those years, and while Jessica Biel may be good to look at, she just isn't a great performer. I also did not care for any other actor except for Edward Norton whose performance was just ok. The acting and directing were just weak than other performances that I have seen and there was no chemisty between Edward and Jessica. The ending was ridiculos and overdone as well was the acting of the evil prince. The only nice thing about this movie was the scenery, not for an hours view on screen though. If you want to see an excellent movie about magic rent the prestige. Edward better get a new agent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time...","review":"This movie was a sad retaliation to The Prestige. The acting was decent but the story was worthless. It jumped around constantly and pent up all of the secrets until right at the very end when they precede to dump all of the explanations on you in a matter of mere seconds.

In reality, he has participated in a couple of good movies the rest have been forgetable. The Illusionist, however, is just BAD, a WASTE of MONEY. Jessica Biel, oh goodness, she is part of the new homogenized young Hollywood without depth, soul, sincerity, or conviction. She was barely good enough on TV and the big screen only highlights her shortcommings. Her accent? ridiculous. She is not a period actress, this would require actual skills which she does not possess. The story is bad as well.There is no character development. The editing is horrible.

Do not WASTE MONEY or TIME on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is fine - download quality - very poor","review":"This quality of this movie download is awful - small screen -big screen - just gawdawful.

The Illusionist can bring forth holograms of people, but you hardly get an idea of how he is working to get that result. The film is playing on the principle: Does he have any special ability or is he an illusionist? But without having anything concrete about any of those.At the end of the film, the policeman gets a \\"sight\\", almost like in Usual Suspects, which explains to you in two minutes, how it was done.By this time, you would probably have guessed it and it is a wonder how the policeman gets all these hints from nowhere. Why and how he put all the things together at this precise moment is the only mystery of this movie.Two stars because of the special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Usual Suspects in a Magic Show......","review":"I generally like Ed Nortons work and look forward to his new films.

The love of the two main charecters seemed a bit rushed ,it should have been developed a bit more. The magician, Norton, really had some great illusions and tricks, the orange tree was incredible. Towards the end you begin to find out that he is not supernatural, but a genius at the top of his game. I thought the twist in the end was a bit telegraphed. Overall I gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars it was an enjoyable 2 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT The Prestige, Thankfuly","review":"I am tired of hearing folks whining about this being a rip off of The Prestige, A film I was not that enthused over.I Enjoyed this film immensely Edward Norton is subdued but powerful, Paul Giamatti as always excellent.Jessica Biel was somewhat wooden but there is little she could do with what she had, and Rufus Sewell was extremely hateable and nasty in his role as Crown Prince Leopold. The Photography was splendid, slightly dark as fits the mood of the film, and a fine soundtrack to boot. I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The finest of Illusions","review":"The story weaves its way through the essence of deception and illusion, asking central quesions regarding justice, ethics and our view of how both fit together to serve our individual needs.

The film is well-paced, beautifully photographed and, while the outcome may be obvious to some, the conclusion remains satisfying and thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I normally don't purchase movies.

I'd say the screenplay & storyline are fairly original to this movie as well. So many movies out there today are remakes of older films or so similar to other films that have been made, which makes \\"The Illusionist\\" refreshing. It is also refreshing to watch a movie that isn't based on using excessive violence, foul language, sex/nudity, or the same old silly slapstick that has become the norm for so many movies today.The acting, costuming, and cinematography are also great in this movie too. \\"The Illusionist\\" is a well-rounded, must see movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable but still compelling.","review":"One of the nice things about a strong cast is that they can hold your attention even after you've realized what's coming. \\"The Illusionist\\" is a film saved by it's cast, all of whom are excellent. The story's resolution becomes obvious almost as soon as the conflict is established, however. Nevertheless, the acting and imagery created by the scenery and special effects creates a compelling vision of the fairly straightforward storyline. Good musical score, too. I recommend it as a date flick, although it is a little dark and quasi-spiritual (not a 1st date flick). Not an outstanding movie, yet worth an evening or slow afternoon, especially as an alternative to romantic comedies or some other type of relationship movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so magical !!!!","review":"I had nothing but high hopes for this movie.

Somehow this elegant period piece was much more enchanting than the thrillers and horror flicks that came streaming in from all directions. Edward Norton's fine performance and a fine supporting cast are greatly enhanced by the period sets and costumes all lit and styled with great taste..

Edward Norton is incredible as usual. A lot of people have been comparing this to The Prestige since both were released around the same time and are about illusionists, but that's about it.

The Crown Prince Leopold, played by Sewell, is offended by Eisenheim because of his sudden appeal to the masses, and particularly to his wife to be Sophie, played by Biehl, who happens to be Eisenheim's childhood darling and current love interest. Leopold hires Police Cheif Uhl, played to perfection by Giamatti, to pursue Eisenheim and destroy his legacy.The film is filled with stunning visual effects, as well as many plot twists and surprises along the way.The best thing about the film, however, is the performance of the entire cast, particularly Norton and Giamatti who could easily recieve Oscar nods.RecommendedB+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, suspense, some action, and a good love story.","review":"Eisenheim is a magician played by Edward Norton who after years of travling the world after leaving home (vienna) in his youth, comes back to re-solidify his place in society. He also runs back across his old childhood sweatheart, a duchess named Sophie played by jessica beal. However she is set to be engaged to Crown Prince Leopold, future ruler of the Austria-Hungarian Empire. Set in a pseudo-historical setting of Vienna around the WWI times, this plays out evenly with a few twists and turns, but overall a very sound storyline. It has Romance, suspense, and enough action to keep most guys and gals happy. Pick this up, rent it, buy it, worth watching several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good mystery, but I felt ripped off in the last 5 minutes!","review":"The mystery in this movie was excellent at holding my attention.

Great acting, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Mystery","review":"You can not actually solve the mystery in this movie. It is one of those movies that presents a problem but there is no way to actually solve it. It's like one of those Scooby-Doo episodes where the monsters end up being real, which in my opinion, ruins Scooby-Doo. Not cool. Get the Prestige instead. If you have money to buy this movie, don't.

I enjoyed the story and the acting was fine although not oscar worthy and Jessica Biel's lips have clearly been enhanced since i saw her last. Whilst intruiging and well shot this film tries for a big reveal at the end to surprise its audience and surprise it does. I won't reveal what exactly happens however i walked away quite angry. The reason for this is anyone whom has watched the events of the film closely will know that the ending is impossible and completely inane. I also find any film that reveals it's secrets in a short, rapidly cut flashback style montage very lazy filmmaking. Silent Hill also suffered this same problem. How so many people can rave about this being a true masterpiece astounds me. Can't anyone else notice the absurdity of it's twist? The real illusion here people is that so many can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"D-U-L-L","review":"Slowly paced and monotonous, this film didn't hold my interest. The only positive things about it were the convincing period clothing, the cinematography, and the acting. Unfortunately, I couldn't have cared less about the story and the twist at the end came much too late for the movie to redeem itself. Finally, if anyone watching couldn't figure out what was going to happen in Eisenstein's last perforamance, then they weren't paying attention. Miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING IN ALL RESPECTS!!!","review":"This movie is absolutely beautiful. I am not even going to go on about Edward Norton's performance-he is my favorite actor anyway ever since the \\"Primar Fear\\". I was pleasantly surprised how a fresh-faced teen Jessica Biel gave such a solid performance of an aristocratic lady. She has done an amazing job. Paul Giamatti's character offers an excellent glimpse into a soul that is divided between his open loyalty to the crown prince and his secret admiration for Eisenheim. Rufus Sewell does a mean, mean job of portraying the prince, you cannot help but hate the bastard, another great job. When the movie was over, I was speechless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)","review":"A young boy falls in love with a girl that is way above his social standards along with the art of magic.

She fell in love with another man, the Crown Prince. The two got engaged but the boy, Eisenheim, finally meets back up with the girl and uses his powers to free her from the royal house in Vienna. This movie is stunning in many aspects. Visually in terms of locations, inside and out, there was great consistency and a nothing seemed strained. The story weaved fluidly through these locations and seemed to make the locales a vital part of the story. Ed Norton and Jessica Biel are superb. The story is fresh and imaginative, very intriguing.

Was I ever shocked how well he played this period piece. Makeup, scenes and locations were all perfect. Beautiful romantic story with twists and turns going around constantly to keep your interest. The music is haunting and I have found myself keeping this DVD running on the TV even when not in the room. I have watched it over and over. Many have compared this movie to The Prestige, which is impossible to do. As that movie was a same Period Piece but a Sci-Fi movie. The Illusionist, even though it was still about the world of illusion, are still totally different movies. I have watched The Illusionist over 30 times.

They are forcibly separated. Destined to meet again in the future as Edward Norton and Jessica Biel, their actions may have an effect of the future history of Europe.I guess as an audience we are jaded with the onslaught of ghost stories and \\"seeing dead people\\" that the story and outcome is pretty much predictable, not that anyone took too much effort to hide. At least a fact or a butler did not pop out of the closet at the last minute.However the presentation was excellent with the film having a slight flicker gives a hand cranked quality to it. The story is told in third person by Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti.) The music that accompanies the film was by Philip Glass.

But why there are the subtitles and the special features on the DVD disc only? If you have hearing problems and want to watch the film with subtitles or if you want to hear comments you need to switch from the Blu-ray to the DVD.

Hopefully nomitated for some awards","review":"I missed this film in the theaters, but now the chance has arrived on DVD, and it was good. Ed Norton does a solid job in his role as Eisenheim the illusionist, but Paul Giamatti is great, and should earn an oscar nomination again. A fictional story taking place in turn of 20th the Century Austria, Giamatti in the role of city chief inspector narrates a film about Eisenheim, an illusionist in vienna making big noise with his spectacular illusions. It even gets the attention of Prince Leopold, and more importantly, his soon to be fiancee (Jessica Biel). I don't want to spoil the movie, but history is layed out and certain paths have crossed before, and then the movie becomes a bunch of smoke and mirrors, Is anything what it seems? A good movie for the collection, great original story. A good mystery, and even a little romance.

It arrived to an APO address overseas in a most incredible amount of time. Everything must have just worked. When I first found out the dvd was for sale I confused this movie with The Prestige. After watching it, I enjoyed it quite a bit, and even if my wife and I never watch it again, it was worth the price. The addition of the dvd along with the bluray was something I did not know when originally purchasing this item.There is only one small detail I wish would be changed, and that would be adding special features to the bluray itself. As it is, there is just the feature presentation on the bluray, and the standard def version and extras on the dvd. With the amount of storage space and compression algorithms available in blurays, simply adding a few features wouldn't kill it, and would make this a 5 star.I'd definitely recommend at any price below $12 or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for women only!","review":"This is a great movie in every way. My adult son watched it with me and enjoyed it. I won't tell you how it ends, but there is a twist that we've grown to expect from Ed Norton.

The CD cover only lists 16 of them. \\"Never Be Mine\\", \\"Moments of Pleasure\\", \\"Under the Ivy\\" are the last three tracks, and they are some of the best. The vocalist, Jemma Price, covers many of the songs in a more acoustic style than Kate does. She does a wonderful, nearly perfect version of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" that I like nearly as much as Kate's, and much better than when Pat Benatar covered the same song. The only complaint I have about the CD is that there are no liner notes at all, just a track listing on the other side of the cover. This isn't Kate Bush, but it does give you an excuse to buy more copies of her songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Agree","review":"I completely agree with the review below. I love Kate Bush with a passion and I was floored that Jemma Price had such a similar voice. She has really made this tribute album SHINE with her stunning voice, and has made a much better effort her than with her Bjork and Tori Amos tribute albums (sorry Jemma, but shoppers you will be sorrowfully disappointed with the Bjork tribute album and her tribute to Tori Amos is nearly as bad--I had to get rid of it as I couldn't stop cringing).

I love KB but I'm trying to figure out the \\"moral justification\\" for this release. It is merely a good singer trying to \\"hit\\" Kate's notes lick for lick.

Imagine a mystery being solved by cute talking animals and the wonderful Miss Beatrix Potter herself, and you have the main theme of this series. Potter is featured as herself, the children's-book writer who has purchased a farm in the Lake District of England in the time from 1906 to 1913. A more idyllic setting could not be conjured from Miss Potter's imagination - green hills and valleys, blue cloudless summer skies, sheep in the meadows and little brooks running down the hillsides, and a quaint village named Near Sawrey. The cast of animals talk to each other, not to the humans, although Miss Potter appears to almost hear them.

I was hooked, I found book #2 at the public library, the rest are not available in the library or on Kindle. If they were offered on Kindle they would cost about $3.00, I would spend that money for this series but not the cost of the book and shipping. The books are so small by the time I read all in this series I will have invested about $900.00 dollars. Each book is very small about the length of a chapter. I really enjoy his books but I am finished the cost is not justifiable. I would have rated it a 5 star but by the time I pay for the book, there are over 50 in this series and shipping I am investing a lot of money, so they are not worth the cost or a 5 rating. I have bought #4, 5 and 6 and that is the end. I will have over $50.00 invested in these small books and that is enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Write More!!!!!!","review":"The storyline and basic attractions of this book have already been discussed above.

We did get a brief glimpse of Anthony's feelings in the first few pages of the book but after those few pages we are robbed of how he feels...only Fleur provides interpretation of his actions and words. To me that was the first disappointment.The second disappointment is that Anthony and Fleur's \\"love\\" (and I use it very loosely) is based on Anthony's fascination and obsession with the image of Fleur while she was married to her first husband. He claims that he fell in love with her on sight. The love is empty, the \\"body\\" of the story is weak because there is no rhyme or reason for the development of Anthony's love from obsession to hatred to \\"love\\".I feel that this book and premise had a lot of promise. The writing was beautiful but overall the love story fell flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stockholm Syndrome","review":"I've never hated a fictional character so much as Lord Anthony.

I am going for my Bachelors in Information Technology so I am some what of a tech freak and I have been starting my son on the computer early. I didn't want a game that was just fun but also very educational and that helps children start out on getting comfortable with a computer. This game blew all other programs out of the water! My son loves it and started getting comfortable using the mouse two days after we started using it! The animations and games are also very attractive for children as well as educational(i.e. numbers, matching, ABCs, music, sing-a-longs). I liked it so much I just bought two more as birthday gifts for two friends who have children turning 2.I highly recommend this program if you want to get your child started using a computer early, which is a good idea in today's world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars!

I love seeing anything shot in Louisiana. The story and the acting are what brought this movie way down... It's kind of like growing up and being told that two wrongs don't make a right. Accent is everything and too many times I thought to myself wow, that doesn't sound right. Having read other reviews, I realize this may go against the grain, but I can't ever reccomend this movie to a friend if I would want them to see southern Louisiana or a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who proofread this book before it went to print?","review":"This book sounded interesting, but unfortunately, the abstract story went right over the head of my 5-year old nephew, and the \\"pictures\\" (stylized black & white photographs of objects not obviously related to the story line) were confusing to him.The worst thing was when we got to the last page of this very short book, there, in large black print, was a glaring typographical error. (The word \\"strangest\\" was spelled \\"stangest.\\") My guess is that all of the copies from this print run have the same error.... gave this book 2 stars because despite its flaws, it has a unique style that may appeal to someone out there. So give the book a try, if you like, but I personally would recommend trying a different book. There are so many other great books to choose... and most of them have all the words spelled correctly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I was expecting the book to detail good exercises for abs and proper posture. While the book does list some exercises, most of them are ridiculus. For example, \\"have a friend sit on your back when you do pushups\\" or \\"using abs to throw a tantrum. Vigorously flail your arms and legs up and down\\". The idea behind using abs for everyday living is a good one, but the book is poorly written. I am in the exercise science field (B.S., M.S., and currently a Ph.D. candidate) and did see the author present at a national meeting. I was disappointed with her presentation and should have known not to buy the book. The author has some good points about proper posture and eliminating the forward head posture, however, she does not provide information on how to change these effectively. Most of the exercises in the book are ackward, silly, or dangerous...such as \\"jump around in the pushup position like a flat jumping spider\\". Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Real Backpack","review":"I did not realize that this was a toy and not a real backpack.

Most of the disc has a good groove to it, and has alot of organ throughout. Some tracks dancy, some trippy. It simultaneously sounds retro and modern, and is good thing just to put on and enjoy. They also have a \\"best of\\" called \\"Melting pot\\", you may want to try that out. Either disc should fit well between your \\"Happy Mondays\\" and \\"Stone Roses\\" cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Charlatans album ever","review":"This album never gets old, even 18 years later. This is the true Manchester sound for that time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 80s","review":"After hearing 'The Only One I Know' on internet radio I came here to buy the album. I was confused at the date amazon gives as 1998 release since i couldve sworn i'd listened to this album a number of times in my highschool girlfriends bedroom. After a little research my thoughts were correct as this album came out in 1990. So i called up some friends and asked around to see if anyone i knew had the album. why buy it? instead i'll check out Melting Pot or Wonderland.What i enjoy about this album is the way its a perfect ending to the 80s sound. Alot like listening to an Echo and the Bunnymen album but without the horrible nostalgia of 7th grade science experiments. The whole album has a wonderful 60s vibe to it with influences from groups such as the Byrds. Its a nice album to listen to while driving through the country with the top down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"A one star rating is an overstatement of the value of this book. I believe the 15 hours is the time the author spent learning the language.It is not of value to beginning or experienced programmers. It does not serve well as either a review or an introduction. The examples are poorly chosen, (banking account), poorly explained. The other examples are lacking in clarity.Even when something that one knows well from other languages, such as the difference between ++i and i++ is mentioned - it is a mention without an example in a loop or a clear explanation.Look elsewhere to get started in C++. 15 hours would be too long to spend with this book.

The description of the movie does not tell the whole story. There is much more to the story line that is very interesting. There's a lot of tension and a few bloody scenes, mainly dead sheep. Dorothy is a \\"gifted\\" young girl who many believe is under demonic control. A doctor comes to comes to her home after a disturbing incident Dorothy has while babysitting. The doctor believes Dorothy has multiple personalities. This is when the story really takes shape and draws you in. What is really Dorothy's gift??? You will have to watch the movie to find out.

With its perfectly unsettling mix of various (yet original) elements from THE EXORCIST, THE WICKER MAN, WAKE WOOD, and SYBIL, DM should be a supernatural classic. The interplay between Jane (Carice van Houten) and Dorothy (Jenn Murray) make the building horror absolutely believable, and make up the core of this dark gem.

This book gave me several days of good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"I thought that the book would have the full beginning of Bat Out Of Hell but it is shortened straight down to the start of the song.

I came across this book for a term paper in a class titled the Global Flows of Cultural Heritage. Not only is this a interest-grabbing-can't-put-it-down story, but the issues of value, ownership, world museums and the influence of public oppinion are deeply scored and very relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not emo, just goodness","review":"I am slightly embarrassed that i heard about this band when i was a Bright Eyes fan, but they are very good. They dont try to overly impress anybody with fancy guitar solos, they focus primarily on lyrics, and they do a great job with them. They have a very distinct style that i am drawn to because of its emotion, but not to the point where it is annoying. Their simple and pretty melodies put the listen in the perfect state to recieve their lyrics at the right frame of mind. And surprisingly, every thing sounds sweet, like the tone was set just right when recording, its truely beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah..........","review":"After forcing myself through just one listening, I find nothingmemorable worth noting here.

It will not suffice for the fulltime user. If you try to split something that is simply too much for it, it might break - like mine did.

When Amazon listed the splitter at $222 plus freight ($95 because the splitter weighs 154 lbs.) I had to give it a chance. The assembly takes about 30 minutes or so, nothing really difficult. Then it was time to head to the wood pile. I used the splitter on seasoned and fairly green wood (8\\" to 12\\" in diameter) and it handled everything. On pieces of wood that are right at 20\\" the splitter may not completely split so a little manual may be needed, but nothing strenuous. So far, I'm really happy with this splitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful King's Singers Hit","review":"Even though it's a short album, it's still jam-packed with quality, as is to be expected from the King's Singers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh??

Fela is incredibly underrated, and unlike any other artist. Part Ellington, part Louis Armstrong, part Bob Marley--all soul. The man's music comes through as a brilliant example of genreless masterpieces. It isn't African-world music, it isn't jazz, it isn't an early dissendant of hip-hop...no, it is all of those things. Anyone with any appreciation for any kind of music must own this. It is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a BAAAAAAD Man!!","review":"I have been listening to Mr Kuti's music for years. If anyone has any doubts whatsoever about world music, this is a great place to start!! From slower tempos to faster beats, no matter what track it is, I am jamming, jamming, jamming!! What I also like about his music is that there are messages to be learned. Even though I am in the USA, when I listen to some of his lyrics it's like I am traveled to the plight in his day and time. I know that he wrote most ofthe songs 30+ years ago on a totally different continent, I can identify with many of the lyrics today.All I have left to say is that I have (unintentionally) converted several friends and family members who got hooked from me listening to it. I used my others disks so much that they became scratched beyond recognition. I was NOT satisfied until I went and bought another dual set.

However, as an introduction to Fela, you can't go far wrong with this- songs such as Lady, Water (he no get enemy), Zombie, and my personal favourite (though no doubt many will disagree with me) Gentleman are simply sublime examples of this type of music- the songs generally start with a simple riff, for example on a saxophone, and are driven along by a pumping bass. After building you up to a state of high excitement, Fela's (usually witty/cutting) vocals come in, delivered in his magnificent bass tones. Absolutely fantastic. However, as mentioned above, if you've got the time and the money, don't get this album- get the individual albums, which all seem to be coming out in remastered form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seemingly Undiscovered in the US","review":"Fela is a legend in Africa for his music and his political stances.If you are a fan of soul, rap, funk, jazz, reggae or any other African/African-American music, then Fela is one that will raise the quality of your collection like a Bob, a Jimi, a Trane, a James.His band is as tight as James Brown's.His lyrics are as powerful as Chuck D's.His music is as inspiring as Trane's and Marley's."},{"rating":"2","title":"fela rediscovered","review":"this fela CD has opened my eyes to fela. now i'm yearning for more. oh God, another addiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but flimsy","review":"This glass looks pretty, but the upper edges are extremely thin and prone to easily crack.

Some of the plates in this book,, notably 'D' showing a chieftain in a chariot beign followed by a pack of curious local children and dogs, are simply spectacular.If you are looking for a good Osprey-style intro to the warriors of the proud, disparate tribes of Gaul and Britannia, try Stephen Allen's 'Celtic Warrior 300 BC - AD 100', it is better-researched, has more material, and the artwork is almost as good. But, if you are a devoted fan of Angus McBride, buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great art; bad text","review":"Not particuarly good. I'd recommend Celtic Warriors (by Time Newark) or nearly any book by Peter Berresford Ellis, if you can get ahold of them. The saving grace, however, is in the artwork. Angus McBride is certainly talented, and people should check out his other works.As for the text, there is not much too it. The classifications of helmets was good, but the history seems to come entirely from pro-Roman sources, such as Caeser. It therefore contains a large number of mistakes about Celtic civilization, mostly ones that reinforce the stereotype of \\"noble savages\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brief Review","review":"The plates in this book are beautifully illustrated and there is a fair amount of interesting information on Iron Age Gallic and British weaponry and armor.However, I found much of the information too be quite outdated and was annoyed at the authors' constant grouping of diverse cultures from throughout Europe into some kind of \\"Celtic\\" blob."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast shipping; great product!","review":"Beautiful braclets, and you can't deny the energy of the stone combination.

The book as a whole would have been better if events were put entirely in chronological order.Having lived in the Ozarks, I found the descriptions to be too generic and borrowed, and would have enjoyed more personal desciptions from the author. The descriptions were too superficial, so I never got the \\"feel\\" of the author's surroundings and experiences.I also questioned some of the factual content of statements made in the book. It's as if the writer did not do enough research on certain topics to have an educated opinion. In other words, the writer jumps to conclusions in his evaluation of people and events without adequate knowledge and background.

Sid was once the best trial lawyer Manhattan had to offer. He had fame, money, and all the top cases. But when alcohol and drugs get the best of him, he's forced to rebuild his career from the ground up-sober this time. The only problem is he's stuck doing cases for small-time crooks, and waiting for his big break-a high profile case that will give him back the fame he deserves.Then he gets a call from Priscilla Sweet, who's in jail for murdering her drug dealing husband, and realizes that this is the case he's been waiting for. She claims self-defense, but the evidence that it was a cold-blooded murder in almost unsurmountable.The novel has the dark, grittyness of an Ed McBain novel with the excitement that only a legal thriller can deliver. It's full of unlikely twists and turns, fantastic dialogue, and highly complex characters. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbeatable Courtroom Drama","review":"A character like no other, a courtroom drama like no other, a surprise ending like no other.

I resent that Amazon and Mr. Macaulay actually accept money for this worthless publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but not Macaulay's best","review":"Visual explanation of how Egyptians living nearly 4500 years ago were able to construct such large and magnificent structures. Shows the construction from conception by the Pharaoh's architect, to clearing and leveling the site, transporting the stones, tediously dragging them up and placing them to create the 124 layers of the pyramid, and finally chipping them down the form the distinctive triangular sides of the pyramid. Of course Macaulay goes further to show construction of the underground tombs, and nearby temples.This book is not quite as interestsing as Mr. Macaulay's City book, but the subject matter was not as interesting either. Drawing men hauling stones up ramps doesn't compare to the richness of the Roman architecture and bustling city life."},{"rating":"2","title":"PYRAMID \\"SECRETS\\" REVEALED!","review":"Who built the pyramids of the Giza Plateau...and why?

Written for children, MacAulay takes the reader through each intricate step of the pyramid's construction from its conception on papyrus to its final completion. Leaving no stone unturned, PYRAMID also provides intriguing information on the daily lives of the Ancient Egyptians: how they viewed life and death, and what God and the afterlife meant to them. Each page is filled with sprawling pen and ink drawings which clearly illustrate their clever engineering techniques. PYRAMID is a simply written but vastly informative and enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT, FUN READ","review":"My friend checked this book out from the library and lent it to me, and I really enjoyed it.

I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a book they can really sink their teeth into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible on Kindle","review":"I've always loved this book, even as a child, and was excited to see it on Kindle. Unfortunately, the publishers just scanned in pages, making the illustrations hard to see and impossible to read. If they had taken the time to format this book for Kindle it could be amazing and a great way to illustrate Macaulay's extremely detailed illustrations.Ancient Egyptian works are extremely intricate and by having the illustrations small, you miss a lot of the detail that really makes this book wonderful.Great book, horrible e-book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Changed\\" by Ed Bruce","review":"I'm a long-time fan of Ed Bruce & when I discovered this CD I ordered it without ever having heard any of the songs, I knew I wouldn't be disapointed--and I wasn't.

Yes Feast and Feast 2 had their share of comic moments but Feast 3 goes way beyond what the first two movies did with comedy.

I however am disappointed that Amazon sells this saying that it will work on all of the newer computer systems. It just doesn't!

There are NO MUSIC/VOCAL credits in the notes which also confirms the falseness of this disaster. I listened to this CD 4 times very carefully, searching for one shread of quality but found nothing. I was embarrassed I bought it and fustrated I couldn't return it. I mean, come on.....the record label is \\"Dressed To Kill\\". Who ever heard of them!?!

Hang the DJ."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"Stay with the originals! I'd love to see a great Blondie tribute cd, but have been disappointed so far...The female singers on this cd just seem like pale imitations of Deborah Harry - they are trying too hard to sound like her. Also, the cover features a dreadful painting of Harry (the rest of Blondie are nowhere to be seen), which makes it all the more distasteful and cheesy! Do yourself a favor - buy \\"No Exit\\" or \\"Parallel Lines\\" instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A FEW GOOD COVERS, BUT NOT PLATINUM GIRL","review":"I will always prefer Blondie's original versions over any cover album put out. I think the most interesting thing about covers is the bands ability to take a song and present it in a new perspective. This album falls short of doing that. The highlights of the album are versions of ATOMIC and JUST GO AWAY. This album is bands trying to be Blondie. On the Platinum Girl Tribute album, groups put a twist on songs and make them unique.

Highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY DISAPPOINTING!","review":"Now here is a great collection of traditional hymns of praise & worship that you'd expect to be fabulous listening given the great voices offered on this cd. The problem lies in the really crappy arrangements. Here you will get to listen to LEANING ON THE EVERLASTING ARMS, arranged to sound like something you'd hear at a cocktail lounge! Songs whose tempo should be somewhat upbeat like, NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD, is slowed down to a really boring cadence that becomes just plain irritating. There are much, much better versions of all these sacred songs to be found on other recordings.

Don't quit them anytime soon. Except for a couple of the songs (Softy and Tenderly, Victory in Jesus, Leaning on the Everlasting Arms, and maybe one other one), this CD is a waste.

Stay away!","review":"Alright, so I decided to try this product because I ran out of my normal gel and was on the run and this is what was available at the local store in a small town while I was visiting my parents. Growing up I had an acne problem, but my skin had been clear for years... A week after using this product, I began breaking out with acne ALL over the area that I covered with the shaving cream. I immediately threw out this product. The only reason I am giving it a 2 is because I did shave well with it, but the effects of it on sensitive skin are HORRENDOUS. I repeat, if you have sensitive skin or are the least bit prone to acne, do not buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"This is a decent product. It is thick, and the Aloe does help reduce skin irritation quite a bit. Are there better shave gels on the market? Probably. But, this is a decently priced product that gets the job done. I had used the regular version for quite some time. I saw the Aloe variation in the grocery store once, about six months ago, and have since switched to that exclusively. I ordered it here on Amazon for convenience the last time I needed it, and it was a good value. I do tend to buy a lot of things on Amazon, but this is one that I actually would say is probably going to be cheaper to buy at your local grocery store, especially if you are buying from an Amazon Marketplace seller who is charging shipping on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know how Grandpa tolerated it","review":"I picked this stuff up on a trip and used most of the can before throwing it out. For me the negative effects were cumulative... at first it worked fine (and I felt tough and old school), but after a couple of months I realized my skin had become really tight, dried out, and sensitive. The problems disappeared after my wife replaced the Barbasol with some fancy stuff.

To get the most out of it, your child should have the ability to hold and click a mouse, and should already have basic recognition of capital and lower-case letters. The lowest level is perfect for my child but would have been too difficult at ages 3 - 3 1/2. The software teaches both letter and word recognition as well as phonics. The games are cute and when your child gets tired of learning to read there are fun songs and graphics to listen to with \\"reading propaganda\\" lyrics about how fun and important it is to learn to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best learn to read software program","review":"This is absolutely the best learning to read software game currently available. It's so rich! Kids learn phonics and sight words. Parents of impatient kids, beware. There is quite a bit of repetition in this game. But it does the job really well. If you want real, tangible results with a reading software game (and that is hard to find), try this game out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No technical support and no upgrades","review":"This game was bought for my son 1-2 years ago when he was a toddler. Now that he's four we started using it. There is an error in the piano game that basically teaches your child how to spell words incorrectly putting in lots of incorrect letters at random. The piano game features prominently in many of the exercises, so you basically have to do a work around throughout the entire process.What really gets me though is 1) I recently bought what I thought was an upgraded version of the game only to find the problem had not been fixed by the manufacturer 1) there are no patches or upgrades available to fix the problem, 2) the manufacturer states on their website that they will not give a refund for this game. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't run on mac os x","review":"there's no support information available regarding failure to run on mac os x platform. i was unaware of the problem because the product is advertised as macintosh compatible, and only subsequently discovered that others have run into the same difficulty after searching online for troubleshooting help."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work with w2k","review":"I'm an A+ network Engineer.

We looked for customer service from the reader rabbit website. It was not a website that was intended to make customer inquiries easy. We received an automated response from Broderlund, that was followed by a second message telling us that tech support was now being done by another firm. So, I registered my issue with that company. Another automated response directing me to another website. More FAQs.

The main idea is very blurry and hard to grasp. THe author gives theories and not facts and not very good training for tracking dog. The author has confused the ideal of tracking and air scenting. Even though it says \\"S&R\\", this book has a poor approach to it. This book was published in 1982, so much has changed since now in tracking. I truly think this author wanted to make a book more than educate people about tracking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Young is the master of music horror.","review":"Christopher Young has done it again with the sequel score for Grudge 2. It is big improvement over the original which was too string reliant and emulated Penderecki's Kanon for 52 Orchestra and Tape. This time Young utilizes asian woodwinds to capture the japanese origins of the tale. This was one of the opportunities that was missed during the first film's scoring duties. Also I must give credit to the late film scoring legend Jerry Goldsmith who has a big influence on Chris Young's work. Chris' use of the piano for the main theme evokes memories of The Omen. This is a truly terrifying score and an excellent addition to Young's impressive career."},{"rating":"2","title":"I learned so much about my family!","review":"I bought this book at a seminar at my child's school that was given by some local organizers who focus on students.

I recommend waiting for the real story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good choice for a beginning text","review":"I have this book as my text in the Business program at the University of Phoenix. I am not a supply chain manager and do not aspire to be, but it is a required course. Some of the math is a bit daunting (the phrase \\"using simple calculus\\" is an oxymoron to many) but even without knowing calculus the case studies and discussions convey the fundamentals effectively.Visually, the book is also good, with a layout and graphic design that makes reading easier and not at all a strain on the eyes. That might not seem important when you are shopping for a text, but when you are reading the third chapter of the day sometime between supper and midnight, it will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better, not quantitative","review":"Although this book has some good case histories I found the mathematics and quantitative analysis very weak. Equations are just pulled from the blue and put down with no explanation of how they are derived or their limitations. The authors spend a great deal of time describing in full detail the case histories. It took me a long time to get through the many pages of the Barilla pasta company story -- even though I am a pasta lover. From a non-quantitative view the book is good. I did not try the CD with the beer game supplied. I wish that maybe the authors will consider a second edition where they are more careful with the mathematics and explain the quantitative aspects of supply chains more carefully. As a PhD scientist I am curious on how the authors derived some of their analytical expresssions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bk girl !!!","review":"Very captivating, could not get my eyes off of it. The book captured the essence of Brooklyn life, I would recommend it to anyone who was raised in Brooklyn.

Makes one think before acting, and is a great lesson on why you should never judge anyone. You could very well end up in a situation similar to her family. Honest living is always the best living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sister Souljah's book is the best I've read in a long time!","review":"I couldn't put the book done. I wasn't sure if I wanted to read it at first or not because I knew a little about Sister Souljah (mostly from the hip-hop world). But, as soon as I finished the first chapter, all of my worries vanished.This is truly the best book I've read in a long time. It draws you in page by page, and you hate to put it down. I even hated to go the the restroom, and I felt disappointed everytime I had to do something else.Denise Ogden"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, what was ALL the hype about","review":"My sister recommend that I read this book, so I ordered it and my only question is, \\"What was all the hype about.\\" It was an ok book but it was NOT a page turner.

It will blow one away from beginning to end. I actually began to feel as if I knew the characters and if they were real. I started the book on a Friday morning and finished it on Saturday night. YES I HAVE A LIFE, but this book became a part of it for two days.

Once I picked up the book and started reading I was immediately drawn into the story and felt as though I was actually there watching everything go down. This book kept me on edge the entire time and it was so realistic. It is a must read for all those who have witnessed or have personally felt the effects of neighborhoods being destructed because of narcotics. Also if you like the drama of city life, then you'll enjoy it as well.I read this book in about 4 days, but in total it didn't take longer than 24 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!","review":"I love this book.

It was almost like reading an assignment from one of my students. I actually had impulses of correcting the story as I read it! It is a good story line but was presented in an unorganized manner. I didn't feel sorry for the characters nor could I attach myself to any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coldest Winter Ever","review":"My husband and I both thought very highly of this book. The book has a flow that makes it very hard to put down. We were also very pleased with the ending. So many times writers make 'The Life' appear flawless, however, that's not always reality. I am proud of Sister Souljah for telling it like it is. Thankx Sister Souljah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was one a cold winter","review":"This book was one of the best books i've read in a while.This book tells of the struggles of a family, when their life turns downhill.Sista Soulja teaches you that money doesn't last forever.Everyone go get this book,and you sure will experience a cold winter.

That should be \\"enough said\\" but I feel the need to say more. This book is captivating from beginning to end. I recommend it highly to all. As I read the book...

I look forward to more from this author SOON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This a very good book. At times I really felt where she was comming from. It was thrilling yet sad.

I really enjoyed this book, and i like the fact that it was written by a strong black female"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and Fabulous!","review":"This book has given me a completely new respect for Sister Souljah. An absolute page turner. Her writing is both candid and three dimentional. Winter has never been so hot! My only question...When is Souljah going to bless us with another novel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I could not get over how excellent this book was. It was one of the best books I've ever read. It had realistic dialogue and the characters were people I knew or had heard about from friends. I wished that the book hadn't ended the way it did, I didn't even want it to end, I finished it in two days and am about to read it again. Sister Souljah has a gift. SHe can capture you're attention and hold you there in the palm of her hand, hearing her message and will not let you go until the tale is told."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was all that and a bag of Lays!","review":"I enjoyed this book to the fullest. I felt I was talking on the phone with Winter like she was my girl. You get to see a dealers side of things as well as a community activists (Sister Souljah). It's about time we hear from two different sides in the hood. I wish I had a chance to chat a little with a true soldier like Sister Souljah."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I totally LOVE this book. Growing up in the era of New Jack City, I can feel the characters so much.Sister Soulja did an impeccable job of bringing her characters to life. I especially love the section in the very back of the book that describes every character and their roles in Winter's life.I recommend this book because it is not sex filled like most of the modern day books are, it has a little bit of everything from Love, Money, Sex, Adultery, Deceit, Imprisonment, Backstabbing, Friends, Lovers, Family, Status Symbols and more!After reading this book, I called a few of my friends who are avid readers such as myself and recommended the purchase of this book if they have not already purchased this. The Coldest Winter Ever is not a book that you check out at the Library then return, this book is worth paying for, it's worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever","review":"This book was the best book i've ever read in my life it took me two days to read it all but it was worth it.

Sometimes she made me mad because of the stupid things she had done and i'm happy at what happens to her at the end, then other times she made me laugh and say you go girl. This is one of those stories you tell all your girls to buy so you can talk about it all the time. Once you pick it up you cant put it down i read it in 3 days. i would have gave it 4 and a half stars but couldnt."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAPTIVATING! I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. My cousin suggested that I read this book. I didn't think I would be interested. This book is a serious page turner. I couldn't put it down. I finished in about a day and a half. I wish that all materialistic people could read this book. Especially the ones who get their material things from profit of illegal activity. Everything you think is good is not always good. The book should definitely hit the silver screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"applaud","review":"I have a 10 year old daughter and after reading this book I will now change the way I raise my child, live in front of my child and respect other people. The book taught me that you shouldn't always expect the best and teach your children to have the best. Teach them that whatever you have, make the best of it. It is always a must that if we are single parents we should always have only one man/person in front of our children, and we should have the one that treats us with the upmost respect. The books fansinate my intellegence as to all girls no matter the age are always influence by our parents, no matter how we feel. Remember our children are effected by our lives as much as we are effected by our parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The REALEST Book ever","review":"Every since I can remember I have been a reader. Although I'm from the same streets as Winter, I could never feel her pain but I've seen that same pain through some of my friends. This book is the REALEST book ever. Sister Souljah has out done herself. This is my favorite book. I even brought the hardcover and softcover. I keep the hardcover for my collection, and lend the softcover out to my friends. I suggest everyone read this book. What put this book in my top 10 was Soul Souljah didn't end this book as a love story but her ending was just as it is growing up in the ghetto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Lessons","review":"I guess some of us are lucky enough to be taugh wrong from right and go forth with making the best choices for ourselves. Others aren't so fortunate. This is what I took from this book, it goes into great depth about the ignorance of a young woman coming of age in a harsh drug pushing environment set up to look like a beautiful and inviting one. Her Kingpin father gives her material things, street wise skills, but no life lessons about things that could go wrong and having respect for yourself. Everything she thinks about involves money and clothes no matter how bad things get for her. Sometimes you can hate her and at other times pity her. Even when people tell her what she needs to do to fly right she doesn't listen, talking to people who have fallen from the type of life she is leading doesn't help. This book is a true example that sometimes people just have to learn for themselves by falling hard and she does."},{"rating":"2","title":"off the chain /crunk to death","review":"this book was off the chain i'm talking bout if you ever read this book please don't put it down cuz you r going to be mad! winter was a good character and had a good name.this book is ghetto-fabolous i would review this book over and over again ever time i get a chance!if people are put reading this book let me tell you you have some good taste in black intersting book! HOLLLLA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldest Winter Ever","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all that I have read you can't put it down once you start it. Winter is a girl with many different hats and the title describes her best. The Coldest I bought it again just to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"For What It Was.","review":"I was handed this book as a 15 year old boy. Mind you at the time, I was shocked that my step-mother wanted me to read it after the first sentence. I thought this story was great, Now reading it as a 22 year old man, I am no more moved than I was 15. Thinking on this novel, it is a very stereotypical fable. It didn't enlighten me any further than it was when i read it the first time.For what it was though, out side of the stereotypes, I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only gave it 1 star because I had to","review":"Am I the only one who thinks this book was a moronic, self-indulgent stereotypical-black-girl fantasy that insults the intelligence of young black females everywhere? Winter is drawn with nary an appealing bone in her body. She's rude, crude, shallow and completely unlikeable. Her family is a pathetic caricature of 'power' and 'respect' -- I thought by the end of this 'novel' (hah) we would get a lesson in the dangers of superficiality so severe that members of said family are named after expensive cars, but alas, this was not the case. I'm not sure what Ms. Souljah is trying to do. I found this book completely pointless and offensive. Maybe next time this author develops a yearning to titillate herself with materialistic fantasies, she could try for her own show on BET."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disapponting Book","review":"'The Coldest Winter Ever' by Sista Souljah was very, very disappointing. On the heels of her book 'No Disrespect', I would have thought that she came with a better showing than this.For some reason she tries to incorporate every urban cliche and stereotype known to man. The way Winter was a fiend for the latest designer clothes and money, to these elaborate hustles and schemes she was always cooking up or to some girls carrying razor blades in their mouth. Never do any of her characters have moments of reflection or recollection about life. I have been around that culture in the same borough that the book is set in and Souljah's view is nowhere near to reality.All in all, a not-so-well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"astounding","review":"The Coldest Winter Ever was amazing. I couldn't put the book down because I needed to know what Winter would do next. All through the book I screamed, she is crazy, don't do it, and get your mind right Winter. Every aspect of the book had a message encrypted in the words. You can relate to the characters, because there are so many of the Victor Santiago's, Bullet's, and Winter's living in our own back yard. The things Winter did to keep up with this \\"lifestyle\\" sometimes had me in tears. It is so sad that she would just do about anything to look great in someone else's eyes. I hope that all the people who read this book come away with some wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book ever","review":"The coldest winter ever was maybe the best book Sister Souljah could have ever written.It tells you about a young african american girl who goes through a lot in order to servive. Born and raised in the ghetto Winters father is the top drug dealer who's operation gets busted. So winter and her mom and 3 sisters are out of a home and money. Winter is a hot girl who loves men and sex.She is very atractive so all of the men want her and she just really gets them for their money.There's more to the story but you should read to find out more.I think that Sister Souljah really out did her self and even though I don't know her I'm proud of her"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lesson Learned","review":"This is a novel with raw language and a message for all or our youth. When you try to grab the first shinny thing you see, it usually comes with a painful hook inside. This is also a lesson some adults have yet to learn. Sister Souljah masterfully takes you into a world that for many would be hard to imagine, and unfortunately for some of our youth is everyday life. Ken Aubrey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Crime Affair","review":"I felt the book was an accurate portrayal of the lifestyles of urban criminals today. The bluntness of the language used,andrealness of the day to day situations caused me to think that may be this book is actually a autobiography. Sanitiaga's family was doomed from the start. This book could be use to all that are contimplating the role of Drug dealer, that all money isn't good money...so be ware. I also saw the the lesson though Midnight, anybody can redirect their lives. Winter is, however sad, very typical of young women everywhere in the world wanting money and power without working for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three times and it still does it for me!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"BRAVO!!!!!!!!!! This was my third time reading this book. It was and still is great. I read this book when it first came out, again in 2001 and now I read it again. With all these new up and coming writers that are out, I thought I needed to take it back. Her writing style is the Bomb. She is A TRUE WRITER, STORY TELLER AND CAN PAINT A PICTURE WITH HER WORDS!!!!!PICK THIS BOOK UP AND YOU WILL READ IT AGAIN. I wish they would make a movie out of this book. You feel as though you are there doing everything with Winter. I can relate to this book being a native NY'er. Sister Souljah put it down!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The easiest reading yet","review":"This books represents so many faces we see day to day and it hits many nerves. I enjoyed this book and I am contemplating reading it again. The Coldest winter Ever has the effect of making you not believe what you just read. Nothing prepared me for the events as they unfolded. This book like S.S's first; \\"No Disrepsect,\\" Tells the story of our women in a realistic and entertaining manner and keeps the true message throughout. Its true that many who fit the part of Winter may not get the message, but if you share what you have taken from reading this book, the message is bound to reach the right people. Overall, this book is true to life because nothing is as it seems, outcomes cannt be predicted, and the fruit doesn't fall to far from the tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"DA BOMB!","review":"This was by far the best piece of fiction I have read in a long long time. I never would have figured militant rapper and orator Sista Souljah for a brilliant novelist. I can't wait for the next book! I read her autobiography \\"No Disrespect\\" before I read \\"Winter\\" and I knew then that I was definately on to something. This book was so powerful and haunting, it took at least a week to get the images out of my head. It was like seeing a really good movie. One that just takes your breath away and leaves you speechless. I was just too eager to share this book with my friends and I hope you will read this and want to share it with yours. Sistah Souljah if you're out there, Girl hurry up and write another book! :O)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book!","review":"This is the BEST book I have read, and I have read a lot of books. I vision Winter as Lil Kim or Foxy Brown. Sister Souljah has done a great job of capturing the ghetto fabulous lifestyle. I am recommending this book to everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction but really reality","review":"Although this book is fiction, it holds many truths in life for African American youth. It proves the saying that \\"What Goes Up, Must Come Down.\\" This book helped me to realize that although making fast money in the beginning seems great, it will someday come to an end, and all those involved will suffer greatly. The story of Winter is a perfect example to girls who sell their minds and bodies to be supported by men who do not have legit jobs. The Coldest Winter Ever is a true reminder that children mimick what they see in life; therefore we must live the way that we want our children to live. This book should be read by all African American men and women who aspire to be Scar Faces."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever","review":"This is one of the best books ever written. I read the entire book in about two days. Sistah Souljah had me thinking I went to the movies because I felt like I was looking right at Winter.Winter had to do what she had to do by any means necessary. Which was just about anything to survive.(The old lady with the rock was drama!!!)This book is the truth and will hit home with a lot of young readers. I think any women young or old that's fascinated with street life, should read this book, it may wake them up, and let them know that the glamour is only temporary.Every one I know loved this book, but was upset with the ending. I think the end was perfect, because Winter realize that your pass will catch up with you. I can't wait for the real movie on HBO, and Sis Souljah's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank Ya Lord!","review":"I don't know how many reviewers out there are like me, but this book made me thankful to be a Christian. It definitely shows how the other half lives and all that glitters ain't gold. Although throughout the book, you hoped that the main character would get it together, but the sad reality of it is you know in your heart the book couldn't have ended any other way. Its definitely a wake up call. Sister Souljah, keeps it real and gets her point across Crystal Clear. I too couldn't put it down. I stayed up all night b/c I just had to see how the whole thing was gonna play out. A MUST READ! Thank you souljah for that wake up call! And thank you Lord for allowing me to choose a different path in life than Winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This is one of the best books ever. This is one of those books that I'll definitely read again. I didn't think I'd like the book too much given the background of the Santiaga family. Once I started reading I couldn't put this book down. Winter Santiaga is a young girl with a lot of character and a lot of heart. It's hard to read this book without laughing or crying. At times you feel that Winter deserves what she gets but at times you can't help but feel for her. I think we'd all like to have a bit of Winter's spunk and tenacity. I like that this book had political lessons, although they weren't extreme and in your face. By the second or third chapter of this book, I had recommended it to several people. I think this is an excellent book for any woman and teen-age girl. This books shows both good and evil, and how they relate to several aspects of life. We can all learn lessons from Winter and her journey through the school of hard knocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coldest Winter Ever","review":"All I can say is .....You have got to read this book. Once you open it you wont put it down. The book was so good, every light I came to in my car I was reading. You definitely wont want it to end. Real tear jerker at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO!! BRAVO!","review":"This type of writing reminds me of the great classics as Daddy Cool and IceBerg Slim. It was so real you were there. What was most 'real' about the Coldest Winter... was never once did Sister Souljah deviate from the character of a ghetto princess, just when you thought she will make a difference in her life, the street in her kicks in and she stays loyal to the game, even to the end. Buried deep within.. for the young ladies, was the real message. Although I got what that message was and I'm sure they will too, I believe that just like Winter, it will hit the surface, but just like Winter, when it comes time to make a difference, the street will kick in, it just comes naturally. Overall this should be placed in Oprah's Book Club! (Imagine..She would have to explain in white code what it all means.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I am not much of a Sister Souljah fan, and was shocked to see that she had written a fiction novel. HOWEVER, this book was one of the best contemporary books I've read--period. Sister Souljah leaves her self-righteousness out of this one, and writes a damn good novel. I finished it in two days and could barely keep it closed. This is a highly recommended read, and I hope the film does it justice, because it is a must-read for sisters everywhere. I'm keeping my fingers crossed in anticipation that Sister Souljah continues writing fiction-she is truly gifted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coldest Winter Ever","review":"I am a 16-year old African-American female and this book really moved me. I was captivated by the experiences of Winter, which I hope never to be a part of. Reading this book, I became so into Winter's character, that I was angry when she was, in love when she was, thoughtful and every thing else when she was. Even though Winter did somethings that really upset me, it made me realize that I often do stupid things if it gets me out of a difficult situation. I promise you, this would be one of the best books you would ever read. I know it's my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coldest Winter Ever","review":"This book was action packed from page one to the end. Sister Souljah is definitley one talented sister. I completed this book in just one day. This book is a real page turner. To all of you book readers, this is surely a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Goodness....","review":"I am really blown away with this book. This book left me in awe for several days. I can't say I relate to Winter but I know a lot of young girls and boys do. The book was out of sight. Sister Souljah did an excellent job. I wasn't even going to read the book. All I did was pick it up and flip to the first page. I read the opening line and said \\"Oh yeah gotta read it\\" Winter makes you wanna smack her and then she makes you feel her pain it's outstanding. This book deserves to be made into an movie and have an part 2. The beginning to the end was dynamite. When you get finish with the book all you can say is \\"dang\\" I give the book two thumbs up. And, also to make it known how good the book is I just read it one month ago and I'm about to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had greater expectations of this book.","review":"Although I admit I know next to nothing about Sister Souljah and her political stance, I expected more from this story than the way in which it ended. For Winter to have been portrayed as being so smart, she was dumb as dirt. Having been around the same type of environment as Winter, I guess I imagined her using the skills her father taught her to turn her life around; not to try and follow in his footsteps (which she did very unsuccessfully I might add). To me, Winter turned out to be nothing more than a spoiled brat who was loyal to no one, not even her mother, and her \\"street smarts\\" only taught her to be a \\"Stupid Ho\\". Perhaps Souljah was trying to show that, more often than not, people caught in this type of life DON'T turn their life around and DO end up in the same cycle. I guess I was just expecting the portrayal of that One in a thousand who actually did turn their life around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"I remember reading this book when I was younger but as an adult I couldn't finish it but its great to have in my collectin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a good read","review":"I actually read this book many years ago.

This is by far one of Sista Soulja's best books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked","review":"I just recently read this book after a few friends of mine said it was a must read. I have to say I read this book in 2 sittings and was pleased from the begginning to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !!!","review":"A must read if you are a conscious person that always ask questions about social issues in the African American Community. This book will allow you to get a first person view of a stereotype black sista that loves men with a lot of wealth."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\"by Sista Souljah","review":"This book is...great. Sista Souljah made a book for someone who can relate to the characters experiences. \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\" has a storyline about a teenager growing into a women and is going to many problems that actually caught my attention alot. It's not very appropriate for teens, but many teens nowadays may have gone through what the the main character has. This book has suspense and the author did a good job at foreshadowing through the story to make the reader unable to put the book down. This book is ready for a sequel. I felt that the character was someone I knew made a good moral to the story. It makes you think about your own life and experiences even if they haven't been as suspenseful.Sista Souljah brought interesting characters that helped with making this book so good.This book is good for even the laziest readers. It's especially excellent for those avid readers. It'll be even a bigger treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifestyles","review":"This novel is really a page turner. The indepth illustration of \\"ghetto lifestyles\\" and survival on the streets is true to life. Ms. Souljah keeps you suspended and anticipating what will happen next. Some of the characterizations were stereotypical and did not give a true view of all the people who live in the ghettoes. She did an excellent job of making you feel the emotions of Winter. I'm looking forward to a sequel to see what other avenues Winter's life goes down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coldest Winter Ever","review":"This was an excellent book! Winter's character was entirely believable and her surroundings and circumstances were entirely perceptible. The complete book from chapter to chapter was a 'page-turner'. Winter places value on everything except herself which leads to a personal demise.This is a must read for young black women because her true to life \\"attitude\\" is what so many of us possess.

I was determined to find out what Winter had up her sleeve next. She is a strong and very determined young lady that will do any and everything to get what she wants out of life, no matter what the cost.Sista Souljah all I can say is, YOU GO GIRL! You did a great job on this book.Angela Weathered, Author"},{"rating":"2","title":"The coldest winter ever","review":"The first page draw me into the world of winter. I felt her excitement at the wonderful, loving, giving and protecting daddy. The sweet, caring but well put together mommy. I related to her friendships from her hood. I cried, when she lost her trust in her father, her house,car, and her way of living all gone in a day. She grew up in a week,but the greatest tradegy was going through all her trails, and learning the lesson in the end.I hope this book open up eyes before the the lesson is done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldest Winter Ever","review":"I think that this was the best book that I ever read. It held my attention from the first page until the last. I lost sleep because I was unable to put it down. I passed this book on to many people in my family. My niece wasn't a fan of Sister Souljah, and was very reluctant to read her book and after I gave the book to her she was unable to put it down herself. Noone has come close to captivating me as she has. I read both of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book started it all for me...","review":"Great book, captivating, and surprising. Sister Souljah pulls you in with Winter. You feel her pain and you empathize. I recommend it to everybody, but everybody's already read it! Ha ha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"I read this book and like many of these reviewers, I couldn't put it down. At times I liked Winter, I hated her and felt sorry for her. And this is what you see everyday, women using their body to get what they want, money, clothes, etc.. Without giving away the book, Winter is just like what the title says \\"COLD\\".I do have to comment on Sister Souljah's description of herself in this book, I guess she is making fun of herself or downplaying her image. She calls herself outdated (in so many words), overweight, etc, etc. I guess she did that to prove a point, that most young girls don't have a positive role model in their lives and when someone tries to help and guide them, they act like they don't need any help.I would like to see a sequel to this book, or better yet, write another one close to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gotta love this book","review":"I'm not the type of person who like to read but when i first read this book at school because i was obliged to do it, it became obvious that i had to read it again today !

She told me that it was so good she couldn't put it down. I read the book and found myself sneaking in the bathroom at work just to get through two or three chapters. The book was so real and so explicit, that I actually thought I knew each character personally. Everyone knows a Winter or a Santiago. It made me take a look at my own life and the things that I put a great emphasis on. The book was good from the first chapter to the end. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a reality check. This is definitely one for the big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldest Ever!!!!","review":"This was the first urban book that I ever read and it was good!!!! Winter was off the hook and was down for her family. It was messed up that she got locked up after a nigga that she thought she loved.

Come on Sista Souljah we want to know!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE COLDEST BOOK EVER","review":"THIS IS DEFINATLY ONE OF THE COLDEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN. I READ IT 3 TIMES ALREADY.

It is a definite must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the Chain (5 STARS)","review":"This book was so riveting that I finished it in approximately five hours (11pm to 3:30am), could barely get up for work the next morning; it was very interesting, enlightening and empowering. Interesting because it depicts what really goes on in the hood; enlightening and inspiring because it details the road of destruction and encourages me to continue on fighting the temptation of the fast life and the lust for the strength of those type of men, I'm like a magnet to them; which has been an off and on situation in my life but my prayers have kept me safe; it is a warning for black men and women to stay out of the game; it's an addiction, a fast life that ends fast"},{"rating":"1","title":"not my cup of tea","review":"this book was so highly recommended to me, but i was disappointedcouldn't get past first few pages, put it down and tried again . found b-more careful to much more interesting perhaps because i am from baltimore and it was nice to be able to read about my city even in a bad light. have tried to read other of her writings just don't find her to my taste. but then again i don't usually read books of this genre"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coldest Winter Ever","review":"The coldest Winter Ever is a great to read.

I can't wait for the follow-up of the The Coldest Winter Ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Read !!!!!!!","review":"I HAVE READ MANY BOOKS, AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS IS THE BEST. I LOVED THIS BOOK FROM START TO FINISH. FROM THE FIRST LINE I KNEW I WOULD LIKE IT. IT REALLY IS TRUE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT DONT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER, BECAUSE THIS BOOK IS GREAT. I READ THIS BOOK IN 2 DAYS. WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT IT, WAS THAT IT DIDNT HAVE A HAPPY ENDING. MOST OF THESE NOVELS ALWAYS END ON A HAPPY NOTE. THIS WAS A REAL BOOK, BECAUSE IN REAL LIFE MOST OF THESE KIND OF STORIES DONT END HAPPY. SO I LOVED IT. I AM ABOUT TO READ HER NEXT BOOK \\"NO DISRESPECT\\" AS WELL."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENJOYABLE READ","review":"THIS WAS A PLEASANT READ, THE WRITING WAS DETAILED ANDVERY UNDERSTANDING.

I highly recommend this book especial to young teenage boys and girls, because there is a great lesson here to be learned. Sister Souljah congratulations on this wonderful book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"By far, one of the BEST books that I have ever read.

I think that the dialougue was well written and Sister Souljah did a good job at describing the detail. It was a true page turner as I anticipated getting to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coldest Winter Ever","review":"This book came highly recommended and now I know why. I could not put it down because I could not wait to find out what happened next. I've never been a fan of Sister Souljah but I am now. The Coldest Winter Ever was gritty, raw and truthful. It's a shame but there are a lot of beautiful young ladies in urban cities with the same mentality as Winter. I found myself hoping that she would make the right decisions and then cursing when she didn't. In my opinion, she was a product of her upbringing and sometimes that can be a bad thing. This book is a must read for all ages, gender and races. Thank you Sister Souljah for the truth and keep doing what you are doing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive \\"Must Recommend\\" Reading!","review":"I was given a recommendation to read this book. So I made the purchase, maybe 6 months ago. During this past weekend, I cleaned my closet and found it and decided to begin reading, at least 1 chapter. I'm notorious for starting a novel and loosing interest quick. However, Sister Souljah's novel starts off like the Black Sopranos and moves aggressively to bad, worse, and can't get any worse, to horrible to 'oh my goodness'. I highly recommend this book and have found myself in a directing mode and identifying the characters with such possible stars as Alicia Keys as Winter and Tyrese as Midnight...anyway...that's just a thought. Just get the book and you will feel me and everyone else on this great book! Congratulations Sister Souljah on your wonderful debut!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Souljah has arrived!","review":"I am an educator of inner-city adolescents. Language aside, I wish they could have read this material. It really puts a number of things into perspective. Sister Souljah did such a great job with giving Winter a strong and undeniable voice. When I wasn't reading, I would find myself wondering about Winter's next move, as if she were not a character but an acquaintance. I would definitely welcome a film project or a sequel to this book. Sister Souljah has definitely arrived with her first novel. My prediction is that she is here to stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"When a friend of mind suggested that I read this book, I was okay but then she said, I'm telling you once you start reading it you not going to be able to put it down. She was right!!!! The book started off the top with excitement. I was flipping the book page by page, eagerly to heard what the Santiaga's family or Winter's next move was going to be. Now, I know alot of people who flow's like Winter and the people she hung with and let me tell you the book was categorize as fiction but it was REAL!!! Hopefully someone who might be headed in that direction or in that situation will read this book and learn that you never stay on top and that you always get caught and it's really not a good life to lead.I'm truly impressed with how Souljah worded the book and kept it interesting.I don't about ya'll but I'm ready for The coldest Winter ever II.Peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Alright","review":"Like most books written for African American women, I found this one to lack substance. I thought that this book was a good read until Winter met with Sister Souljah. That was the ultimate act of narcissism. The book lost my interest there. I would recommend that young women who are fascinated by the easy life read it. It was scary how easy it was for Winter to have her whole life turned upside down in an instant."},{"rating":"2","title":"i dont see what the big deal is","review":"maybe reading flyy girl first, this book didnt really do it for me. everyone is fascinated like, ooh did you read this and read that. it was very good though. her mother had her when she was 14. i can hardly get over that. anyway its about how she lived a pretty good life. her father was a drug lord then something happened and he ends up in jail, her mother becomes a crack head and she goes from the top to the bottom, climbing her way back to the top then gettin put back in jail. althought this book didnt really do it for me, it was good. i know that probably doesnt make sense. she got by, regardless of what situation she was put in. so i recommend reading this book, you were anyway. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"This book was so good I read it about six times and bought it for four of my friends to read as well. We all enjoy reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is EXCELLENT. One of the best I've read.","review":"I could not put this book down. In fact, as soon as I finished it I started it again and I never do that. In Winter, Sister Souljah created a character so real, believable and tragic that I got utterly involved in her plight. She was able to \\"preach\\" her message without being preachy. I learned so much from this book and would recommend it to everyone. Sister Souljah is to be highly commended and I hope she is in the process of writing her second novel. I would love to see a continuation of Winter's story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Think So!!!!","review":"This was not the best book ever! I was so disappointed. I thought the book was based on Sistah Soldier and not Winter. The book did have some good parts. This would not be a book I would read again! I just want to know why did the author have to write herself into the story. I guess just to give herself props! I finished the book hoping it was going to get better. At the end it did show what happens when a person is trying to be with drug dealers all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!!!!!!","review":"So when i got this book i was expecting thisAMAZING book because of what everyone around mewas saying but i was wrong. This is the 2nd worstbook i have read (first place goes to her other book midnight)I don't know where to start. Winter was a complete idiot. It seemedlike she was in love with her dad. Her mom was even dumber than shewas. I wish you didn't have to rate the book because it doesn'teven deserve 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Book","review":"I really like this one. I loved how it was written. The book really showed a piece of reality. I could relate to this book because I knew people that were in this families situation. I kind of understood them. I would have never thought of reading this book but a co-worker told me it was good and boy was she right. I could not put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"blown away by Sister Souljah with this book...","review":"this book is so deep. sister souljah keeps it quite real in this masterpiece of hers. if parents can venture to look past all of the graphic language in this book, they will see that it offers so many life lessons to young women today, especially our little sistas out there. i recommend it to both parents and young people alike.powerful messages and inspiring characters here. do not pass this book by."},{"rating":"2","title":"You did justice to the game...lesson to be learned","review":"I've read this book last year .It was hard to find though. I literally went to a predominantly white area to find it. Read it in 3 days. Sister tells lesson to young woman whom think the \\"fast,Game\\" life is all that. What's up Money? Winter thinks. Our main charater is smart, about the wrong things.Gift of gab,clothes,designers and nice cars. A pocket full of Benjamins don't mean nothing if you did earn them. Long and hard lesson. I reccommend the book to teenagers, young sisters who are easily distracted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I've Ever Read!","review":"I read this book in 3 days! If I didn't have to work, I would've been done in one! I could not put it down. I felt so attached to Winter Santiaga. She was very ignorant and she made a lot of stupid decisions, but the way Souljah wrote the story made me fall in love with her. The ending crushed me! I actually cried (maybe I'm sensitive). The language used in this book made me feel comfortable. It made the story real for me. I felt like I was right alongside Winter throughout all of her adventures. I really wish someone would turn it into a movie. Although I feel that a lot could be lost in the adaptation to the big screen. I have recommended it to at least 10 people and I just finished it yesterday! The best book ever!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"read this book several times","review":"I have read this book several times since it was introduced to me a few years ago and enjoy it every time. I've lent it to several friends who have all enjoyed it. Wouldn't go as far as to say that its the best book ever written, but I can't think of many that I liked more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"This book has been hyped up for years, so I finally getting around to reading it. This book was horrible,if Sister Souljah can be a writer, than I should be President. I found it amazing how Winter's only concern was her FATHER, SEX and MONEY; what about her mother and her sisters? Immature garbage story. The whole thing was just horrible. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dumbest Winter Ever Left Me Hanging","review":"This book was very compelling, but I was very disappointed by the ending. I couldn't identify with Winter at all, even though I know many people like her. I hated her. All she cared about was ice and men and wearing name brands. She is one of the most superficial protagonists! I kept waiting for her to turn her life around, to realize how utterly STUPID she is for only caring about the BLING BLING and sex and looking good. But she never did. And what is up with Sister Souljah incorporating her own image into the novel? I thought that was a bit pompous. I kept waiting for Midnight to come and help Winter. Somebody needed to help the poor child. Maybe I just wanted a fairy tale ending. Even at the very bitter end, Winter still only cares about how good she looks compared to others. You'd think after all she had been through, she would have learned her lesson. I wouldn't be surprised if she would be back to her old tricks. There was no real resolution.:("},{"rating":"2","title":"GhEtTo GoSpEl","review":"FINALLY someone has stepped the game up of \\"hood reading \\" SISTA SOULJAH was right on the money when she came out with this ! me coming from BROOKLYN i see what she is saying in this book she keeps it real ! winter a typical round tha way girl form tha hood ! i recommend this book to everyone and their mommas and their grandmas and they boyfriends its a great read 5 stars hand down"},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Of The Gold diggers","review":"If you like books about drugs, crime, street smarts and sex, this is the book for you. I really enjoyed this book. Winter is not a likeable character. She's a young, dumb girl who doesn't use her brain all the time. It's sad to see a young girl who is really smart waste her time worrying about what clothes other people are wearing and how much money she can get. All she cares about is how good expensive clothes and shoes will look on her. She's just a gold digger. There are so many things in this book that may shock you. I'm sure if you read it you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent at its best!","review":"I read this book in 2000 and until this day 2013, it's still one of the best books I've ever read. I'm so excited that she has a part 2 of this book coming out. If you haven't read this book yet, you don't know what your missing. Sister Souljah, did her thing when she wrote this book. I just wish she would write more books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is my second time reading this book...it's excellent...sister souljah is an excellent story teller...I really enjoyed this book...one word...excellent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There was a lot of hype about this book and that is why I purchased it. Through the years I have heard it was a great book. As I read it I found myself wanting to throw the book away. I found the writing to be mediocre and the topic to be very challenging to believe it was reality. After I finished the book I desperately want my money back and the time I wasted reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juicey","review":"I love this book probably read it 5x but it never gets old and I find something in the story line that I didn't the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th time! I had to get it on Kindle so it can travel with me! There's action from the start! A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An insight into the culture of big city street life","review":"The author is a black activist with direct personal experience of poverty and prejudice. She has dedicated her life to making changes in both areas. This novel chronicles the life of a young beautiful daughter of a Brooklyn drug lord as it spirals down from being the queen of the heap when they were rich and accustomed to expensive clothes, jewelry and respect within the gang culture, to becoming poor, homeless and victimized by former \\"friends\\". It left me with the grim realization that it is almost impossible to intervene in appealing to youth whose idols are those who can make money easily on the streets even though the long term outlook is not good. It also gave me an education in the language of the streets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This book had been on my to read list for a long time, but I never seemed to take the time to read it. How I ended up reading it is I recently joined a book club, and this was the book chosen for the September read. I loved it! I carried this book EVERYWHERE! I thought that Sister Souljah did an excellent job in her development of Winter, and the rest of the characters in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell yeah, This book is the bomb!!!","review":"Sister Souljah took her time with this book. It showed alot of detail and made me feel what was going on.The book was kept real.I was digging the book since page 1.Some of the things going on I could relate to.At the end the book left me hanging.I didn't expect an ending like that and I was mad cause the book was over. I wanted to read more.There should be a sequel. What's going on with Porsha? What happens when Winter gets out? Do Bullet even hollar at Winter?Other than that the book was all that and I am waiting for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL BOOK!","review":"Sister Souljah, you go girl! This was an incredible book. A tale of a young woman, growing up way too fast and the trouble she encountered. It's defintely a page turner that kept me up several nights and falling asleep at work the next day. Now I hear, it's being made into a movie. I'm waiting with baited breath. Please buy this book and read it. You won't be sorry. Trust me, the ending is not what you'll expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!!!","review":"Nearly everyone I came in contact with had nothing but good things to say about Sister Souljah's fiction attempt... Notice Isaid attempt. If this is the best book you ever read...You haven't read many books. This book isn't about the journey, but the destination. And let me just say the ride there is boring, predictable, and trite. Souljah doesn't consider language, depth of characters, or universality. If you want a novel that is not written well that's filled with gratuitist explentives. Then this, my friend is the novel for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pros and Cons of a Ghetto Fabulous Lifestyle","review":"This book came highly recommended and now I know why.

If you like the whole \\"ghetto\\" drug, money and violence, a long with families falling apart, And how a father can't be around to help out his family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real...good...lacking closure","review":"After reading \\"No Disrespect\\", I anxiously awaited the release of Souljah's second novel. In both, I think she gives great attention to the transgenerational conditioning of black women on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum. She shamelessly reveals what some of us are willing to relinquish in order to gain money, and the illusion of power and respect.The thing that turned me off was the Sistah Souljah cameo.The reason I feel it lacked closure was because you never knew whether Winter would get it together or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"LOVE this book 4th time reading it waiting on part 2 to come out GOOD writing sista Fallujah!!LOVE it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reread","review":"Still a mess of a story but in a good and juicy way.. love all the drama and craziness of Winter's world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"i could not get into this book it did not get my interest i brought it because i heard good things about it so i wanted to try it because i love urban books but this put me to sleep"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coldest Winter Ever","review":"\\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\" by Sister Souljah was such a good book.

It is the best book I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!","review":"I don't know one person who has read this book and can say that they didn't enjoy. The charaters were well developed. The plot was real. Sister Souljah allowed you to live within the story without giving too much details. I think Souljah did a great job. She entertain you while giving a clear and postive message. If you missed the message you should read it again (which I'm sure you'll have no problem during). Some might disagree with me but I loved the way it ended. Some people have to learn the hard way. Sister Souljah is a modern Geroge Woodson with a twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"This book is beyond words. I picked up this book on friday and by sunday I was finished. I am so happy that Sister Souljah found her nick in life. She is an excellent writer and I am sure we will here more from her in the future. Go out tell you friends that this is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great novel!!!","review":"This book is a must read for all the ladies that are involved or thinking about getting involved with a man in the dope game. Sister Souljah really broke it down and told the truth about that lifestyle. Everything was so realistic to me. Winter and her family were living the \\"high life\\" one minute and out in the street the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down!","review":"This book was spellbounding. I could not put it down. I gave up my soap opera watching just to get to the next chapter. I enjoyed Sister Soulja's style of writing, she actually made me think about about my own ideas of material things. I have recommend this book to everyone I know. It's wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A PAGE TURNER","review":"Have you ever read of a book that leaves you speechless in a good kind of way? This is what Sister Souljah has managed to do with her first work of fiction.This has got to be one of if not the best pieces of fiction in it's class, that I've ever read. It's very real and believable. The author brought life to each and every character and gave you a front row seat in the life of a family dealing with the drug world.My hat's off to Sister Souljah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"After a long time, this is a really a book that makes you enjoy the read. You want to know how the story goes on and read on and on. I had it finished in two days. The characters are authentic and real. The storyline is interesting, compact and full of suspense. The genre is neither thriller nor drama nor crime story, but a blend of it all. Sister Souljah writes in a way that she is not evoking pity or even sympathy for the characters. She simply shows us the protagonists and their way of thinking. The protagonist Winter Santiaga even meets Sister Souljah herself in one chapter and is still steady in her character. No judging from Sister Souljah's side either. Very authentic. Like it was a real life story. A full hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very VERY Good!","review":"Sister Souljah, I really enjoyed this book! I did NOT want the story to end!

I look forward to the next novel.THANKS, a fellow Rutgers alumna!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Souljah you did Ya Thang!!","review":"Well firstoff this story was tha bomb! Winter is so classy and tells peeps that she is a bad girl. She really was selfish and greedy a little though. She shouldn't of stole from the AIDs benifet, or she shouldn't have hit the lady in the head with a sock. Anyway Winter is the best girl around in this novel.

I found it lacking and poorly written.The only thing the author managed to do with this book, was re-enforce very urban stereotype of our race and the female gender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"It's a wonder Sister Souljah doesn't strain her knees bowing to herself. I thought her first book, No Disrespect, was pretty good. But \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\" has very few redeeming qualities. Winter is the most unloveable, disagreeable and unlikeable protagonist I've come across. Frankly, the book is a waste of time and money -- unless you want to be really depressed by the time you finish it. The part I really disliked was where she said her father \\"broke it down so she could understand\\" why he killed her two uncles. Come on -- if you're smart enough to do all this stuff -- why can't she figure out things for herself? I know everyone else thinks this book is great -- and frankly, I do think Sister Souljah has done some great things. But writing this book really wasn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Hipe but Rather Disappointing... I feel cheated!","review":"By now, this book has compensated the author well, but it is not worth the purchase price that I paid for the ebook version. At 82% into the book, the author goes into this Q&A section about the book when we should have been reading 18% more about closure on the characters of the story. There was way too much explanation and justication about the author than necessary. She could have added much of this information to a blog or something similar.

She then reminded me that she had sent me a different book, with just as many pages and how fast I read it, so I sighed, agreed with her, and dived into the book.Let me say this. I loved this book! I mean I really loved this book! Winter stayed real the entire time. Yes, I hated her, but she was only doing what she was born, raised and bred to do. I held out hope for her, but she stayed true to her game until the end. I don't want to say to much for those who haven't read it, however I will say this, The coldest Winter Ever is the bomb, and I'm looking for a sequel as well as a movie!

Winter personifies the mentality of many who long to live the ghettofab lifestyle that we see in videos, movies and worst of all in our communities. The question arises, money or your soul? There is a little greed and selfishness (Winter) in all of us that kept us turning the pages. Hopefully the lesson we get from this book separates our ending from hers; menatlly numb and spiritually dead. Thanks SoulJAH for holding up that mirror!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a powerful account of materialism!","review":"This book is a excellent read into a lifestyle beyond my scope. It also tells the tale of what becomes important in a young person's life is set by their family's values early in life.

I normally read a book a week and this is still by far the best novel that I have ever read. I can't believe that it hasn't been picked up by one the great movie producers by now (such as Ice Cube, Spike Lee, John Singleton, etc). This book should have easily become a movie. It's well written and very entertaining. I especially love the fact that it's written from a woman's point of view and it's about a woman. It's one of the greatest hood stories ever told.

I was in need of new reading material, but running low on cash. (...) But once I began reading it I couldn't put it down until I finished every single page! My knowledge about Sister Souljah wasn't very deep at that time, so I had no idea she could write such vivid stories. Winter is a true \\"thug misses\\".

And by including herself as a character in the book, she leaves the reader with the question of exactly what is fictional and what isn't.I also wondered if this was a tool to feed her vanity because she, and her crew, were the only characters in this book with redeeming qualities.The biggest common denominator among ghetto dwellers is being poor -- not being stupid.Sistah Souljah is from the ghetto and she knows better.

Living in the neighborhood and city where the book is based, unfortunately I see Winters and Bullets everyday. What kills me is that these kids are chasing tangible items that they can not take with them when they are 6 feet under.The poem alone on the first page of the book described perfectly what is going on in today's world and brought tears to my eyes. I identified with many of Winters thoughts when I was younger and would have been Winter if I did not have a strong love base from my mother. Well, I know two soon to be Winters, aged 16 and 19.

This is the story of Winter, the attractive, wealthy and spoiled daughter of an urban drug lord. Early in the book, the father is arrested, convicted and jailed with all of his money and possessions confiscated by law enforcement. THE COLDEST WINTER EVER is the story of a displaced Winter and of her efforts to survive and prosper. It's a real-life scenario of what could and usually does happen to a young person with ghetto mentality who shuns education and legal employment to becomes deeply involved in crime and the illegal drug trade. The ending alone should prove a deterrent to some young people. The author was so \\"on-target\\" that it's hard to believe this is a first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh! My Gooooodness!!!","review":"My daughter turned me on to this book, I hadn't been interested in reading it for some reason, even though I admire Sistah Soujah. Once I started this book I could not put it down! And believe me, initially I wanted to! The first couple of chapters were quite raunchy, with a lot of sexual graphics (maybe my shyness was because my child gave the novel to me-even though she's 'legal' age now, I think of her as a \\"baby\\"); and this book's main characters' sexuality is certainly not naive innocent, or babyish! The ending, when it FINALLY comes, is very sad, almost disheartening; but there's a moral to the story - and it opens up your eyes concerning the drug world and those who make their money in it. Also, even though I think I'm quite sophisticated, I learned more about shopping, name brand clothing and their prices, and the advantages of life as a drug czar's BAP (if there is such a thing Winter was it), than I knew before I read this book. Good job Sistah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another clulesss sista.","review":"I finally read Souljah's first book. Winter Santiaga is like alot of other young brain dead girls. I was surprised how well Sister Souljah perfectly molded Winter into a ghetto princess. Winters world turned into a Ghetto Diva's dream into a young girls life spining out of control.I noticed in this book everytime Winter does something wrong she finds herself in a even worse situation. I only wish that the character Midnight was real, because he seemed so down with what these young immature girls out here are up to.

First of all, even though you download the software onto your computer, you still need to insert the cd into the computer each time you play. Secondly, the game play with computer opponents is terrible. You can choose from three different skill levels for the computer opponent. The more advanced their skill level, the higher the probaility that the computer opponent will have more favorable rolls, and a higher probability you will have less favorable rolls. This is too bad because I bought the game so my son could play by himself.

After you read/try to read The Woad to Wuin you will know what \\"because it isn't what they would expect\\" really means. Actually, I say that because David abuses the concept. Everytime I read it I envisioned the Airplane actor unplugging the lights to the runway saying \\"that's what they would expect us to do.\\" It just seemed to me that David wanted to unload his cliches and puns he hadn't found a real venue for. Do yourself a favor. Read David's other books. This one is not an effort worthy of his top 10. The book nearly dies midway after a terrific start. I almost wanted my money back.

A lot of the songs actually work here. Heaven 17's \\"With or Without You\\" kept teasing with the percussion not kicking in till almost the end of the song. Since I'm not into goth, it's hard for me to get into some of the songs. The Polecats version of Desire as previously mentioned has a ska-ish type feel.

I agree 100% with a tribute to U2 but tributes should not use the band's songs. It would be much better to write original songs, and would probably mean more to the said band. Anyone else playing the songs is an insult to the band. Especially \\"One.\\" That's the best song ever written in the history of rock'n'roll and no one but U2 has the right and is worthy enough to sing or play it. This is just wrong. I am a long time and dedicated U2 fan and this is wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Place","review":"I own 38 U2 CDs, and this is the worst one. I love U2; they are my favorite band. My love for the four Irish boys is so large that I like every single U2 song, even tracks such as \\"Red Light\\" and \\"Babyface.\\" I am curious as to how it is possible for U2's music to sound so horrific. In general, tribute CDs are an invitation for disappointment because they're never going to sound as good as the original. But perhaps, you hope, you might here some new and unusual adaptations of classic material. \\"We Will Follow\\" plumbs the depths. A few tracks have promise, but then after thirty or forty seconds they too begin to stink. If you are interested in a tribute CD, pick up \\"Zoovenir.\\" It's tough to order and continually out of stock, but if you manage to get it, it's got some worthwhile stuff. \\"We Will Follow\\" is the worst of my U2 collection. This is the only U2 CD I could ever give one star. DO NOT WASTE your money! Even if this were selling for 25 cents, you'd be better off buying a pack of gum."},{"rating":"1","title":"One heckuva disgrace","review":"Whether you're a U2 fan or not, this CD should disgust anybody. Most of it is pretty much techno and bad techno at that. The passion that Bono put into the original recordings is completely absent here and is replaced by mind-numbing repetition and horrendous vocals.

When you understand the history of money and how it came to be today, it becomes clearer what we need to do in order to achieve financial stability.

Lightweight, closed, earbud, volume control, ones that elimanate outside noise, and ones like these, behind the neck headphones.One thing I have to say is, they are actually pretty comfortable, unlike other types of behind-the-neck headphones. The sound quality on them is pretty good, with banging bass and clear highs and lows. They aren't too expensive, and they are kind of portable.One thing I do have to point out. The cord is kind of short. Though, for portable player listeners, this shouldn't be a problem. Though, you'll feel like a dog on a leash if you use them for a computer were you have to hook them up far away (that is if you don't have a headphone plug on your speakers.)Overall, these are a good buy.

There is no comparison. I imagine if you waited until the last moment and had done essentially no review, would be satisfied with a 3 or less on the AP test, Smartypants might help you see the basics of the basic - much like a conceptual chemistry book might assist you with the real deal. But why would you bother when there are other review books and material online that are so much more thorough? I felt this book was over priced and woefully inadequate: it had big print, was double spaced and a mere 117 pages, including tests. And speaking of test questions... you'd be much better off using your textbook's companion website than using these questions. I'm giving Smartypants a thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Great as the Reviews Say","review":"This book is mediocre at best. It offers invalid practice tests and too broad of a summary on each thing. It doesnt pinpoint what is on the Ap exam very well at all. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone.

Being a respectable professional in the environmental science field, I question how this book can help anyone out at all, with the construction of the exam today.

The pins for this watch band are not interchangable with the leather straps. You can purchase replacement pins for the leather straps however, for this \\"two-tone Band\\" you are out of luck. In my opinion extra pins should be a part of this watch band's package or at least the \\"smart folks\\" that designed it should be aware that the pins can become loose and fallout. If I am totally wrong and I can purchase replacement pins please let me know other than that 1/2 star for this poorly designed product.

I was very proud to read about such a great man, who did the courageous things that he did at the time that he did them and to be able to call him Grandfather, was a treasured moment. Thank you to the Author for writing the book. What most people do not know is that Freedom of Religion and Separation of Church and State were ideas that he was the first to fight for in America.

Covers an important (and large) segment of history from 1419 to 1820, and the player can choose to play any country in the entire world. Absolutely fascinating. For anyone who ever enjoyed Civilization type games, this is a definite must-buy. In fact, it is far better both in accuracy and playability than its competitor Civilization III which of course has a lot more marketing. Not for stupid people or those who dislike history, geography, politics, or economics. Historical realism rather than political correctness. Several historical scenarios covering different periods, but the best is of course the Grand Campaign.

The amount of mathematical variables involved in the economy (that thankfully is automated by the AI) is also on a GRAND SCALE.Europa Universalis II builds oupon Europa I and adds more depth and decision making and plenty of random events that make the game flow like real life and gives the player a true sense of ruling, or at least attempting to rule, the WORLD.I just hope Crusader Kings can live up to the standard that has been set by this terrific game."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring games made after 2000!!","review":"I was hoping for another great stratagy game that I could add to my large collection of PC games. I usually love Stratagey games, but this game is an exception. The game is very buggy and feels cheesy. For example, when you try to click on something, it takes many clicks before it gets the messgage. And no it isn't lag.I forced myself to play it for several hours thinking that if I gave it a chance, I'd learn to like it, but I just hated it more an more with every waking moment. This game reminds me of a much downgraded civilization 2. Trust me. There a many good stratagey games out there. This just isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"This game was great. I have been playing it for almost a year and I'm still not board with it. I really like history and this has a lot tied in with it. The goal is to have the highest score by 1819 and many things go into that score. You get scored for winning battles,winning wars,having a strong economy,and for succesful diplomatic negotiating. The game is slow for people who like fast action games but is great for people who want an fun game and a small education to go with it.

Good quality prints. Alternative head cleaning method.","review":"I've had nothing but great results with this printer, but like most ink jets, after a year or two the print head clogs up and despite all the head-cleaning and deep-head-cleaning you do, the problem just gets worse. The nice thing about this printer is that the print head is removable, and so this allows for some creative head cleaning methods that you can't always do with other printers. Randy K's method is very nice, and here's an alternative that worked well for me. Remove the ink cartridges and then the print head. Run the print head under warm water and shake it around. If there's a clog in one or more of the colors (in my case it was magenta) you'll see that color ink washing out. Look on the inside and wipe out any ink that you see seeping out with a q-tip. Reapeat this step until you see no more ink coming out. Then thoroughly dry the head out (like overnight in front of an AC or fan) and then put everything back together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Printer","review":"I like this printer a lot- very easy to use, great customer support.

Alas, that same reviewer forgot to mention an interesting fact, that Said in his introduction trumpeted his scorn and contempt for those mighty irresponsible and unfair warnings of terror attacks against the U.S. Kudos for these words of wisdom. For some reason, my professor sternly declared that the World Trade Center attacks make this book EVEN MORE RELEVANT (cue for a Martin Kramer tirade).A simple exercise: When you see your authority stumbling headlong into the muck, try reevaluating your own perceptions before singing a paean for a feat well done (that means avoiding \\"Seeing his bedraggled mug reaffirms his dexterity and aptitude\\" kind of thinking). And on a less merry note, use this book only as a first hand proof that Said's critics are indeed right."},{"rating":"1","title":"antihistorical","review":"For those of you not familiar with Edwards Said's unabashed support of terror groups AND getting caught in complete lies about his own privileged nonPalestinian background, do some research.

Being a Palestenian Christian, it is obvious he wouldn't simply side with the East because of his religious ties with Islam. The book is very fair in showing exactly how the West's propaganda against the Middle East is a self-fulfilled prophecy. It's undoing will certainly be its downfall. This is a must read for anyone who wants to understand some tenets of journalism and is definately a must read for anyone who has ever taken an anthropology class. Pick it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Said once again masters the ability to search deep into a subject and without any prejudice can bring insight and understanding to a readers mind. Great Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I looked forward to this book, but ended up disappointed. Said spent a good deal of time criticising a range of other's arguments, without giving views of his own.

His work delves deeply into how pseudo-intellectual Hollywood and the'yellow' media often brand (most of the time) people of Middle East culture as the 'bad guy' or the one who 'must have planted the bomb,' etc... Covering Islam is a great book, not just in its clear-cut shining examples of how people often unconsciencely discriminate, but also in its well researched scholarship. Mr. Said explains and points out the subtleties of what is being taught in schools today, what is on the radio, television and movie screens. His fluid writing style and insights, I believe, will help people to become less subservient to the ideas and opinions expressed by the 'still-learning' media."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book intended to put honest journalism on the defensive","review":"The book attempts to discredit any honest and straightforward revelation of events in the Arab and Moslem world. It unjustly portrays those critical of attitudes of Arab and Moslem governments and societies as having a colonial and prejudiced mentality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Covering up on Islam?","review":"Is this what the author is suggesting? Covering up on the crimes committed in Moslem countries. This cover up is indeed practiced by the media. Since the sixties, more than 1.5 million Christians were killed in the Southern Sudan, and this genocide is till now well concealed from world public opinion. But the book is not satisfied with that. It urges the media to explain away terror, bigotry, and racism if they occurr in the Moslem world. He also wants the media not to report on the mysogenic attitude in Moslem societies. Is it not the moral duty of a fair journalist to report on the mistreatment of women in the Arab world, on their genital mutilation, their inferior status? The pity is that if what the author recommends is adhered to, more suffering will occur in the Arab world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Propaganda At Best","review":"I was forced to suffer through this rubbish in a college class. This book is merely propaganda packaged under a thin dust jacket of objectivity. The arguments are weak and contrived. Said seems to be just another appologetic for Islamic barbarism. The very premise for the book seems irrelevant -unfair potrayal of Islam in the western press. It's the very typical \\"don't believe what you see, believe what I say\\" sort of drivel that only appeals to mindless drones in dusty lands."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bet you've never heard of them...","review":"I bet you've never heard of them but there's a lot of talent here.

But it's all good stuff.The recording quality is poor by most standards but once you realize they play the music, do the recording, and cut their own records you'll appreciate it. In fact the poor sound quality is sort of \\"their sound\\" and is instantly recognizable once you listen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"good introductory book for taxation","review":"It is a good book to get started with some basic concepts and framework behind taxation. The book is well written and easy to read, even for people with very limited knowledge in taxation or accounting.However, it seems to me each edition was released so early that a lot of contents had not been updated thoroughly. Many examples were still using from these from 2-3 years back. This does hamper me from getting the most update to date information. For the price I am paying, I would expect something perfect or near perfect:)After all, I had to admit that it is a good introductory taxation book for students who are interested in taxationI had to point out that it would not be the best book that people want to use it do their own personal income tax. For the later purpose, I would suggest to spend less than 15 bucks for a yearly edition tax form book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for problem solving","review":"I didn't like this textbook at all: on one hand, it is easy enough to read (with the simple examples throughout the chapters), on the other hand, it doesn't give you any guidance on how to do the homework problems, which totally differ from the chapter examples. Many of the most important rules were not in the body of the chapter but in a tiny footnotes, which you are constantly required to use in homework problems. Unless you have a great instructor, who can explain the steps for performing tax plannig cases and problems, I would not recommend this book for students who are not familiar with tax laws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set, not very complete","review":"Good set but very limited.

I cannot recommend this book highly enough, especially in the face of the recent wave of sickly-sweet children's picture books now crowding the publishers' shelves.

I don't regret it at all. Using the Music Generator is so much fun-- mostly because it's so intuitive and hassle-free. You can make Rock, Techno, House, Beat or Bass & Drums tracks, choosing & editing hundreds of bass lines, drum loops, melodies, vocals, percussion and sound effects (like scratching). I was just a little dissappointed that you can't make hip-hop tracks, but considering the price, I can't complain. Besides making your own songs you can also join a group online in \\"Music Jam\\" and mix interactively with people from all over the world, or create a 3D video to accompany your song. You can also convert your songs to MP3 or WAV format if you want to burn them onto a CD.

Naysayers can tell you it's a system 'designed for kids,' but in truth it has something for everybody. Surely, Resident Evil isn't a \\"kid's game?\\" Madden 2002? And what about the XBox? It's overpriced, under-engineered and just not well thought out. It has a hard-disk drive, a component with a high rate of failure. It's hideously oversized and the controllers are just as malformed. Microsoft has been trying to buy the support of Japanese game-makers for years. this hasn't gotten them anywhere. Nintendo already has the support.

My policy on GCN is \\"wait and see\\" for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Costly","review":"I have been saving money for a GameCube for about 5 months.

Now that I get on the internet and look, all that people sell are \\"Starter Packs\\" and I cannot afford tose. It makes me mad. I do like the items in the pack (the games and controllers), but there are too many items and it is much too costly. What about: GameCube, 1 Contoller, 1 memory card, and Luigi's Mansion? That is nice, small, and not so costly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nintendo is back...","review":"Well they've done it again. Here we have another system from nintendo where nothing has really changed. I was a hardcore fan until the nintendo 64, but since have found their games childish, the graphics blocky and their developers are also leaving much to be desired. After losing long time backers like squaresoft I would have thought that they would have learned, but it looks like a cool looking system with a new type of game set-up(cd finally instead of cartridge), but nothing has actually been vastly improved. I hope nintendo will change its ways before it becomes the next SEGA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I actually would really like a gamecube right now, but WHY can't they just have a simple gamecube for sale? Why do they have to bundle it with a ton of stuff that not everyone may want right away?

Come on you guys let the little gamers have a chance to play too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH","review":"... The XBOX controller is the size of the whole gamecube. This pack comes with three awesome games. ALthough Luigi's Mansion only takes about 8 hours to complete, its so fun that you will find your self going back to it to complete it again. Wave Race is one of the best multi-player games out(next to SSBM, Fifa, and SSX). You can cruise along as a mess of players and a whole bunch of levels. THe weather can also differ. it can be rainy, nice, cloudy, storming and many other options. Star Wars is also a great game. You can be a Y wing, Xwing B wing, Millenium Falcon, tie fighter and a speeder. The graphis for all three games are incredible and is very durable. The controllers are also very comfortable. THey feel like they were made for your hamd. They curve around the side and have an indentation at the R and L buttons.

But then my brother bought an N64, and my views on games changed forever. Bottom line is Nintendo make the most fun games around. You will not find any better multiplayer action on any other console. Basically what I'm saying is, if you have no friends and are a really boring person, buy a PS2 or X-Box. But if you love having fun with your friends, Gamecube is the only console to bother with. Just ignore all the people who complain about it's appearance or it's lack of a DVD drive or whatever. If you want a DVD player, why waste $300 on one with X-Box? Just buy a proper DVD player and save the rest of your cash for the console that'll give you the best games and the most fun.

GameCube will be the best system ever better than PS2 because they had to add a DVD player to it to make sure it sold and that's one reason why it did. I think Nintendo is still the top video game retailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"If you don't feel like shelling out 300 bucks for a video game system, but still want to be part of the action, then the GameCube is a great thing to get. If you already have a DVD player (which a lot of people do) then why should you pay extra for another one that isn't as good as most DVD players? With GameCube you don't get all that extra stuff, all you get is a great game system- which is all you should want. Plus, the games are a lot better too- Nintendo has always made fun games, and there are plenty of great third party ones too. Where else can you play Mario, Zelda, Pikmin, Eternal Darkness, Perfect Dark, and all those other great Nintendo games? Only on the GameCube. And where else can you find a system for 100 bucks that does just what you want it to do and does it well? Nowhere. Even if you do have the cash for an Xbox or a PS2 (which needs a MAJOR price drop!) a GameCube is still gonna be just as good or better than both of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUCH XBOX","review":"This system has very good graphics and the gameplay is much smoother than PS2,PS1, Xbox, and N64.

I would have if it wasn't so pricey but I have played it enough to know it is better than the Xbox and PS2 because Microsoft and Sony tried to do too many things and NOT just focus on making a good video game console like Nintendo did. So if it fits your budget I highly recomend you to buy it.Gamecube Rules!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gamecube isn't that great","review":"Gamecube is not that great. It has a litle better graphics and color than n64. Overall it doesnt make a big difference. Your better of with Xbox they have almost two times the amount of games for Xbox than gameube. I would say Xbox is much better. The games aren't that fun. They are boring. So whoever wants boring games and a system that is no better than n64 this is for you. Yu cant even play DVD's on it.

They concentrate on built on things that if you get them seperate It would cost the same amount as the X-Box. Plus they don't work that well!! Buy a real DVD player. Plus who doesn't like charecters like Mario, Luigi, Zelda, Star Fox, and many other charecters?

Everything else, though, from the clarity of the sound for a 1939 mono, the quality of the soloists, etc. is great.Now, it's true that the woman tend to get flat in the upper register, but I have to believe that's primarily an artifact of this being a 1939 recording in a cavernous space, and a mono recording to boot.That said, I'd take this over a lot of stereo versions of later date.(Oh, and as to the reviewer who favorably compared this to Karajan?

For those of us raised on the Soli/Price recording, or Giulini and Christa Ludwig, this one feels clean and sparse - but not rushed. It's all the more poignant, given that this was recorded in the Rome Opera House in 1939, with Europe on the verge of WWII.As lush and sonically wonderful as many of the newer recordings are, Serafin's interpretation has a musical clarity that others lack. It feels less of an opera, and more of a Requiem.If you are singing or conducting the Verdi Requiem, you need to listen to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"We have many Melissa & Doug puzzles, but the quality has deteriorated a lot over time.The wood is a cheap layers of plywood glued together very poorly.

That spool holds it lid even more securely than the cable within. Oh, I got the cable out alright, by breaking that freakin spool apart! Fortunately the cable works fine, and was quite inexpensive to match the cheapness of the execution of the product I imagine. So if you want a inexpensive ext-cable, it's fine.

They were enough to convince me that the book is dated (published in 2002 but no citations dated after 1990). But much worse is the terrible stream-of-consciousness writing \\"style.\\"Evidently, the principal authors recognized that they needed help, so they list an editorial assitant on the title page. But that assistant must not have seen the manuscript, or he would not have let through such howlers as \\"... it carry's (sic) with it the probability ...\\". Or how about the list of criteria for causal inference (pages 54-56). It consists of one non sequitur after another.And if all of this isn't bad enough, the brief discussion of statistical methods in Chapter 3 should demonstrate that the authors are clueless about basic biostatistics.So, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit!","review":"The item arrived promptly and despite of my worry that it wouldn't fit, it did.

I feel like in a minute way, I've participated in the story of a saintly soul and a spiritual flower. As Cardinal O'Connor once put it, being a saint meant doing THE best that you can. It is not lost on me that Fr. Hamilton was truly a gifted and happy young man who desperately lovingly wanted to do the will of Jesus by becoming a priest and offered his very self in the process. His story reminded me of St. Therese, for his life seemed to consist of doing little things with great love, including his seminarian studies day by day. How I wish I could have had him as a parish priest or a friend.

Some of the best games, such as Twisted Metal Black, Nintendo wouldn't touch with a 20 foot pole. I love the PS2, because of the games and power. The Gamecube will have a little bit more power than PS@, but not much, and with no games backing it up. The PS2 is already the console of the holiday season, and three of the hilodays must buy games are on the PS2.

USE VINEGAR FOR THAT. Also, use generic bleach in place of Drano. Bleach is easier on metal pipes and a lot cheaper.CLR IS ALMOST ODORLESS (MUCH BETTER THAT LIME-A-WAY) but it bites the skin. So, the next time I will wear gloves.USING CLR, I folded a Scotch-Brite heavy duty scouring pad and saturated it with CLR. I scrubbed the shower tile both ceramic and glass. After rinsing, the tiles were bright, like new. The white hue was gone. I also scrubbed the corners where the wall and floor tiles meet. I had noticed blackness that looked like mold. IT DISAPPEARED. CLR also removed the calcium deposits from the nickel plated fixtures.Our water in East Texas is supposed to be river water. That means \\"soft\\" water to me. So, where does the calcium come from? I do not know but do know where it went. It went down the drain and into the sewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"If you have calcium on anything this is the stuff to buy, I have used it for years and it really works.

It made absolutely no difference on the stains or in the mineral deposits in the humidifier. On top of that, it had a very strong, toxic smell. I'd recommend looking at something else instead of buying this. A pumice stone will often work on rust deposits. Baking soda and a strong brush do as much or more than this did -- and without the fumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kills Coffee Makers","review":"The smell of the CLR never came out of our Zojirushi drip coffee maker after running many gallons of water through it. CLR's manufacturer (Jelmar) said that this only occurs in coffee makers with carbon water filters, only in rare cases. Meanwhile our Zojirushi doesn't have a water filter. Jelmar also said the CLR can react with certain metals/chemicals like Tephlon, and that this is a risk of use (meanwhile the label doesn't list any such precautions). Thus, I caution anyone from using CLR in any food or drink application since there is a chance of residual smell or a chemical reaction that could impact your food, and therefore you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Works Or Hardly Works","review":"We have a brown/red rust problem from our well water.

But it surely does not match the standard of Lonely Planet and similar guides.

The shelf came with two 2\\" wood screws. Here's the list of problems:1. The concept is you sink these wood screws into the wall and hang the shelf on them using keyhole slots. IF I could sink the screws correctly, I suspect I'd never get a good, tight mount to the wall... the shelf would always droop.2. I'd like to sink the wood screws into the studs... but the keyhole slots are 24\\" apart!3. No drywall anchors were included.I'm not sure if it is easier to rig my own mounting system or just build a similar shelf myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"The shelves are mediocre at best. I was disappointed by the quality of the shelves and the installation method. Due to the fact that the shelves are installed using two screws and nothing else I do not trust them to hold much weight. Overall very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love These Shelves","review":"I have six of these shelves in my home for 2+ years. I have had no problem with them holding what I have put on them, even the one above the deck door (this door is opened and shut quite a lot). I worried about the keyhole mount myself, but went to Home Depot and bought the drywall anchors that screw into the wall (I believe the instructions tell you to purchase what works best on your walls). It took me a couple of times to get the screw to the right depth to tightly hold the shelf, but once I did the shelf was solid against the wall. They come in wide variety of lenghts and the width is just right for what I display on them. They look great. I plan on buying a couple of more as soon as I get paint on the wall. I highly recommmend them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shape, Well Packed","review":"The fact it arrived on time, in great shape, and packed nicely, is enough for me for a research material book.

I think that it is excellent in terms of organization, theme development and certainly vocabulary; however, I cannot excuse the lack of updating. The copyright is 1995 and since then, several countries have joined the European Union, the Euro has become THE currency of Europe - not to mention the technological advances that have occurred in the past 8-9 years! I beg Gudrun Clay to update this otherwise superb classroom tool - it's a waste to just let it sit. As a result of the lack of updating, I cannot recommend this book for the classroom.

This should be in every high school guidance counsellor's office, every career office, every library. It just makes plain sense out of all the strange goings-on of our military.

It seemed she traded one life of bondage for another...to the home of a much older man who seduced her as a very young girl. I expected her to find the true Christian faith upon leaving the Amish but it seems she is only exploiting her past. I was totally disgusted by the twice divorced man she chose to marry and with whom she became intimate before he was divorced and (naturally) before they were married. Certainly, if she were indeed seeking biblical truth, she would have known that was wrong (sin). It seems she is just in total rebellion against her parents. I hated that I had actually paid money for this book and expected it to be Christian in nature. This one will not be given to our church's library. I'm sorry I wasted my time reading it but I took it along on vacation and felt obligated to finish it once I started it. Money in the pockets of these these two...ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book, but had to finish it!","review":"This book was terrible, poorly written. Irene was bashing the Amish, but really she was mad at her father more than anything, and he represented anything Amish. I was just disgusted reading this book. I hated it but had to finish it, like when you pass a terrible car wreck you just have to slow down and look. Irene and Ollie are just profiting off the Amish. I am ashamed that I put money in Irene and Ollie's pocket by purchasing this book. And Ollie totally disgusts me. I wish there were pictures of both of them on the cover, though I have my opinion of what they both look like."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this author","review":"I would not recommend this book or any by the author!!!!!!! I would have given zero stars if possible. this is one womans alleged story, not a true representation of the Amish people.This author who had NOTHING good to say about the Amish in her book Crossing Over is just trying to make $ on the Amish! She has recently been on the news portraying the Amish people as monsters, abusers etc. Ruth actually complains that the amish don't want her in their stores (gee I wonder why?) and is complaining they violated her rights no less! Will she think the Amish should stock her book next in their stores?Do yourself and the Amish a favor and don't support this author. Carrie Bender and Beverly Lewis and Lindaa byler (Lizzie books) write well written books about the Amish"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff, not enough substance","review":"This book could have been so much more. While it makes for an interesting personal story, it is lacking in the depth and detail that could have made it so much better. There isn't really anything new here for those interested in learning more about the Amish way of life and the difficulties one faces after leaving it. Several chapters of the book seemed to be \\"padded\\" in order to stretch the story long enough to be bound as a book. For those interested in a light, easy read, it will be an enjoyable journey. For those lusting for the gritty details of Amish life, it will be a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"very interesting","review":"As someone who finds the whole Amish existence to be fascinating, I was very interested in reading this book. The only thing wrong with it is that it was too short! It held my attention. This book provides insight into the true story of Ruth Irene Garrett. Born and raised Amish, she fell in love with an \\"Englisher\\". Wanting more out of life and searching for answers, she had to leave behind her family and was ultimately shunned by her family and the community. Her story is told with truth and Love. A real glimpse into what is certainly a society that most of us can only imagine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderate","review":"The book gave insight to the more conservative Amish lifestyles but her explanations for their hard life leaves one to wonder if her husband isn't just a free loader. She is definitely the worker in that family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes interesting, not well-written","review":"This is a sometimes interesting, more often cumbersome read. The abundance of sentence fragments is distracting and made me wonder what her \\"co-author\\" did to earn his money besides interview people who wouldn't speak to her. The use of her estranged family members' personal letters at the beginning of each chapter feels intrusive; they obviously didn't give their permission. I'm a little skeptical of her husband's intentions, but she seems happy, so who am I to judge? Overall, this book is OK but disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow I love it.","review":"I really enjoyed getting some facts from the other side about the Amish.

I took it along to the beach, thinking my friend would like to read it, started it out on our balcony just because it was there, and didn't put it down until I was finished. A quick read, but it was interesting AND I learned a few things.I'm not normally \\"into\\" these types of books, but for some reason, I obtained a copy thinking I might, maybe, some day be interested in it, and I read it through in one sitting.The only thing I didn't like is that it doesn't really end. I mean, this woman is still alive and still on her life's journey, but the book was written in 2001, and it kind of just....stops. I would have liked more of a conclusion or something, I don't know.But I was interested enough that when I return from the beach, I will do some searching on the internet to find out what she and her husband have been up to since 2001. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible book","review":"This has to be one of the most simplistic books I have ever read.

Read \\"Growing Up Amish; A Memoir\\" by Ira Wagler. Read \\"Prophet's Prey\\" by Sam Brower. (Also not great, but certainly better than this.) Best of all, read \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" by Jon Krakauer. It is a great book that also happens to have a great title. Well researched and fascinating. This, however, is neither. This is simply a story chockful of Bible passages and letters from the family begging Ruth to come back which all sound the same after awhile taking up a lot of space, and a thin story line tieing it together. Sorry, but I found the idea of a young Amish girl taking up with a much older, 450-pound man less than desirable and even kind of creepy.If you listen closely, you can hear the whisper \\"I sold my story for the money\\" behind this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing..","review":"Like the other reviewers, I have been disturbed by this book, supposedly about escaping Amish life.All through its reading, I was more concerned about the obese guy, quarter of a century older than the heroine who seems to have nefarious intentions.I am sorry if that sounded harsh but that is the truth. I was disturbed by this man who was willing to date so young a girl, take her away and \\"save\\" her from Amish life.I wish the author and her husband every happiness but this book was still to me...just disturbing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstructured drivel","review":"I read this book for a book club, and do not recommend it. It has no literary value, and does not even provide much insight into Amish life. Instead, the author gives only random recollections and gripes about the Amish. The book is loaded with filler--lots of excerpts of letters, blank pages, and wide margins to hide the fact that it has little content. Nothing about the writing is worth mentioning. The author leaves her life with the Amish to lead what sounds like a completely pedestrian and uninteresting life (living off of her older husband's disability pension). I cannot think of any reason to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dreary tale","review":"This is a sad and strange tale of a woman who leaves an oppressive Amish family and community for a morbidly obese, thrice divorced, unemployable man who is 25 years her senior. I was especially disturbed when upon escaping in his van, this knight in shining armor hands her an electric razor and tells her she must shave her legs if she's going to be his wife! The author is young, and still very naive about the world. I'd be interested in reading a followup story ten years down the road when, hopefully, she'll have developed keener analytical skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Boring","review":"Not well written. Boring story, not orderly. Kept waiting for more in depth information. Wanted to learn more, but was left hanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I enjoyed learning about the Amish people, but feel the writer was very young and naive and certainly DID NOT find her prince! I felt very sorry for her. Like another reader said...would like to see a follow up in 10 years or so and see if she still feels the same about her husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"Made for TV\\" script - light and simple","review":"Ms. Garrett does indeed show intense courage to overcome the confines of her heritage. However, she only acknowledges the values of her upbringing quite sparingly. In fact, the only instance I recall some level of scrutiny and analysis is her comments on the crass commercialism of the \\"English\\" Christmas.The manner by which Mr Farrant has conveyed Ms. Garrett's story does not convey her internal struggles, other than her concern for her mother and resolve over her father's personality.In short, the story is a light and simple read where the narrator doesn't delve into the meanings of certain Amish practices and attitudes (e.g. materialism) but raises their significance only in symptoms as they apply to her. There is absolutely no ecunemical analysis or likewise introspection, however, that might be alright for the audience that Mr. Farrant intended the story for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tranquility ATN (All-through-the-Night) Fitted Briefs Size Small","review":"I am certain that by design the product is just fine.

The band swivels at four points - each end of the watch face and each side of the clasp. So you can flip the band over when you want the pearly side and back again when you want plain gold.

My husband loves the scent as do I, and every few months we would order a new bottle. Shipping time was efficient and it smelled great.This last time, however, the smell was watered down and lasted only about half an hour where as the bottles we have received in the past lasted him all day. We even compared an almost empty bottle with the new bottle and the scent was distinctly watered down and even a little different.Amazon, however was quick to refund us upon hearing our complaint.

It has an unusual fragrance for men of lavander, roses, and cinnamon - without it being not unquestionably manly. And this was an anchievement of sorts, as a flowery fragrance is typically associated with women. There exist two downsides, however. The first is that it does not hold very well, and the second plays off the first. It is slightly cloying. So I believe CK needs to refine this cologne - and Euphoria Intense is not the answer. Yet even still, this is an intriguing cologne, if not excellent, and meant for sporty/informal events, school wear, or a night's out, rather than for formal wear or the office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"This cologne smells great and seriously only lasts about 3 minutes.

It smells great but lacks all the other qualities a good cologne should have namely Projection (how well others can smell it on you) and Longevity (how long it lasts). Euphoria fades away after about 1 hr and you can maybe smell a small trace on you if you hold your nose right up to where you sprayed it. Nobody will know you are even wearing it unless you reapply every hour. I have never had this problem with another CK fragrance, but this is the common complaint about Euphoria.

Many simply won't appreciate this difference, so they might prefer to get a CD with the stereo versions. However, for musical power, these mono masters pack a punch and are a blast to listen to.

If you're looking for stereo mixes, this isn't the collection for you. That issue aside, the only real criticism of the album is one of programming-- songs tend to be clustered by artist or group. Perhaps a more thorough shuffle was in order.Each CD jewel case is fronted with a repro of a Gordy Co. label, including one of the very first MOTOWNs, which was pale pink in color. The accompanying 68-page long box book is quite comprehensive. Recording dates for all songs and chart positions are given. There's lots of great photos; artists and groups are given a few pages of bio each. This HITSVILLE USA four-CD box set is fairly extensive, and about all you'd ever need in a compilation of MOTOWN 45s.TOTAL RUNNING TIMES --DISC ONE -- 76:10DISC TWO -- 75:21DISC THREE -- 77:09DISC FOUR -- 74:10"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars x 2 = 10 stars","review":"I was born in Los Angeles in 1957,so I was pretty young when these songs came out. On Los Angeles AM radio in the early 60's. The top songs were easygoing safe stuff. Any time a Motown song came on you just had to dance,you couldn't help yourself. This HITSVILLE U.S.A. is the best collection of Motown hits by far. From the early days of Smokie Robinson & the Miracles,Supremes,Martha and the Vandellas,Four Tops and The Temptations to The Jackson five,Rare Earth. The standerd was always higher then anything else out there! Take it from the little white boy from LA who has kids of my own now. They hear these songs,and just have to dance.Todays music it's hard to find any music that will grab you this way,and not turn you lose. MAKES A GREAT GIFT,TOO!

It contained songs that I couldn't recognize at first but the longer they played the more familiar they became. A real treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL IN MONO-DO NOT BUY!","review":"Do NOT buy this collection. While the song selection is very good I want to know why Motown could not and did not issue this collection in stereo when a great portion of these songs are available in stereo on other albums. This is a cheap ploy by Motown to suck in your money. The second Hitsville Box 2 is in stereo, but the song selection is poor. I repeat, if you want a quality box set collection that is well engineered and in stereo, do NOT include this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motown","review":"I saw this album while watching a PBS special about the grestest Motown groups of the 60's. Had to have it. Sure glad I bought it to add to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive 50's collection","review":"If you're a Motown fan, this is a must have. The recording quality is very good considering the era, and the selection of songs is right up my alley. Most people don't realise the extent of the contribution of Motown Records to the music of the Fifty's and Sixty's. This collection will surely elighten you. The supplied booklet is very well done and each CD has a different label that Barry Gordy used on his records. If I was just starting out to build a collection of early Rock and Roll, this would be the first one I'd buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Much All You Need","review":"There are so many good songs here, you can't go wrong. Don't let the whole 'mono' thing scare you away, either. With a decent stereo, these sound just fine. Just turn up the bass a little and crank it loud. I like about 80% of the songs in this collection, and for the price you can't go wrong; Nice booklet w/ lots of cool pictures included. With this collection, you'd only need to buy a handful of other discs to complete your Motown collection..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best memoir ever","review":"I have been looking for this book forever and because it was out of print I had to go to the library every time I wanted to read it, which was often. The only copy I could find was $200. This book really tells the truth to what it was like as a person in the Imperial family. This puts an end to a lot of rumors flying around about Rasputin and Anna Anderson. This was told from a trusted person, someone that Olga trusted to put the truth about her family out there. It is beautiful and compassionate and a fabulous historical read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same mistakes as Dad . . .","review":"Sarah Hudson is making the same mistakes her father made 30 years ago when he traded in self-respect to be a \\"Monkees\\" characterized entertainer on the short lived \\"Hudson Brothers\\" tv show. Now daughter Sarah is being dressed up and marketed, not in the feel good 60s vibe, but the current pseudo postpunk teen angst marketing gimmick. Already beaten to the punch by Fiona Apple and Avril Lavigne, she is behind the curve. Sadly, her immense talent, like her father's, will be lost because she cashed in on the misery gimmick of the movie \\"Thirteen\\" and \\"Kids.\\" Now in her late twenties, she is still dressing up like a miserable high schooler. It is amazing that she has songs about being angry at her folks when a recent documentary shows her so close to her father. A song about how her folks mean to her really would have made her stand out from the crowd. Image over substance takes down another amazing voice. See you in the discount bins Sarah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh, Outstanding...don't miss this!","review":"Every once in a while a truly fresh talent crests over the wasteland that is the cookie-cutter manufactured music industry...such is the case with Sarah Hudson.These songs are fresh, hungry, angry, sad, giddy, sexy, powerful pop at its powerful best. There isn't a predictable lyric or melody in there for those with ears tired of the Ashley Simpsons and Brittany Spears...This is a powerful voice, both in sound and on paper...she speaks to generations of gals and does so with a gleeful glint of sly in her eye...This is the music industry's best kept secret...This CD will become your favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"Sarah Hudson's album has been compared to Skye Sweetnam's 'Noise From The Basement'. WHAT? There is no comparison - Skye Sweetnam has actual talent. While Sarah...What sort of lyrics are - \\"I can't hold on forever/I know that you know I know\\" and \\"I wanna go shopping like Wynona Ryder\\" and \\"you better lock your doors/the bitch is back.\\"?\\"Naked Truth\\" is not about the music. This album is about manufacturing a woman trying to be a girl, singing about things that she's too old to identify with. The tunes are trying their best to be hardcore - but they arent. Sarah is trying her best to be Skye Sweetnam - but she's not.Besides, Skye Sweetnam is actually a great role model for youngsters. Sarah is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nah","review":"This cd didn't keep me hooked...got very bored :-\\\\I did like track 3- \\"strange\\" But I didn't care for much more.So \\"Strange\\" gets a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Velvet Vocals !","review":"Sarah Hudson has strong velvet vocals, and this is a crunching CD that can't be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfull","review":"What a video and i can say that it is the best yet as i watched it my soul was so blessed and my spirit was so lifted.My husband works a 12 hr shift and i have many of the gaither vidoes which i watch espically at night.All i can say is keep up the good work and God bless."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM.","review":"WONDERFUL MUSIC TO DANCE TO OR JUST LISTEN.

I like the cardio and the fact that she takes it back to basics your not doing some off the wall thing to your body. You just need some weights and a mat . I love it !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work Out Vid!","review":"I really love Jackie's set of work outs here. Each one is twenty minutes long and tailored to a specific part of your body. Jackie is encouraging and explains each exercise in a simple way I have never seen before. Mixing cardio and strength training, anyone is sure to benefit from her easy to follow routines based on upper body, lower body, and core training. You can do each twenty minute work out alone, or combine them together for a forty or sixty minute ultra work out. I really enjoy this DVD for working out. Nothing has motivated me to work out more than this. I actually look forward to pressing play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout!","review":"At first I couldn't get past the way the \\"trainers\\" looked, with their painted on abs and odd behavior. But I guess they are reality stars (which I didn't know before I bought the DVD) and they are in L.A., so I guess I should have expected the extra makeup if not the silly banter; but the workout is really good and I am sore after I do it. I really love the 30 day shred but we can't stick with the same workout forever. I would recommend this for anyone who needs something after the shred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great strength workout","review":"I got this after reading a positive review of it on SparkPeople by Coach Nicole.I was very pleased with it. It really works you as hard as you want it to, Jackie shows you variations on all the moves, and she stresses proper form. I like that it's broke up in 20-minute workouts (one each for upper body, lower body, and abs). You can do one, two, or all three. I also liked how she fit in some cardio in each segment, it's great to get more burn by raising your heartrate. Each set of exercises are done for a minute, and you usually do 2-3 sets, then 1 minute of cardio, and repeat this sequence until it's done. Each 20-minute segment has a warm-up and a cool-down.I love this DVD and would tell anybody looking for a new strength training video to try this one out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult but Fun Circut Workout","review":"This workout was hard but fun and fast moving. It consists of three parts so you can interchange the workouts, but believe me, doing two of them a day will make you sweat up a storm.Very good challenge to your stamina, however it provides the cardio workout that a circuit training workout provides, not one that a one hour jog around the neighborhood does. (Those two vary in their results, in my opinion.) This will definitely make you stronger and more toned. I think even doing this workout a couple times a week would be enough to get the toning and strength. Concentrating on cardio for the rest of the week would make it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good....","review":"I really like this video for the most part. It's a good workout and sort of reminds me of Jillian Michaels. There were a few new moves that I learned. Jackie leads you through the workout and only one person works out at a time. I will rotate it with my other videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"This kicked my butt!","review":"I am a big fan of the Ripped series by Jeri Love but I have to say this workout from Jackie and her trainers kicked my butt and is a nice change of pace from the Ripped videos due to its flexible organization and the cardio intervals(Jeri Love also has an excellent cardio/strength video too...Ripped 1,000). My favorite section of WORKOUT is the abs segment! This segment is good for those days when I just feel like doing straight cardio but want to add an abs component."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really looking forward to using this DVD. I thought it would have really kicked my butt, but it did not.I finished the entire workout, but I was so bored and kept wondering when it will be over. Sorry this one did not do it for me.Maybe her next one will be a lot harder and more intense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Hot....","review":"BORING!!! I'm OK with the fact that it is a little (well, alot!)easy for me, that would be OK as you can just add weights for more of a challenge....but I found it boring! And so umotivational! I would never want any of the people on this DVD train me!! They are just plain awful!! I do have a couple of her other DVDs which I really do enjoy - but, my advice is to stay away from this one! Get Personal Training with Jackie: Power Circuit Training or Personal Training With Jackie: Xtreme Timesaver Training instead. Both are SO much better!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome!","review":"I've been doing the Gilad Ultimate Body Sculpt DVDs for awhile now and have enjoyed them immensely; I just needed something new to keep working out interesting and I'm a fan of \\"Workout\\". This DVD is the perfect addition to my weekly workouts. I love how you can modify or increase resistance. For instance, I played it conservative with the amount of weights for the upper body and next time I'll use more, but since my abs are weaker, I did the modifications. Very customized and I like how it sets a \\"bar\\" to work up to with the more intense versions of all the exercises. I love Gilad, but this is definitely an ultimate body sculpt too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD did not work","review":"I received this DVD but it only plays on one of my players and not on the other.

I have tryed other dvd's since I don't have a gym to go to and this one is by far my favorite. I do all 3 workouts which takes an hour. By the end I can feel the burn and the sweat. She does transition in the video but not fast as another person wrote. I let 2 of my co-workers do this video and they both loved it as well. I havent tried the Julian Michael videos but I have tried the boot camp ones and I like this one by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite workout DVD!!!","review":"I love this workout!!

It's okay but I have bought better exercise DVD's like Jillian Michaels '30 Day Shred'. I think that Jackie needs to get back to basics and stop believing her own hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"I only did the upper body portion of the dvd so far and I must say that I am HIGHLY impressed. I don't care too much that there really isn't a lot of cardio. I just wanted the toning. I do have to say that my arms and shoulders burned after 20 minutes. My goal is to break the workout up into three workouts that way I am exercising a different area a different day. I walk and play DDR on playstation in workout mode daily. Thank you Jackie and to the other trainers."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORK OUT","review":"I dont work out but i need to... I love Jackie!! Excited for the results to come with this video"},{"rating":"2","title":"Butt kicking!!!","review":"I loooove this workout!! The abs segment is especially awesome. It's so tough and that's what I was looking for! Something to kick my butt into shape! I wouldn't recommend for beginners - it moves quickly with no breaks and even the modified versions are tough. I love Jackie and the trainers are fun - their AMAZING bodies are a HUGE motivation!! Highly highly highly recommend!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so but there are better DVD's.","review":"I like the show on Bravo and I like Jackie's no BS attitude when it comes to working out but the workouts on the DVD are just OK. The workout as a whole is confusing and there isn't a lot of fluidity between each exercise. The two trainers in the front doing modified (tough and beginners) were great to watch and helpful. The other two trainers (Rebecca and Agostina) were terrible and like watching 2 dead fish. Jackie was motivating but with 2 non-expressive, boring to watch trainers behind her it made it difficult to stay motivated.The Biggest Loser DVD's are better workouts with better trainers and better people on the DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workout is amazing!","review":"I really liked the upper body segment. Jackie and one other trainter (they took turns) would do the moves and focus on detail. It helped it go by superfast!Then the Abs segment was different. Everyone did it all together. It was a really good workout! I'm pretty sure I couldn't do all three segments in onw day. I started the lower body and my legs were burning so much I had to stop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"This is by far the best workout video I have ever seen and I have seen quite a few. It is very effective and also very hip and fun. I only wish she would come out with a new one, because I've been using this one already twice a week for 6 months and I need a change, but nothing else I try compares to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Jackie!","review":"I am a Jackie Warner fitness fan!!! This workout is great if you have only a short amount of time. Each 20 minute workout is effective and sweat inducing. You can do 1, 20 minute workout or all 3. Jackie keeps you motivated the whole time and the music isn't too bad either. AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Jackie!","review":"I have the Personal Training video with Jackie Warner as well, and I really love her videos!

YOU WILL SWEAT, TRUST ME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video, definitely challenging!","review":"I love the core and upper-body segments. Jackie is great at reminding you to pay attention to form. The lower-body segment moves pretty fast, so I'd recommend that newbies practice correct lunge form before beginning the segment. Each segment transitions between a series of one-minute exercises followed by a cardio boost exercise, so you'll always be feeling the burn in one muscle group or another. I'd recommend this video to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shnikey! I am so sore!","review":"Just bought this DVD on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised, although was in severe pain from sore muscles on day 2. Already seeing results although I tend to get bored with workout videos after a few months so hopefully i can stick to it! Jackie is pretty motivating, but some of the trainers are a bit annoying. All in a all, a pretty decent workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout at a great price","review":"I picked up this DVD mainly because of the show and the incredible price. I was not disappointed. I liked how the segments are divided up and on the main menu you can select the videos that you want to perform, meaning if you want to do just legs and core, you highlight both and when it plays, it leads one segment into the next.Overall this is more like the boot camp style workout that Jackie talks about on her show. It has made a nice addition to my other workouts to shake things up a bit. You will feel it the next day. The 20minute segments make it great to fit in on those days when you don't have that much time to fit into an entire workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work out and muscle builder DVD","review":"The DVD arrived fast and in new conditions.

I only did this workout once and will probably never do it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"This DVD has three sections and you can customize your workout.

JACKIE IS SOMETHING SHE THINKS SHE IS AND SHE IS FAR FROM IT. GIRLS MAY ENJOY THIS BUT NOT FOR GUYS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workouts","review":"This DVD has three great workouts. Even though it's supposed to have cardio after each group of exercises, my heart rate wasn't really raised during the upper body workout and the ab workout. That's not to say that they aren't still great workouts, they just aren't very cardio oriented. The lower body workout is great for targeting gluts and legs and actually did give me a cardio workout as well. I usually alternate this video with Jillian Micheals' NMTZ and BFBM. I can't say that I've lost weight using this video because I've been maintaining my target weight goal for a month or so and bought this video after I reached my goal, however I do feel like it's helping me to define my abs and tone up my legs and arms. I'll be buying her other video next to throw into the mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"I liked this workout. It is not my favorite but I am happy with it. I like the added short cardio segments vs. the other workout by Jackie (Power Circuit Training). I also like the format with the feature of working with one person. It really helps to focus on the form and doing to moves correctly. I am finding that I do use this DVD often but it has not replaced my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK GOD ALREADY!","review":"Thank god somebody finally had the brains to make a dvd that actually does what it sets out to do. WORK YOU OUT. No crappy music, no fake chit-chat. I do not understand these reviewers who gave it a \\"1\\".

You rock girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good exercises, strange energy level.","review":"I like the actual exercise, but this isn't my favorite video. The energy is low and each trainer does one section while the others sit in the background and watch, which is much less than inspiring. I do like the combination of weights and cardio, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie Warner's Fast Pased Workout","review":"I bought this because I love Jackie and the gang from Sky Sport and Spa. Her workout tape sucks though. She moves too fast from one exercise to the other. She doesn't explain things that well. I understand this is her first video, but I can't keep up. I hope she makes another one and this time slows it down. She is very interesting to watch. I love her show and hope that it returns to Bravo soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I loved this show and I work out often; average workout gal. Jackie moved so quickly I couldnt keep up with the changing moves. She would just \\"annouce\\" the next move and by that time the \\"deminstrator\\" was already 3 or 4 sets in WITH NO EXPLAINATION ABOUT FORM or structure. It takes a viewer a few mins to look at the TV, listen, get their weights, and into place. By that time I have missed most of the routine. I wish I could get my money back on this DVD. On a positive note (there are some good workouts on this DVD (if you move quick enough). Disappointed...."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WORKOUT","review":"Good DVD!! Does cardio and weights in the same workout. You can choose to do upper body, lower body, core, or do them all. Each workout is 20 min and it includes cardio between strength training which is great for beginners or advanced that are looking for a change in routine and fat loss with sculpting the muscles. I took this on vacation and used my own body weight or resistance bands and it was perfect. No excuse to not workout because it's easy to do anywhere as long as you have a DVD player!GREAT PRICE TOO!

If you're not familiar with their body of work, both in the clubs and in the studio, it should be enough to say that if you were into the blue-eyed soul sound , or just some uptempo blues, you should enjoy this music a lot. While it can be argued that this guy or that guy came and went, the group kept on rolling. There were great spots in many of their recordings, just like there were a few rough spots. They were a great regional band If you are into Pandora Radio, sample the Boogie Kings channel for more great sounds of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and Fluffy","review":"There's nothing new under the sun. Whether or not the authors are experts in their fields, this book is not to their credit. The book presents 150 more or less randomly assembled topics presented alphabetically and with very little depth or helpful reference. What I expected was perhaps an outline of investigative techniques or helpful hints. Instead, the authors dish out scant advice and a blend of rehashed, superficial material. This book would be unhelpful and remedial for a novice LEO fresh out of the academy or even to the very green PI. Interesting perhaps as a light and fluffy reference for the lay public. Another so called indispensable book returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute but not very sturdy for a toddler","review":"I bought this for my 16 month old soon.

However, if you are buying these for younger kids (mine are 6 and 3), you may want to go for the pack with examples/ instructions as well, as the initial reaction for my two very creative kids seemed to be that they wondered what to d with them. They were excited to play with them, but weren't sure how. It took a lot of hands-on time with me to walk them through a few different building ideas before they wanted much to do with them on their own. That said, they certainly inspire creativity, and though they are sticky, they can be reused, which is nice (I store ours in a big ziploc bag in between uses). Looking forward to this package wearing down so I can buy a bigger package with more colors and a better instruction booklet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware...","review":"While this Danco kit says it fits all Gerber Tub and Shower faucets it did not fit the one for which it was ordered.However, in fairness the brand name is not detectable on the shower handle or escutcheons. Though having once worked in the plumbing trade and in the process installing many Gerber shower and tub faucets that's what it appears to be. The splines on the stems however are simply too large in the shower set I was attempting to rehab.Also, if you are planning to keep the parts in reserve (as I was) look over the return policy.I bought this kit for our cabin some time ago. When I attempted to return the goods the time frame had passed a mere 2 days earlier.This made the parts a throwaway for me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her etudes are better than her preludes.","review":"Critics are by no means unanimous about Zayas' Chopin.

HBK vs. Shane McMahon, The Rockers vs Brain Busters and Steamboat vs. Roberts are particular stand outs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Old-school fans","review":"This is a DVD that even if you don't watch wrestling anymore but did in the 80's -early 90's you'll still enjoy. It features tons and tons of great matches and segments from the past. Many include Hogan, Macho Man, Bret Hart, Andre the Giant an many many more. You don't need to be a fan of wrestling anymore, but if you were a fan in the early day you can still enjoy it. This is a great buy for any wrestling fan old or new."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Classic 80's Wrestling","review":"Saturday Night's Main Event was the SHIZZNIT back in the 80's right after \\"Superstars of Wrestling\\" and \\"Wrestlemania\\". It's a time capsule that will bring back the excitement of your childhood. The matches from the 90's and 00's are unecessary, but fun as a bonus. All the best wrestlers, clips, interviews, skits, gimmicks, and storylines are included in this awesome 3-disc set. If ever there was a wrestling DVD set to own, THIS IS IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Own For Wrestling Fans!","review":"If you're a fan of classic wrestling in its hey-day, then this is a must own!! A ton of the classic superstars from the 80's and early 90s are featured here. Over 30 matches, included steel cages matches, tag team, and even battle royals. Even though a few of the matches may not be the most impressive as far as pure wrestling skills go, you can't deny the showmanship and the charisma of the matches. But don't get me wrong, there are some very good pure wrestling matches here as well. To be honest, its just great to see all these legends when they were all that the top of their career. I'm not gonna bother listing all the matches or superstars, I'm sure someone already has, but again, I just wanna say that this collection is most definitely worth owning, and watching it is like taking a trip down memory lane..a trip I plan on taking many times to come!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you loved about 80's WWF in a3 DVDs.","review":"I am having a blast watching these classic matches from my youth.

Indeed, you cannot calibrate the wheel, which may present some problems with some games. But with Burnout 3: Takedown, this wheel works perfectly. In fact it's as if it were calibrated for that game! It also works with Rallisport Challenge and Project Gotham Racing, but not as smoothly as with Burnout 3. My previous wheel was a Logitech for the PC and it used clamps to lock on the desk, which destroyed my nice desk. This one uses suction cups, which is better as long as you remember to reinforce the suction (by pressing down) every few minutes. The pedals work fine, too.Overall I'm pretty happy with this cheap but fun accessory for my Xbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Zone too big - no calibration.","review":"The hardware is nice - foam steering wheel with good feel.Usability - that's another thing. The dead zone in the middle of this wheel is too big to control the car. I played Project Gotham 2 with this and had a very difficult time controlling the car through turns. I switched back to the analog controller and had much better results.As far as I can tell, there is no way to calibrate this wheel. Given that, I would not recommend this wheel.If I missed something, I am interested in how to configure but so far, I don't see anything that gives me an indication that this is a possibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine interpretations which are well recorded.","review":"Malcolm Arnold wrote a lot of great music for film and concert hall. His entire symphonic output is included in this economical boxed set. While he derived much of his inspiration from Mahler and Shostakovich, he is not quite their equal as a symphonic composer. Brilliant passages alternate with less inspired, and sometimes depressing, passages. The older he got the more pessimistic his music became. At this price, however, you get enough great music to justify adding Arnold to your collection of classical composers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taming the Money Master","review":"If I'd had this book ten years ago and followed its advice, I wouldn't be in debt today.

In the past two months, I've paid off three of my credit cards and am on the road to getting out of debt.One piece of advice: If you choose to melt your credit cards in the oven and turn it into a mobile, be careful that they don't start to smolder. The smell of burnt plastic lingered for days. Makes an incredible and beautiful reminder, though.

The clip is not \\"deep\\" enough and doesn't open wide enough for most bags. They either do not fully close the bag or they don't fit around it. A large bag of chips once opened and folded shut isn't even held in place by the largest clip which just slips off.Forget about the magnets. They just get in the way unless, instead of keeping a bag closed, you want to leave a message on the fridge.My advice is to buy a clip that is more like clothes pin with a strong steel spring. Don't let looks fool you. I've got better ugly bag clips."},{"rating":"1","title":"A portrait of an upper class family with difficulties","review":"I thought this film was going to focus on the autistic son's life and struggles. However, it did not. This was a portrait of the family from the producer's point of view. It was more about the struggle of having a father who had short temper and who was idolized at the same time. It touches on the life of the son with autism but is not the focus of the film. Whilst the producer mentions that he did not really admit to the anger and flaws of his father as a young man, however, he did not investigate how his earlier denial may have affected those around him. The movie is strictly from his point of view. This shows a life of priveledge in South Hampton and New York City, despite his father losing the family fortune in the 1970's. One can't help but think that part of the story is left untold and question the motives of the producer. Why is he making this film?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably poignant","review":"A heart gripping slab of reality that ennobles all of us who have long given up on some ultimate meaning for human existence.

The authenticity of Chris Murray's disability was there on the screen, not portrayed by an actor. You'll fall in love with Chris... his innocence makes him so loveable... The scene with Chris taking his aging Mom's arm on a wooded path so she wouldn't stumble is profound. Chris will make you laugh more than cry.

Totally worthless as anything other than a big, expensive piece of jewelry. The inability to see what time it is unless you are indoors under lights or outside with bright sunlight makes this device totally impractical and useless as a watch. In fact, it should not even be called a watch. Call it a bracelet with minimal time-keeping capability.

Great size, form factor, appearance. Nasty smell though, not sure why (rubbery/electrical smell, not burning).It's got an AC 120v outlet and a low power DC USB port. The 120v AC outlet, the meat and potatoes of this little number, works beautifully. It's the reason I bought it in the first place, the USB port was an added bonus. Unfortunately the USB was dead on arrival. Tried multiple cars, multiple USB powered chargers, etc. There's no reason why a company like Kensington should have such brutally obvious and testable defects in any of their products �?but this is clearly an OEM product from China that they stuck their name on. There's not even a mention of USB in the product manual.If the USB did work, this would have gotten a 4/5 from me, 5/5 if there was no smell (it's really bad!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protect your paws from sharp edges.","review":"I hold these gloves in my 9-11 reserve bag under my desk.

I ran the blade along the palm of my hand with these gloves on, and I also squeezed the blade as hard as I could.Although I obviously felt the pressure of the blade through this ultra thin material, I did not experience any pain from the sharpness, nor did I suffer any cuts of any sort. The material is so thin, I can wear it under my regular leather gloves.The only reason I did not give the gloves 5 stars is the color. Kidding. Only reason was it seems as if they don't seem as if they would hold their shape very well after a long period, but again, they are quite inexpensive for the protection they provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This book was not a good book.

It is exactly how I have felt for so many years because I thought I should be able to just let the past go. I was amazed at how much of what happened to the author emotionally is so close to my own suffering. I finally feel that I am not weak and crazy to feel this way. The passage from the introduction (about acting) on the back cover made my cry out loud because I have lived it every day for years. There is a song that came out the year I graduated High School - Robert Flack's 'Killing me softly' - that reflects the way I felt in reading this book.

Little to no photos of most early 80's artists that were a staple of early MTV video rotation (particularly new wave music). 60% of the photos are of poor quality - either very grainy or bad color reproductions lifted from TV broadcasts.The book begins with a few interview soundbites from the 1999 VMA, then more grainy photos, then jump to the year 1981 - then to the 1991 VMA and then to the 1986 VMA and continues in this pattern.
