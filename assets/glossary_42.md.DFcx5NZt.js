I returned the first one two hours after buying it because the reservoir leaked uncontrollably. I trashed the second one after trying everything I could to stop leaks from under the cup rest plate.

Then the pod holder disintegrated and I called Black and Decker for a replacement part. The part was no longer available so they sen me a new machine.The new machine leaked water on the counter and not into the cup. Another call and another new pot. This is the third pot and I will make another call. All I want now is a refund, but that is not in the cards.I would suggest no one buy this machine. It is the poorest design and quality on the market. I am not sure what their cost is, but I would think the replacements would be checked better and they would try to improve the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I got this for a Christmas present last year. Worked fine for a couple of months, except sometimes the coffee wasn't really hot. Coffee tasted good, though. Then, one day one of the pods exploded and after cleaning it up, I tried to make another cup. That's when the water started running and running and running. So I called customer service, and they sent me a new one. That worked well, until Monday when nothing worked on it. I pressed the button, and nothing happened. Switched to another outlet, still nothing. Call customer service again and they said they were retooling it and a new one wouldn't be available until August. She said they had had lots of \\"major\\" problems with this machine. I asked for my money back instead and will try to find a different one. Maybe I'll check out Gevalia or Senseo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive price, cheaply made!","review":"Ok, I bought this as soon as they hit the stores. A one cup machine is perfect for me. But this machine wasnt!After 2 months, I noticed some plastic bits in my coffee. Hmmm very strange. So I inspect the pod holder. Yup, it's cracked. So I call and get a replacement. After 3 weeks, I finally get the replacement. Great, on with the coffee. 2 months after getting the replacement, the pod holder is cracked again. And upon further inspection, the plastic holding the pod holder is broken as well. That's where the plastic bits in my coffee were coming from.Also, the locking mechanism was breaking into bits as well. So my husband told me not to use it anymore. I went to empty the water container to find my machine was also leaking everywhere!This thing has since went into the trash.

Thinking maybe it was just my overly sensitive nose, I tasted the coffee. It tasted like plastic! I had filled the reservoir with 14oz to make two 7oz cups of coffee only to find that if you don't make the next cup, the water will run out of the reservoir, through the bottom of the coffee put and all over the counter. I returned it, and will not try another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I'm very disappointed with this product. I received my 1st one in September 2004, as a gift, it started acting up in late October, by December it was completely broken.<br />It also splatters coffee everywhere unless you use a thermos type large mug.I returned mine to Target they would only exchange it for another, this one brews fast but the coffee comes out lukewarm. I'm very upset that Target would sell such a crappy product and only echange it for you if it waits till after 90 days to break. <br />Black and Decker seems to have rushed this product out to make money. I sure fell for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a nightmare","review":"I am currently on my 3rd and last unit. The first unit would not close properly and the coffee spit out in all directions. Then I noticed small pieces of black plastic falling out of the unit when removing the used coffee pods. The second unit simply stopped working after two weeks. I am on my third unit which, so far, seems to work. I did notice that the new unit seems to close a little more securely than the first two. No spitting either. Overall, I am still disappointed. The quality of the unit is below par. Has the feel of a dollar store plastic toy. The pod holder feels as if it is going to break apart each time I attempt to close or open it. I expected more from Black &amp; Decker. Apparently, quality was not their concern. Shame on me for returning this item twice. I will try the Philips Senseo next time. Seems to be a higher quality unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this product","review":"What a waste of money. I got the Black and Decker Home Cafe product.

I wouldn't buy this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Junk!","review":"I have always trusted the Black & Decker name. Until now. My first Home Cafe was used for about 2 weeks before the lever broke. Back it went for #2. #2 made lukewarm coffee so I called CS. Nice Lady sent #3 out immediately. Didn't even ask for the broken one to be returned. #3 immediatley leaked all over my counter. Called CS again. Nice Lady sent #4. #4 also makes lukewarm coffee. Called Nice Lady again. Told her I didn't want another coffee maker. She offered to send something of equal value. I told her to surprise me. She sent a food processor. (It works just fine). I still have #4 which still makes lukewarm coffee and not the amount that the buttons say . I just nuke it which kind of defeats the purpose. Maybe I should be very afraid since so many of them have exploded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistant working order","review":"I wouldn't recommend this coffee maker. My device would sometimes make a full cup of coffee, and sometimes only a half before it 'sputters out'. Couldn't figure out why. Placing the pods in the machine is touchy, the machine squeeks of cheap plastic as you secure the pod in. The coffee came out great, except when it decides to make half a cup, then it's espresso strong. Nasty. Luckily, I got it at a yard sale for $5, so I tolerated it until I saw a $30 single-cup coffee maker at WalMart that had programming (this device does not). Surprising, I thought Black and Decker made better products than this, so I expected a higher quality device. Guess they should stick with power tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Hot!","review":"Literally, your coffee will not be very hot w/this machine. I have to reheat in the microwave to be decent. And no frothy top like the Senseo, which I also have. But, hey, I got this one on sale for $8 - and now I know why LOL! My husband will use it for the to-go mug feature.You pay more for the Senseo, but hands down you will get a better machine and an awesome cuppa joe with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried 2 units - neither worked correctly.","review":"Regardless of the \\"cup size\\" button pressed, the unit produced random amounts of coffee - too much sometimes, too little other times.

Excellent quality and coffee from the Senseo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You like leaking, cold coffee?","review":"I purchased a B&D Home Cafe with great anticipation. I ran it ONE time, and it leaked all over the counter. I called the service dept. and they sent me a replacement. This one doesn't leak, but the coffee is nowhere near warm. It also has a distinct plastic flavor, despite running vinegar through it, as per the service dept's recommendation. They won't send a refund because I don't have a recipt....anyone want some cold coffee? I'll give you my machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK JUNK JUNK - Do Not Buy!!!","review":"Makes great tasting coffee for about a month before all the little plastic pieces begin to break.

It made 2 cups of lukewarm coffee then began turning on by itself (thought it was haunted) Also, one time it cycled from one size cup to the next and kep running - we had to pull the plug. Pretty scary. I called Black & Decker and was told by their customer service dept that they have had no problems with this machine - obviously a lie becase I read the same problems everywhere. I also read the Brew & Go has problems with turning itself on. Shame on Black & Decker!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great taste, broke in 2nd week","review":"I chose to buy the Black &amp;amp; Decker brand since it gave you a choice of three different brewing sizes. The good part is that brewing one cup at a time is great and the coffee it brewed tastes great. The bad part is that it is very cheaply made, and it broke in the second week I bought it (not even sure why). But after one week of use it quit brewing the 9 oz (mid) size cups, which left only the small and large options. I took it back and am now looking for a better built unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a robust product","review":"The coffee is similar to my old Mr. Coffee when brewed strong, but I did like being able to quickly brew a cup for the road in the morning.

So now I have a piece of JUNK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"bought based on coffee selection","review":"I bought this item over other single-cup makers simply because of the variety of coffee flavors available. I am especially waiting for the cappucino flavors to show up in stores. I find the machine extremely easy to use (you will get used to the plastic handle) and clean, it makes a consistent strength cup of coffee (which was my problem when trying to use my husband's 8-12 cup drip machine for 1-2 cups), and the variety of available coffee flavors is a real plus.As mentioned, the machine -- like all single brewers I've seen -- is big, but if you just like a single cup of coffee and are tired of inconsistent cups of coffee with sludge at the bottom, this one is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't spend your money to buy weeks of frustration.","review":"This is, by far, the worst appliance that I have ever had the misfortune to own. The first worked great for 3 cups of coffee, and then quit working entirely. The second brewed for a week. You get the idea, so I won't bother to describe the problems with units 3-7. Yes, that's right, I had 7 of these in less than 9 months.The company gladly replaces these regularly defective units for a $7 fee. You have to mail the cord and payment in before the replacement is shipped. Of course, when you are paying this every few weeks (no, the units don't actually last weeks, you just have to wait a few weeks while the replacement ships), it adds up. So, in addition to the purchase price, I paid $49 for replacements. On top of that, the pods would go stale between units, so I lost more money there. With three months left on the warranty, I have decided to not even bother with replacements.Save yourself time, money, and frustration, and RUN from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 5 cups started spitting hot water everywhere","review":"I purchased the Home Cafe in April and until June couldn't find coffee pods locally. However the Senseo pods are identical.Before going through the coffee sample the machine started to spit hot water on the sides of the brewing cup. If I turn it over and place the pods in the side for holding two pods it works better, but the coffee isn't as good. It is getting worse and logging on at the Home Cafe site they won't reply to emails.This morning I brewed a 9 oz cup and left the room. When I returned there was approximately 6 oz in the cup and 2-3 oz all over the counter and on the floor. I've had to constantly clean coffee stains from the counter in a 12 radius from the machine. Even when it doesn't leak it tends to splatter out of the cup as it fills.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The convenience tempted me to try this for $20 at my local grocery.

It also splashes coffee everywhere and makes a horrible sound when brewing. I would spend my money on another single serving coffee maker, but not this one. I hope I can return mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Decker is awful","review":"This coffee maker stinks.

First the pod holder cracked. I contacted Black & Decker using their email system. After a week, they emailed back an 800 number to call, & they replaced the pod holder free of charge. Then the cheap plastic tab that held the top closed broke. Again I called the 800 number (I had the foresight to not delete that email), and they replaced the machine for free. Then we had a power outage. When the power came back on, the machine started spewing water about the kitchen and a general burning plastic smell was present. Again, I called the 800 number. This time they again replaced my machine, but charged me $5 for shipping. The machine sits in my kitchen, unopened.

After that, it would only brew half the desired amount of coffee each cycle and overflow the rest of the water into the drip tray. Several \\"cleaning\\" cycles later, it appeared to mildly improve, only to clog up again after 2-3 cycles. In the end, it was just too much hassle cleaning and too much expense in wasted coffee pods (did have some very strong coffee during all those failed cycles, though!).

The plastic lever to lock and unlock the pod unit is difficult to move and doesn't seem to be seated correctly.It's going back to the store this weekend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the most under-appreciated albums in the genre","review":"The Clancy's, here, have given us a work that pushes beyond the pub song/ballad/folksiness that defines much of their work. Very similar to the works of Bob Dylan on Time out of Mind, or Warren Zevon on Life Will Kill Ya, this record contemplates the anguish of aging without sacrificing that certain Clancy brothers charm. I would recomend this album based solely on what I consider to be the most haunting and meaningful rendition of The Final Trawl ever recorded. A star must be striken from the rating only because the rendition of When the Ship Comes In was very sub par to the live performance they gave on the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary concert album. That album, to, may be worth buying on the strength of the single track (though, don't get me wrong, I think it's an excellent album for all of them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring. Comprehension on it.. very hard!","review":"This is not a childrens classic! It is boring. At page 26 I was confused. I read it for A/R (accellerated reading) resons. The movie is much better, and reccomend that you watch it instead of reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Example of the Shipwrecked genre.","review":"This book is one worth reading. I would suggest it if you like adventure novels. I have read it a total of 8 or 9 times. You wont regret buying it. A good first long book for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lucidity readers have come to expect from Pipes","review":"If you have been following the essays and articles that Pipes has written in numerous newspapers and magazines, you may find this book a bit redundant. However, it is one-stop-purchase if you want a concise overview of the author's social and political views. A must read for all those concerned about the war on terror and its roots. Against the tide, Pipes has spoken out eloquently and urgently. Miniatures is no exception. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly biased and narrow minded view of Islam.","review":"I was assigned this book for a really terrible college course on terrorism taught by a really terrible professor. Pipes cites plenty of facts, but many of the conclusions he draws from those facts are illogical and clearly influenced by his hatred of Islam. He takes on some really complex issues that he doesn't have the intelligence to understand himself. I can't imagine who his audience is. I would think that people who are stupid enough to enjoy this wouldn't be able to read a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pompous, misleading propaganda readers expect from Pipes","review":"Saw this in the bookshop, and was not at all surprised at the raging, fuming, one-sided ill-informed content of Mr Pipes' new book. He has not said anything new for the last five years. It is still the dangerous war-mongering diatribe dressed up in a false academic garb that it always has been. Mr Pipes seems to have a small and loyal following. However, judging by his pomposity he obviously believes that the majority of the book-reading public are as blinkered as he is. Buy this book if you want fuel for the fires of your own bigotted ignorance. For truth and wisdom look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional.","review":"The lyrics of Fade Away are good.

I bought it because I greatly enjoy David Hudson's other albums (Woolunda, Gunyal and Rainbow Serpent). Synthesized new age slop all but erases Hudson's didgeridoo artistry. The claim that the album is as heard on the television series \\"Survivor\\" is false. The \\"evocative melding of didgeridoo and world rhythms\\" gives me the feeling of being in an airport bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're in school you can't live without this","review":"I have used at least 3 editions of English Simplified while going to high school and college.

I just recently completed my MBA and I used English Simplified constantly!! Again, I lent it to a friend and they moved out of town to work on their PhD.

The entire album is only less than 40 min, but this album has such a quality that makes me want to listen over and over. Poetic and romantic lyrics and melodies could take you to the world of imagination. I just can't say enough about this album.

The description of his music was so intriguing, we took a gamble and it paid off BIG TIME!No offense to other children's performers, but Cuneo blows most of them away. My older child immediately calms when we put this CD on to play and my youngest is instantly ready to nap. No other performer has this effect on them!The tunes are memorable, the lyrics void of any references to violence, fear, sickness, or death. I dare anyone to find something objectionable on this CD.Mr. Cuneo is a huge breath of fresh air when it comes to children's music and I encourage the skeptical to plunk down their $13 bucks.

Watching again after so many years, I remember why I liked it so much the first time! There's some good actors here but \\"Mona\\" really made the show great. There was a lot of chemistry between all of the actors too especially between Tony and Angela.Watching a show like this does for a short time take a person away from reality and have some fun.I'm hoping the 2nd season comes out real soon because I'm going to buy it when it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEASON TWO PLEASE?","review":"I just finished watching this season and want to continue with Season 2.

The design and the material is great, it's easy to clean using alcohol wipes and a damp paper towel.

Itfeatures an archeologist heroine who uncovers a nifty little lamp thatturns out to contain a very sexy genie named Alex. He announces his presence to our stunned heroine with this line \\"I have come to do your bidding mistress\\". How can one not read on? What follows is a fun, sexy romance where the couple spend a lot of time together and get to know each other well before committing. The book begins to drag towards the end as the focus shifts from their relationship to a mad chase around the country as they try to salvage Chelsey's career. Despite that little slow down, the book is most definitely worth searching for if you like magical stories filled with laughter, sensuality and strong characterization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack's Manneqyin","review":"This was and has been my favorite CD since i bought in in August of 2005.

This CD is already on repeat in my car and my stereo as well as on my iPod and I've only had it for one day. Fans of Something Coporate will undoubtably love this album, the vocals of Andrew McMahon are, as usual, just amazing...but the album isn't just another Something Corporate album. This album is so personal and intimately emotional in a way that Something Corporate albums just aren't. Each song gives such insight into McMahon's emotions about being away from home on the road with Something Corporate and returning to the place he left as well as love, loss, and pretty much everything in between. I can listen to every song on the album and absolutely love it, but my favorites are: \\"Miss Delany\\", \\"Rescued\\", \\"I'm Ready\\" and \\"Made For Each Other\\". (I couldn't choose just one...) I absolutely LOVE this album...pick up \\"Everything in Transit\\"...you definitely will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is a MUST BUY serriously. I picked up my copy of EIT today and I cannot stop playing it.

Do yourself a favor and buy this album immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"... :)","review":"Well, all I can really say is that this cd is one of the best cd's I've ever heard. No really, it's absolutely amazing which was of course expected because it is from Andrew Mcmahon, who is the heart and soul of it and with the talents of other talented artists. The styles of the songs vary because some songs are very lively and others have a sort of \\"serious\\" sound to it if that makes any sense at all. It has elements of Something Corporate but it is definitely awesome in its own way. My favorite song is \\"Dark Blue\\". I can't say enough how good this cd is so just go out and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this album is so good!","review":"i am in love with something corporate and I have all of their albums but i like jacks mannequin a lot more! you can listen to the music anywhere and it has upbeat songs and slow songs as well. the music and the lyrics are both really good. this was one of the best albums i have ever bought!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Jack's Mannequin's cd \\"Everything in Transit\\" should be named cd of the year.

ORDER IT NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW what an awesome cd!!","review":"okay so i'm kinda picky about what music i like and what i don't like but Jack's Mannquin is simple AMAZING!!! Everything in Transit is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE CDs EVER!! Many times, I don't like ALL of the songs on a CD, but Everything in Transit is one of the few CDs which I like EVERY SINGLE one of the songs. Sure, some are a little better than others, but they are all GREAT!! My favorites on this CD are Bruised and Dark Blue, but I also like Holiday for Real, The Mixed Take and Miss Dalaney a lot. The other ones are seriously good too. Seriously, Andrew McMahon has the greatest voice ever and the music and everything is just WOW! His songs come from the heart, and are GREAT!! I seriously can't say enough good stuff about Jack's Mannequin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Brilliant","review":"So this is the best cd I have heard for quite a while. I listen to it in its entirety at least twice a day. Andrew's lyrics are absolutely wonderful. If I could give this cd 10 stars I would...

You won't regret it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"jyomama's review","review":"This album is possibly the best work Jack's Mannequin and Something Corporate frontman Andrew McMahon has done yet. The melodic tracks stray from the sound we're used to hearing from McMahon and his first project Something Corporate, but they're all wonderful in their own way. McMahon's piano-powered pop/rock/punk/emo songs transcent the stereotypes of all of the music genres they could fit into and reprsent the unique sound and incredible lyrics that only McMahon could create. Make sure to listen to MFEO part 1 and 2, it's the best song on the entire CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing cd","review":"If you enjoy listening to Something Corporate, you are bound to enjoy Jack's Mannequin's \\"Everything In Transit.\\" Andrew McMahon's enchanting voice and impressive lyrics make this album the outstanding record that it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything in Transit","review":"I was always a fan of Something Corporate therefore I was excited to hear that Andrew McMahon had started a side project Jack's Mannequin. Everything in Transit is an all together amazing mix of great lyrics and just as great instrumental music. Andrew McMahon is a very talented writer and piano play whose voice is mellow and in my opinion one of the easiest to listen to. I absolutely love this cd and would definitely recommend anyone buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have album","review":"This album is one of the few that you can listen to all the way through and every single song is amazing.

There isn't one song that I don't like on this cd. I loved it so much that I've been trying to get all my friends into Jack's Mannequin, too.

I don't take the time and money to go out and buy very many CD's, but this was one I couldn't pass up, and I don't regret spending a single penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Quite a Story It Is!","review":"Whenever a side project arises from a band that I love, that I have spent thousands of hours listening to, that has played to me on stage a dozen times, that I discovered at warped tour many years ago, I am skeptical. However, Andrew, the lead singer of Something Corporate, has done some amazing work on his side project, Jack's Mannequin. This new album, Everything in Transit, is everything you could hope it would be. The music, you can rock to, the words, you can relate to, and the feeling it gives you when you wake up to it in the morning is completely refreshing. This CD is proof that musicians are still real, still in touch with the pain and joy of life. Its also proof that music is still something to love. Everything in Transit: Buy it, Play it, Love it. Thats all there is to it.-Socopianorockers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so Corporate afterall....","review":"Being the diehard Something Corporate fan that I am, I was a little skeptical last november when I heard about Andrew's desire to do a solo project...I mean, the five guys together are what REALLY made good music, right?10 months later, skepticism is just a thing of the past as i pop my Everything In Transit cd into my stereo every morning. This album is wonderful. Andrew experiments with many different types of music and expands on the usual something corporate combination of guitar, bass, drum, and piano by adding a little bit of horns, harmonica, and accordian as well.You can tell with every song that Andrew has put his heart and soul into every note of this self-produced album. From \\"Holiday from Real\\" to \\"Into the airwaves,\\" you feel like you have gone on this journey with him...it really is \\"A story....\\"this album deserves an A++++please go buy and support Andrew as he is currently battling leukemia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything In Transit","review":"This is an amazing cd. When I first heard the single \\"The Mixed Tape\\" I knew it was a must have. In fact that night I rushed out to the store and bought it even though I had only heard one song. It is definitely one of my favorite cds. I listen to on a daily basis. I find it perfect for almost any mood I'm in. I recommend it to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing cd!","review":"this is an amazing cd. i'd recomend it to anyone! andrew mcmahon has an amazing voice, and his music is very compelling. i cant say enough how much i've enjoyed this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALBUM EVER!","review":"This album is amazing! Andrew McMahon, also singer for Something Corporate, brings his amazing talent to this new band. Still with his melodious voice, McMahon shows a softer side with Jack's Mannequin. This album is like a journal inside the world of this great musician and with hits like \\"The Mixed Tape\\", this CD becomes etched in your mind. If you like Something Corporate, definately check out this band! If you don't like Something Corporate, but like fantastic vocals and addicting songs, then Jack's Mannequin is the band for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best bands ever","review":"I heard one song on the TV, went out and bought the CD, and realized just how AMAZING Jack's Mannequin's music is. I am compleatly hooked on this CD. Every song is wonderful. If you like Bruised or The Mix Tape, GET THIS CD!!!!! One of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack's Mannequin","review":"in my opinion, this is in many ways different from something corporate. it shows a lot of growth from \\"leaving through the window\\", and is more upbeat than \\"north\\". the vocals are fantastic and the band is really great. this album is a perfect addition to any something corporate fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"I was not a fan of Something Corporate or Jack's Mannequin when I heard \\"Everything In Transit,\\" but after hearing the album, I need to get my hands on everything that Andrew McMahon has ever done. This album is the first one in a long time that has made me dance, think, sing, and cry all at one time. It is truly powerful music, especially considering Andrew's story and his struggles with his health. This is a definite must-own for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely incredible","review":"as a big fan of something corporate, i picked up 'everything in transit' just to see what andrew was up to and if it was any good. i was shocked! jack's mannequin has surpassed something corporate as my favorite band and is amazing live. i would recommend this cd to anyone who is a fan of something corporate, cartel, yellowcard, the starting line, snow patrol, etc.it is truly touching to know that there is someone out there who believes in the power of words and music, as andrew mcmahon clearly does. this cd will leave you thinking, which is the best that we can ask for in music nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down the best album since \\"North\\".","review":"I was skeptical when I first heard about Jack's Mannequin. As a long-time Something Corporate fan, I thought that Andrew's joining of a new group could mean the end of a wonderful collaberation that brought us so many brilliant and emotionally powerful songs.I am happy to say that \\"Everything In Transit\\" not only matches the quality of some of Andrew's previous work, but surpasses it in some instances as well.Every song on this album deserves five stars and I cannot wait to see Jack's Mannequin on tour this summer. I have no regrets about this purchase, and in keeping this review short and simple: If you enjoy the maturity, poetic credability and uniqueness of Something Corporate, then buy this album NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"You should know Jack","review":"For starters, \\"Deep Blue\\" should have been a hit. I can only guess that poor promotional support prevented this. It is a song that grabs you on first listen and eventually becomes one of those melodies that lingers in your mind. The key then to this disc is the melodies. While I was never enthused over Something Corporate, Andrew McMahon has found a fine vehicle in Jack's Mannequin to frame an entire lp of aurally satisfying songs. I only dicovered this disc two years after it's release because of hearing \\"Dark Blue\\" on an old various artist promo disc. I play it often and recommend this disc to anyone wanting sing along music that does not resemble the pablum of pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"JACKS MANNEQUIN","review":"If you are looking for a way to escape the long winter and continue to live in the dream world that is summer, this is the album to keep in your cd player.

And it is a variety of years and genres - the only thing I don't listen to is death metal.There just seemed to be something missing on this album.

The c.d. has a poppy and buzzy vibe, but the lyrics and voice of Andrew McMahon pull you in and make it impossible to stop listening to. If you knew Andrew McMahon was diagnosed with Leukemia you would think this album was made after treatment with all of the references to doctors and ambulences, but it in fact was made before he was diagnosed. Andrew's lyrics show his advanced writing ability and his love for a home town that he missed out on while touring with his previous band something corporate. If you are in a bad or depressed mood this album is perfect to listen to with the cheerful sounds and the passion McMahon puts into each individual song. Although each and every song is amazing I would recommend Dark Blue, MFEO/You Can Breathe, and Bruised. If you purchase this album it is gauranteed that you will not be dissapointed.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good CD!","review":"Jack's Mannequin is a very good band. Intricate piano parts are interlaced perfectly with rhythm guitar and vocals. My only problem with this CD is that it sounds exactly like Something Corporate. They honestly could have slapped the Something Corporate label on it and I would have thought it was their latest album. This is understandable, however, since it is Andrew McMahon's second project.McMahon's lyrics are exceptional. Battling with cancer, his lyrics written are very personal and heart-felt, filled with his struggles of coming to terms with his life and illness. This is evident in just about every song on the album, with lines like \\"Oh, say you'll miss me one last time/I'll be strong, but whatever you do/Please don't get me rescued\\" in the song \\"Rescued\\".This is currently one of my favorite albums I have in my collection. I highly suggest it to anyone who enjoys the sound of bands like Something Corporate and Copeland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Them are some tasty tunes!","review":"This CD is delicious.You will love it.

After gloating all the way home and through set up, I began to realize that I would have done better making my own jig. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is made of plastic which will deflect without too much difficulty. Just the weight of my circular saw made the tracks bow, and it takes frequent tightening just to keep everything aligned. Make your own jig from your scraps and put the money you saved into your miter saw fund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks (photos) are deceiving","review":"The photos of this item make it look like it's constructed of silvery aluminum - appearing sturdy and rigid. Well...its 1/8th inch thick gray plastic and pretty pliable. I doubt that it would survive a 3 foot fall on its corner. Above and beyond that disappointment was the fact that mine arrived with all the assembly hardware missing. Not a bolt or washer in sight - just 4 sad pieces of plastic and a piece of plywood..

Usually when Im on the home computer with a tv show in the background to keep me company, it usually keeps my mind preoccupied and motivated. With this one I wanted to throw a rock at the tv, the music is horrible and even the female cat scratches a wretched note. The main tune is a long dreary song bent on pure sentiment. Awful.

I typically use 2\\" diameter velcro sanding discs but it has more than enough power and speed to handle 3\\" diameter discs as well. It gets warm under longterm use but not hot enough to make it uncomfortable to hold. I originally bought a Neiko sander because it was cheap but after a month or so it started sounding rough and I new that I needed a production grade tool. After quite a bit of research I decided on this and havn't regretted it even though it costs as much as 6+ of the Neikos. You get what you pay for seems fitting in this instance. One thing I do miss about the Neiko is it's a bit shorter and has a higher than 90 degree angle between the drill chuck and handle but those are minor issues.P.S. It's made in Japan and the quality shows it."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST AWESOME!!!","review":"This is the #1 right angle drill you could ever buy for small to medium drilling job. The variable speed control is absolutely great...you can actually set the max desired speed so you can not over speed on some material.

A couple of things bother me. First, it's difficult to determine exactly what the sacred truths are. They are not highlighted very effectively, so after listening to the book you will not be able to list them. Maybe it's just me, but I like when ideas are presented in a clear, logical manner. Here they are not. The other problem with the book is the background music that plays almost continuously while the people are talking. It was very distracting.

I actually thougt the same thing when i played the playstation version, but this one is definetely the true version of this fantastic game. In the dreamcast, Raziel's moviments are much faster and more realistic. The graphics are completely improved showing the 128-bit full power. There are almost 40 hours of continuous gameplay full of incredible creatures and great puzzles. You must switch from physical world to material world and vice versa to get througt all these 40 hours.Everytime you kill a boss, you receive new powers such as climbing skills, light swords among others.

Colorful, hi-res, and a wow-factor of about 10 once you've seen them in person. The dreamcast needed a game like this as far as this genre is concerned, Soul Reeaver is THE game to buy right now. The game takes a little while to really get used to the controls, but once you've got them down you can move about fairly accurately. The voice acting is top-notch stuff, and really adds to the atmosphere. On the down side, the music changes occur abruptly at times and fighting enemies with the soul reaver weapon can be tricky to perfect. Also, I was dissapointed that the game took me less than half of the time stated on the back of the cd case in order to find everything and finish it. A little misleading, I think, but mark my words... once you've finished it, you'll want more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesbian Vampire Comments","review":"Not enough quality skin.

The hour long neo-realistic scenes shot by the italian director had been cut by a David Selznick fearing that the american audience could be shocked by the 1953 italian reality. The Dream Factory couldn't accept a movie that would have awakened the nice sleepers of America.So, what's left of the movie is watchable, nothing more. Jennifer and Montgomery spend a lot of time running through Rome Main Station and cruise a few symbolical figures that have lost all their impact.So let's hope that the european version will appear soon in the Criterion catalogue.

When noisy yet catchy is in order, The Evaluation won't let you down. Dominated by treble-soaked guitar work, We Built the Gun That Causes This Unending Fear is an adventure in the disjointed and hapless rock that we've come to expect from the Lujo family.Don't think, though, that this is some 45 minute jaunt of hard-to-listen-to noise rock. No way. While gritty the album can be easy on the ears, especially during the many meandering guitar break downs and hands-on-the-hips sing alongs.

It displays Mr. Darden's finely honed writing skills and showcases his accessible literary voice. The tale is inhabited by smart, witty, aware and responsible characters, which Darden couldn't have written about if he didn't possess those qualities himself.Thank you, Rashid, for a wonderful read--for the opportunity to flex my brain and ponder life while being thoroughly entertained.

Periods are constantly being left out and you find yourself reading sentences that make little sense - but if you look again, you'll see a capitalized word which, if you were to put a period before it, would make two sentences that make more sense. Spelling like: \`Aftar an Daffyd and others...' (instead of: After all Daffyd and others); \`A winged hone' (for: A winged horse); \`That's what I can Vaden' (for: That's what I call Vaden) are often interfering with the flow of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"great book with too many TYPOS!","review":"This great story has many many typos.

There is not one single weak or 'filler' cut on this CD - the entire disk is a pleasure for any picking fan - and a special treat for those of us fortunate to have experienced John Fahey before his untimely death in his very early 6o's.

His album in Europe is called \\"Jet Sounds\\", but Bossa Per Deu is probably the song most noticed in the United States, thanks to that wretched Acura commercial which doesn't do the song or Nicola Conte's music justice.It is a great, high spirited martini madness kind of CD. I think the style Conte uses is \\"Bossa Italia\\", heh heh. Definitely a Brazilian influence in the music, but with a 60's, Italian feel to it. Very interesting and very enjoying CD. For the record, if you like or have heard one Easy Tempo, released by the ESL label, that is what this is similar too, only a bit more modern. Nice beach music.

This guy takes a simple one or two chord progression and beats it to death throughout the duration of the song, relying on mechanical sounding noises coming from samplers and sequencers to pull it off, and to no avail. The styles of Bossa Nova and Now Sound calls for one to have a good ear for inventive chord progressions when composing them, and for some degree of chops to make them work, neither of which Mr. Conte has been endowed with evidently. If you want Bossa, check out the biggies like Jobim or Astrud Gilberto...if you want Now Sound then check out Peter Thomas or the Vampyros Lesbos soundtrack...or check out Arling and Cameron's Music From Imaginary Films if you need current day grooviness, as it's worth the ride.

I'd write more, but don't want to give away the storyline. Being one of heinlein's early 'juvies' this book isn't as involved as his later and better known works, and at times I felt it was too predictable.

I first read it when I was about 10-11 years old (back in the late 50's - I'm dating myself). Yes, there are a few things that today seem rather dated, but even now I am amazed how plausible Heinlein makes everything seem (especially in 1953)!

This is a solid entry in the Heinlein canon of great stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heinlein wrote many better than this","review":"I literally picked up a copy of this book because I was stranded on a tropical island and it was one of the few available in English.

I am an occasional Heinlein enthusiast (loved The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Stranger in a Strange Land but detested The Cat Who Walked Through Walls and The Number of the Beast) and this book seemed to distill all of the very worst of Heinlein's writing (a two dimensional, unbelievable hero, a sexist view of women etc.) Perhaps I am just too old to enjoy Starman Jones but I suspect that most adolescents are a lot smarter than this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like Military surplus - Maybe???","review":"Got the \\"Wraparound sun glasses, but not what I expected.

Unfortunately this mug has a design flaw - the handle is hollow and it seems that after you put it in the microwave for a minute, the handle gets INCREDIBLY HOT even though the coffee inside takes much longer to heat up (the handle is on fire but the coffee is only warm). The handle gets so hot that you can't pick it up with your bare hand without burning it, which defeats my purpose of buying a ceramic mug in the first place, so I have to give it one star. Otherwise, the mug is fine, it holds a lot of coffee. As other reviewers have mentioned, the lid does not seal very tightly but is good enough to keep coffee from splashing out, which is all I expected. However if you tip it over it will spill, so you need to keep it upright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What it's Cracked Up to Be","review":"\\"Cracked\\" is the correct word here. I've purchase two of these mugs. The first arrived in an undamaged box cracked badly from the rim down past the handle. When I went to send it back I was hoping for an exchange - nope - that wasn't an option (I'm guessing because the package wasn't damaged), so I ordered another one. The second mug arrived in an undamaged box with exactly the same issue, only this time the crack was slightly more fine.I won't be buying another one. Either the stock needs to be inspected much more closely or they need to bump up the amount of packing materials they use - I don't know when the breakage is occurring, but it it's happening before I get it.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get it to cut","review":"I spent a considerable amount of time trying to get this to cut 22ga sheet metal. Finally gave up. I didn't return it because I persisted on trying to get it to work by attempting to fine tune the rollers, which were wobbly and did not achieve proper opposition to achieve a cut, and the 30 days had past. Totally worthless IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes were dashed","review":"I live for games and this one was disapointing. I acutally returned it. Animations, though impressive, were very slow and cumbersome - so much so that I was loath pick things up or open doors.

I was very unhappy with this game and returned it to the store from which it came."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad, i threw it away, almost unplayable, no direction","review":"little fun, cheesy graphics. The beginning gets you excited, the music is nice, ok, but it seems repetitive, the orc monsters unimaginative, and you just walk quickly down roads in the snow hoping to find an apple before you starve, which happens all-to-soon. Boring. Most of the time you just try to figure out what to do, what you can do, which is not much, or you wish you would be told what you should do. Save your cash. I put mine in the trash.Apparently, at the beginning, you have to pay the ferryman when given a choice. I figured out that much.

Maybe someone a little more advanced, like a postdoc or very advanced grad student, would benefit from this book.The questions in each topic area start with a very basic question (for which there is a limited solution) and then skip right to much more difficult questions (for which there are still limited worked-out solutions). I have not found the book helpful, and I'm a 2nd year grad student w/a strong math background. I think it tries to cover too much in too little space, rather than (what I need) focusing on the basics (at a graduate level) and expanding a little on the main topics.Basically, it's going to end up being a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"This thing gobbles AA's at a phenomenal rate.

From beginning to end..AWESOME! Having kind of lost favor with this band over the years due to the fact that they had faded gently into oblivion, I was simply amazed. This recording brings it all back. All the old favorites, from No sugar tonight/New mother nature on down to 'Busrider' are included here! Some of the songs I was unfamiliar with, like \\"Running back to Saskatoon\\" have since become favorites. The vocals and guitar work will surprise you for a 'live' recording, very cleanly done. In fact all the tracks were superbly mixed. I am listening to it again right now. Guns, Guns, Guns, I feel like I am in the front row. Every live recording should hope for this clarity. Randy, Burton, Garry, Donnie, and Bill should feel EXTREMELY proud to have their moniker on this one! If you liked them then, you need this CD.

His military and political experiences fill most of the book, however; ample coverage is given of his family life and personal thoughts.He has lived an amazing life touched by virtually every historical event in Israel since before it was a country. His story is as much a history lesson on the Middle East and Israel as it is a story of one man.If you want to better understand Middle Eastern history, politics and life in Israel, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warrior","review":"Ariel Sharon remains a very controversial figure in Israeli history, in his autobiography he recounts his military and political experiences. He starts with his upbringing in a Jewish settlement in the then British Palestine. Sharon soon starts his military career in the Israeli War of Independence, his description of his platoons fighting in Latrun and being wounded is particularly poignant. He then served in Israeli launching counterterroism raids and leading troops in various wars becoming Israel's greatest general. Sharon than begins his political career with the Likud party and ends the book after he resigned as Defense Minister following the fallout from massacres in the Lebanon War. Overall it is a very interesting look into Israel's military and politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hungry for More","review":"I enjoyed this autobiography of one of modern Israel's giants.The book was written in great detail on many of the historic battles and decisions that Israel faced. Sharon played a large part in the fledgling country's struggle to survive the onslaught of hatred and terror. Sharon also touched on the personal hardships he faced.The only problem with Warrior was that Sharon wrote it so early in his career (1980s) that I was left hungry for more information. I had to go and buy a more recent biography of Sharon to bring myself up to date on Arik's life and career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would the Real Coco and the Bean Stand up","review":"I was big tyme disappointed by this album. Bluntly speaking, it is a major deviation from the stylistic sounds that characterize singles Western Ways or Killing Time, or Waisters and Melted on the Blunted CD.If you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop tracks of the other singles, then stop searching for this CD right now. This CD is straight commercial and the style is done already. If you want to hear the sounds on this CD in a better presentation you would be better served to pick up some old Soul II Soul.I heard killing time on a community channel on cable. It was being broadcast by a radio station. This song by itself, put me on the trail of trip hop. A journey that took me through Massive Attack, Portished, Craig Armstrong, Tricky, and others to arrive at a full CD by Coco and the Bean that is just a huge let down.Seriously disappointed with the current direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would the real Coco & the Bean stand up?","review":"I really do not have the words to describe how disappointed I am with this CD. One would be better served to listen to all of their singles, Western ways, Killing time. In addition, to the cuts they put on the 'Blunted' CD, waisters and melted.I was big time disappointed. If you love milky tracks with jazzy 1920's hook-lines reminiscent of Sarah Vaughn or billy holiday lamenting over love while lazily tripping into the sunset, this CD ain't it!A big disappoint. This CD is straight commercial. The distinctively emotional vocals and creamy medleys are missing.

I don't even know what to say. I just spent an hour of my life reading this book, and I want it back.It reads like a synopsis, with no discernible scenes, little dialogue, poor style and punctuation. It's unpublishable material that probably wouldn't have seen the light of day in the hands of a capable publisher such as Random House or Penguin.

It is annoying and stupid. Just because u choose to misunderstand words and act abrasively doesn't mean u have a spine - it means you're stupid and childish.That's all. This book really rubbed me the wrong way - sure it's well written and all, but really, this idiocy is getting too much (i guess i have just read one to many books with idiots masquerading as heroines with a backbone)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great contribution","review":"The go-betweens is the kind of band that always has you wanting to hear its next cd. Its fans are the kind of people who always eagerly anticipate every release and every concert. To understand this you have to listen to the cds. Once you have listened you want to listen to them again, and you want to listen to everything they've done as individuals and as a band. Oceans apart satisfies the gobees jones. Each cd they've put out since they've gotten back together in 1999 has gone in new directions, but still maintains the basic reasons why we love them in the first place. Robert has his stories and Grant has his melodies. Start here or start somewhere else but start somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"What we've been waiting for","review":"I could not agree more with previous reviewers who label this an instant classic, an even better album than their other two (also solid) post-reunion albums. As a long-time Go-Betweens fan, I'm delighted with every song in Oceans Apart. I'm sure it will become as treasured as 16 Lovers Lane. One last comment: the reviewer who mentions the absolutely miserable mastering job is completely right. There are songs (especially the last 2 tracks) that are painful to listen to in any hi-fi or above average stereo system. I have tried the disc in several different systems (incl. iPod and top quality car stereos) and am very disappointed at the sound quality. I even returned the first disc I bought because I thought it was defective. However, the bonus live CD is fine in terms of sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Miles Together","review":"This is an album that demonstrates a band that truly still has everything that got them here and more. With the subtle but rocking quality I've come to know and love from this band.I first got into them by getting 16 Lovers Lane, that was sort of my departure from listening to the Cure, who are great don't get me wrong but for some reason I found The Go-Betweens to be a bit more genuine and actually never leaving me with a dull moment. Come on, let's be honest, you know you've skipped through quite a few Cure tracks in your time. There are moments in this album where the song is carrying you and you feel really mellow about the song then the breathtaking little changes sprinkled all over in such a way that the song really doesn't change at all. They find lyrically and with delicate touches on the strings and drums that if you pay more attention you just might learn something."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"I'd never heard of the Go-Betweens before I got this album. I've never heard any of their old work. So I guess you could say my opinion of this album should be pretty objective. This album is just fantastic music.The songs are all very mellow, heartfelt and moving. There's just something about these songs. Like I said before, I haven't heard their earlier work so I may delve into that now, the only reason I haven't yet is that I'm afraid to be disappointed that it isn't as good as this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Improving","review":"Sammi is definitely improving in many ways.

There are much better books out there.This book just doesn't give a good big-picture of .Net, so if you are new to .Net, you'll learn some concepts, but you won't see how they fit into the big picture all that well.A premise of this book is that you can take your skills as a VFP developer and transfer them quite easily to .Net. That is not quite correct - you can take your skills as a PROGRAMMER in general and transfer them.I honestly think that you are better off not trying to learn .Net from a VFP perspective, but rather to learn it from scratch. You'll only confuse yourself if you are looking for similarities. I believe that you are best off taking your generic programming concepts (i.e. OO design, structured programming, etc.), and going into .Net fresh. It's a whole different way of thinking, and all it takes is a good overview to get into that way of thinking.

After many hours of trying to get myself to enjoy it I just gave up. Now, I know that this is an RPG game, but personally I find the pace of the game to be much to slow compared to some of the other RPG's that I've played in the past. Also, I highly recommend reading the manual before you play or you will be completely lost. I'm sure many of you out there like these challenging games, but I just thought I would give a different perspective about what to expect. Some aspects of the game I DID like are the graphics. Beautiful scenery and settings throughout the game, and some cool effects with certain characters as well. I also liked the opening cutscene. My advise is only buy this game if you are really into RPG's otherwise I would stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"diablo 2 or this?","review":"Wow. I thought I was addicted to Diablo 2.

I am tempted to say it is the best computer game I have ever played, and I've been playing since the glory days of Atari.It's only downside is that it is too good. The temptation is strong once you start playing to renounce all other activity in favor of more BG2. Thank god Throne of Bhaal will be coming out before law school starts up in August, otherwise I might forget to go to class for a month. The development team seems to understand my pain, however.

What did I think of the two? BG2 was way better! Although I found that NN had better graphics BG2 had way better plot and character developement. BG2 also seemed( How can I say it?) More busy. You seemed to be getting more interactions with other charachters, more places to see and explore, and you character seemed to be getting cooler buy the minute (hey you can turn into a frigen' monster). BG2 was like walking into a book that you controlled. I loved NN but RB2 is my easy first pick. Don't agree with me? Well I understand everybody looks for different things in games.

I played through it mainly ignoring all the sub-quests and followed the main route, which took me longer than most games, and I loved it. The plot is top-knotch, the depth is endless and the games features are fantastic, such as 300+ spells, superb NPCs, great locales, epic battles, items and weapons to die for, dozens of good monsters and an excellent main villain. After all that I fired it up for another go through in preparation for Throne of Bhaal. I was gobsmacked at the amount of side-quests you could partake in. It turns out I played about a quarter of the game going through it normally and missed out on some fantastic adventures.

I started playing it several years ago, and would still be playing it if I hadn't lost cd2 (A new cd already heading for my house ^^) I have never been so addicted to any game in my whole life; it is role playing as nothing has been before. Instead of the usual hack'n slash you're having conversations (and sometimes romances too ^^) with your party members, getting to know them better than you ever could in BG1(or any other game).

I shouldn't have to go through this much trouble just to play a game. Do I know anything about my drivers or blah blah blah? No, but I don't think I should.

I love how she blends the suspense with a love story. While I thought this was a good read, it was not my favorite by her. I thought the plot was a little shallow. Heartbreaker and Mercy are better reads in this series. I thought the friends doing research on the con man was an extraneous storyline that really did not need to such an integral part of the story. I did like the chemistry between Alec and Regan and thought it could have been developed a little more. I also love Noah Clayborne and the friends without the side murder mystery.

The plot is not only predictable but also excruciatingly boring. the three central characters are among the most unlikeable i have ever encountered. for some mysterious reason, the author decided to builf her story around three rich young women, whose problems and concerns are incomprehensible to a regular reader.

In spite of my belief in all things Garwood, I could not get past page 105 before throwing the book down in baffled disgust, and certainly wouldn't have lasted that long if I hadn't hoped I'd find SOMETHING to realign reality as I knew it. Alas, 'twas not to be found. I would actually pay money NOT to have read even part of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweetness will turn your stomach","review":"Ms Garwood has a tendency to write books with perfect women with supposedly endearing innoncence, but in a modern setting, unless they were raised on an island by Nuns and no TV, it's just not believable. The author's attemps at contemporary romanace aren't very strong. Heartbreaker was passable as a first attempt, Mercy was more entertaining in terms of the mystery, Kill Joy finally showed promise of characters with some depth, but Murder List is so sweet it's boring. And the characters are so perfect you might as well be reading a Barbie book. I found myself getting irritated with the characters and now wonder why I even bothered to finish the book. The plot wasn't very memorable.I won't give up though, everyone can have a bad day (or book), once in a while. I only hope it doesn't become the norm."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked!","review":"I downloaded this book as one of those Kindle free offers, and it worked...

I have every single one of her historical novels. I read them over and over again. I have too since this new contemporary stuff shes been writing is so awful.So for those of you that are fans of the historical Garwood novels, WRITE to her and ask her to go back to what she does best. I did. And she wrote back and told me that she was under contract to only write this drivel. And so I wrote back and asked her if she would ever write historical again and she became defensive about it. Real eye opener there.So sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"THIS BOOK I REALLY, REALLY TRIED TO READ ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

I also like her contemporary, Heartbreaker and Mercy, even Killjoy's not bad. However, I'm really disappointed with Murder List. The heroine, Regan, is simply too airhead, spoiled, and nave. It's not funny anymore. I don't find her likeable at all. She and her friends acted more like teenage girls in high school. The suspense isn't very interesting and unlike Garwood's other novels, there's lack of real humor in the novel. One of the reasons I like reading Garwood's novels is because it's so funny. The interaction between the hero and heroine's very interesting and the heroine is usually quite witty and intelligent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder List - An easy good read for Garwood Fans","review":"Ms. Garwood broke the mold again. This book is not her usual style. Regan and Alec's relationship develops slowly over the course of a few weeks. He is trying to save her life, from a vengeful killer, before he moves to another city and a new job. By the end of the story you will not only like both Regan and Alec you will also like her two best friends. Garwood spends time developing their characters. Hopefully, at least one of them will be the heroine of her next book. I highly recommend this book as a fun easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a whodunit","review":"If you're looking for a murder mystery, this is not it. If you're expecting a whodunit, you will be sorely disappointed. The problem is, it's written like a whodunit and sets up your expectations for one. I've only read one other book worse than this: a murder mystery in which you don't find out who the killer is."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointing...","review":"I'm another avid Julie Garwood fan, but this book was a dud. No one writes historical fiction better than Ms. Garwood, but she's making the same mistake other historical writers (McNaught) have made, by turning to writing contemporary novels. None of her contemporary novels begin to compare to her historicals. I too wasted big bucks on a hardcover copy of this one - wish I'd waited to check it out at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"am a huge Julie Garwood fan. I have all her books, and had to replace a few for I read them so much that they got worn. I can even tell you some of the small errors that the editors made. I was disappointed when she changed her writing style, but after reading her first contemporary novel, I was hooked again. This book will not we one that will be read alot, if again. If I didn't know better I would swear it wasn't a Julie Garwood book. To much like Mary Higgens Clark, who is a wonderful author, but not Julie Garwood. Her usual humorous and loveable characters were missing, as well as the passion between her characters. If I hadn't read all her books, and had started with this one, I probably would have enjoyed it more. Hope this isn't her newest style."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG YAWN","review":"I will start out by saying I never buy hardback books but love this author so i peeled out the money. BIG mistake! While the book was readable and kept my attention somewhat i should have waited for it to come in at the local library.What happen to the days when you could'nt put a book down? When you got behind on everyday chores just to get in the next chapter? This was not that kind of book. Sorry it was a big YAWN!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So original!","review":"What a great concept for a thriller! The murder list makes the book more exciting as we wait for people to die. Garwood gives us what we expect from her in terms of interesting characters and romance, so fans will not be disappointed. She's made the transition from historical romance to contemporary thriller quite easily - though I would love to see another historical from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio CD: the voices were **all** wrong","review":"I'm on the last CD of this and the story seems much less interesting than the premise. However, I have to comment that the voices are just so wrong. In particular the voice of the heroine is just completely wrong (I can't be specific without being rude). The voice of the romantic interest is also just completely wrong - he doesn't sound handsome or appealing - again, I don't want to be rude. At one point, there is someone who is supposed to be a young adult, and the voice is not young, etc. I'm completely unable to follow the story because I'm so distracted and turned off by the voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A rehash of \\"Heartbreaker\\", without the interesting sideline of Noah. Ms. Garwood is one of the few authors whose work I will pay for in hardcover, as soon as it's released. I wish I had waited on this one.

I had never read Julie Garwood before, and there was nothing in the story that would prompt me to pay actual money to read any more of her work. The writing was poor, the plotting was worse and there was no suspense.For people who like romantic suspense,may I suggest that you try some by good writers like Susan Isaacs,Elizabeth Peters or even Charlaine Harris.

During a seminar of Dr. Shields's, she (and everyone else) does a little exercise of creating a list of people who had hurt or deceived them. Regan is shocked when people on her list begin dying! Alec and Regan become attracted to each other. This could easily compromise her safety and end up killing her. Together, they must figure out who is killing off the people on her list ... and why.**** This one will grab you quickly. At times it seemed to drag on a bit too long (to me) though.

The story was dragging for too long. As I was reading the book I was surprized on how little things had progressed as I was getting to the end of the book.I felt the author was reflecting too much of herself in Regan.I'm definitely not an expert in analyzing books or writing methods, but when I read a book I look for good story telling techniques and that means I don't want to see the author in the story.Similarly, an excellent actor plays different roles without any aspect of his/her personal character leaking out.I recommend reading this novel for comparison but it definitely did not make an impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed too","review":"I did manage to finish this book, but I agree with whoever said that it dragged on.

I finished it but was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"comme ci, comme ca.","review":"I got this as a Kindle promo, not knowing anything about the author or her home genre.I have to say I enjoyed the first part of the book. I thought the device of going to Regan's first day of Kindergarten then flash forwarding was interesting and well done.On the other hand, minor nits started piling up for me until they started to take over what I was supposed to be reading. The drug bust left me wondering what happened. The way the resignation of one of the main characters didn't seem to be handled realistically to me and catapulted me out of the story. Then having the cop serve as bodyguard was similarly jolting...I don't think a real PD would have countenanced such a thing and yes, this is fiction...but to suspend disbelief the suspension requires a little plausibility.It's not Agatha Christie, but then it's not a horrible read either.

The story only got back on track in the last couple dozen pages. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring","review":"I don't know if I just didn't like the way JG writes or this story is farfetched. The book has several stories and all of them are boring. The killer who wants to kill Regan but before he tries to slaughter all the persons she hated just to please her is pathetic.

A complex story to which it is easy to relate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beating the same dead horses...","review":"The prose in this book is well composed, and the story is easy to follow. My problem with it is that it is essentially the same story in books like Babbitt -- small-town snobbery and how people deal with it. The protagonist just becomes whiney and self-absorbed as she deals with the snarky people of her town -- she is just another manifestation of her social set.If you haven't read other books by Lewis, then this is worth reading.

First, there is no publishing information whatsoever. Thus, it is unusable for research purposes. Second, the chapters should have sections. There is only one section, a \\"III\\" in the first chapter. Though the words are there, the text is not complete without these sections. This edition is not worth the $18+ that Amazon sells it for, and I am quite upset that such an expensive novel is not even complete. It is useful for little more than decorative purposes, and should be advertised as such. I am a frequent Amazon shopper, but this is probably the worst text I've ever purchased from this company. I will think twice next time I purchase a novel that is out of copyright and mostly out of print from this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"NATURAL EVOLUTION","review":"Quite a departure from their original OI ! sound,this an OI !/ hard rock crossover album,complete with an acoustic ballad,keybords on a couple of the songs,and even an Ace Frehley's (Fractured Mirror) nicked (minus one note) intro to one of the songs.But don't get me wrong,it still transpires power from massive singalong choruses and guitar riffs,backed by one of the best drumming jobs I've ever heard.I got this album by mistake and even thought of putting it for sale on e-bay,but one listen and was hooked.Despite being a fan of OI ! music in general,I'd never owned a record from this band,despite the occasional borrowed or taped lp,which I found OK but not worth buying,since I am not a big fan of this band.So if you're in a similar position and are not alergic to music with a hard rock edge to it,you might well give this album a try at your own risk.The sound is good but the bonus tracks suck,except for the 1st one,Lumbdob,a reggae-tinged song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them","review":"I love these.

Not as good as Witches Hollow, but better than many others. Good acting by the guest stars (again, better than usual) and a fair number of scenes with the divine Lisa Eilbacher...the only unbelievable part is the ending, where the jade figurine allegedly has been holding gems - curiously, the gems have made no noise during all the handling of the statuette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victoria's victory","review":"When you begin to listen this CD, your first surprise is to hear some instruments, specially viola. Tomás Luis de Victoria composed all the pieces that contains the CD only for voices, but Jordi Savall prefered to add some staff. Certainly, this great conductor uses only intruments from Renaissance, and the collective sounds with delicated texture, specially in the case of Salve Regina and Magnificat Primi Toni for eight voices. Finally, you forgot the conductor, the instruments and also yourself and relish the music of this master of the vocal music, probably, with Pallestrina, the best harmonizer of a large number of different voices. If you are interested in harmony as a musical discipline, or simply if you stir with beauty, you will find in this CD many minutes of satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"4.5 stars, really?","review":"I purchased this cover based on the number of good reviews, but I am writing this review in response to these glowing reviews. First off, some reviewers mentioned this cover is perfect for a smaller grill with no/collapsible sides. Not true. This cover is sewn to accommodate the sides as well as a small grill. The only thing that makes this small is the fact that it's short. Second, the quality of the cover is poor. I agree with another reviewer in that it really is just a dark green vinyl tablecloth (lined with felt) sewn to fit a wide grill. Quality-wise, it doesn't even come close to the previous cover I had, which was made with heavy water resistant fabric. To be fair, this does have velcro fasteners. Personally, I'll be happy if I get one year out of this cover.

I couldn't find one of those straight covers so in desperation tried this one. The small size is roomy but fits great and I like the Velcro fasteners.

In the discription it claims, \\"Fire-retardant fabric offers UV protection and resists cold cracking.\\" Well after about 1 1/2 years it began cracking and tearing all along the top. The grill does sit in the hot Savannah sun. But it is obvious that the claim of UV protection is false. I would rather pay a little more money and get one that wouldn't have to be replaced every couple of years. I will say that if your grill is in a sheltered area, it might last longer. But they shouldn't make claims that are not true."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal & quality!","review":"Just had to say how pleased I am with this purchase.

None of them last long - especially if you live in a place where you experience hot summers and cold winters. It fit my small gas grill perfectly and is a bit shorter than my previous one - which means it's less apt to get hit by the weed wacker in the summer. It just survived a blizzard and did not budge.

The power of the motor seems to be fine for normal use. My only complaint is that opening and closing the chuck jaws is a bit clunky, but it gets the job done.

This is like a new version of a combination of those, Oleander-style.One song on this particularly, \\"Jimmy Shakur Day\\", sounds like it is meant to be like Nirvana.Hilights include the releases \\"Yours if you like\\" and \\"Are You There?\\", the love-attatchment saga \\"She's Up, She's Down\\", and the remniscent \\"Back Home Years Ago\\". This cd is like the ballad version of the first cd (although \\"are you there?\\" is like \\"why i'm here\\" and I suppose \\"Yours if you like\\" can be reffered to as like \\"i walk alone\\". Anyway, most of the songs on here fall under the ballad or power-ballad categories. They accomplish this by also pulling off the modern rock of late 90s and now style and also the grunge rock style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good CD","review":"I was very pleased with this CD.

The heavier tracks \\"Unwind\\" and \\"Are You There?\\" give the album the edge that i like.

I must have read this book a million times, and I am only thirteen. This and Alan Mendelsohn: Boy From Mars are my favorite books of Mr. Pinkwater's. This book sparked interests in my friends and I of lizards and corn muffins. Every time I read this I enjoy the adventures of The Chicken Man (a.k.a. Charlie Swan and a lot of other things), his hen Claudia, and Victor, a (somewhat) ordinary kid. I love the humorous happenings (i.e., the Lizards doing a take-off of Groucho Marx's You Bet Your Life) and the twisted plot! This book is for EVERYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come for the fantasy; stay for the authentic touches","review":"I am always struck, when reading blurbs, reviews and comments about Pinkwater books, by the emphasis on the fantasy, the absurdity, and the loopiness. Lots of authors can do that. Very few authors besides Pinkwater can do that and yet also touch moments of stunning authenticity.Once the lizards show up in this one the book just becomes a finely amusing fantasy. But, before that, when our hero is puttering around his empty house, or working on his model, or taking a public transit bus to a neighboring town, or just generally scheming to keep his parents from getting suspicious, that is where Pinkwater shines. He creates the most self-reliant, self-possessed, competent kids in literature.Good for him. Great for the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of background information","review":"Im still reading through this book a week after I bought it. There is so much information to digest and so many things I want to try and incorporate into my life.

This book does not offer that. It does not give someone without a great deal of prior knowledge a good historical reference for what led to war. I feel like the author of this book assumes the reader is extremely familiar with the conflict and decided to write a book sharing some of his personal experiences that coincided with major events in the conflict. The chapters severely lack coordination. As somebody else mentions it goes into way too much detail about insignificant figures. I also purchased \\"Yugoslavia, Death of a Nation\\". Though I've only finished the introduction and first chapter I already feel like I've learned more than after completion of \\"The Fall of Yugoslavia\\".

This is one of the most poorly written books on any subject. It purports to be a personal account of travels through Yugoslavia before and during its fall. But, there are way too many detailed references to minor political figures and small towns to keep track of. Nor do they seem to be mentioned for any particular reason. The book lacks focus and purpose. It is also now hopelessly out-of-date, despite revisions. One of the author's predictions is that the Serbs will never make Kosovo an issue for miltary control--granted he said this over 5 years ago. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are there no Outlines? Are there no editors?","review":"Maddeningly disjointed and disorienting.

Shame on the editors of this book for failing to package it in a readable form. What could have genuinely been the answer to thousands of readers' concern about this subject remains a hopeless muddle, a stream-of-consciousness hodgepodge.

The characters can be funny at times, and the weapons are kind of cool. One major problem is that it's not clear how you're supposed to get past certain parts of the game. You can sit there shooting away at everything and not know what you're really supposed to be doing.The reason I gave this one star (and would have given it even less if I could) is because this game relies heavily on jumping puzzles.

I've used it in extreme heat (zipped out flat and covering up with a sheet) and fairly cold (but not 20-30 degrees, for which it is rated-I'm not nuts!). If you want some extra cold-weather insurance, put a polar fleece blanket in your pack. I really like the little pocket up by your face, too.

I was very disappointed given the gushing praise on the jacket (who are these people?!).More and more it seems as if there are hardly any excellent thriller writers around today and the publishing industry is pushing books which barely make the readable grade, like this piece of nonsense.

Mrs. Sayers gave a brief look at the years ahead in \\"Busman's Honeymoon,\\" but could not, of course, describe the little ones unconceived. Boys will be boys, and Harriet Vane's kids are Wimseycal chips to be admired. Well, anyway, Mrs. Sayers-Fielding as she then was takes the time to watch over the young family still living at Talboys.And there are other stories, some clever, one or two as gruesome as anything in fine English mystery fiction. For those who know Dorothy Sayers' great creation, this is a must have, being the last authentic Wimseyana ever finished by her own hand. For newcomers, it is a perfect gentle introduction to the noble detective and his (growing) entourage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lean and on the dark side","review":"These short stories are fine examples of the strong, lean prose required of all short fiction, not just mysteries. It seemed to me that Sayers let readers into the dark corners of her mind a bit more than in her novels--especially in that story about the sculptor. That one gave me chills. Not to say that all the stories weren't satisfying. It was also nice to glimpse some of Lord Peter's married life. If only there were more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightfully Mysterious Book","review":"The Lord Peter Wimsey stories are very imaginative. They show off Dorothy Sayers' knowledge of liturature and keep a nice sense of humour throughout. As a fan of Agatha Christie, I keep a critical eye on mysteries in general and I found these to be clever and interesting with conclusions that are not always wild but can keep the mystery-reader interested. Sayers does not succumb to the temptation to make her mysteries impossible-to-solve for the reader, but succeeds in throwing in some surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"When your reading a PD or Agatha book...","review":"This is a great book to read while your reading other books.

I also didn't care much for the organization. Lastly, the font used is small, and this makes it all the more difficult to read for any length of time.

We had quite a bit of fun playing with it for an hour or so on Christmas day. When she and her friends wanted to play several days later, the Monkey had died and would not emit its high frequency sound. After changing its battery (there is no positive motion power switch, only a red button with no indication that it is powered off) and the batteries in the wand, we tried it again. The monkey would emit a very low power signal, so low that the only way to detect it is to hold the wand directly over the speaker port. It appears that the high frequency sound amplifier in the monkey is bad, rendering the toy useless. Very disappointed in the durability of what was otherwise a pretty promising toy. Unfortunately, can't return it as the packaging was thrown out with all the Christmas wrapping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, Poor Execution","review":"I read so many good reviews that I thought maybe those who rated this product poorly had purchased duds or earlier models.Nope, the product really is pretty worthless.

My kids could see the monkey before the wand even lit up. The customer who wrote that you can put the monkey in containers, under blankets, etc. must have the wand on steroids because it says right on the box that you can't do that or else the wand will not work.

I would pay 2x the price for one that actually worked because all of these kids love hide n seek. Not a single pair would work though. We tried every wand with every monkey. Some would give a very faint signal when you were about 1 foot from it, other didn;t even light up.One monkey was about 1 hour out of the box when my niece (about 2 1/2 foot tall) dropped it on the carpet and the arm broke off.What a dissapointment!Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hide and Seek Monkey","review":"My grandson enjoyed finding him in the trees and bushes although the wand doesn't sound off unless you areright ontop of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"Grandchildren (2 girls and 1 boy; ages 2 - 4) loved this game and played all weekend with it.

Give it some time and you will fall in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"review from Synthesis","review":"On Minus the Bear's Spanish-ly eponymous new CD, the long-underrated indie rockers manage to incorporate dance-able beats, ample synths and memorable hooks without sounding anything like the multitudes of neo-new wave bands storming the shores of pop music. Though the band has long been known more for their tongue-in-cheek lyrics and song titles, this notoriety has often taken away from the fact that they do kick quite a lot of ass, musically. Like a streamlined version of the Dismemberment Plan, Minus the Bear fill the 50-plus minutes of Menos El Oso with enough electronically aided indie funk to kill The Braverys and Killers of the world stone dead. Dancing with crossed arms never seemed so right.- Daniel TaylorSynthesis.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"I love this group.

In this book, it made no sense at all. And it made even less sense that should would involve herself in ways that put her in so much danger, such as following suspects up mountain roads by herself, breaking into suspect's homes and businesses, and confronting suspects face to face with no backup.I also found her personality especially annoying in this book compared to the previous one. I kept wondering why Villari didn't lock her in a cell and toss away the key...for good.I haven't found any more books in this series...if there are more, I hope I enjoy them as much as the first one, or I'll cut this series off sooner rather than later. This one was just painful to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love begins at 40! part 3","review":"Ok folks Donna Hill has done it again, the series continues with the four friends this story concentrates mainly on Stephanie and Tony.

They're a band that can ROCK, but after you listen to their music, you catch yourself thinking about the lyrics. I know, I know, the words thinking and rock band don't usually belong in the same sentence, but these guys are the exception to that rule. Hugh Dillon is a lyric writing genius. He's also a neurosis filled, authority hating, terminally depressed rebel that we'd all like to be in our rock and roll dreams.

I enjoyed the old-fashioned wit of his excerpts so much I ended up buying a copy--something I am not prone to do. It took half a year, but when I finally got around to reading it, it was exactly what I expected: a gentle, witty tale of a country bumpkin's move to London to work for his great-uncle's newspaper. There are a boatload of supporting characters who are all utterly believable, with their own quirks and entertaining agendas. One small criticism is the silliness of character names, which slightly detracts from the overall assuredness of the writing. There is a lot going on, but it all resolves more or less satisfactorily, as is the norm in fish-out-of-water stories of this ilk. The one area that could have used a bit more attention was the history of the hero's grandfather. A promising debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"witty and very enjoyable","review":"I've just finished reading this book and I love it. For a first novel, Theroux is greatly talented.

I used the coffee maker for 3 pots of coffee and I'm done, it's in the box, and it is going back. This thing is a piece of junk. It makes the weakest cup of coffee that I have ever had. I should have heeded the warning of others but, let's face it, I'm cheap. I want to spend the least amount of money I possibly can to receive a product that meets my expectations.

And even though it is technically under warranty, Amazon makes the warranty return policy incredibly obtuse.

As always I agree buyer beware! and reading the reviews can only get you so far in your selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value coffee maker","review":"This coffee maker does what it should - make coffee. It's pretty low frills, but at its price point, it's to be expected. It makes and keeps very hot coffee, and I love the programmable auto-brew feature. My chief complaint is the cord is really short, we actually had to buy an extension cord to be able to plug it in and keep it in the corner on the counter. If I had to do it over, I'd probably drop a few more dollars and get something a little nicer, but, again, for the price, it's a decent coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffe maker","review":"I like the looks of this coffe maker works great and love the fact if I forget to turn it off it shuts off by itself in 2 hours"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee maker if you like HOT coffee!","review":"This coffeemaker looks great on the counter - and makes a great cup of coffee too.

I thought buying a Hamilton Beach would insure a hassle free product. After all, what can they do to screw up a coffemaker?? I have been using this maker for about 9 months now and have two big issues from day one. Right after brewing, the coffee is not hot. So, I end up nuking the first few cups. Also, when making 10 or more cups and therefore using more coffee grounds, I always end up with grounds IN the pot. I attribute both of these problems to the hot water sitting in the grounds basket too long which overflows the coffee filter. Bottom line: warm coffee with a side order of grounds. I am hoping that the extremely hard water we have here kills this off sooner than later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly and loud coffee","review":"This thing must be made of inferior plastic; the coffee it produces stinks and tastes of petroleum. My wife wouldn't take a second sip.What drove me crazy was the surprisingly loud clicking sound coming from the hot plate after brewing. My guess is that it is the switch controlling the heating mechanism, flipping on and off at irregular intervals to control the temperature of the coffee. It's impossible to ignore once you are aware of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, but the carafe is terrible.","review":"This coffee maker looks great and has simple easy to understand controls. However, it seems like no one at Hamilton Beach ever tried making coffee with it before they shipped it! Because of a large lip around the inside edge of the carafe, it is very difficult to pour all the water out of the carafe when filling the coffee maker, and very difficult to empty all coffee out of the carafe when cleaning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"coffee pot","review":"I am very pleased with the way the Hamilton Beach 12 cup coffeemaker is performing. I have noticed that it is important to allow the glass carafe to stay on the heat source for a few minutes after the coffee has perked. Otherwise, the coffee will Not be hot enough. Also, if your expecting a signal when the perking is completed you will Not hear a beep. But for the money it is quite sufficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee at good price","review":"After having a more expensive Cuisinart that made and held coffee without a carafe go caput, I didn't want the expense again so I opted for the much less expensive Hamilton Beach.

Cheaper than many other models that look ugly and have the same whistles and bells.Cons: Tab on coffee pot already broke with 2 weeks use, coffee pot has the markings in increments of 2 starting on 4 (so if you want to make yourself only 2 cups of coffee you need a measuring cup or guess).Overall a very good buy for the time I have been using it; would recommend.I am going to make myself and my hubby a cup of joe, see ya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Tasting Coffee Ever","review":"I don't know if this was a new machine or not but I have run gallons of water through this machine and used the vinegar solution twice and the coffee still tastes bad.

The lid is very difficult to get off because it snaps in firmly,without a design to easily remove it for washing.

Brilliant! Other reviewers say the access hole is small, and it may be, but I've seen bigger accesses and the carafe still spilled water everywhere. This design works! (The access is sloped like a funnel, making it even easier.) It also pours cleanly from the pot to the cup. And get this: it has not made a mess with the coffee grounds even once!

No matter how much ground coffee we put in it, from 2 scoops to 4 scoops, it still produced a very weak cup of coffee. We gave it a good test and no matter what we did, we were disappointed. The water came out hot enough, so it could not have been the temperature, we don't know what could have caused it. We did not want to give up...we paid more for it than we would have at a discount store for something comparable.

It is easy to program, and after brewing, the coffee is nice and hot, especially if you wait 5 minutes after it's finished. The only thing I was disappointed in is that the hinge that keeps the flip-lid on the top of the carafe is not constructed to hold up too long. The 'hinge' is actually just 2 little nibs of plastic and one of them broke off after about 2 months. The carafe is still usable, I just need to keep my finger on the lid as I pour the coffee. I wash the carafe by hand, and in retrospect should have been aware of its shortcomings.The only other thing is: The coffeemaker fits nicely under my cabinet, but in order to fill it, I have to pull it all the way out every time because the coffeemaker lid flips up in order to receive the water. So I just put it on a tray and slide the whole works out on the tray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Maker","review":"I bought a brand new Black-Decker coffee make about three weeks ago. I hated it from the day I got it. It was very awkward to use. After 3 days the lid fell off, and I trashed it! This new Hamilton-Beach cost a few dollars more, but it has been a far better value. It's easy to load & the auto-program couldn't be easier. Hamilton-Beach is a great brand in general & I can highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic collection of old commercials + cool arty shorts","review":"Not all the commercials are from the 1970's (Crisco ad looks like it was from the early 60's), but it's a fun watch for (with the exception of 1 or 2 commercials, i.e. the VD commercial) the whole family. It's amazing what psychology was used to sell products in the pre-cynical age from which these ads were culled.

While it is a solid game, I must say that it fell short of my expectations. This game could have been called Baldur's Gate 1.5 -- it has almost exactly the same graphics, interface and gameplay. I greatly preferred the larger sized characters in Planescape. The sound and music are better and the spell effects have also been improved. Path finding still seems to be flawed.

However I had all the problems they complain of with BG. Considering that the Character choices (except for the one you start with) statuses were extremly bad. In Icewind Dale this is fixed in the beginning you select all your party. I don't know if this was done in BG2 (since I did not want to buy the sequel to a game I could not finish not understanding the plot) but it should of been done in BG1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Wrote These Reviews?

My only real complaint about this game is that there is a limit to the number of experience points you can get, and most classes can only go as high as around 15th, 16th, or 17th level. Other than that, it is an awesome game and a must-have for fans of fantasy rpgs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Icewind Dale","review":"Having been a fan since the first D&D games hit the market, I can honestly say that they have outdone themselves.

The plot goes as such; there is a big scary evil somewhere and you just have to pick up the biggest weapon and go at it. Stunning visuals but with no plot, like a hollow birthday cake. I think that for ... more bucks, you'd be better off getting Baulder's Gate II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorta o.k., but not worth the money","review":".... It's ... frustrating, too the point that it isn't fun. I'm an avid gamer. It's fun to \\"role-play\\" low level characters. An orc or two can be a very scary thing. This doesn't translate well to a computer game that wipes out an entire party in ten seconds even with the \\"AI\\" scripts on. The visuals are cool, but I wish I would have plunked my money down for something else. This game does not deliver. Boring linear plot and hack-n-die. Buy some dice, a figure and paper for a real roleplaying game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linear and slow","review":"Dull very very dull and very linear. Not worthy of the Baldar's Gate games.

But for the rest it is an excellent game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hack 'n' slash fun","review":"This game takes me back to the old Gold Box D&D games I'd play on my Commodore 64.With the frantic dungeon combat and engaging (albeit linear) plot of those classic games, coupled with the Infinity engine that made Baldur's Gate such a joy to play, along with gorgeous graphics (especially spell effects), this game is an unmitigated success. Creating your party of up to 6 characters gives you greater ownership of your game and a greater opportunity for role-playing (rather than the single-player Diablo, Diablo 2, or Baldur's Gate), and the lengthy in-depth plot gives you plenty of hours of game play to move that party up the experience point ladder.Overall, a great gaming experience for D&D gamers and RPG fans alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game that nets tons of fun!","review":"This game is a big improvement over Baldur's Gate. PROS: Simpler, better pathfinding, and more spells. The best improvement is that you can make up the entire party, not just one character. That gives you the freedom to custom-made your ideal party. Cons: While the pathfinder has been improved it is still weak in some ways. Overall: Faster, Stronger, Better game than BG1!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Best RPG I've ever played!","review":"This game is stunning! Yeah its billed as just hack and slash, but the work that went into the game is immediately evident. The artwork is amazing, but the music steals the show right off the bat. As a fan of movie soundtracks I sometimes find myself just sitting and listening to the game play! The character voices are also even better this time around. I've only played into the Vale of Shadows but I'm already hooked, this game is awesome. You're more driven by a storyline, there's less wandering around exploring than in BG. Better than Baldur's Gate for me, had Interplay made their original 6/23 release date I wouldn't have bothered with Diablo 2. After playing each game for a couple hours, I found myself craving IWD and Diablo 2 still sits on the shelf! IWD sets a very high standard for BG2, but I'm sure Interplay is up to the challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated to build sailing skills","review":"This book does not achieve what it promises: to transition novice sailors to cruise-ready in seven days.

Within two more weeks all their teeth (including teeth in back) were plaque-free and white down to the gum line.After 6 months we switched to this product, Plaque and Tartar Control, because the ongoing cost was considerably less than Triple Pet Plaque Off.

He said it's okay and that my dog, now three, won't need to have his teeth cleaned for at least another two-three years. He is just now starting to get a little placque.

I already brush her teeth 2-4 times/week, and she had all white teeth except her rear molars which would get yellow mushy plaque- the type i could scrape off with my fingernail in a chip.Well, after using this product, it seemed to have an opposite effect of what is claimed. I kept using it for weeks, thinking \\"maybe it gets worse before getting better,\\" but am now quitting after over a month of use before I do any more damage. The soft tartar has hardened and is now much tougher to break off, and more of her teeth have become discolored.

I felt this would be a good follow-up to the dental cleaning he just had. Furthermore, the dog does not seem to like the product and has not been drinking nearly as much as he used to.

The whole thing isn't very well explained, its as if it needs a prequal to tell you how Dr. Spittle and the others actually ended up where tehy were at the beginning.

Peterson traces the concept of worship for Israel from the OT to the NT, which helped me understand much of the remaining Jewish customs and backdrop for worship for believers today. I was especially encouraged by the discussion of the temple and the reality that worship is no longer bound by a geographical location.

BUT, when the CD arrived and I played it, I was greatly disappointed. This CD needs a National Geographic Label not a Popular Music Label. Savina offers outstanding ethnic and musical talent. Sevina's haunting mid-Eastern \\"replicas\\" of Enja and Fairuz are wonderful but there are only five or six tracks that could be used in a group appreciation (party) environment, these are eclipsed by a cacaphony of, probably ethnically accurate, but tooth and spine jarring interpretations of multi- ethnic sounds. Note the word sounds - not music.

They're steadily gaining national recognition while staying loyal to their sound and fanbase. Electric Version, was a gem of an album combining catchy music with excellent vocals. The harmonies stay in your head and keep you tapping your feet for days.Twin Cinemas, the bads most recent record, continues this trend. The record is not quite as upbeat as Electirc, but still screams fun. A.C. Moore and his band sound tight and together throughout the record.

Im not sure if this is actually indie but I generally do not like much music in that genre. I dont think many indie bands have good vocalists but it is easy to see that that The New Pornographers have beautiful harmonizing vocals. Overall this is easy to listen to, and is just good indie pop. They seem to have some kind of chemistry in the band to create such simple enjoyable music. There are not too many memorable songs, except maybe Sing Me Spanish Techno, but overall it is very pleasing to the ears.8.2/10 - I recommend this album to all indie and alternative fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album!","review":"You'd think after two great albums, that the third would slip a bit in quality. You would be wrong then my friend! TWIN CINEMA is another great album from one of the best groups to come out of the pike in a while. The album still boasts the same hooky, power pop songs we've come to expect from the New Pornographers. It's a sunny record that sounds bright even when the tempos slow down and the melodies change toward a minor key. The great thing about this band is that every member has an equal part, and contributes something to the project. So maybe band isn't the best word to describe them, but team is more fitting. It's nothing groundbreaking, but it seems that they've found a niche and sound that works for them, and this listener couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shins meet Abba","review":"First time to listen to this band and they just didn't impress.

This'll be collecting dust on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD, seemingly timeless","review":"To anyone interested in purchasing this CD, all you have to do is listen to the 30second samples of each one, and if you understand music, that should be enough to convince you to buy 'Twin Cinema'. Omit the far and few between negatives reviews such as that of D. N Voetberg - who compares one of the album's best song to an Ashlee Simpson song ( this guy has the boy scout handbook on his wish list, though, so maybe he's a litte 'off').

The rest of the tracks on the album are simply not memorable, easily forgotten. Personally, I don't think that three tracks on an album of 14 songs makes it a worthwhile addition to any music listener's collection.

What do you expect from the New Pornographers? Looking for a philosophical basis for your new religion? Personally, I'm in it for the hooks, and the super catchy, fun songs. Mass Romantic and Electric Version were loaded with them, and so is this one. I can't stop listening to it, and it's getting better and better the more I do. There might be a couple of songs I'm not wild about, just like there were on the earlier albums, but taken as a whole? There's more smokin pop music on this record than we really deserve. Easy five stars. This album is a blast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me a fan.","review":"This is a great album, it made me a fan. I bought it initially because I had seen it recommended by people on sites I frequently visit, none of them actually being music dedicated sites.I approached it with an open mind, I like stuff that is more \\"out there\\" than this album. My first though was that it was a little boring and I \\"shelved\\" it (I would skip songs when they would come up randomly and so on) for maybe a month or so.

I'm very happy with the price and the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Colander","review":"This is a well-built colander that should last for years.

Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China, poor quality","review":"When I bought this product, I was expecting a metal colander similar to the one my mother had when I was a kid. Yeah, not so much. The metal is very thin and feels quite flimsy. The other issue I have with the colander is that it is made in CHINA.

This strainer works great and I think I may buy more sizes of the same style."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love it, BUT","review":"Ok I love the tiny holes so that I don't worry about shaking the spaghetti out of the colander. The problem are the handles. While this is meant to sit in the sink and you don't \\"have\\" to hold it, at times I do \\"need\\" to. The handles are very thing and you have to brace a finger or two against the side of the colander where the hot food is in order to hold it upright. You can't just grasp the handle and hold it straight. So, I am disappointed in that aspect and would not purchase it again for this reason. Also, I think the bottom of the inside could be a little more rounded. The liquid tends to pool around the rather wide are the colander is attached to the base. So when I tip it to release the liquid, I risk losing some pasta if I have made a big batch. Using this for pasta was my main reason for purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"When the colander was pulled from the box, my husband said, \\"Is it used?\\" The colander is quite small for a 'large' I was expecting it to be bigger.

I almost chose one of those mesh strainers but after reading some reviews am glad I purchased this one.

When I zap tomatoes in the processor, I freeze the solids, but like to drain off some of the liquid for fresh juice. This nice colander sits perfectly inside my large 5 qt mixing bowl for that purpose.It doubles as a course strainer since the holes are all over and relatively small and is super for capturing all the aromatics and bones you've boiled to make a stock, while allowing the stock itself to flow through to your bowl or large soup pot.I really needed a strainer this size that was footed so it would sit securely in the sink, but also sit inside a bowl when I wanted to save the liquid and I'm delighted with this product. It is sturdy and well made. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large collander turns out to be small","review":"I like the design of this collander (it has a fairly large, round base that is less likely to tip over), and it seems to be reasonably well made. However, what is sold as the \\"large\\" size is actually quite small. The inside diameter of the bowl is just over 9\\" and, even more problematic, the bowl is well less than 4\\" deep (i.e., quite shallow.) Thus, the capacity of the collander is actually very limited and it can be characterized as large only relative to the other two that Amazon sells, which must be quite tiny.

It was great in the beginning, although my dogs did not drink from it very much. Then I went to clean it. It is a bear to clean. And lifting the 5 gallon water bottle in order to clean it, isn't pleasant either. When I cleaned it, there was a small piece next to the plastic filter that broke off. Plus, it leaks water in between the water tank and the bowl. I should call the manufacturer to ask for a new plastic piece, but it's not listed in the manual. My next fountain will not have an outlet. And as far as keeping it free from dog hair or food, that's bogus too. It does not keep the water free from hair or food.

It turned out to be the pump. When the dogs drank too much water at one time, the pump started and didn't stop. I ended up with a gallon of water on the floor each time.

It is a bit noisy and takes a short while for your pets to get used to the pump motor noise and the bubbling of the water tank noise. Does a good job of providing a constant flow of fresh filtered water. The only drawback is cleaning the bowl area. The whole unit must be unplugged and turned upside down after removing the water jug to rid the bowl of inevitable dirt and hair that finds its way into the drinking area as it sits on the floor. Overall, it's a good product, especially for cats with renal problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a hacks book, interesting though","review":"This isn't really a hacks book per se. It's a set of 100 small vignettes on the brain and on neuroscience. I found surprisingly little on how to change the behavior of your brain. Or practical ways to focus your attention, to become smarter or faster. That's what I was hoping to see. Though what I see instead is interesting all on it's own.If you are interested in neuroscience, or the function of the brain. And little games of tweaking your perception that you probably learned in Psych 101 and hen forgot. You will probably like this book.Though I should also mention On Intelligence (0805074562) from Times Books.

Each hack is one to five pages in length and includes lists of extra resources to explore further. As a result, the book goes beyond the pages and is an interactive reading experience.There is a lot of information here that you probably won't care about and will never read, but it serves as a great reference to explore areas of interest.I particularly liked the chapters on facial recognition, detecting cheaters, and boosting memory power. I could have done without the chapters explaining optical illusions, aural illusions, and how to have an out of body experience.In short, this is a very interesting read. You will definitely find something here that will interest you and likely improve how you use your brain.

There are some great songs here though, particularly the slower moody acoustics Coragem Pra Suportar and Pega a Voga, although the more up-tempo numbers are propelled along vigorously by Roger Duprat's superb brassy orchestration. It's not Tropicalia as most people have come to know it through Mutantes and Veloso, but it's still great and unique music, if more typically Brazilian.

If ever in Chicago area, on the third Wednesday of every month they jam out at Fitzgerald's Club in Berwyn.

Of all of the books I've read about antebellum American politics, this is far and away my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"This book, along with Foner's Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, provides extremely valuable insights into a crucial turning point in American history, which still resonates today. Both are masterpieces of synthesis and interpretation. Both are scholarly and detailed, yet convey a feeling of excitement at the events described. Both enable the reader to relive the tensions, aspirations, thoughts, and struggles of the times they describe. The 1995 reissue of Free Soil begins with an important essay by Foner, which he wrote for it.Foner was a Marxist-Leninist when he wrote both books. But he never allowed his Marxism to vitiate his historical analysis. On the contrary, he constantly emphasized that the motives that propelled the participants were ideas and ideals, not economic interest or social class (e.g., pages 4-5, 104-5, 110, 113, 168-76, 183-4, 304)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to the last cup","review":"I found this coffee to be very tasteful and delicious.

It seemed as though everyone else and the family dogs and kittens wanted to be more than a bit player in this novel. I expected more of a one on one thing between Mia and Sam.I'm still giving this five stars though. I very much enjoyed this book. It kept me up till late at night.

Robb), but not this time.I loved the first two novels in the series. I thoroughly enjoyed the bantering between Mia and Ripley, and Nell was just too sweet for words.Face the Fire seems rushed to me. There's a whole lot of uninteresting pointless dialog. The characters personalities seem so mellow compaired to the other novels. It's like they've all had too much Paxil. Especially Ripley, who was my favorite character in the series. The ending left me feeling nothing. No sense of relief, excitement, or happily ever after.Overall, I was very disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn, feeling let down.","review":"I was eagerly awaiting Mia's story. I was completely caught up in this trilogy because the first two books were fantastic. But Face the Fire was over about 30 pages in, it was predictable and flat and I only kept turning the pages because I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't.It was rushed and the story just wasn't there. No amount of flashy magick can make up for a dull story. Maybe the next trilogy will be better. But I guess when you write trilogies it's the first two books that count anyway right? Why put forth the effort in the 3rd when you know everyone's going to buy it anyway..., that is, until it happens on the next trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"fizzle and drissle, mope and moan, this book will make you titch and groan","review":"I too was hoping for a good story about Mia and Sam.

I would have read about a wedding and babies, but never the less i loved it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"What a disappointing book! I usually like Nora Roberts, but this book was a major let-down considering Mia seemed to be the main character. I really expected her story to shine and I really expected that Sam wouldn't be easily forgiven; forgiveness came with no effort on his part at all. The chemistry between the two characters was weak and relied upon their history as children instead of their present personalities. This was by far the weakest of the three in this series and I'm definitely going to be more cautious when buying Roberts' books -- they used to be on my automatic purchase list, but now they're not. This is certainly not a book that warrants above 3 stars. Save your money and borrow a friends' copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"still good reading","review":"I was somewhat disappointed with the ending. I agree with some other reviewers that it did lack something. I think the whole booksigning thing with Caroline wasn't necessary and it did abrupt quite suddenly. Mac could have played a more interesting role in this book since he was the one interpreting everything. In the first 2 books Mia was an independent tough-girl type and in this book she just wasn't. By the third book, I started to get annoyed with the whole \\"Nell's a good cook\\" thing. It still gets a 4 star rating from me though and it's worth the money. Not as much punch as the first two but still a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I think this is the first Nora Roberts book that I put down and didn't finish. I just could not get into this one and was disappointed. I liked the first book and was okay with the 2nd but this I just couldn't care about. First, I did like Mia but Hated that she was constantly flirting with Riley's boyfriend/husband and that he reacted to her made me a little uneasy as well. Anyway, Sam was just a disappointment....okay he leaves her FLAT without explaination, even after sleeping with her and writing that saying on the wall in the cave, then he has the nerve to come back 10 years later and wonder about her coldness. He thinks she is just going to blow up at him and he would soothe her. I wouldn't have even given him that after breaking her heart so completly. Just couldn't get past that and the book was a bit boring. This series just went flat and I am a huge Nora Roberts fan.Oh well, this one just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book and good trilogy.","review":"It seemed to me that all the women's trials were to either reclaim or remember something important in themselves: Nell had to regain her courage and thus her strength, Ripley had to remember her mercy and find true justice, and Mia had to relearn how to trust and how to forgive and thus to gain a deeper, better love than she had originally owned.Another of the interesting things was how the love stories of the three modern \\"sisters\\" echoed those of the ones from 300 years ago. Naturally Sam had to leave; after all, so had his counterpart in the past and the past needed to be balanced for everything to straighten out properly.And it was fitting that, finally, there was someone to take the place of the last element. There are traditionally four and it really struck me as wrong in \\"Air\\" when there were only three.Bravo, Ms. Roberts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story but not the earth shatering climax","review":"I was expecting. The reason I say this is because the other books in the series seemed to be building up to something incredible. While Face the Fire is an interesting story, the ending does not satisfy. Mia and Sam are great characters and have lots of chemistry. However, I thought that the reason for Sam's departure was flimsy at best. He basically left because he was feeling smothered, tied down by Mia and her love. He has loved her all these years yet he stayed away for over a decade!!! I just could not really care about him after that. I also though Mia should have made him beg and grovel before taking him back, she seemed to give in way too easily. Aside from this, the writing, as in all of Robert's books, is excellent the appearance of the characters from the previous books is also a treat. This book is recommended to those who have read the other two, if you have not I recommend starting out with the first book Dance Upon the Air. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed so mote it be","review":"I really like the first book, the second was for me a slight step down and maybe I was just expecting tooooooo much from the 3rd but I was surely let down. I am an avid NR reader and this one was well below her normal grade. She had built Mia into such a compelling character in the first two books and this one just somehow didn't deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ending a little flat but otherwise great book","review":"I always found Mia to be the most interesting of the three and was looking forward to her book. Most of the story doesn't disappoint, her and Sam have great chemistry and with their history together it adds interesting elements. Nell, Ripley & their husbands are all an integral part of the story and it was good to \\"see\\" them again. The book moves along at a very fast pace, which is why I suppose I found the ending a little lacking, with so much build up I was expecting a bit more during the final confrontation with the darkness threatening the island. You are given signs about the strength of Mia's power and I was expecting it to be used a bit more for the climax. While the ending did fizzle a bit, the book was still a great read and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definatly the best of the three","review":"I loved this trilogy!!! I so glad my friend gave me the first book to read since then I was hooked and I bought the next 2 in the series the day they came out. If I had to pick my favorite in the triolgy it would be this one, it was great I loved it. In the other to books the potrayed Mia as a very sexy mysterious goddess but they never really talked about her so when I read this book it unlocked that mystery and let me into Mia heart mind and soul. Then when you add in the romantic intrest of Sam Logan it really gets good. Like the other it has fear, sadness, joy, and excitment. I highly recommend this triology this will be one that I know I will re-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witchcraft...not here","review":"This was no where near as good as the first two books.

If you like a little magic, or paranormal mixed in with a lot of love and laughter, the three sister's trillogy is the set for you. All three books are a must read but there was something compelling about Mia that I couldn't wait for her story to be told. I was not disapointed. Sugcessful business woman, wiccan by birth, and by choice Mia can not find a man to replace the young man who moved away and broke her heart. It is years latter now and Sam is back, can Mia trust again ? Can they work together to save their home ? Can they find what they had before ?

I found this story to be somewhat contrived and a disappointment. Mia and Sam are both strong characters and the book did not do justice to either of them. The reason why Sam left Mia was weak. The grudge Mia held for Sam throughout most of the book was even weaker. This conclusion to the trilogy betrayed both characters.

It had everything going for it. But by this book, well, where was the editor.I guess it started going downhill in the second book when instead of a real villian and real human emotions like fury and despair being the catalyst, Roberts went toward this undefined evil. It gets to the point in Face the Fire, where the book is basically a show-off for her knowledge of Wiccan speak. Zack Todd is now indistinguishable from some of her other heroes (Aidan in Jewels of the Sun comes to mind) and Ripley is also just a shadow of her former self-Booke has been reduced to a one-dimensional Ghost Buster. She keeps bring things out of left field just to make things work without ever having shown them before.The ending is muddy, rushed and not quite followable. I'm sure this book will sell, simply because it is the third-but I'm not going to be rushing out for the next trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok... but not as much character development as I and II","review":"Don't get me wrong--- nobody does a romantic trilogy like Nora Roberts. But I must confess--- the third book in the Sisters trilogy left me somewhat disappointed. My favorite component of Nora Roberts' novels is the character development. Mia's story with Sam left much to be desired. I was longing for more flashbacks- more meat about their history together. The plot, surrounding the wolf-demon- was vague, and Mia's \\"challenge\\" didn't seem as intense as the previous novels.

This was a real disappointment.Do read the first two volumes - they are sexy and saavy and great to read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Par","review":"I was very disappointed with this 3-book series, particularly the last one. These were not the usual gripping, can't-put-it-down Nora Roberts books that we all love. I saved these books to read until all 3 were available, and read them right after reading Nora Roberts' new book \\"Three Fates\\" which was fantastic. Maybe that's another reason these were a real letdown. The story was too far-fetched to be believable and the 3rd book seemed to hurry through tying all 3 stories together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay - who really wrote this book","review":"This first book really grabbed my attention and left me waiting impatiently for the second. The second was not as good as the first, but I thought it was because I really did not identify with Ripley. However, I expected the third book to really deliver - end the series well and develop the powerful and mysterious Mia. After reading this book, I was sorely disappointed. Other NR trilogies have been spectacular (all three books). In this book things 'happen', without real character or situational development. Suddenly, animosity between characters is gone. Suddenly, a character does something out of character with no explanation. The ending was also a little too romance-novel-cookie cutter for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely treading water","review":"This album is rather lame. I was expecting more from Embryo, having got Opal and Father Son and Holy Ghost and enjoying them both. Those are good examples of some fairly imaginative German jazz-blues-rock from the '70's. This, however, sounds as uninspired as its title. Long, winding mostly blues-based wankings with no purpose or fire to them at all. The tracks are WAAY too long for what they are - it smells of CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION to me. Whether or not that's true, I don't know, but I do know that I AM trading my copy for something more worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and Thoughtful Playing","review":"This album has Mal Waldron (electric piano) and Jimmy Jackson (organ) playing with the rest of the Embryo crew.

It catalogs not only a point by point refutation of Von Daniken's theories, but exposes an alien philosophy that is clearly anti-Christ. Wilson is warning Christians to not be fooled by beings that bring another gospel (of peace and love), while denying the Biblical truth of original sin, judgment and need for a sinless Savior/Messiah to forgive them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Weak Attempt to Write off Erich von Daniken","review":"This book is not worth 1 cent of your money. In this book, Clifford Wilson tries to write off von Daniken as wrong and reveal to the world how von Daniken's theories were illogical. The fact is this:his arguments revolved around the idea that Christians knew better than to believe that \\"God\\" was nothing more than an alien, which were even weaker than von Daniken's illogical jumps!The fact is this:there is no way around von Daniken. Despite the fact that most of his arguments were illogical, he presented lots of interesting points, and most of his illogical arguments were fixed in his sequels.So don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors and lies","review":"This book has so many errors I'm amazed it came from Microsoft.

I usually like kitsch, low-budget comedy-horror flicks -- they can be a lot of fun. But this one was just painful to watch, to the point where I found myself counting down the minutes until it was over. The wonderful cast of actors and actresses deserved better writing and directing than this movie offered them. Illogical, inane, and insipid, this movie is one I wish I'd never watched, and one I definitely will never watch again. I would have given it one star, but I felt the cast deserved better, hence my rating of two.Then again, I have to admit, for all its faults, it was still better than 'Disaster Movie'. As is a colonoscopy without an anaesthetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugbusters-Another Flop of Heigl's-What's Happening?","review":"The early portion of Katherine Heigl's career seemed to promise a great deal of upcoming success. But after her release of Wish Upon a Star , things have gone terribly downward, it seems. Bugbusters, was the latest, and prime example. In an age of young actresses succeeding in Hollywood as if there's no tomorrow, why hasn't Heigl made it? She showed brilliance in all movies she put out up to 1996, but since then, there's been nothing. I still maintain she's a fine actress, and seems to be one of Hollywood's very nice, caring young women.However, in Bugbusters, she had to resort to images of \\"near nudity (The bathtub and shower scenes).\\" What's up Hollywood?

Overall, I think this Luke better captures the feel of the character than the newStar Wars Comic Packs EMPEROR PALPATINE CLONE & LUKE SKYWALKER Star Wars Dark Empire #1 Action Figures & Comic Book Set.

He believes in this music and his voice and style had the potential to create one of the best gospel albums ever. However, the terrible production quality of this album has ruined it. Track 5, Take My Hand Precious Lord, has significant audible distortion. I sent it back for a new copy, and it had the same problem! The other tracks are mixed TERRIBLY. His voice is barely audible at times, and the rest of the time the mix is just an echoed mess with too much bass. None of his other albums have that problem, so I think his turning over the production of this album to some local guys in Texas, instead of his usual pro team, was a major mistake.

But listen again - it is very pleasant! And real! It sticks out, even though most af te songs are well known classics. Engelbert's voice blends very well with the gospel groups consisting of older men, like the Jordanaires.I have to give this album five stars.

Engelbert has now conquered country and rockabilly music! This is one of the best-recorded, most spiritual undertakings in country gospel. A masterpiece of a production by Art Greenhaw of The Light Crust Doughboys, this album continues to receive raves and accolades from around the world including Grammy nominations. Engelbert is, of course, a legend, but this gem takes him away from the Vegas-Lounge mold and transforms him to a whole new plane of soul, grit and recording excellence.

Truthfully, I would give it a rating of 4.5 stars. The tempered stainless steel is clearly of high quality. The finish is the right finish for a chef's knife. It cuts like a dream, and it's big enough for my hands. Also, the santoku-style cutaways certainly allow the knife to slide through solid foods easily. The blade is relatively thin, which requires this knife to be babied, as most fine knives should anyway.The only drawback I would mention is its balance. When holding it just behind the bolster, it tips forward (the blade tends to fall down). For me, this translates into slightly reduced feeling of control. I've used some very expensive chef's knives before and they tend to achieve balance when teetered behind the bolster.The handle feels great and it's some sort of hard rubber polymer. It has good grip when wet.

I can no longer use the tent until I get a replacement pole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesh square","review":"The mesh square is a gear loft, it gives you a place to put a flashlight, your glasses (if you wear such), your wallet, etc. Its a nice feature if floor space is tight."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are pleased with the tent","review":"Overall, the tent was easy to put up. We are happy with it's appearance and structure. It fit my 4 year old, 7 year old and myself nicely and we could have fit Dad in there too even though it may be a tight squeeze. For the price, it is great for us to have as a backyard tent. Only downfall, it comes nicely packed in a LITTLE pull string bag. After taking down the tent, we tried 3 times to wrap that thing as tightly as we could and STILL couldn't get it back in the bag. I advise that you keep the box it comes in so you can just store the rolled up tent in that if you can't fit it into the bag! A question for anyone who has this tent, there is a square mesh piece with hooks. The only place we could find to put it was inside the tent at the peak of the ceiling where there were 4 loops. WHAT is that for??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Treat hard to reach places","review":"The Dustick is a simple device, pump in air and spread pesticide dust. What makes it unique are the extension tubes that allow you to reach high areas without having to climb up and down a ladder or construct scaffolding. The extensions are well made with 'O'rings at the joints to prevent air loss and are light weight so that the tool doesn't become cumbersome in use.One detractor from the product is that only the top section has a lock to keep it from separating. This is usually not a problem as you will be using it to reach up and gravity is on your side. Just be sure to use the tool as instructed by adding sections as you reach up to an area instead of assembling the parts and trying to swing the tool into place.The price seems like a lot for a duster, but it is very well made and it performs it's intended purpose well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compilation of 80's music...........","review":"If you like 80's music you will enjoy this CD. I think all of the Pure 80's CD's are great to own. I wouldn't want to be without them. The great thing about this series is that it has many of the one-hit-wonders that you can't find anywhere else. This is the CD to buy if you want to bring back old memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giorgia--The Voice of an ANGEL!!","review":"I discovered Giorgia on the radio in Italy, and I was hooked. Her voice grabs and tears and my heart and soul. POWERFUL VOCALS (and lyrics for those who understand). She is Italy's answer to Mariah Carey! ENOUGH SAID!"},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible vocals","review":"i speak italian, i understand every single word of what she's singing, and believe, Laura Pausini can't hold a candle to Giorgia's talent, both for lyrics and voice. Giorgia's sound is a mix of Whitney and Mariah, and the songs are a mix of powerful ballads, r&b-soul tunes and also a little of country feeling! Really worth the purcase! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah Carey? PLEASE! Giorgia is much better.","review":"Giorgia doesn't screetch painfully like Ms Scary, and her songs are much more interesting and touching. Di sole e d'azzurro is one of my all time favorites and Gocce di memoria is up there, too. Giorgia is NOT in a class with Mariah or any other American pop icon, end of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like","review":"I purchased this album because I am a Bocelli fan and heard Giorgia's lovely duet with him. I thought this might be more of the same, but it is not--its tawdry, superficial, kitschy pop that is entirely forgettable. In her defense, I don't speak Italian; if I did perhaps this music would mean more to me, but then, I don't need to understand the lyrics of Bocelli's songs to appreciate his music..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"I'm a huge fan of Laura Pausini, another great italian singer. I had heard about Giorgia and decided to buy her greatest hits CD. I loved it!!! it's one of my favorite records now. Her songs are so profound and so beautiful, you just want to hear them all over again, as an aspiring singer I can say that Giorgia truly has what really makes a great not just singer but artist in every way, give this girl a chance, she has what it takes! it's also an ecellent way of learning some italian, I did! All i can say is that you have to get it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gifted Singer","review":"If you only buy one CD from Giorgia, this is it. It has all of her #1 hits as well as some of her best songs to date. Her voice is incredible and you will be truly satisfied with this collection. Another definate buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of an Angel","review":"I HIGHLY recommend this CD. I mean I don't even speak nor understand Italian but I definitely love Giorgia... she has the voice of an angel and I could translate the emotion in her songs.

She truly has an amazing voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rename this CD please.","review":"I am a big fan of Techno/Trance/Dance music. It is the bigest part of all my CD colection of approx 1400 of them. When I played these 4 CDs, I had to force myself to listen to them just once. They should have named this CD \\"Goa 2001: WORST of Psychedelic Trance\\". Apparently I don't like psychedelic-trance music. But i did get my house cleaned up while forcing myself to listen to this awful repetitive music.. !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"This should not be labelled best of psychadelic trance.If this is your first exposure to psytrance try out some different sources such as philosomatika.com, etc.This first of all doesn't sound like psy-trance to me, and second of all, whatever genre I would put it in, it would also suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Case Closed","review":"I happen to be one of those people who really like the Case Closed series. \\"Captured in Her Eyes\\" does not disappoint.

I don't know where to begin but I am very impressed by ths cd. Even the interludes (which shoulda been made into full-length songs) , especially \\"Faithful\\" and \\"Everything\\" are tight. \\"Alone In This World\\" which features Big's sample 'Who Shot Ya' is my favorite joint on this cd. Also, \\"I Love You\\", \\"Burnin' Up, \\"You Gets No Love\\", \\"Brand New Man\\" and the disco flavored \\"Back To Love\\" are other significant tracks. Judging from this cd, Faith Evans ain't playing. I've always been a big fan of Faith but even I wasn't expecting blazing material like this. Go head on Faith...Much success to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith I give you your fullest props.....","review":"I have loved Faith ever since she came out. I don't have her CD, but I have had a chance to hear it. I really want this CD but I can't ever get it for some reason. Anyway, I give her love and luck with the rest of the album. BAD BOY FOR LIFE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing Artist","review":"Faith has grown as an artist and it shows on this album. I can honestly listen to just about every song on this album, how many albums out there today can you say that about. Each song is different, each song has a different theme. I am really feeling this Faith album. I recommend people to go out and get this album, it's pretty hot. Another good thing is that Puffy's voice is not all over this album, that's probably why it's so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly Average","review":"Faith is a Hit&Miss Artist.I tend to Prefer Her Behind the Scenes as a Writer because Her Own Material tends to become a bit Formula Driven.I Like Songs from Her different Albums but on a whole Nothing holds together.She has Talent but the Material on a whole to Me always leaves Her a Bit Short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, Better, Best, Never let it Rest....","review":"I think that Faith's first album surpassed all of her work from that day to the present. On her first album, every song had a meaning and a feeling that was timeless. Ever since then, each release has lacked that \\"rich\\" content. Each album has a few songs that you can dance to, and one or two that leave their impression on the listener, but all in all, NOTHING has come close to her first album. I hope that with her next release she takes the time to give us what she did back then... a glimpse of her heart and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad keep the faith.","review":"Faith like everybody else is copying the west coast rap flavor still not a bad cd and if I was more into Faith I would spend the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"WHAT THE HELL IS THE BONUS TRACK? YESH, IF YOU EXPECT US TO BE INTERESTED, AT LEAST LIST THE TRACKS STUPID AMAZON.COM"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most talented female artist on this planets!","review":"This album was wonderful, inspirational, and down right beautiful. Faith's vocals are the most soulful and strong of any artist out there right now. Faithfully is a wonderful, wonderful cd from the intro to the very last interlude. The very best song on the cd is \\"Love Can't Hide\\" because it is a real showcase of her fabolous talents. I think Faith Evans is under appreciated, and is over looked alot for awards and accolades. \\"Faithfully\\" is the only Faith album I have, but from listening to this cd, I plan on purchasing her two previous albums also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith","review":"It was hot... The beats. Her voice is just great!!! This is one of her best albums ever... She looks good... Her video is off the hook... And her singing is 5 stars..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lesson in simple math","review":"Ok, Faithfully has 18 tracks on it...Of these 18 tracks, 5 of them are interludes, and 9 are really bad songs... which leaves 4 wee gems that save this album from being coaster worthy. \\"You Gets No Love\\" is the bumpin first single that deserves to be next club anthem, this song could potentially throw \\"Family Affair\\" by Mary J Blige into light rotation. \\"Alone in this World\\" is very pretty, think a hip hop music box and you'd almost be there. \\"Can't Believe\\" with Carl Thomas covers all the bases lyrically, musically, and vocally. \\"Brand New Man\\" is a standout track lyrically. But for the most part, this cd undermines Evan's vocal talents, the songs are lyrically weak and even boring (case in point \\"I Love You\\")and, sadly, over production of bad songs cannot save this album. Someone at Bad Boy needs to learn that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the faith???????","review":"I was so excited when Faith's 3rd album debuted this past Tuesday, so when I came home my husband had surprised me with it because he knows I am a big Faith fan. Well, sorry to say that \\"Faithfully\\" does not meet the expectations I thought it would. She has a lot more fast songs on her CD this time around. I'm more of a slow song person. I like a couple of the tracks but I end up skipping tracks to get to the ones I like. I still support Faith and will continue to buy her albums when they come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY OVER RATED SINGER.","review":"This cd just plainly sucks.The production and beats are the same typical beats you would expect from bad boy.She is a mediocre singer and poop diddy simply ruins her album by talking in that ridiculous voice in every other song.I cant believe this beautiful women actually married that fat,ugly crack dealing loser biggie smalls.To conclude,this album stinks and bad boy reeks.DO NOT BUY THIS GARABGE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith fan remains Faithful","review":"As a Faith Evans fan, I can honestly rate this as the 2nd best of her career. Her debut album FAITH remains my favorite of the 3 and is still in heavy rotation in my CD player. Overall, this is a very good CD. Faith's voice is as strong as ever and there isn't one disappointing track on the whole CD. Even though this album contains more than its share of samples, Faith's emotional presentation of vocals kinda makes you forget about the song that was once so blatantly familiar. Songs that stand out are the light and lovely \\"I Love You\\" and the beautiful \\"Where We Stand\\". One thing that I found about this CD is that the interludes (\\"Everything\\", \\"Faithful\\", and \\"Love Song\\") display Faith at her best. Each interlude leaves you yearning for a little bit more. This CD is more happy than \\"Keep the Faith\\" and that's probably the case because Faith is more happy in life now. Cop this CD, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is the Best","review":"I just wanna say that this Cd is bagin baby. Its off the hook i love her voice. i love this song \\" ilove you\\" my gurl sing it all.If u didn't pick up the copy of this album than what u waiting for. Just go pick ur copy up today. cuz thhis album worth it.Iam out holla at a playa."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!! This cd is incredible! I hadn't heard of Faith until last summer when I heard \\"Can't Believe\\" on the radio. I loved the song and wanted her cd. I waited and waited for a new cd by her with that song out and then \\"You Gets No Love\\" came out. A few weeks later she realesed \\"Faithfully\\". I love the album and listen to it when I can. There is hot production by the Neptunes (on \\"Burnin Up\\") P. Diddy (on \\"Can't Believe\\" and several other tracks) and by Michealangelo Sardsbury (\\"You Gets No Love\\". I absoloutely love this cd and you don't know what you're missing if you don't buy it!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Change of Heart","review":"I have to admit I was not a big Faith Evans fan but I finally picked up this CD because I kept hearing good things about it and I liked the singles that had come out. I figured if nothing else, those few songs would be worth buying the whole CD for, and to my surprise, I really like every song on the CD. It has a great mix of fast, mellow and slow songs and the most important thing is that the lyrics are good along with good musical arrangements. (And even P Diddy didn't ruin the songs he was featured in.) She really has a beautiful voice and her talent really comes through on this CD. It's so rare to find a true R&B CD that is classy and mature. This one's right up there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine AND has vocals. You can't get much better than that!","review":"Nothing you can say can tear her away from her Guy. I love the lyrics. Touches me...DEEP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her most well rounded album yet!","review":"If you want an overall introduction to Faith Evans, I would suggest you start here and then work backwards. While 'Faith' has to be one of my favourite albums of all time, 'Faithfully' has more of that 'something for everyone' quality to it, and shows a more versatile side of her character.Music = TIGHTVocals = TIGHT!Lyrics = Almost tight! But a few cliches here and there.This album is an essential buy for anyone into quality r'n'b and for those of you strictly into soul of the neo variety (D'Angelo et al), this is also worth a listen.And for those who know nothing about Faith, WAKE UP! Buy this album and album and her first one. You'll be pleasantly surprised and inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faithful To The End","review":"Faith Evan's new album 'Faithfully', is truly as work of art. Tracks like 'Burning Up' and 'Where we Stand' are beautiful. This album is Faith's best project to this point.Most of the sounds are catchy and the lyrics are extremely meaningful. If that wasn't all u could ask for, the interludes are the bomb. 'Faithful' interlude and 'Everything' interlude best the best of them.Faith is a very talented singer, one who has kept up her standards up unlike so many of the singers of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony, we hardly knew ye!","review":"We bought this Sony when our Philips DVD player (circa 2001) started getting finnicky about which DVD's it would play. I thought we'd do a little better with a Sony product. Not only did the Sony lack the Philips features, but it lasted a little over a year before it crapped out completely. I suspect Sony has joined the rest of the world in getting their products made in China, but I failed to check before I threw the box away. Sad that you can't expect durability from anyone. The old Philips player is still going though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot play Disney DVD (and some others)","review":"I bought a brand new Finding Nemo DVD, 3 times, from 3 different places, and the dvd player would have problems playing it. The screen color would fade in and fade out, it was just terrible. I bought another brand new disney cartoon, same problem. The only DDVD i can play without any problem is \\"Lord of the Ring\\". Man, i will NEVER buy any Sony stuff ....at least not the low end DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZOOM zom NO zoom","review":"It is a nice player but forget the zoom and the menu's are a pain (You are in deep do-do if you misplace the manual). I repeat for emphasis, there is no zoom control and you are not going to be able to expand a wide screen movie to fill your standard television screen.Go to the Sony website and -www.sony.com- the support area and get the manual and take a look. You will not be able to resize the picture to fit the TV. Sony may say you can in their advertisement, but it did not work for me. I am not technically challenged either. I built my own computer from parts and I installed the replacement electrostatic panels on my Martin Logan's.The picture outputted was very good, and the remote was not so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"By the moon","review":"This is a great DVD player. It has everything you need, at a price you can't beat. It's such a good buy. It's easy to set up and easy to use. A great first DVD player for anyone who is thinking of getting a DVD player. I wouldn't use it on my HDTV home theater, but if you just want something simple that looks great, this is the one. It has good sound and picture for the price. Haven't had any problems with it, what can I say I love it. It was cool.Big Truck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I realize that this is a \\"no frills\\" player, however, I would expected it to play my DVD's without incident. With this player, I can't play any of my DVD's without blips and the colors fading in and out every few minutes. I returned it to a local store for another one and the second one did the same thing. My DVD's play just fine on my Playstation 2, so the problem is in the player. I wasn't up to trying a third one, so for a little more money, I bought an open box RCA RC6001P. Boy, what huge difference! The RCA plays all my DVD's perfectly, and it has a \\"real\\" remote control, not a \\"only good for a paperweight\\" one that came with the Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lived less than two years","review":"This was a great DVD player when it worked. It lasted less than two years, and I am incredibly disappointed. I bought it primarily on the Sony name. One day, I went to put in a DVD and it made a horribled noise and refused to play a single DVD.This is actually the second Sony DVD player I have owned, and the other one met the same fate. I am not sure if it is just a bum player in a large lot of exceptional ones, or Sony does not make as good products anymore. This Player worked really good when it worked. It gave no warning, just crapped out. I also own a Panasonic DVD player that has outlasted both Sony's, so I dont know that I would buy another Sony. Just be careful and make sure you have a warranty when you purchase one and Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice player - Sony finally adds MP3 capability","review":"This is a good solid basic player witha few features that you actually can and will use. Plays DVDs well, no issues to speak of (yet) and it offers component outputs in addition to regular outputs. It plays DVD, CD, CD-R(W), and my favorite, decodes MP3. The MP3 software work just like a normal CD player (track numbers and all that), so you don't have to have the monitor on to play MP3s. It does have a nice GUI if you do want to use the monitor, though. Nice added touch. I've enjoyed the unit so far, but since it's a newer model, I will post again if I have additional comments. Only 4 stars because it most of its features are operated from the remote only :(. Don't lose that remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Teenage Paradise\\"-The Volumes","review":"This is a great song and the Cd gets 5 stars because it has this on it.....KILLER falsetto.....the other songs are OK also but you gotta hear this fantastic song!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Darn Good Group","review":"If you have or have not seen Nelson in concert thin this is your chance cause they are good.Rondall"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking forward to next book, too","review":"I am really enjoying this series that began with Quieter than Sleep.

Yes \\"Tormato\\" or King Crimson \\"Islands\\" would be good comparisons. Not bad, but only fans are going to really like them.

I have not heard the CD version yet, but the LP is great! A Tab in the Ocean and Remember the Future blow this away, but this album is well worth the purchase and the listen. If you enjoyed those albums, you will enjoy this one, though the production values seem to have suffered somewhat and for what reason, I have yet to figure out. Anything by this group blows away ELP, Yes and any other progressive rock group, by a long shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip Hop","review":"This is my 3rd MF Doom album. They all sound completely different. This album is another true Hip Hop collection. Viktor avoids choruses that plague today's rap scene. The beats are crazy.

My favorite track is the one feat Kool Keith."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't see what everyone is complaining about","review":"This is definately not my favorite Doom album, but I still think it's solid. I do not agree with one of the previous reviewers comments about the production lacking. I think the beats are well crafted and the songs flow perfectly. Still, if you are new to MF Doom, check out: Madvilliany, Operation Doomsday, or Vaudville Villian.

I must say this album is just as good as anything MF Doom has put out. I was glad to add it to my Super Villian collection! I love the fact he changed up the production on Venomous Villain. The Villain can flow to any beat, track, sound! His voice goes so well with each track and I must say the guest appearances are all on point. I honestly don't think DOOM! works with wack MC's!!!! The tracks that hit hard are Bloody Chain, Ode To Road Rage, R.A.P.G.A.M.E. (Rappers Against Phony Gangsters And Mainstream Evil) featuring MF Doom, LOL, and Fall Back.

A shame, really. Some of Nektar's best music can be found here. They run through several different styles here, from a classic Nektar prog-rock track (\\"Away From Asgard\\"), to ballads (the title track), to the sort of hard-driving music that is perfect for late-night long-distance drives (\\"Eerie Lackawanna\\"), to a song about CB radio and truck drivers(!).

Their show Tenacious D is really funny and you should check out those episodes before you think about buying the album. More than half the songs from the album come from their show so you probably wouldn't get them. I personally think Jack black and Kyle Gas are hilarious and will lokk forward to seeing them on halloween. And if they read these I hope they now that sas a friend wrote this........Actually you better tell them it was sas-quatch they might not know which friend you mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best, but not bad either...","review":"Jack Black is pretty funny, I've got to say, and when I first heard Wonderboy on Conan, it really clicked in my head that Tenacious D was awesome. Now that I have the CD, it turns out that Wonderboy is the only one that I really like. It just doesn't quite have the same feel as when they sing it live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell Out","review":"I've been a big fan of \\"The D\\" for a couple years now... ever since seeing their HBO shows. In fact, I have even seen them live a couple times. Needless to say, I couldn't wait for this CD.Finally a CD that is a high quality recording instead of the lame bootleg songs from napster!Well, all the songs are there but they have been refined and tweaked so much that I can't even listen to it.The beauty of this duo was their acoustic heavy metal and inside joke of them thinking they were big stars.Now that they are using a full band it just isn't as funny and you can't even enjoy the guitar playing.The in-between comedy bits are kind of funny but all in all it is a major letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping for a purer D sound next time","review":"The D have been the most clever and heartfelt rock band in the world. But their charm lay in their simplicity of tools: two acoustic guitars, two harmonious voices, two wickedly inventive minds,...Now the D's incredible talent has been buried in pretentious rock shlock.Please JB and Rage Cage, release the REAL Tenacious D. Fire the band... get back to your roots and produce your next album without all the lame-rock additions..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it.","review":"I must admit I bought this cd because of one song, Wonderboy. I saw the video on MTV and was intrigued by the humorous lyrics. The rest of the cd just simply left me skipping through track after track. The music sounds the same song after song, and the skits just aren't funny. To me, they are just being crass for the sake of trying to offend the politically correct. Trust me, I'm no damn prude; however, this album is the epitome of teenage, locker room humor.If you want to listen to \\"offensive\\" music, I would highly recommend Frank Zappa. He is talented, creative, and intelligent. Buy \\" Joe's Garage.\\" Don't buy this album. [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Black fans rejoice","review":"While not appropriate for many audiences, fans of Jack Black and his style of humor will appreciate the \\"D\\". The lyrics are mostly nonsense and obviously JB and KG had fun, but they are suprisingly talented musically. For an even better experience I recommend the Tenacious D two-disc DVD. It has all the episodes from their HBO series, a live concert, music videos and more. Some versions of their songs are better on the DVD but this CD has more songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad, more funny than musical","review":"it's got a *bit* too much comedy/dialogue in it for me, but i really like it. doesn't get old fast, can listen to it a lot. wish there was a bit more music but it's still darn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album will rock your socks off!","review":"Tenacious D is the best band in the world. Not only is the music funny, but the songs are awesome and super catchy. You should also check out some of their HBO shows. The only thing that I didn't like was that the D did not put jesus ranch on the album. Every single song is just so good. No one should go without tenacious d. What are you waiting for, buy the album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The D\\" has betrayed its fans!","review":"As a long-time fan of \\"The D\\" I'm sorely disappointed with this album. First of all, their warm and entertaining \\"two ... with acoustic guitars at amateur night\\" act is completely lost since they perform their trademark songs with a full studio band, drums and all. The skits are only funny the first time you hear them. After that, it's a chore to listen to the album as you have to keep grabbing the remote to skip the tired skits and get to the next song. The best part of Tribute, the Stairway to Heaven excerpt, has been dumped. Many of their funnier songs aren't on the album: Sasquatch, Bowie, the Star Trek theme with lyrics, and Jesus Christ Superstar. I hope JB and KG read this review and realize how they've betrayed their fans. I'd rather have purchased a compilation of their live club performances or their HBO appearances."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't right","review":"As a fan of the show on HBO, i don't think this album serves the D justice. It just seems like an opportunity to cash in on Jack Black's success and sudden stardom. The songs on the TV show, \\"Lee\\", \\"Explosivo\\", \\"Tribute\\" and others were funny and catchy, but only in their lo-fi, mp3 off of Kazaa-type format. The dual acoustic King Diamond-esque guitar worked on the show. It doesn't work when they pump it up with guest stars from such legendary heavy metal bands as Phish and, GASP (the caustic lords) Foo Fighters. If you were a fan of the show on HBO or downloaded early Tenacious D songs you will not like this album. Unfortunately, it's hard to find the good stuff anymore..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever","review":"See... they're not really good looking, but they sing about how cool and good looking they are and it's really ironic and funny. Get it? They don't look like rock stars, but they talk about how they're rock stars. Get it?It's really hip. Right?See... They're really cool, but they say they're not, so they really are.Be a part of this very exclusive club. Maybe you're ironic and clever enough to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be honest...","review":"Tenacious D is indeed the greatest band in the world but this album is not a good example of their work. What this is a good example of is the record industry taking an artist and watering them down so that their true essence is mild enough not to disturb or offend anyone. They have become homogonized and sprinkled with mass appeal. The unadulterated RAWK of Tenacious D lay primarily in their simplicity and passion; this album has been overproduced, as was my fear when I heard of this undertaking. I only hope the D doesn't bring the Dust Brothers and their unneccesary sound effects on tour with them. Long live the D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced","review":"I'm very disappointed. Gass and Black were hilarious doing this same material with just two acoustic guitars. Gass is a talented guitarist, and Black is a talented vocalist, and doing their two-man show, they pulled off a silly/overblown/rock-and-roll-dream schtick that made my wife remark \\"oh, their voices are so pretty... but then I heard what they were singing....\\" It was priceless.Unfortunately, that charm is lost, drowned out by a vanilla shlock-rock backing that adds nothing and subtracts much. It has converted one of the most interesting music/comedy acts to come out in a while into a something that sounds like bad 80's pseudopunk (e.g. Angry Samoans, Surf Punks, etc.)My only remaining hope is that they follow this up with an \\"unplugged\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest Band In The World!","review":"This CD is sssoooooooo funny and is sure to bring a smile to almost anybodys face, want a laugh as well as the chance to listen to some great songwriting and musicianship?.Look no further and buy Tenacious D's self-titled debut album today, it ROCKS!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Zappaesque","review":"These guys are very funny and suprisingly musically talented. They remind me of the late, great Frank Zappa. Only the music is not near as complex. This Disc contains some great riffs though. Jack Black is great and brings the crowd some excellent humor on the screen and now into our stereos. I am happy to have purchased this disc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than **** Pushups","review":"A riotous mix of Jack Black's witty humor and clever song writing, Tenacious D truly is a CD worth buying if you are looking for laughs. \\"One Note Song\\", \\"Hard ****ing\\", \\"Inward Singing\\", \\"**** Pushups\\", \\"Friendship Test\\", \\"Karate Schnitzel\\" and \\"Drive-Thru\\" indulge listeners with various skits in between serenades which are equally entertaining with uncouth rhyming and explicit content. If you aren't into swearing or two dudes crooning over balling discreetly, then steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profanity + Decient Music is funny","review":"OK Tenacious D may seem like a novelty band with constent Profanity and obscene topics but they are also hillarious if you have that kind of scence of humor, plus the one thing that seperates Tencaious D from Weasley Willis is actual Musical talent JB and KG were actualy able to put Pop melodies and funny lyrics together to create a great album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some very funny stuff here","review":"I heard of these guys before from friends, but never really got into them until now. I picked up the CD after reading some very positive reviews and I really like the album. It has great skits and the songs aren't bad either. I'd give it a 5 except that Jack Black swears more than the kids from The Blair Witch Project which isn't a bad thing, though it does grow tiresome after the tenth or eleventh listening. Pick this one up if you want something that's funny and fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friggin' awesome!","review":"I know the cd has been out for a while now, but I felt the need to share just how awesome this album is. Tenacious D is that sort of funny that will make you laugh 'til your eyes water. Also, they are very talented as a rock band, and are a lot better than most bands that take themselves too seriously. Don't be mistaken, you won't regret buying this album, especially if you're a Jack Black fan..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must own album!!","review":"I heard wonder boy and was hooked instantly to Jack black's voice and kyle g's melody (well both of them)this cd is fantastic im a 17 year old girl and i just love it.very clever for being so-called gimick performers.

Songs like Tribute and Kyle Quit The Band are hardly 2 minutes but will have you humming them the rest of the day. The catchy melodies and hilarious lyrics make this just one sweet mix of folk, comedy, and rock. Although, there is alot of swearing Jack Black is one of those rare people who can swear all day but never offend. He has a fun, jovial tone that makes his F-bombs seem enjoyable rather than tawdry. Check this out if you have any curousity in the mystery that is Tecacious D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actual Genuine Music!","review":"Jack and Kyle are obviously having a ball. Though clearly self-indulgent, they take this self-indulgence to the level of art form. Adolescent only in that it is pot and sex driven, this music has a heart and a genuineness that is most certainly art. While the music and content do become repetitive, one stays truly charmed throughout the album, willingly hanging on for dear life until the next gem presents itself. Everyone I talk to who knows this album becomes really happy at its mention. My only serious complaint would be the poor production value. This music is meant to be played LOUD, but it is impossible to reach the level of satisfaction without the music becoming muddled and unlistenable. At times the volume levels of the sketches drop off the map. I hope the boys get enough juice off this to get a better producer for next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a tribute","review":"This has to be in the top 3 of my years best cds to come out. Jb and KG have put out the greatest and best cd in the world. This is one of the funniest cds i have ever heard. They could have put some of the other songs that they have done in the past, but this was over sufficient. Funny as hell in my opinion. It was well worth the 12 dollars that i paid for it, and i would gladly pay that again for the cd. Comedic Brilliance is achieved with this cd, espicially if you have never heard the D in action before. This is a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Musical Paradox","review":"JB and KG have outdone themselves with this album. The album creates a great musical paradox, and that is what I like about it. The lyrics, are some of the most pointless, stupid, and funny lyrics you will ever hear. The music though, is actually rather deep and powerful. These two factors combine to make a very unique listening experience. The humor tracks that are thrown in, like Inward Singing and the Drive Through, are hilarious additions that will not disappoint you. The parental advisory sticker does not lie. Just about every track has vulgar language throughout, but I do not mind the language that bad, and I feel that it actually adds to the fun of the lyrics.If you have not checked out Tenacious D yet, I highly recomend that you do. Great music and ridiculous lyrics combine to create a truly unique musical experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mightiest Band In All The Land","review":"Jack Black and Kyle Gass light it up on this f---ing great CD. If you've listened to any of the live bootlegs of The D--this album totally does them justice and then some. These guys are AWESOME! Hooky songs, hysterical lyrics, and lots of expletives (if you're into that sort of thing). In a nutshell, this album will, similar to your dad's old playboys and your mothers lingere (you know you've worn some of it), find a special place on your shelf and in your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"the album's great, but...","review":"...if you weren't already a fan of the d before you heard it, i doubt you'd be converted. for some of their truly inspired stuff, i recommemd you download a few tracks recorded by fans from their live shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic comedy CD","review":"This is up there with some of the best comedy CD's ever. It reminded me a little bit of Adam Sandler's first CD.The guitar work is actually quite good. A distinguishing factor from Adam Sandler. Most of the CD is actually songs, although there is a substantial bit of spoken word.My only beef is that Jack and Kyle only sing about sex and drugs, they don't really expand their horizons for comedic zaniness. All in all, it's a really funny CD, just buy it already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Excellent Band","review":"I think that this is one of the most awesome bands. Tenacious D Rocks!!!

The D is not only funny as hell but they also rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest CD I Own","review":"Very few cds can make me laugh and simultaneously get a good song stuck in my head - one that I'm overjoyed to have lodged in my cranium for the remainder of my life. This cd hasn't got a bad track on it, with the obvious exception of the non-musical selections, which are a nice breather from the hard, heavy, extreme style of their music. I love the songs for what they are - really good songs. I love the lyrics for what they are - really really funny. For me, this is the perfect combination. I would highly recommend this to just about anyone (with the exception of those who fear being rocked hard). If you dislike swearing in music, this will be the cd that changes your mind. Almost every song has lots of swear words, and they greatly enhance the music. Humor in music is vital, and Tenacious D does it better than anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"LISTEN TO ME!!!!","review":"If you don't own this album, you must be listening to Michael Bolton right now as you read this. So in other words, you suck.

I'm eagerly awaiting next CD from \\"The D\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but don't believe the hype","review":"Okay folks, I've listened to the cd a couple of times, and there's a reason that the cd has already dropped off the Billboard 100. Its funny, yes, but its not music. The songs, while mildly amusing, have no endearing qualities, except maybe \\"F... her Gently\\" and the radio single \\"Wonderboy\\". The comedic sketches seem forced and silly, and the satanic undertone as well as the ridiculous satanic artwork will keep this band from ever being taken seriously. Jack Black is very funny in the movies, but I hope his idea of Tenacious D., aka \\"Two Jerkoffs With Guitars\\" is a short lived one.If you're looking for serious acoustic musicianship, check out \\"Live at Luther College\\" by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. I guarentee it will be more useful in your cd player than Tenacious D, which should be used as a beer coaster or frisbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Funny","review":"I'm not sure why I broke down and bought this; maybe because I kept hearing how HILARIOUS it was. But to me, this just sounds like the Barenaked Ladies with swear words.

It is totally horrific!!!!!","review":"I'm sorry Jack Black but you were a good actor in school of rock. But music is just not your area. This Cd is completely the worst thing i have ever heard. If you want to hear some real music that Jack Black was in then listen to the song in the movie: school of Rock, in the beginning of the movie. That's music, but this is just filth.If this is supposed to be rock like one reviewer said then why dont i hear any rock and roll riffs. This is horrible. Whoever gives this more than 2 stars has no taste whatsoever in music.Please Jack Black, come to your senses and make some real music. This is not living up to your potential. I've been playing guitar for only a year and a half and i can say this as a fact that i have more talent than everyone in this entire band. Its sad but its true. Guys come to your senses and stop jerking around. Make some real music for christ sake!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a comedy cd.. turns out to rock like a mutha!","review":"i bought this on the strength of their single \\"wonderboy\\".. and.. from having seen their show on HBO.. but.. wasn't prepared.. for the all out assault on my ears.. ok.. i know this is a \\"comedy\\" cd.. i know they aren't a \\"real\\" rock band.. but.. this cd rocks harder than any real band out there right now.. even when you are laughing at the juvenile lyrics.. you are thinking.. \\"ooookay.. how come a real band can't come up with the awesome riffs.. and soaring vocals that this joke band managed?\\"fantastic cd.. and.. amazingly.. i find myself listening to it like a music cd.. singing my favorite songs.. forgetting it's a comedy effort.. jack black should give up comedy.. grab ahold of the metal/rock world.. and bring back the glory days of rock.. lol.. or at the very least.. should do another record soon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody Knows.","review":"The D don't let you down. It'd be well nigh impossible for The D to let you down. It's just not in their DNA. Some thoughts on the CD..'Explosivo' should have stayed acoustic. Adding all the instrumentation just made it sound like a novelty song and I stress to you, dear reader, that The D is NOT a novelty act. 'Wonderboy' would be lodged in the Billboard Top 5 right now, but most of America hasn't removed that corn-cob from their rear so that they might free up space in their ears. It's their loss. 'Friendship' should appeal to all those power-pop junkies out there, those Big Star and Raspberries vinyl snobs. 'Karate' is an oh-so-short but how-very-sweet lovesong for your worst enemy. And 'Double Team' is the incredible God-Like rockfest that no one on earth can do better. Sex supreme indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Band In The World","review":"I have been a fan of Tenacious D for a few years now and I must say that this album is a step in the right direction from their live act. While nothing can replace the unforgivable error of not including Sasquatch, Jesus Ranch or Bowie on this recording, it is still worth the money for the glorious rock that bleeds from their souls like wine. Every note of their music is carefully placed so as to increase the total amount of rocking possible. The consensus amongst my friends is that \\"Wonderboy\\" is officially the greatest rock song of all time, closely beating out \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" That's how good this album is! So, buy this album and find some of their bootleg live shows. Study their every detail so that when your children in the near distant future comes home from school, you'll be able to talk with them about the \\"D\\" and even read over the multiple chapters about them in your child's history books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Circles - The Devils","review":"Fantastic cd.

I bought this relatively expensive set of sheets as part of a budget bedroom makeover. I am totally disappointed. The pillow cases are supposed to be on top of the bed, matching my rose afghan, looking sleek and welcoming.

He is joined by an old friend of his, Liam Mellows, wanted as a possible informer by the IRA. Both getting the papers off the dead body and keeping a step ahead of Liam's pursuers is beginning to get more and more of an impossible task.This winner of the newly formed CWA Steel Dagger Award for thriller writing is actually a dull, dreary and dreadfully slow read. There are moments of sheer terror. However, the concentration is on realistic characterizations with great depth. The author succeeds in that regard. The characters lack true empathy which leads to apathy.

I thought it was boring. The main characters had little substance and it was a little farfetched that the president, while in office, had not only had a girlfriend but a baby with that girlfriend and not once in the ensuing 30 years did it ever get leaked to the press.

Although I tried to follow some advises from this book, I saw that they prefer to starve than eat anything else.I thought they would die since they didn't eat anything for 2-3 days and gave up! The author insists that it's a matter of time that your dog will get used to the new diet, but I see that it is not. I think it has to do with the personality of each and every dog, and that's the reason I will never get a book like this. They don't change their nutricion no matter what I do, so I prefer buying books which deal with their psychological world and ways to communicate with them, instead of books which actually waste my time reading them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all Master Mason's.","review":"This book will short cut a life time of learning and add so much to the understanding of the Masonic Order..

When they first happen you cannot imagine that this is the message, but when the author explains things you can feel how your life would mirror gifts in your life.This was a easy read, and most enjoyable.

Next, the \\"chinese fingers\\" are inserted over the top of the crankshaft and the new seal is retained by the finger trap. Using liberal amounts of lubricant, one pulls the new seal into place with the \\"chinese fingers\\" device included in the tool kit.

In some ways this is the best of the three albums... it's certainly the most easily available. Jazzy atmosphere layered over hip-hop beats, with white boy Mark Griffin rapping (such as it were) over the top. Interesting art music, but like I said, Soul Coughing do it better.

Within the first minute of the gigantic, eerie opening track \\"New Moon\\" I realized that this was going to be an album the likes of which I had never experienced before. While a bit uneven at times, One Step Ahead of the Spider is a fascinating musical journey to say the least. From the somber \\"Buried at Sea\\" to the ultra-cool \\"But If You Go\\" to the just flat out bizarre \\"Rhubarb\\" this album is not easy to pigeonhole into any one genre, so don't even bother.

All the songs have the exact same thrash sound, with the lead singer shrieking incoherently. I had to look up the lyrics of each song, just to figure out what he was trying to say. Add to the screaming guy, a few short grainy voice clips of characters from the old cartoon shows, and you have every song on the album. Other than the sporadic rough cartoon clips, there is no real connection to Transformers, or in some cases GI Joe.In my opinion, like all the other recent attempts to revive the Transformers name, this band is trying to make a buck by passing off its monotonous crap, and riding on the coattails of the success of the real Transformers.I again suggest you listen to any of the samples above, as any one of them will give you a feel for what every song by this band sound like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the first reviewer","review":"The worst piece of Transformers \\"merchandise\\" I've ever heard... this is a shame to all fans.

Un tema para atraparnos a todos, por su concepción, espíritu nocturno, fresco y veloz: Radio Marrakesh, que comienza de día y con una alta torre donde se recitan oraciones al desierto y luego la modernidad que llega en vagones a alta velocidad: teclados, bajo, percusión de gran precisión.

It was just not good music. There are several different songs, but they all sounds quite a bit alike, and the music is almost constant in the show. I have no problem with constant music- I'm a musician myself- but when the music is terrible, I can not listen to it.

I bought it to use on flies and have found that your technique is very important. You must fully extend the tube, then when the fly lands approach the fly with the tip very slowly. Flies have trouble detecting slow movements. Approach from behind if possible and the fly will be sucked right in and let the zapping begin. I then go outside, pull off the tube and let the fly fall out. If the fly is cooked to the electrodes a bit, I gently rub it on grass and the fly comes right off.

You have to knock the bug into the tube and sometimes even push it through the baffle on the end of the tube to get it to fall into the tube. Just putting the end of the tube near the bug does nothing but give the bug the opportunity to fly away.After a few seconds the noisy fan motor quiets down considerably. That means that the almost minimal vacuum power is reduced even more as the weak battery gives up. The bugs seem to enjoy crawling around on the built-in \\"high voltage\\" zapper.

I would wait for an improved model, especially one with greater suction power."},{"rating":"2","title":"bug vacuum","review":"product works very well.

Now I just grab this bug sucker - it is quicker and quieter.The only problems are the vacuum isn't as hi-powered as a real vacuum and the end doesn't mush right into a corner to get at a bug. However, I am really pleased I bought this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bug Sucker Doesn't Suck","review":"I order tons from Amazon and this is the first product that I've ordered that I've been disgusted with. It's a sturdy, nice looking piece of equipment, however it just doesn't work. The little suction that has can suck up a bug or two, but that's about the limit. Also the flap that sits inside the tube doesn't close properly and the bugs crawl right back out. I'm in the process of returning it to Lentek now. It was a gift so naturally the expiration period for returning it is past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to Suck","review":"After charging fully the unit made noise but completely failed to produce enough suction to perform it's intended finction of sucking bug into the tube. On flat walls it would have a slight chance of getting the bug, any other surface shape it would not work. Most bugs just moved away from the slight airflow. The design has potential but needs a massively bigger air flow. You almost have to get the bugs to crawl in, and catching them in flight, no chance. Very dissapointing, total failure. I would not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This thing doesn't work. It won't pick up something as small as a ladybug.

It barely had enough suction to suck up small spiders and rarely killed them. I purchased it for my wife because she hates bugs and was always putting cups over them until I got home to handle them. She used it a handful of times but wasn't impressed and has gone back to using cups. It has sat in my attic for 2.5 years now and I will probably burn it the next time we go camping. I should have known when I stumbled across it in a SkyMall magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I purchased product.","review":"Found a large reddish crab spider in the basement! The bug vacuum had been charging for 24 hours after purchase. Took the bug vacuum down to the basement and turned it on over the spider... The bug vacuum ran for approx. 10 seconds, long enough for the spider to be sucked up into the tubing. Then the vacuum died with the spider still in the tubing and alive! I had to take it outside and empty the tubing and kill the spider myself. I will give it another chance, but the first impression is that this is a piece of expensive junk for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Product","review":"This is the worst product I have ever purchased.

This product sucks because it won't suck!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I had an invasion of ladybugs and some flies. This machine was not able to zap the lady bugs. My guess is that the lady bugs have suction feet or something like that. They went into the tube, spun around and when the machine was turned off, walked about like they had been at Disneyland. They were not able to make it to the zapper. It worked for some of the flies. I believe this machine needs more power for my bugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Have you ever heard the term \\"couldn't hurt a fly\\"? That is how I would describe this product as it literally cannot hurt a fly if it is even able to provide enough suction to get it into the tube where the electric screen is. This product is useless. It should not be listed as a vacuum, zapper or killer of any kind. The suction can barely pick up lint and if you are lucky enough to get a bug inside the electric screen will do nothing to kill them. If you have an empty jar, you are just as well armed as having this worthless piece of junk! I am in the process of returning it but I don't exactly know how to. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS WORTHLESS AND THE COMPANY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Garbage","review":"This product never worked and I don't mean it didn't suction well.

I had to throw mine away because I had thrown the box and packaging away. Please don't waste your money. I ordered it to suck up stink bugs as they got in my screened porch and it doesn't have enough power to suck them up. I was trying to save my vaccum from the stink but this thing has no power.

We had hoped to use it for the occasional stink bug. It is bulky with a massive charger. Its vacuum power is best described as a gentle breeze.

I thought this was the perfect gift. There are not alot of bugs around in the winter, but fortunately a spider showed up for his demise. I anxiously went for the \\"bug vaccum\\". I positioned it perfectly above the spider, I think it was comotose, because it did not move. I held the cover over the spider but the suction was too weak to actually suck it up the tube. I had to take off the cup and directly put the hose over the spider. Finally, the spider was sucked up the tube.

Many colors and different wattages, which I dearly love. Unfortunately, the spiders also love to build webs on the siding because flying insects are attracted to the lights. One night I used my Panasonic vacuum (which I love) and got over 30! The motor chews them up and spits the pieces into the disposable bag--I've never had one survive! Nice jolly subject, right? Often, I have to hold the vacuum in one hand (20 lbs.) while using the hose with attachment in the other. This gives me over 3 ft. of reach and the suction is so great that the insect is \\"gone\\" within 1\\" of the brush. OK, the Lentek is rechargeable, doesn't have a power cord and is lite (albeit unwieldly). After charging for a day the unit would pick up a 1/8\\" spider but nothing larger. After a minute of operation the suction is down by about half and you won't get anything then. Yes, I'm back to the Panasonic and the Lentek?---the \\"round file\\"!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly Useless","review":"This product just doesn't work... It will suck a bug in, maybe, but it doesn't kill anything- and after a couple of minutes it won't have the power to suck any more bugs in.

That's where the good stuff ends.It doesn't hold a charge for long... mine is good for 60 secs tops. Suction isn't very strong... sometimes you have to coax the critter into the tube.

The suction isn't strong enough to pull them off what they're crawling across and the zapper at the end stuns them for a short period of time. Luckily, the stun time is long enough to get them to the toilet or some other convenient method of disposal.

This is my first one, but I have to warn others. Do not buy this product.I get the feeling someone who feels sorry for insects designed it, to get back at those of us that want to kill them or remove them from our homes. Well you did it.

Usually products carry some amount of charge right out of the box but I figured it may have lost this charge prior to my purchasing it. I put the product in its charger stand and plugged it in. The light came on on the charger base. I didn't think about it again until I needed the bug vacuum a couple months later. I went to use it and it didn't turn on. The light continues to be green on the base charger. Unfortunately, I was out too far out from the original purchase to be allowed to return it so I lost all my money on this one.

Build quality is fine, but the vacuum part is laughably underpowered. If you put the big circular head on it, the suction is so low that it won't even pick up a dead bug. If you take the circular thing off, the vacuum can pick up a dead one, but a live bug can easily hold on for dear life. Once you get a couple of bugs in the thing, the pathetic suction reduces even more.

Reasonably priced, quick delivery, and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"This bug catcher is not very useful. It has very little suction, so many bugs don't get sucked into the tube. Also, the ones that do get sucked into the tube are then sucked against an electrical grid and shocked, which results in the device blowing out air that smells like burned bugs. A small portable vacuum cleaner is more effective and pleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! Quick and clean.","review":"No more smash marks on the walls or ceiling. Easy to get the \\"stupid bugs\\" as my daughters named them. They come in the house and bang themselves on the walls and can't find their way out! Yet they are almost impossible to catch/smash. Now they're gone.And big spiders--goodbye. The grid isn't big enough to really kill them and the vacuum can be a little weak for (I just stopped writing to get one that just emerged from behind a note on the wall). I was going to say the spiders can really resist and are heavier than some other bugs but at least the vacuum can suck them in and I can take it out to dump it alive or drop it in the toilet. That's a great feeling.I wish I'd had it years ago. Definitely worth the high price. I had considered buying something smaller, lower priced. I'm glad to have this now."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome! make my life so much easier","review":"I was a bit skeptical to place the order because there are mixed review about this product. But then after multiple hesitations, finally decide to give it a try. And I'm very happy that I did. I've seen complains about suction is not strong enough to get relatively larger bugs, but it's working perfectly for me so far. Even some bugs that I thought might be questionable, it still works like a charm. The most awesome part being it will just electrocute it once it's in. so cleaning job afterwards is like a breeze now. So I don't have to do all the climbing and squeezing anymore, and my wife could deal with whatever on her own.The missing star is actually for not able to suck up the small bugs on carpet. But I guess that's along the same line about suction not strong enough. And if the blue cap could be transparent, it would be so much easier to see the 'sucking' in action. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product.","review":"Had a chance to use twice and works great!

So I decide to check over the others and find 4 of them really BULGING - each end pouched outwards a centimeter or so. And another 8 cans showing 1 to 3 mm bulges at each end! This case has been in an A/C-ed home in a dark closet.The case of small cans appears to come from 3 different lot numbers (OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1121, OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1122 AND OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1123) Note the 1121/1122/1123 code differs.With just my visual inspection it appears all affected cans are 1122 but I will not be eating any of the remainders.

Actually this book lead me to want to explore certain subjects in greater detail to which I owe it thanks.My verdict: A good subway read for adults, great to give to younger people as a primer to the period covered in the book, the 1960's.

But after completing my How To Use Illustrator AND Photoshop books, I got this book to go through and have a real understanding of the menu's and for easy and quick reference if I can't figure out how to do something.

It pretty much covers everything, and I consider it a must have. The only reason it may not be for someone is if they don't learn well from just reading; that, I admit, is a downside of this book. Sometimes it can be difficult to understand what they are talking about by just reading the instructions. If you are sitting by the computer though, it's very easy to follow step by step.

The flute work is beautiful, and Barabas mainly contributes with electronic keyboard devices on this one (a shame, for such a great keyboardist!).

As for the movie itself, based on seeing the first half I think it is good for a made-for-TV movie, with an interesting plot, reasonable character development, appealing location shots, and mediocre special effects.

He manages to sidestep a lot of charged topics though, simply by leaving them out.The style of writting is both readable and enjoyable and the book itself is engaging. Unfortunatly it leaves out 90% of us humans who are not from that particular tradition in the \\"west.\\"If you want a book that will reinforce the western centracism by all means read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Smells","review":"I've just read three professional reviews of this book as a means of helping me decide whther I want to read it. I'm pretty sure I do, but all three of the reviews I've read have described some aspect of the book as pungent. So, I can't help but think that the book stinks.Can anyone tell me what about this book would cause three seperate reviewers to describe it with an olfactory referencing adjective?Or is \\"pungent\\" just the latest in prose-writer chic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a person interested in history, I wondered how it could be crammed into one medium sized volium. After reading about half of it, I found the answer - skip many important facts and topics, run through everything in a shallow manner and you are done.I did not learn anything new or interesting from this book, but felt frustrated and enraged at the superficial treatment history gets here. Sometimes the book sounds like a story for small children - no names, no background to explain historic developments and almost no dates. Even Gombrich's \\"little history\\" which was written for children is much betterThe chapter aboout the ancient history of the Jews is based mostly on the Bible, without any reference to archeological or other data. Disgraceful,pretentious inaccurate and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Overview","review":"For those who didn't pay any attention in your world history classes and are looking for an overview, this is a great option. I was looking for a book that would introduce me to the people of the past and then allow me, from that intro, to choose what I'm most interested in and then dig deeper (through other books). This book does just that, and it does it at a high enough level that you don't get bogged down or lose interest half way through. I read sections out of the 20-30 odd World History books at Barnes and Noble, and this was one of the few that didn't just list out fact after fact. Another idea, is to purchase the Guide to the Mona Lisa as well and read them together - section by section - from this you'll be able to get a high-level view of art and history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for adults, but not for kids.","review":"One reviewer described this book as being like a 9th grade history book. He was being kind. It's more like a 3rd grade history book. Actual quote: \\"Until five hundred years ago human beings weren't spread throughout the world, like jam on bread. Not at all. We lived in scattered clusters, like the hives of bees a farmer sets along the border of a field.\\" Seriously, this is how the entire book is written. There is a difference between writing for the general audience and dumbing down: Mr Davis doesn't seem to understand that difference. If you are looking for a serious, intelligent book about the history of human kind, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book for teens","review":"I have not finished reading it yet.

I thouroughly enjoyed it for it's action and the obvious research done into historical fact. The feudal farming system was well researched and well described. While Gird as a hero was believable and able to be sympathized with, Luap was very difficult to identify with. I suspect that this was Ms Moon's intent. The problem was that I was left not caring what happened to him. Nevertheless I read the book in one trans-atlantic flight and one extra day, unable to put it down.

Unfortunately, neither approach the heights of that trilogy. The first, Surrender None is slow going but is worth the effort. Barely! The second, Liar's Oath, is a book that had no reason to be written. There is very little story, a confusion of who the main point of view characters are on the authors part with none getting much on page time yet not working as an ensemble piece either. In the end very little happens, and what does happen is so buried under the mundanity of most of the work that it seems trivial.Moon is a good author. She stumbled badly here though.

Surprisingly, perhaps, I agree with most of the prophetic views of the author. However, the book is at best a brief and too-shallow overview of one particular view of prophecy. The author is fairly frequently referring to other words, or \\"longer discussions\\" that aren't appropriate. At the same time, the author often makes statements like \\"Of course.\\" With such a brief treatment, though, how can anything be \\"of course?\\"I'd not recommend this, even to a prophecy neophyte, as it doesn't examine the Bible and draw conclusions, as much as it makes claims and then recites references to back up those claims.

Virtually all the photographs could have been equally as effective in color.

Anderson seems to belittle people and communities who are willing to die for their beliefs- who is he to criticize? He takes paragraphs upon paragraphs to get to the point, and uses 15 large words when 1 or 2 simpler words would suffice. Anderson seems very full of himself, and looks down upon people who do not share his beliefs on nationalism. He cares little for his audience or persuading his audience, he simply cares about trying to look as academic and snobbish as he can. Some arguments were obvious, and he tries to dress them up by adding pages of useless information and showy vocabulary. Others make no sense, and he doesn't explain them clearly or adequately. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A foundational text for the study of world nationalisms","review":"I know Anderson has done more work in the area since the original publication of this work, but I have not read it yet. I hope that work refines his original thesis a bit which seems to simplistic on the chain of causation from material base to the effect of nationalism.Perhaps he simplified to stretch his model over more examples, but I would be interested to see Anderson's take on post-Soviet Europe and Asia. A solid recommend, but not a breezy read by any means.One thing that does annoy me is when authors have chunks of text and notes in untranslated foreign language. In this text the Asiatic languages receive a translation, but the western European languages are left to the reader to interpret. I can read most French but no German, leaving me at a deficit in some cases in the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frog curtain","review":"I bought this wonderful appliqued curtain panel, cut it up the middle, hemmed the inner edges, shortened it by half, and made short bathroom curtains (I made new hanging loops).

This edition, produced by Mark Powell and remastered by Paschal Byrne, who must be a genius, is phenomenally clear and clean. The vocals stand out, the bass and percussion is no longer muddy, and the keyboards soar as they should.This edition contains the original German mix, as originally released on vinyl, and the US mix by Larry Fast and Mo Moore (1976).

Out of curiousity for a leak I placed a lit burner under the grill at the place where the solid extandable tubes come out of the flexible lengths and the tubing lit up from leaking gas!

It is amazing how a poet can be so non-descriptive! How can any writer has been friends with both Mozart and Casanova and yet have nothing to say about them? One gets no sense of what life was like during the end of the 18th century at all. Even Da Ponte's own thoughts and motives do not come across. All that is left are petty political games at an assortment of different opera houses. Da Ponte's story is less amusing than the description of a single flirtation in the truly interesting and picaresque memoirs of his friend Casanova."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanting Volume 3","review":"I bought volume 1 and 2 for my father for Christmas, secretly I knew it would be something he could also watch with my 2 year old son.

With a razor blade I'd expect this, but with a cooking pan?It is unsafe product, as delivered.

I wanted a stainless steel small broiler and this was all I could find, so I'm glad it's working out. It's just the right size to fit in my toaster oven. Food cooks well on it, no problems, no funny tastes. The bottom pan slopes inward on the sides so the bottom is pretty small if you want to cook directly on the pan without the broiler, but I always just use them together.Washing isn't bad. Soaking first (or washing immediately) is a must. I scrub using the scouring side of a sponge and it does take some work, but it comes out clean eventually. Then I toss it in the dishwasher.

It was finally shot and beyond cleaning. I spent weeks looking for a small replacement at all the stores within 35 miles, and found nothing. This looked decent and via the user comments I opted to buy this pan.I've been using it for a few months now, and not overly thrilled with the top section, which I find to have much more metal than necessary to hold the meat, making cleanup a problem. It is too large to soak in our sink. I line the pan with aluminum foil, so the pan is no issue to keep clean.I will continue to look for another small broiling pan, but why re-invent the wheel here? There used to be fantastic small broiling pans already in existence that worked better, had easier cleanup with just a BBQ brush, available just about anywhere.I would not buy this one again unless it were my only option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Razor Sharp Edges","review":"Some past reviews of the Broiler Pan state that the Broiler Pan had sharp edges and other reviews state that their Broiler Pan did not.

The premise was promising and intriguing; however, the story ultimately felt contrived throughout. The conclusion, in particular, fell flat for me, as there was a distinct lack of suspense and the feeling that everything had to be tied up in a neat little bow with everyone (but one) living happily ever after. As much as I love a good (and even mediocre) mystery, this will probably be the first and last Bannister book that I will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite an Homage to Christie...","review":"This book is not an homage to Christie the way \\"A Thousand Acres\\" might be seen as a work retroactively illuminating \\"King Lear.\\" In no way does Bannister seem to encapsulate any of the features that made \\"Ten Little Indians\\" such an amazing work of mystery literature. Instead, she's written a rather dull and plodding mystery, one that replaces \\"Whodunnit?\\" with \\"Who cares?\\"Let's face it, no one is going to be able to improve upon \\"Ten Little Indians.\\" Even Christie's play, along with countless film versions, have changed the ending to a trite \\"tie up all the loose ends\\" phenomenon, where the \\"good\\" characters get a happy ending.

Athanasius found himself standing alone in the face of the Arian heresy which was supported by most of the Eastern bishops, and the emperor. Athanasius stood fearless and unapologetic when it was not safe or convenient to do so. He suffered five exiles and numerous attempts on his life. He kept on talking, writing and outlasted his enemies.

Bible studies? Who uses such language in the 4th century. Athanasius encouraged asceticsim in Rome, not Protestant Bible studies. The narrative doesnt compel, intrigue or flow. Insight is nonexistent and it was painful to read the life of one of the Church's greats so poorly portrayed with so little effort to engage the reader with the actual thought of Athanasius--not Roman, Protestant or Eastern Orthodox, rather a church Father of the 4th century--long before there was a divided between the 3 great faiths of Christendom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great bowls, lids don't fit!","review":"I ordered these bowls because of the lids, how nice to be able to mix and refrigerate things in the same bowl.

The cubs are ridiculously cute and the adult tigers are absolutely magnificent and beautiful. The movie is shot very well, with many breathtaking scenes overlooking the forest. The moral of the story is excellent. It shows the trouble tigers endure and truly shows that humans should respect animals as other living things.

However, such a ploy is a double-edged sword, and in this case, at least to these ears, the album's eclecticism is a primary contributor to its flatness and directionless feel. The circus concept motif is--and was back then--incredibly dated, even sophomoric. On the other hand, the playing is quite good and the arrangements (especially on \\"Nelly the Elephant\\") are well-orchestrated. But apart from a few quitessential tracks (the aforemetioned \\"Nelly\\" as well as the scorching \\"Astral Man\\" and Fidgety Queen\\")the concept overshadows the musical execution pretty drastically in this case. A Tab in the Ocean, Remember the Future and Recycled are the three Nektar albums you really want to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Timeless Music from the Overlooked Nektar\\"","review":"What a shame that so many people have never even heard of \\"Nektar\\" which is a heavily Beatles influenced progressive/ art rock band which created some of the most memerable music in this genre back in the 1970's which to me still is as fresh today as it was over 30 years ago. This is a concept album about a circus and every song is a virtual gem especially \\"Early Morning Clown\\", \\"Show Me The Way\\" and \\"Astral Man\\" Please add this magnificent CD to your collection and I assure you that it will bring you a lot of joy over many listenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn fine lineup even without Garcia","review":"While I have a soft spot for the original incarnation of the New Riders, with Garcia on pedal steel and Lesh on bass, they were still a formidable unit in 1972, when this gem of a show was recorded.I have a bunch of NRPS bootlegs on CD, from '70, '71, '77 and other years, and while the '71 show from the Dead's historic spring run at the Fillmore is my favorite, this runs a close second.Most of my favorite songs are here (\\"Truck-Drivin' Man,\\" \\"Henry,\\" \\"Glendale Train\\"), as are some nice covers in the form of Chuck Berry's \\"School Days\\" and Cash's \\"Long Black Veil.Buddy Cage is nice on the pedal steel, but like I said, I just have a soft spot for Garcia's loping style, which carried through surprisingly well on pedal. Cage is a little more technical, but still very enjoyable.Like the Dead, NRPS have an awkwardly endearing harmony that makes you smile, and the boogie to back it up. Good good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"At their best","review":"These are excellent,well recorded versions of the bands' best songs.

The product is as described. It has a lovely wood design and the tines are decorated with colorful pieces of metal.

Souvenir items are usually not tuned to the desired pitch and the quality of materials is less than those used by actual musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"Despite the obvious tuning problems that most people had with this product, I found it really fun and easy to use. The small size allows maximum portability, and the range of keys allows quite a wide variety of songs to be played on it. I've never played a kalimba before ordering this one, so I was relieved to find that it was relatively easy to play (after tuning it and growing my thumbnails out slightly longer). I found the sound to be very aesthetically pleasing, except for the highest notes (shortest tines) which had a sort of \\"thin,\\" sound, but it didn't really bother me much. With a screwdriver, a piano, and a bit of effort, I was able to tune the kalimba to my liking. Also, after a bit of use, the tines can be tuned with some sideways wiggling and pushing/pulling. I think ordering this instrument was a great decision; my family and I are currently enjoying very much. It's really easy to make music with it and it can be taken anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice LOOKing!... Weak sounding.","review":"I received this kalimba last night. At first open I was actually very excited how nice it LOOKED. I would have been proud to have this one in my collection. The item was described as new, however there were a few blemishes (which I would not have minded cuz it was under $50 bucks). I tuned it into it's proper range (B as bottom note). Tuning it isn't as bothersome as other people have commented. However, I immediately realized that the first two tines did not play right (the sound was muted and made \\"thunk\\" sounds. If you do decide to buy this kalimba - be careful cuz the dealer doesn't refund any of the shipping. I hope you don't get one with muted notes like I got. Also, the sound is not as strong as similar kalimbas - but just sounds okay. By the way, I don't have anything to gain or lose by commenting here. I was really hoping it would work out.

No mention of lejos, the java VM for RCX.The book doesn't mention USB at all and mostly focuses on the parallel port.

Denny Crane even endorses Obama, the most unlikely and inconsistent plot twist imaginable (Denny is definitely one of those people \\"clinging to their guns\\"). They give us an obvious case of female infanticide via abortion, but an episode ending that lets all the lawyers in the room believe they'd done their professionally responsible best, though the glib child goes off to abort her daughter.

I have yet to watch the show, but I hope it is better than the book. While I usually enjoy WWII books, this one disappointed me. The stories set around individual soldiers or small groups were quite good, being told from the stories that Ambrose gathered from those very men. Where the book falls short is in the description of the major movements of the troops. His descriptions are confusing and he uses some abbreviations that a person not familiar with the military may be confused by. Ambrose could have put a little more effort into better explaining these battles. Adding the maps into the chapters they applied to would also have helped. Would have like to see more photos also.

He starts with how the company came to gather and moves on to their battle in Normandy, Belgium, Germany and Austria. Ambrose does a very good job writing this book. He uses quotes from interviews of the members of the Company in the book. This book shows how; throw determination, well, loyalty, self-discipline and personal courage, normal people from across the country can come to gather and defeat evil and keep this country free. I would recomind this book to anyone and to read any of Stephen Ambrose's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I found the HBO series rivetting...so I rushed out and bought the book. Speilberg and Hanks tell a much better story than Ambrose, even if they glossed over the truth a bit. In the series, the soldiers do come off as real heros. In the book, they just seem like whiners. I was surprised at how much Captain Winters goes on and on in the book badmouthing officers both above and below him in rank. In his opinion only Captain Spears and himself seem to be worthy of any credit for the 101st's achievments. It get's tiring hearing soldiers go on at length about the greatness of their company. The producers of the series were right to minimze this...it just seems tachy to be still complaining about other soldiers 50 years later.The letters of a private Webster are quoted at length, simply copied page after page into the book, so much so that his name should have be under Ambrose's on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as his others","review":"Dreamed about foxholes and shells every night as I read this. Very good book, just as good as the more acclaimed \\"D-Day\\" and \\"Citizen Soldiers.\\" While those were more grand in scope, \\"Band of Brothers\\" may be more compelling because it follows essentially the same cast of characters through their Odyssey instead of jumping around to different divisions, nationalities, etc. Doesn't cover up the drinking, loafing, back-company pilfering, shooting of prisoners, looting, occasional insubordination, acts of cowardice & stupidity, etc. I was a little disappointed that Ambrose ripped only on the dead (namely Capt. Sobel) and glorified all those who are still alive. But overall a wonderful book. I don't want to glorify war--I would've hated to fight in any war, including WWII (which ended 25 yrs. before I was born), but if I had to fight I would've wanted to fight in the airborne under Major Winters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne","review":"Absolutely gripping from start to finish.

Based on this experience I can share with you all that Mr. Ambrose has done a remarkable job of capturing the essense of this warrior in text. This book was one of those rare \\"can't put downs\\" that you only happen upon a few times. I strongly recommend this book to both WWII buffs and those who are just starting to learn about the war.

I want to read this outstanding book again. My hardcover copy is long gone, but I own a Kindle now and would love to buy it,. For some absurd reason however, the Kindle version is more than twice the price of the mass market paperback. To say nothing of the the fact that it's environmentally criminal to force people who would by an electronic product to buy a physical book just to save money, the whole thing just makes no sense. The digital version of these products are inherently cheaper to produce than any physical copy could ever be. The Kindle version should never cost more than the cheapest paperback version. There is no embossed dust cover or fancy leather binding with a Kindle. It's just text! Amazon needs to get with publishers and correct this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and interesting read","review":"Steven Ambrose is the historian for the masses. He writes in a concise manner that anyone can breeze thru but uses a fair amount of imagry to create a novel instead of a history book. Obviously, watching the mini-series is much more enjoyable after reading this book. The greatest reason this is true is the knowledge of all the names/identies so when the directors accent certain events, you aren't trying to understand what, who or when. If you're a history buff, WWII dork, or like me (little bit of both) you'll want to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book, read it if you get the chance","review":"Stephen Ambrose is the most compelling historian ever and this book is proof. Because of this book I have read more into the 101st Airborne and actually more into WWII. The book is magnificent from cover to cover, from page to page. If you can buy this or even borrow it, do it. It will be a great book for decades to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor Issues are not Major Errors","review":"While the book may rely too much on Winters, and I will acknowledge a few really small accuracy issues - the focus of this book is much more on the subjective and personal experiences of this company of soldiers. I found the book and the movie believable and consistent with what I have heard from combat veterans. Is Ambrose a true historian or a very good story recorder? I think the latter but that does not reduce the value of the work he contributes - he puts flesh on the bones of dry citations and 'history' as still photograph and diary. Both are needed and valued, and have a place.Winters, of course, was injured in the leg during the Caretan battle in Normandy. And it is incredibly dubious to me that anyone could get away with gross exagerrations with the dozens of 506th veterans interviewed.I think these works are important to filling out the combat experience of the soldier."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Realistic Account","review":"Band of Brothers is one of the best books I've read on the Normandy invasion.

How surprised I was to discover just the opposite. Ambrose may have been a great historian, but he was no writer. Incidents that in the series were presented with drama and suspense were written of in a flat-footed, perfunctory manner. What I came away with most after reading \\"Band of Brothers\\" was less respect for Ambrose and more for the producers and writers of the series, who so successfully fleshed out Ambrose's skeletal text. I don't think I've ever said this before, but skip the book and rent the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick shipping","review":"The book was in the condition indicated, and was shipped quickly.

They put their lives on the line for their country and their fellow soldiers. They lived history, and changed its course dramatically. This book is a must for all military, war, and American history buffs. Heck, this is the type of book that should be mandatory for ALL Americans.The one thing holding this back is that the writing is not the best. I don't know if Ambrose took what the soldiers wrote and put it in the book word for word, or this just isn't his best work. There were a lot of areas that just did not flow that well. Also, there is a lot, A LOT, of military language in terms of troop grouping. I have no idea what any of that means, and I still don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy S*** this is GOOD!!!","review":"If you're remotely interested in history and/or WW2 just do yourself a favor and get this.

I have finally read it and enjoyed it immensely.The book gives details the series could not give (due to time constraints) but aside from that the series remained faithful to Ambrose's research.The best part of the book was that it didn't read like a boring history book - it was vivid, attention grabbing and read as if the men of E Company themselves were sitting across from you retelling their heroic tale. I was able to read Band of Brothers cover to cover without struggling to get through it (and in my book if any historical book can be read in that manner then that is a great feat.)I recommend this to anyone who loved the Band of Brothers mini-series but craves more detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding..Buy it!","review":"Oral history at its finest.

It's shocking that so many readers out there just gobble up Ambrose's \\"feel good history\\" as unquestionable fact, when in reality what Ambrose writes little more than entertainment for ignorant readers. Everything Bate's mentions is true...the fact that other less fabled, yet equally brave and crucial formations that served in Bastogne get ignored by Ambrose is shameful. Also, his knowledge of the German Army in all of his writings is down right pathetic and revolves more around old 'folk lore' than any type of dedicated research. Ambrose does know how write an compelling story, I'll give him that...although there is a lot of better academic history out there, and it is not very hard to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Band of Brothers","review":"Band of Brothers is a good book.

One of the best books I've read about the common soldier in Europe. Ambrose's writing is superb - he makes all of the characters come alive as we follow their induction into the Army and their arrival at Fort Toccoa and their training with Capt. Sobel. We follow the guys to England as they get ready to depart for Normandy. The book continues with their jumps into Holland and later, Bastogne. Since we've followed the troops and have come to know them well, there is a sense of sadness at the war's end that these band of brothers are disbanding. The \\"where are they now\\" at the end of the book is quite poignant. The book is not heavy on facts and is somewhat light reading but it's one that is hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charge!","review":"This book is about the 101st airborne division.

I have nothing but the utmost respect for the men in the book, and all of the veterans who put it all on the line for our country.

Stephen Ambrose lacks the style and wit of Edmund Morris, the last author I read. However, many will prefer the simplicity of Ambrose's \\"just the facts\\" approach. I especially appreciated the personal detail he extracted in face to face interviews. He shares these very candidly. No punches pulled here. The reader is treated to the feeling that he is more than acquainted with the soldiers of E Company. The book includes interesting background and personal detail not included in the miniseries. A watching audience would view them as tedious. However, the book lacks the visceral impact of the visuals in the miniseries. My advice? Watch the miniseries AND read the book. They complement each other very well. Rating: 4 of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written; a good read","review":"I've enjoyed other books by Stephen Ambrose and this one didn't disappoint.

HBO series is better....","review":"This offers an historian centered view of E Company while showing much of the same personality as the HBO drama. However, the acting in the miniseries is outstanding, moreover, the HBO series also has interviews with the surviving E company soldiers which are incredible. Why only read about these individuals when you can practically meet them? Having watched the series first I was continually picturing the actors and thinking of the interviews while reading the book. In effect the series brought things to life whereas the book is a little dry. It is a good read and I would recommend it but I would recommend the series more.

The brief and very shallow source section at the end of the book did little to enhance the text and made it impossible to know exactly what historical research was done other than oral interviews. My inquiring mind requires more substance concerning Ambrose's research. The book kept ones interest fairly well although I found it fairly basic.

How do you understand anything, unless you were there and have gone through all the circumstances?

Thank you, Mr. Ambrose for following your instincts on doing this remarkable story so that Easy and the 506th PIR, 101st Airborne will never be forgotten.

I am sure this could have been much longer, but it really hits highlights, except for Bastogne which it went into some detail about.

You felt as if you knew the men that are interviewed for this book and how many men there were that didn't come back and have a chance to tell their stories. What a great generation they all are. Both of my grandfathers fought in WWII. Neither have a lot to say about what they did and what happened. Sharing this book with them has released stories even thier wives didn't know. Stories that would be forever lost. The 506th exudes brotherhood-what it means to truly love others and sacrifice. Under intense, unimaginable conditions, they came together for the better good.

It keeps shutting off my Miele washing machine...one of the new Miele big front loaders. I have to go for weeks without it working. Now I am having to reset it every time. It is horrible, horrible. A nightmare. Miele has been out here 3 or 4 times, and there is NOTHING wrong with my washer. It is all this stupid Intelliflow unit. There is no flood but it just shuts off because it cannot work with the sophisticated electronics of the new Miele washer."},{"rating":"1","title":"more trouble than it's worth","review":"I had this device installed by my plumber after my previous washing machine overflowed and destroyed the ceiling below. It worked fine for about a year, but has been nothing but trouble since. I have had numerous service calls on my washing machine because of water flow problems (no hot water this time). It is impossible to bypass this unit to troubleshoot any washing machine problems. It's really frustrating. The washing machine repairman always blame this unit. In the latest case, he was correct. This unit is not allowing any hot water to flow to the washing machine. The electronic aspect with no manual shutoff removes any control on the part of the user. It also cycles on and off and causes huge house-shaking knocking sounds when the washing machine is on the hand-wash setting. I cannot have this un-installed fast enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronics failed in just over a year of use","review":"I was impressed with this valve when I saw it on This Old House. I purchased one for my new laundry room and installed it about a year ago. I was surprised when the electronics failed. We were about to do a load of laundry and it was dead, no water. Luckily I do my own plumbing and easily switched back to a manual shutoff valve. Looking into a replacement, I now see several other reports of similar failures. Until this high failure rate is addressed by Watts, I have no intention of buying another, as much as I like the concept. I wish there was an alternative on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, flawed product","review":"This sounds like the ideal solution to washing machine hoses which might burst at any time. It detects the electrical current of the washing machine and opens water valves only while the machine is active.The problem is that the product is so cheaply made that its almost impossible to install correctly. The threaded attachments for the water supply are cheap soft PLASTIC. As soon as you start to thread on the BRASS nuts that hold the water connections tight, you will cross-thread the nuts. The maker knows of the problem since they have a warning \\"Don't cross-thread\\" in their instructions. A better solution would be to build a product with a METAL valve body which might actually survive installation.Nice idea, but unless you are the most gifted installer STAY AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently a piece of crap...wish I had read these reviews before","review":"Ours was installed by a plumber about 15-18 months ago. The whole time we've had it I had to unplug the unit and plug it back in to get it working. Otherwise it thought there was a water leak and wouldn't start the laundry. Then after I came back from a week's vacation on my 4th load of laundry it started the water into the drum. When I went to add another item to the wash I realized it had stopped filling. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and the lights simply faded out. Our plumber asked if we had had a power outage...we had...over a week previous and I had done 3 loads already. Apparently this thing was a huge waste of money and I only wish I had seen these reviews before our plumber installed it. I'll be sure to tell him about these reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT ! !","review":"I bought even after I read all the reviews. Man, I wish I had more common sense. Mine lasted exactly 8 months to the day, and broke within the one year warranty period. Watts doesn't honor the warranty cause I didn't buy it direct from them. What kind of load of junk is that. I bought this becuase I had seen it on TV on This Old House. Boy am I sorry. I have spent sometime on the phone trying to get it covered under warranty but now I give up.

It suddenly stopped working and no amount of rinsing, disassembly, prodding, could get it to work again. Because it uses custom connections, and it had worked okay for quite a long while, decided to purchase an exact replacement from Plumbing Planet. This unit popped and sent sparks flying the first time I used it.

I've had this one for 13 months. And there's no way to override it.A little over a year seems to be the standard, from reading the other notes here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not buy this!","review":"Under no circumstances buy this it is an utter nightmare. It trips often and stops your washing machine from working and requires frequent re-calibration. Worst of all the fittings are unique to this unit so you can not swap it out for new valves."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment!","review":"Sometimes the old fashioned way works better than the new. I installed this valve but my washer shut down. After spending money with a washer repair company and a plumber, I learned that my machine was one of the many that was not compatible with this type of automatic switch. $300+ later I have a manual lever shut off and NO Watts automatic valve. Save the headache. If you are concerned about your washer hoses, put in a lever shut off valve, use it, and be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed like many others","review":"Like other reviews, the product worked great for about 2 years then stopped.

Not sure what I'm going to do next."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"This think is JUNK do not install, I have 2 of them both of them broke in 4 years and then you cant just put a new shutoff in you need ot redo ALL your piping and then watts does not make a conversion kit to put on a \\"standard\\" easy shut off.

If the cycle lasts too long, the device thinks the water has remained open too long and closes the valve. The washer is trying to do the final rinse cycle, but cannot obtain water. Because the washer is electronic, there's no way to just turn everything off, unplug the Intelliflow, and restart at the same point in the wash cycle (once turned off the washer must resume from start). The Watts people's workarounds do not help either. I'm trying to decide whether to have the plumber remove it or just settle for dingy clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd done more research","review":"The valve worked well for a little over a year, and then failed after we lost power during a storm. It was connected to a good quality surge protector too - and nothing else in the house had any problems. I'm very disappointed in this unit, as I'll have to either bolt another one into place, or rip open the recently decorated laundry room walls to tie in a different brand unit to the plumbing. I expected to get 5-10 years of service out of this unit, but failing at 14 months it ended up costing about .40 cents a day for protection. In browsing the web trying to troubleshoot the problem, I found that many people had failures just past the warranty period. Buyers, look elsewhere.UPDATE: One year & 4 days later and the replacement unit has also failed. My God is this thing a piece of junk. It's time to rip up the wall and get this out of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality problems","review":"I just had my A2C-M1 die about 18 months after install.

I removed the device and cleaned out the valves and screens, tho there was no crud or debris whatsoever in it - still didn't work. It just failed, I guess. This was, in fact, the second one - the first died when my house got hit by lightning (but so did many other electrical devices).I would not select this product again - tho now I'm stuck with it since my laundry room is plumbed for the Intelliflow and it would be a pain to change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronics FAIL - Buyer Beware!","review":"Similar to other reviews, my Watts IntelliFlow has gone to sleep for good after 2 years. It was plugged into a GFI that never tripped. The green power light won't come on so we'll have to disconnect it until we can install another product (FloodStop). We had shut the water off to the house to replace a broken exterior sill cock and when we went to use the washing machine the next day the power light was gone for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't wash when fails","review":"I was very pleased with my Watts sdA2C-M1 product until it failed. There is no bypass feature, when it fails you are unable to wash until it is replaced. In my case I called a plumber and replaced it with a manual single handle valve. The cost of a plumber and the manual valve was less the Watts valve. If it had a \\"bypass\\" feature I might have considered replacing it. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"product usefullness","review":"We purchased a unit 3 years ago for connection to a Bosch washer. The Watts Intelliflow worked great at first.However, the unit requires constant recalibration (would shut off between uses). Then a washer hose failed and leaked water. The unit did not shut off the water as promised. We placed the sensor in a glass of water to test it. It failed and water kept leaking. The unit has been replaced with a manual shut off valve.We do not recommend these unless you don't care if you have leaks. We contacted the manufacturer about the problem and their response was --- it is out of warranty. We'd say they are not customer service oriented."},{"rating":"1","title":"product failure","review":"The Watts Intelliflow was installed in our new laundry 2 years ago. From the start it gave problems, -mostly wouldn't let the LG washing machine (also new) complete the cycle. The IE message would come up on the washer's screen. But we figured out how to get it to complete the wash/rinse cycle. -Until this time. Now the washer screen shows, again, that no water is entering the tub. I know it's the Intelliflow fault as the green LED light on the Intelliflow device is not on, which indicates no water flow.Not only is there a design flaw, but there's no manual over-ride. Nor is it possible to bypass the device when it mallfunctions, which, to judge by the complaints of others, is quite frequent. Removing it altogether requires replumbing. The manual has no advice other than to plug the device into the outlet (why didn't I think of that?). Nor is there a support site to contact in the \\"Important Instructions\\".Not a good device; my advice is avoid it and all other Watts products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Destined to fail","review":"I had it for 13 months.

The existing water supply valves now serve as isolation valves. A special fitting was used to transition to copper pipes, 8 inches long, to this automatic shutoff valve. Screw the existing washer supply lines to the valve; drop the sensor into the washer's plastic pan, plug the washer into the valve and plug the valve into the wall. That's it. Now, when the washer is off, the valve shuts the water off. If the washer leaks while it is running, the sensor will shut the water off. The total cost of this installation is less than the deductible on my homeowners insurance policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternative Found","review":"With so many negitive reviews on this product I was not going to but.

It does not with in conjunction with the washer as this product does. They also have similar products for hot water heaters.Control floods from broken washer hoses or leaks from washing machines . Only an automatic water sensor activated water shut off valve can save you from extensive water damage.

How many bands can get CRUNK, own the crowd with a riff-tastic punk song, have freestyle rap battles between songs, and beat out Tsunami Bomb (sorry, Agent M) for best band of the night? ...not many.

I too love Russell's booming tenor voice; however, I also love the softer voice he uses on many of these songs. My favorites are \\"You Don't Know Me\\" and \\"To All The Girls I've Loved Before\\". I have always loved this song, but when I heard the duet I just couldn't stop listening to it. In fact, I'm listening now. I just moves me, as does \\"You Don't Know Me\\". I got goosebumps when I first heard it. The only thing I wasn't too fond of is that some of the songs are sung very slowly. I do feel he chose wonderful songs for this CD.

My daughter especially loves the drum.. she loves to bang the sticks on the drum. My only complaint is the little lady bug thing.. it doesnt \\"work\\" to well. Sure.. you hear dings when bang on it.. but, its not such good quality (my daughter could care less.. she just bangs away!)If you are looking just for a basic instrument set for your toddler.. this is a very good choice.

It had twisted a couple of times making it impossible for her to get it off of her head. She now has red friction marks on her neck from the strap, and the drum is now strapless. The design of the strap is such that it is split into two straps, connecting with Velcro in the middle. At fist glance my thought was that this was a safety feature and that the strap would release should the strap be used around the neck. The Velcro is strong enough that I had to strain to get the straps apart. So much for safety!

Richard Lugo!","review":"Most people think Richard Lugo is just another guy trying to be like Ricky Martin. I hate to break it to everyone, but he's not. Lugo has awesome vocals, and cool lyrics(Unlike Ricky who is oh so BORING). When I bought \\"Boom\\" and popped it into the c.d. player in my car, I couldn't help but dance! Sure the people driving next to me thought I needed mental help, but I was grooving along to songs like \\"All the Girl I Need\\", \\"Boom\\", \\"Ocean Drive\\", and \\"Ven, Ven, Ven\\". He has his own style, very different from any other bands/singers I listen too. If you like music with a bit of Latin spice in it, this is the c.d. for you! Go out and buy it, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOM!......THIS ALBUM IS A BOMB!","review":"Lugo is not Ricky Martin, is not Marc Anthony is not even Jennifer Lopez!This album falls flat from the minute it starts. The production is shotty, the first single \\"Boom\\" is amateurish at best. Lugos vocals are fair to midland, he is not even that cute.There are no other potential hit singles here. All of the songs are just flat bombs.\\"Boom\\" has to be one of the worst pop albums in the last 15 years. Save your money!!! Puhhhhlease!!!!!Richard Lugos music career isn't going far, I can guarantee it. The tracks on here are almost laughable. He is NO latin superstar.Just awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Guy Trying to be a Latin Superstar","review":"Richard lugo, yes to girls is cute, but will him being cute really sell records?... I think not. The first single off the album \\"Boom\\" is a song that you would hear on little kid stations because of the word Boom used every five seconds and the un-origianl beat that is used every 5 seconds. The other songs on this album such as \\"All The Girl I Need\\", \\"Ven Ven Ven\\" are written very badly, and show no effort by Lugo singigng them. Let me get to the point .. Lugo has no voice .. It's all computer, the only thing orignal on this cd is Lugos name. The ballads on this album, sounds like a cat that just got it's tail stepted on. If you want a god album get Britney Spears \\"Oops!..I Did It Again\\", or past Mariah Carey albums .. now those are CD's you an handle listeing to. P.S - Beth, you can have this cd .. just don't give it back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"*Only love for Lugo*","review":"This CD is the best $20 I've ever spent. There is not one track I skip over.

This arrived brand new and undamaged but the mechanism that is supposed to lock the fuel can in place absolutely will not work. What's worse, it is evident from the lever mechanism that the problem is with the design itself, not faulty assembly or damaged parts. The mechanism uses a sort of cam mechanism to compress the fuel can against the pin that goes into the top of the can. But the pivot point of the cam and the slot that locks the cam into place are made such that as the cam turns it jams. There is no way to fix this without disassembling the mechanism and re-machining the part. In my view this stove is defective from the get-go. It's not even worth sending the thing back. I'll just give it to Good Will and buy a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Efficient as backup, wish I'd known this first","review":"I bought this stove as an emergency back-up, have used propane stove previously. I wish I'd known that butane does not burn clean. It is efficient -but my pans were blackened on the bottom from only minutes of use. I would only use older pots or pans that I might take camping as I wouldn't use my best ones on this stove. Aside from this problem the stove works well and will do the job necessary whether it be to cook a quick meal or just boil water or make coffee. I found it to be safe and easy to use as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Hotter than the Average Stove","review":"I got this stove for camping with heating water in mind. It gives a noticably larger/hotter flame than my other butane stove. It did heat water much quicker than my standard 6800 BTU butane stove. It also goes through butane very quickly compared to my other stove.The case is very cheap like all of the others I have seen. It is one step up from a dust bag. If you think you are going to toss it around or load gear on top of it it will soon be broken.I didn't give the stove 5 stars because the fit of the burner plate on top of the stove was not good. It seemed loose. It's not unusable, it's just not a good quality fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"It functions, Barely","review":"I suppose I was spoiled by buying a commercial Japanese made version of this stove previously. It came and I tried it. The burner would not light from the piezoelectric ignighter. I had to light it manually and it seemed to burn lower than I expected. I returned it because it would not light correctly.The top black portion of the stove cover and pot support are enameled steel. It stores upside-down in the cheap flimsy storage case. I do not expect the case to last long. The stove seems to be good for occasional use. The fuel canisters can be difficult to find locally. They are available on Amazon and tend to be shipped motor-freight if you order a case.I love the extra gas burner that works much better than my electric stove top.

If you use the 4 slots for double disc cases you'll only have 40 slots in all. My only complaint is that the slots for the double disc cases don't allow you to push them in all the way, and since this item spins it will come out of the slots a little bit.Overall I really like this product, because I was running out of space for my Cd's and this is a lot better than what I had before, but if I find something similar to this that holds more double disc cases I will replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Lamont's Finest!","review":"This record came out during the disco era, nevertheless the compsitions here are mostly magnificent and the musical arrangements and performances are first rate. \\"Boogie Business\\", \\"Love Me To The Max\\",\\"Fly Away Little Birdsong\\" are stand out performances.

The music itself is simple enough, but the lyrics are nicely done and well written, and \\"2000 Years of Human Error\\" is quite an above average album. Opening track \\"The Reckoning\\" is the album's standout track, and other great songs include \\"Sinking\\", \\"Backstander\\", \\"I Hate Today\\", and the surprisingly good cover of The Beatles' \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" are the most memorable, and while the album does have a few parts where it seems it drags, \\"2000 Years of Human Error\\" remains a great album. If you like music like Type O, Manson, White Zombie, KMFDM, or Gravity Kills, then check out Godhead, you'll be pleasently surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD of Hits and Misses","review":"Its not surprising that a band like Godhead would be discovered by Marilyn Manson; sharing pretty similar lyrics and musical sound (on a lighter scale, of course) as every parent's worst nightmare. The lyrics are very well written, because they share a double meaning within them. It either uses organized religion in it or it doesn't, it all depends on how you look at it. This plus the lighter musical sound make it more accessable than Manson's offerings.The songs musically, however, are a much more different issue. You either love this song or you hate it; there is no in-between. I can easily say I loved half the songs (tracks 1-3,6, and 10) and couldn't stand the rest.Still for its inexpensive price (5-10 bucks cheaper than most CD's) it shouldn't hurt to give this one a shot, you'll probably like it.

The music is tight, the vocals are tremendous. The only problem with the disc is a slight lack of diversity. Too many of the songs are exactly alike.

Also there isnt really a good flow to the CD. The good songs are great, like \\"I hate today,\\" \\"The Reckoning,\\" and \\"I Sell Society.\\" But they don't make up for the rest.

The lyrics have no meaning, he repeats himself over and over, and again show NO talent whatsoever. These guys clearly tried to rip off Manson, but managed to fail horribly.

Seeing as how a phones primary function should be to facilitate talking i'm very disapointed! The functions offered are nice (the speaker phone function on the phone itself (not the base) is nice and allows friends and famaily to hear my 18 month old daughter babble while we talk. So good functions, nice design, good price but horrible battery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"Went through four of these phone and none of them worked.

This phone has some very nice features, combined with what I think is a defective charging circuit inherent in the design. I had my phone \\"repaired\\" by Panasonic once. The battery difficulties returned. I have spent half what I paid for the phone on new battery packs. I have even used external equipment to measure and charge the packs. To no avail! As soon as you rely on the phone to maintain the battery's charge, the batteries fail. I'm surprised that Panasonic keeps feeding this dog to the marketplace. Let's hope these reviews alert people to avoid this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This phone is a winner","review":"I'm very surprised by all the negative comments. We bought this phone a month ago and think it's great. No battery problems at all. We find the phone is user friendly and intuitive to use. The features are 100% what we wanted and work perfectly.

Wouldnt waste the money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery lasts 20 minutes.","review":"It's true. There is a systematic defect on this model where the battery life lasts 20 minutes or less.

A lot of young kids won't have a clue about this music ,but if you can really dig the likes of the real pros like Robert Johnson and Bessie Smith you will have a ball with this priceless set as these songe are the real orginals not remakes by some new Motown group.

The late Helen Wessel studied the Scriptures in their original language, and discovered the truth about Eve's \\"curse\\". The first half of the book is written as a story, about a young Christian couple expecting their first baby. There is alot of information to be picked up in the story, and even more follows in the second half of the book.Part 2 has such chapter titles as \\"Childbirth Through the Centuries,\\" \\"Childbirth in the Bible,\\" \\"The Medical Model,\\" \\"Family Sheltered Birthing,\\" \\"Birthing God's Way,\\" \\"The Joy of Natural Childbirth,\\" and \\"The Joy of Breastfeeding.\\" One of these chapters alone makes the book worth buying.

Is \\"natural childbirth\\" some fad started by hippies and humanists? Should Christians use midwives? These were questions that were being batted around by a group of us fairly new mothers back when I was pregnant with my second baby. I wish I'd had this book then. It presents a Biblical view of childbirth...a view that tells us that childbirth can indeed be joyful. Is this pie-in-the-sky stuff only for \\"earth mothers\\" or women who delight in \\"toughing it out\\" or being martyr-like during labor? Not at all!

Another favorite was Shell Shock, it's somewhat different from their usual songs, but I thought it was cool. It's a really neat album, different songs, a very different synth style, and also this is the first band I've heard that uses monotone vocals. Is it recommended? Yeah, definitely, but there are a few things I didn't like about my version which was the 94 version. Although I like True Faith on that one, I didn't like Bizzare Love Triangle, one of my most favorite songs as the version was too short and I liked the original synth used.

Highly recomended for the euro-new-wave lover, but may not be for the the seasoned New Order fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Songs Missing","review":"Combining dance music with alternative rock, this is a great introduction to New Order. Peter Hook handles his bass guitar like the lead guitar, playing melodic bass often in the upper register; Bernard Sumner provides intentionally unemotional singing; and the lyrics are sometimes cryptic.

I really didn't listen to this cd much when I got it, rather it grew on me over time. And once it grows on you, there's not stopping it. There's so many addicting songs on here. Besides the usual radio/club favorites, some other good songs include \\"Dreams Never End\\" (especially the beginning of the track) & \\"Touched by the Hand of God\\". I do wish they had included the original of \\"Blue Monday\\" as well as the '88 remix."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy is genius !!","review":"This is a new way of synthpop potion in the making; and the outcome was not disappointing at all.

It was learning by example of her life, how she was raised, mistakes made, losses, successes, and at the chapter's end she would write one paragraph that would encourage the reader to implement one value or tradition to strengthen the family unit he/she was a part of.

I played it some, but quickly got tired of it. When the expansion came out, I didn't want it, certainly not worth even the piddling ... they were asking. I broke down and picked it up just recently, and was amazed at how unbalanced the creon were.

The game is still overly slow and clunky even on a PIII 500mhz machine. 2. The AI cheats to make units far faster than you can. 3. The unit AI stinks. They will not counter attack despite the fact that the unit RIGHT NEXT TO THEM is getting attacked. Their pathing is equally bad. 4. Unit variety is unimaginative. 5.

The script and acting are pretty flat. Since this was made in 1980, you have to keep that in mind when watching. When they finally get to raising the ship, the effects are quite good and worth watching just for that. I would give this film 2 1/2 stars.

This book was a major encouragement to me, both in my personal prayer life as well as my corporate rone.

I bought 2 more books so the whole class could pass them around. You can see the change in our little group toward prayer and the desire to be cleansed of sin after reading this powerful book.

I have read many books on church growth or on how to have a successful church and was not thrilled about receiving another one. I have found that these books just make me feel guilty and totally inadequate. This book was different. I really appreciated the authors humility. He is not writing as an \\"I now know how you should do it\\" Pastor. When I finished the book I was full of hope. It was simple but not simplistic. It was inspirational but not trite. There were enough stories mixed with good Biblical interpretation to give me confidence in the author and assurance that there was Biblical balance in his thinking. This book should be read by every Pastor who wants his church to grow God's way. I have already ordered books for all the leaders in the church and we will be making the change in our service that Pastor Jim suggested in the last page of the book. I have been personally revived. Thank you for a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Cymbala points out the way to real revival in the church","review":"After hearing pastors say over and over that the way to be a successful church is to offer people what they are looking for (i. e. youth ministry, women's classes, upbeat contemporary music, etc.) and spending time worrying about numbers that are staying the same or even shrinking, it is so refreshing to hear a pastor admit that success in the church isn't demonstrated by numbers and that numbers aren't increased by \\"selling\\" your church. Success, he says, can be demonstrated by the strength of your prayer meetings. Numbers will be increased by offering one thing... God! People are not really looking for a youth minstry or a musical church. They are looking for the power of God, and that comes only through prayer. Cymbala uses quotes from various past religious greats and stories found in the lives of his own congregation to make his point. Revival only comes through prayer. Right on, Brother Cymbala!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prayer Power in Action","review":"To say this is a gripping and inspirational book fails to do it justice. From the stiring testimonials of God's power working through the lives of those touched by the Brooklyn Tabernacle to the accounts of God's marvelous acts from the pages of holy Scripture, Jim Cymbala's book is a masterpiece.

Card-counting, blackjack, arbitrage (eg. potential acquisitions, warrants, options) were all covered, and some interesting approaches to maximizing return vs. risk were addressed.Nonetheless the book was a trial to read - full of sideline ventures of minimal value, superficial/non-lucid explanations of complex concepts, and likely of little or no value today. (Kelley's optimum \\"betting level\\" may have prevented Long-Term Capital Management from going broke, at the cost of FAR lower early returns - however, Poundstone did not explore that possibility).The material could have been much better covered in the format of a broader primer on mathematical approaches to investing, and providing data on the number of such investors able to consistently beat the market, and those who go broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

The Kelly Criterion applies to all variants of investments (gambling, stock market, horse racing, etc). This book explains the history of the Kelly Criterion and academic misunderstanding of it.The only problem with the book is that it did not explore the daily applications of the Kelly formula. Many readers would finish the book and ask: So how do I use this? The book also fail to explain how to adapt the Kelly concept to situations with multiple outcome states rather than only Win or Lose.

I got the original Actionsampler a few years ago, and always wanted to shoot it indoors. Alas, all of my attempts came out pretty grainy and dark.Enter the Actionsampler Flash. I've been basically married to this buzzing little thing - it's awesome! The mechanics are smoother and the images are a lot sharper then the original Actionsampler. And, the four-step flash is great - it's fast as lighting and surprisingly strong. This item is really dope at a concert or party.A few suggestions for prospective buyers...1. Definitely buy this over the original Actionsampler. It's like night and day.2. Use 400 or 800 speed film - that shutter moves fast, and anything slower might blur your images (unless you like that).3. WAIT for the flash to charge fully and the ready light to come on. It can take about 12 seconds or so. If you fire before the flash is recycled, then one element might not flash and you'll get a black frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 to 4 shots and thats it","review":"A friend bought me this and I don't actually know how it really works.

So I thought it was automatic.I sent the film to wash and only 3-4 shots are good (and they're all indoor shots!). I load a new film to my camera again and try one shot indoor.

I read this book in one day and can't wait to read the two follow-up books.Linda Lael Miller has a wonderful way of creating believable, likeable characters that are not completely perfect. Isn't that what people are really like?? The two lead characters of Jesse McKettrick and Cheyenne have a sexual chemistry that is absolutely palpable from chapter one until the end of the book. This is a couple that you will really love and want to see together. There are only two love scenes in this book, but they are Hot! This book is very strong on plot-line and character development.

It was very scientific with a few personal observations scattered through the rather brief book that was presented.

I must say, though, that as I chronologically followed his life I became sadder as I knew how it ended.

Bottom line: not for migrating data from a small drive to larger one, especially if the drive is your bootable.At this point, I don't trust Ghost with my data, even if it did pull through the migration.

All you have to do is send in the original disk and your receipt to get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norton Ghost 9.0 - A dangerous weapon","review":"Hosed the OS on both my machines. It seemed perfect at first -- the app said I had created images, written to an external HD...no problem. Then when I go to restore the images, after what looks to be a seamless restore process, my computer is DEAD. Can't find system files, keyboard failure, etc. I feel sorry for anyone who uses this product, expecting it to do what it is supposed to do. It simply is a dangerous application that does not work -- and it will nuke your system. Not even worth one star on the rating level. I wish I could give it a negative -5 star rating to overcome the obvious shills who write positive reviews on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"making a backup destroyed my disk","review":"While creating a backup, it destroyed my disk. This is the worst behavior I can imagine.Creating the backup, it froze. Then, it would not boot Windows. Ghost had put its own boot blocks on the disk, build another partition, wrote itself into that partition, and would not boot windows. You could boot to Ghost, but it would just freeze or fail in booting windows.In the end, I had to format and rebuild the disk ...(Windows repair did not work. The system would not boot after repair, and repair did extensive damage.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"It hung my XP machine shortly after installation. Luckily, I was able to un-install it and get my machine back without too much heartache. I then ordered and am now using Acronis' True Image, which works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norton product without the typical Norton quality","review":"Peter Norton's organization is becoming more and more like Micro$oft every day. They bought PowerQuest and simply re-branded it. This used to be DriveImage, and what's funny is that when it was a PowerQuest package it seemed to work. I would HIGHLY recommend Acronis True Image instead of this piece of junk. Symantec (Norton) should focus on Utilities and things they are good at, not buying other companies and screwing up what they USED to do RIGHT."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"Gee, I wish I had read the other Amazon reviews before I downloaded this instead of having to learn firsthand. The worst thing about it isn't it not working, it's Symantec trying to charge you $50 to tell you how to get it to work. Their online documentation on the product is rubbish, their marketing is good though. Final verdict: It is trash, DO NOT BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I made the mistake of buying this product for backing up my hard disk on to CD's. I have an external cd writer, with which I've burned hundreds of CD's. Never a problem, with various programs. Until Norton. Norton never gets it right, crashing at various stages of the burn process, messing up my system in the process, even though my cd writer is listed in their \\"supported products\\" list. There's no free support for the product other than an on-line knowledge base. I tried everything they had written in their knowldege base, to no avail. So I get nothing for my money. Hey Norton/Symantec, it's called stealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Frustrating Waste of Time and Money","review":"I bought a larger HD and wanted to replace my current C drive with the new, larger drive. I spent several days attempting to copy all my files (including OS) from old drive to new using Norton Ghost 9.0. I followed the instructions, and I studied the manual, but I just couldn't make it work. I figured, \\"Well, you are just doing somethng wrong. Surely the product must work!\\" Then, when I had almost given up, I checked the web to see if others had been having problems. They have!! Now I know it's not me but the product. Don't use this product. You'll probably just waste your time and money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Norton product ever.","review":"After installing Norton Ghost 9 my system completely hosed up.

This product has been a complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowed My System Down To A Crawl. Stay away!!!","review":"I'll keep this short and sweet since most reviews already pointed out most faults in this junky piece of software.After installing Norton Ghost on my Windows XP machine, the system startup time increased by 5-8 minutes. The desktop would simply freeze when you turn on the PC, then, after some time, the ghost icon would appear and the rest of the system would come alive.The documentation/support is terrible. A classic case of company pinching in every penny by outsourcing their programming talent and support professionals while losing on quality control in the process.Look elsewhere for a backup solution. I use the Windows XP backup tool (Accessories => System Tools) which may not have as many features as Ghost claims to have, but at least it works!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy it","review":"I bought Ghost after my disk drive in my Dell computer began to fail. I followed Symantec's instructions 3 times to image a bootable new drive with no avail. Files were copied, but the drive would not boot. Finally, I got a free software download from the manufacturer of the new drive (Western Digital)and it worked fine. After booting up with the new drive, all programs worked except, you guessed it, all of Norton's stuff, the antivirus, internet security, etc... The kicker is that their suggestion was now to uninstall their software and re-install it again. But the software would not uninstall (including Ghost). The funny part is that their site recommends uninstalling all their software before doing a migration, including Gohst! In other words, you are supposed to uninstall Ghost before you use it to create the new disk. Duh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made the situation MUCH worse!","review":"I \\"used\\" this software on two entirely different computers. The first was an old Win98FE system. I used the included Ghost 2003 as the manual said to do. The software created a conflict with an I/O PCI device and after HOURS of beating my head against a wall, finally uninstalled Ghost and all was well again.The second machine was a newer WinXP thus I installed Ghost 9.0. No luck here again. The software somehow screwed up two license server programs to the point neither of the corresponding programs would run OR EVEN reinstall! EVEN after I uninstalled Ghost 9.0! To make a long story short, I reformatted the HDD and reinstalled everything EXCEPT Norton Ghost. At least I'm back up and running.I am very disappointed in Norton Ghost. I wasted a few days of my time fixing problems I didn't have before Norton Ghost. Surely there is better disk cloning software out there.

Stay away from Symantec."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost 9.0 is really a Ghost","review":"I have never had a product perform as badly as this one has - it simply is a very slow process, it doesn't deliver an image that is complete or actually makes a boot image as promised. I want to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great program - IF you're into the Blue Screen of Death!","review":"Installed this on my laptop and it worked great until I had to use the Recovery Disc to restore a backup from DVD. Ghost recorded the DVD using multiple sessions and the Recovery Disc could only read the 1st session; pretty lowsy glitch. Fortunately I had a spare PC to re-record the DVD using single session - albeit manually. Other problem I had with this is that on my main computer in Windows XP SP2, it would always give a BSOD crash every time I tried to use it. The low-level driver wasn't cooperating - even after I removed everything else I could think of. Bottom line: this is NOT worth the money. The features are great and it has potential - but only when it works. I'm going to try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't work","review":"After purchasing and installing Ghost, I was able to make the first backup, but subsequent backups won't work after installing the latest upgrade to XP. You will find hundreds of complaints about the same inability of this software to work with the latest version of XP.

Its now been 5+ days and nothing. I assume they will never respond. You have to pay to call.

Track 3, \\"Trio,\\" is so reminscent of Patton's work on Adult Themes For Voice as well as several of his John Zorn collaborations its not even funny. Also like Patton she can actually sing when she wants to which is demonstrated on \\"Vacuum\\" and a few other tracks.The electronics on the album are cut-up, glitchy sound collages, conjuring up images of James Plotkin and Negativland as well as dark, surreal ambient/noise moments reminiscent of Nurse With Wound, Hafler Trio and Philip Jeck.Overall this is a must for fans of truly bizarre performance art as well as abstract noise soundscapes.

Well... take a look for yourself. It is terrific to see Stan and Babe in new situations and surroundings. I like these films because, like many of the 20th Century Fox films of the period, they are a great slice of life during World War Two. These films were money makers for Fox... the public really liked them on their original release.So, if you like Laurel and Hardy and have never seen these films, it's like a surprise visit from two beloved friends.On the technical end: The extras and the commentary are great.

It details his struggles to find meaningful work and his ultimate vocation- writing for comics. Where it succeeds is when it shows his early struggles and insecurities and illustrates how difficult it was for even an acclaimed writer to get his start. The pacing is fairly slow and the narrative is just as winding and directionless as his early path in life was. This doesn't detract from the work, but rather had me reading on eagerly, wondering how he was going to screw up next.The artwork didn't blow me away- it felt pretty cliche, like something you'd see in one of those bible tracts.Hardcore Pekar fans will love the additional insight into the mind of this talented writer. Even casual fans will find this volume moderately enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrait of the artist as a young man","review":"This is another autobiographical comic book by Harvey Pekar. This time, he writes about his childhood up to his young adulthood. He has written about this in the past, but never this extensively before. The title of the book refers to himself, because when he was a young man he would quit anything that didn't come easy to him. He had an inferiority complex, which he tried to compensate for by being \\"great\\" at things. If he didn't do as well as he hoped, he would lose confidence and give up. I could tell you more, but it's better to just read the book and find out for yourself. Oh, I mustn't neglect to mention the great black and white artwork by Dean Haspiel.

I have a finger chart and I am learning my base clef now and I can easily sit and play for an hour at least.

The notes on most of the songs do not go off the staffs, which I really appreciate as I am relearning and reconditioning my fingers to play. I keep finding new little gems as I flip through the book. I liked it so much I got one for my sister for Christmas this year - she has four children under ten who will love these. If you have had a couple of years of lessons, you will enjoy these songs with a little work, and if you are really proficient, you will enjoy the songs after a few times playing them. I mean, who can resist the Brady Bunch theme?I am using the songs to break up the frustration of trying to tackle one harder song in another book.

The climax of the film is very exciting, and so touching that it brings tears to the eyes. I won't give it away as to not spoil it. Great news, this film is finally being released in November 2005 along with the original \\"King Kong\\" and \\"Son of Kong\\" as a special collection.

The main points are simple and logical, though it takes someone to remind us of this to help keep us from making our efforts excessively complex (the \\"more is better\\" philosophy). This book reminds me of \\"The Abilene Paradox\\" by Jerry Harvey in it's simplicity and power. Because I can see application in each of their chosen careers (because they all have to formulate and \\"sell\\" an idea), I have given copies of this book to my three adult sons.

The book doesn't provide any insight into how to develop innovative or creative ideas (nor does it claim to). Instead, the book focuses on how to better communicate the ideas we have so that they are memorable and lasting in the minds of our audience. This is not a trivial point. Even the most charismatic speakers wielding the greatest of ideas may fail in their effort to make these ideas stick. Revolutionary ideas do not speak for themselves. We must still communicating them in such a way that they will have an impact during and after their presentation. Made to Stick provides an excellent road map for doing so.

Well the myth is that all saturated fats are bad for you - actually only partially hydrogenated and trans fats are bad. Coconut oil is actually probably the *BEST* kind of oil to make popcorn in because it doesnt break down in high heat. They did a study in the 1950's where they tried to fatten up livestock by feeding them cheap coconut oil. The opposite happened - the cattle actually became leaner and healthier. Also Vincent Price did famous research in the 1930's where he studied indigenous Pacific Islanders whose main staple was coconut oil - something like 40% of their diet.

Made to Stick investigates case studies from business, teaching, advertising and sports throughout the book while discussing concepts such as Gap Theory, to demonstrate how certain ideas inspire attention and interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge \\"SUCCES\\"","review":"This is a complement book for The Back of the Napkin,You have to read this first then polish it with the Back of the Napkin,Rich of great examples,,But if only there are few pictures to back it up..I loved the book, the first three chapters were the most interseting ones, the emotional was little foggythe story good.This book just establishes a new way of thinking. Now whenever I want to speak I try to inject those factorsto my idea,but I find it a bit difficult apply.. Maybe we need more examples?One more thing, Heth brothers are talking about the Curse of Knowledge in the book, however personally Ithink that they have this syndrom also in their very own book.1/3 of the book is too \\"abstracted\\" and written in a very generic way that is difficult to get.But overall , I will give it a four.nice job guys"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for Success","review":"\\"Made to Stick\\" is one of those rare books that just makes you look at everything you write in a fresh light. After reading it, I went and immediately rewrote several fundraising documents on which I had been working. The authors give you a method to cut through the muck and present your case in the most persuasive way. I'm going to have everyone in my department read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovation Manager","review":"The book delivered on its claims. These concepts can be applied to selling a new idea, product or service both internally and externally. For a company that has very traditional marketing techniques it would be very helpful to pass this along to the marketing and communications staff so that they can shift their paradigms and embrace these concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its true and it work","review":"I bought the book before my presentation, I work in the cement industry= boring.

This was filled with interesting stories and anecdotes and was a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books on how to effectively communicate","review":"This book is the best I have read at teaching you how to say something so it can be remembered. It doesn't matter how great the information is that you have, if when you tell others, they will not remember it. It is a must read for anyone serious about business, marketing, advertising, management, and just being an effective communicator. The authors bring very unique and valuable perspectives to this book, and it delivers everything and more that it claims to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight forward and unpretentious","review":"Well written and full of humor, this book was helpful and easy to read. The authors admit that their concepts are simple, but provide plenty of examples to demonstrate that even the most common sense ideas are easy to lose in the messiness of everyday life. I can't think of a single person who wouldn't benefit from these ideas, and highly recommend reading this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Handbook for Anyone Selling Ideas","review":"The brothers Heath have synthesized for us a methodology in which people such as marketeers, engineers and imagineers can get their ideas communicated in a very effective manner. Their formula or telling STORIES in a certain way is a sure fire method to capture almost anyone's attention. It's gotta be SIMPLE and UNEXPECTED.. you start to get them hooked then complete loop with CONCRETENESS - CREDIBILITY & EMOTION.If you've got to sell something important to your boss or spouce (or both) read this book first. Perhaps it's best to carry a highlighter. It will be a fun read... I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant. Five Stars","review":"Try this - Read the introduction and the first chapter and tell a friend what the book is about. If you're anything like me, you'll realize that you've miraculously absorbed virtually every \\"sticky\\" example given along with the reasoning and methodology, without even thinking about it. The book practices its own preaching, making it not only everything you'd hope for in a book of this nature, but living proof that it works. Its very form supports its message, all the way down to the fluorescent orange, textured cover. Absolutely LOVED it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all types of business","review":"Having spent the last 15 years of my life trying to help clients make their ideas stick, I'm delighted to have this wonderful manual full of concrete, sticky, real-life examples. I plan to make every one of my team read this book. Perfect for those in advertising, PR, marketing, product development, and more. A wonderful addition to any business library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable insights for marketers, advertisers and sellers","review":"With an entertaining blend of case studies and startling research, the Heath brothers lay out the critical elements of a sticky idea. They are--1. Simplicity2. Unexpectedness3. Concreteness4. Credibility5. Emotions6. StoriesAs you might expect, the authors use these techniques to drive home their point. For example, in the chapter on stories, they talk about Subway's Jared campaign--quite a dramatic behind-the-scenes story besides being a near perfect example of storytelling in marketing.Although these six elements seem like common sense, they are woefully underapplied in business communication. The authors state it well--\\"Business managers seem to believe that, once they've clicked through a PowerPoint presentation showcasing their conclusions, they've successfully communicated their ideas. What they've done is share data.\\"Well researched, easy to read and hard to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! One of my favorite books of all time!","review":"This is now one of my favorite books of all time. If you liked The Tipping Point and/or Blink, you'll love this one!

The authors take a lot of other information from other books and have summed it up well...kind of like where Time-Life books takes all the hits from the 70's so you don't have to buy the individual cd's. I'd recommend for just about anybody due to it's relevance in society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version NOT the current version","review":"An important note for potential Kindle version purchasers: as of mid-July 2009 the Kindle version of \\"Made to Stick\\" is not the 'current' 2008 version of the book but the original 2007 version. Thus a new chapter in the back of the book is missing from the Kindle version. Now...let me be perfectly clear...I am loving this book so far and can confidently tell you the CONTENTS merit at least 4.5 stars. The first bona fide chapter alone is worth the price of admission. My paltry granting of stars is strictly based on my comments about the KINDLE VERSION. My advice: Buy the book in hardcover form. Yes, I bought, returned, and then repurchased the Kindle version. But this is strictly so I can validate for my wife that I'm using the $300 \\"investment\\" I just made in the Kindle itself. And I'll go back to the hardcopy version to read the added verbiage. Save yourself the trouble and buy the hardcopy version."},{"rating":"2","title":"the book is written wih the same method that preaches and it works","review":"Stories that gets the reader's attention and through this method explains everything that is needed to get ideas stick. I wanted this book so badly because I have so many ideas but I needed something to make those ideas call people's attention. The method and tools that uses (story telling) seems to be working because all the stories that the author mentions I'm checking out on Internet and I read further about them and tell everyone. It's a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get 'stuck' into this","review":"A great book that helps you understand how to deliver meaningful messages in a way that they 'stick' in people's mind. The books is easy to read and contains not only plenty of examples but also an excellent process of how you should go about crafting your message.In an age where we are bombarded with continual advertising the book examines exacts what is retained. It examines in details not only what 'sticks' but why it is so. Any business would greatly benefit from the messages here and surprisingly, they are not all that difficult.If you are looking to get a message across and have it not only be successfully received but also retained then this book is for you. It not provides a wealth of examples but an easy to follow process to ensure your message has the greatest chance of success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"The Max books spark the imagination with a captivating tale while sneakily teaching science at the same time!

This book is definietly for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before 'The Office'","review":"If you think you're cool because you were into the Britcom 'The Office' before the American version aired, you've got to check out 'The Newsroom' which is its Canadian predecessor. Ricky Gervais rocks but Ken Finkleman taught him how to do it- well not really but you know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coverage of JDK 1.3 client and server topics","review":"I got this book after I read a positive review of it on Java Ranch and I wasn't disappointed. I was mostly interested in the chapters on i18n and XML, and those chapters alone would have made this book worth the money, but I found a lot more useful stuff that I didn't even expect to. I was already kind of familiar with threading having read some other materials on the topic but still found Brett's chapter to be clear and succinct. I like the fact that he minimizes the jargon and clearly explains terms that aren't necessarily obvious to someone like me at a beginner to intermediate level of expertise. I also like the fact that the code segments were short and only contained code relevant to the topic being discussed. The code examples in a lot of books are long and full of code that's not related to the topic, which makes it harder to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate reference for advanced Java topics","review":"Despite covering advanced topics, this book is surprisingly clear and easy to read. You won't find any lengthy, irrelevant ramblings about the history of this or that or anecdotes about the author's pet in Professional Java Programming -- it gets to the point and covers the topics thoroughly. Another thing I liked is that unlike a lot of programming books these days, this one is written by a single author, which means that there's little or no duplication of information and the writing is consistent throughout the book. That's not to say that this is a title that you'll want to read from cover to cover, but it does provide terrific information on lots of topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"KIDS JOKE BOOKS","review":"This a perfect book for the child who is starting out telling silly jokes.

I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Large Sized Bag is NOT approved by MANY airlines.","review":"The appellation \\"airline approved\\" for this bag is misleading insofar as many airlines will not accept this bag because its dimensions exceed requirements, for example, Jet Blue. I do bear some responsibility for my error, as I ordered this in haste thinking it would be \\"airline approved\\". I am giving this one star, to punish Sherpa for its misleading representations, because though they do warn people to check with their airline, they have the name \\"airline approved\\" in the name of the product which can be reasonably foreseen to mislead some people into thinking that all airlines approve of it, while the reality is perhaps only some do. Indeed, when one goes to Sherpa's website, one is informed that the large sized carrier, which is what this one is, is not accepted by airlines. It states: \\"(*Please note, based on written guidelines, Southwest Airlines accepts carriers only in small; all other airlines accept only small and medium sizes).\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely 18 inches long","review":"I opened this package and was shocked at how small this \\"large\\" bag is. I placed a yardstick next to it and it measured just under 18 inches long. The product description and box say 20 inches. Also, the opening on top is very small -- I did not even attempt to fit my large tuxedo cat in here -- this is a rip off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect onboard Pet Carrier","review":"We used this carrier for our mini-Schnauzer on 4 flights between Fl. and Tx.

I looked at all the pet stores and all over Amazon to find a good bag that would fit the requirements for air travel. This bag was perfect. I flew on American and the plane was and S-80 and the bag fit perfectly under the seat in front of me. My 11 lbs. Chiweenie had plent of room to stand up, turn around, and lay down (which was one of the requirements of the airlines). I was worried about the quality of the mess sides. I had read in previous reviews that some dogs tore through the sides. My dog was scratching a lot when you first put him in the bag, but it withstood the whole trip. I look forward to using this bag again if I make any travel arrangements with my dog. I highly recommend this bag for those traveling with small dogs under 16 lbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for airline and auto travel","review":"Love the size, the material and fabrication are of good quality, and the modern color combinations work for me.

I bought a large and I am planning on flying with my dog in this bag. I own a black medium sized one but I think she will be more comfortable in this one, because it is bigger. I like the material and she loves going in the bag which makes me happy. The bottom is very nice and fluffy so she lies comfortably. The only reason I gave four stars is that the bag is a little uncomfortable to carry and is heavy with a dog in it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY!","review":"We have a 6 month old puppy. On our return flight on the way to the airport, the zipper broke and we pinned it shut. Thought we might get turned down by TSA for all the safety pins holding the top shut.

It's not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for airplanes - but could be too big","review":"This is a well-made carrier, and is the biggest one I could find that was suitable for in-cabin airplane travel. It's actually 1-2 inches too tall to fit under the seat on a 737, but because it is flexible you can make it fit. Be aware that the size doesn't meet the letter of the law for most airlines, so you may get stopped. However, this has only happened to me a couple of times, and both times I was able to talk my way out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"much less travel anxiety","review":"During my recent job change/relocation I moved six cats, and the Sherpa Bag was invaluable.

If you need to transport your cats this is the bag for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's FAVORITE book","review":"My 1 1/2 year old son gave this to his dad for Father's Day this year. He absolutely LOVES to read this with him and brings it over to him to read every night for story time. It's got a very simple story line which helps to keep him engaged and I was amazed to see how he really seems to understand the plot. He makes a surprised face when the bear turns around to see that all of his friends are gone and acts scared when the bear is scared of the noises. He yells with joy at the end when the daddy bear comes to find him. He even likes to point out the small picture of the daddy and son on the back flap of the book. Our son knows the title of this book (will pick it out when we tell him to bring us \\"My Dad\\"). Reading this book with him has been a wonderfully educational and bonding experience for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manage an Organization as Nature Would ...","review":"... with the neither malice nor pity. That's the gist of this excellent book, and it's not offensive to the concept of human dignity. To the contrary, Dr. Smart notes that \\"A players\\" can (and should) exist at every level. Every CEO, every acountant, every sales rep, and every Wal-Mart greeter should be best in class -- and they should be required to stay competitive in their skills. That's not ruthless. That's natural. But this book goes one step farther, making the compelling case that -- left to their own devices -- the \\"C players\\" in any organization will destroy value over time, whether they intend to or not. Accordingly, Topgrading is essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"The #1 source for world-class hiring and coaching processes","review":"As an HR consultant and executive coach, Topgrading is my bible.

The book is focused on techniques for evaluating and hiring employees, with a focus on topgrading... a process for constantly improving the quality of the team you have to construct a team of A players... where A is for the job and the salary. It talks about how to analyze employees to understand whether they are an A, B or C. It also focuses heavily on how to interview people to determine whether they are indeed an A player.The book has a number of charts and guides in it that I found to be quite useful, and I enjoyed the various case studies it goes through. Sometimes I found the pushing of the author's interview technique to be a bit much, and sometimes the book is a bit wordy, but altogether an interesting read and one I will have a few other folks in my company go through.It definitely has some techniques and advice i will put to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Professional Recruiter's Handbook!","review":"I recently started to read this book at the urging of my mentor.

I think the writer trys to project, or accredit, all or too much of the accomplishments of the companies in his book to his hiring approach. Also the writer seems to spent a lot of time, pumping topgrading. After a while I got sick of hearing the word Topgrading over and over throughout the book. All that is here are some very sound hiring practices, nothing unique or earth shattering.Hiring A players without the proper culture first, is a waste of time.

The author doesn't bother to define what defines a top performer and the qualities they exhibit. He uses generalizations and draws conclusions without supporting arguments.

It appealed to my love of things medieval...to my enjoyment of fantasy...and a desire to be taken to another time another world. The author has mixed lovable characters with strong heroes...memorable women and evil villians with skill. There was one foot in reality so that a reader could immerse themself with conviction.

What I got was a string of primary documents connected by useless one to five page historical introductions. I have no qualms about presenting primary evidence, but to simply present it without any analysis or historical commentary is crimminal. I can't imagine what segment of the book market would find this useful. High schoolers need basic historical explanation alongside primary documents. College students need analytic meat. And experts would have no use for such a simple collection of primary material. My only consolation is that I found this used -the new price is scandalous.

I only liked three songs. Now, as the album and I have gotten older, I like most of the songs. The title hit is a great slow burner and should have been a bigger hit. \\"Culture Shock\\" would have made a better single than \\"Toughen Up\\" not to mention a great concept video.

I think Olivia was trying to follow up the subtle sexual innuendo of Physical with some obvious sexual themes! While this may not be her best, I think Emotional Tangle and Moth to a Flame are pretty great, and I think Right Moment is one of her best songs and worth the price of the CD! However, if you are looking for \\"classic\\" Olivia, you'll probably like some of the Greatest Hits collections better, like the two Greatest Hits albums, Back to Basics and One Woman's Live Journey is a great live concert CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Livvy Tries to be Queen of Kink (AND FAILS!!)","review":"This (as another reviewer said) proved to be ONJ's kiss of death to her career.

(there's a reason why singers reject songs and 99% of the time they are right). Culture shock is well..Downright stupid. Queen of the Publication is \\"Well what is it??\\" The only stand out is \\"The Right Moment.\\" \\"Moth to a Flame\\" is minor hit single material and \\"Overnight Observation\\" is fun but that's it.ONJ tried to be sexy and kinky but couldn't pull it off.

I also enjoy the return to Grease duet with the late Carl Wilson, \\"You Were Great, How Was I?\\" which should be included in future productions of \\"Grease\\" as it fits right in and has a great melody.

It is a VERY SEXY song!!!! and says far more than any trically love ballad. I listen to it all the time and that is why I am giving this album four stars. I agree with the previous reviewer the mix is also fantastic. My second favorite song by her is \\"I Need Love\\". Another very hot and sexy song!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Polished Song with No Soul","review":"Contrary to popular beliefs (as evidenced by the people who'd reviewed this track), this song does absolutely nothing for me at all. In fact, it really grates on my nerves every time this song came on. First off, I have nothing against R Kelly, and in fact, am quite a fan of his work prior to this song. I personally feel that his previous single \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\" is much better and contains more soul than this single. In this song, R Kelly sounds like he's trying to do some vocal gymnastics (a la Mariah Carey) and he comes across as just plain irritating. In fact, one other song that's much better came out during about the time 'Turn' was released, and that's Brian McKnight's 'Back At One'. 'Back' is a much simpler song that come across much more sincere than 'Turn'. But I have to admit one thing, the MTV was pretty cool with its use of special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this song is wonderful!.","review":"This song is just great because it is mine and my boyfriends song and it is just so sweet.

It worked, but the signal was weak on one side of the house and it didn't work at all in one of the kids' rooms. We cabled the wireless access point to the router and put it on the other side of the basement. It worked great. One issue: all devices on the network need to have the same SSID, which was not the same out of the box. Also, the second access point should be on a different frequency (default was 11, and it was 6 on the router, so we just left this alone).

It smelled terrible, nothing like the scent I know it to be, which is an oriental vanilla. This smells like I'm wearing an ashtray.The Casmir that I received from Amazon was supposed to be new, however I don't believe mine was. It was not covered in plastic wrap, and it looked like some of the perfume was used, besides the point of it smelling horrible.I had read negative reviews on Amazon about this perfume being fake or bad. I noticed on Amazon's website that it is advertised as a new arrival, so I thought that perhaps Amazon has taken care of this matter. Well, let me just say it is not the real Casmir by Chopard. The real Casmir smells wonderful. My advice if you would like to purchase this perfume, is to get it elsewhere. I have ordered other perfumes from Amazon, and this is the first time I've experience this issue. So hopefully this will not become a continual problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my Chopard Casmir","review":"I had recently run out of my long time favorite Casmir and ordered it at Amazon. The perfume had turned. It has a strong acrid smell not even remotely associated with Casmir. Then, I found out that Amazon does not honor returns on liquids.

Beware before ordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fragrance seems to have changed?","review":"I have been wearing Casmir by Chopard for over 15 years.

This perfume is not long lasting and it doesn't have as much vanilla in it as before.

Before I read the book I only knew Morrison through his music, which was inspired and fun to listen to.After reading the book Morrison emerges as a moody, brooding, petulant jerk/drunk/druggie who mistreated and used friends, girlfriends, acquinatances and associates.Hope you weren't expecting a happy review. The Jim Morrison of this book is a mental case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Photos, Zilch Insight","review":"If you want any kind of insight into the mind of Jim Morrison, read his interview with Lizzie James. In fact, read any interview with the man himself. Let him speak for himself. It's not as if he isn't articulate enough. These two-bit hacks can't get anywhere near the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get out of this one with any Morrison insight","review":"The insight into Jim Morrison in \\"No One Here Gets Out Alive\\" is as shallow as Grandma's pool. It consists of a couple of rock star cliches: Morrison gets drunk a lot, has fun with his groupies, and uses more drugs than Marion Barry.Even if we give the authors plaudits for stating these obvious Mojo facts, there is no cogent analysis into why an arguably brilliant mind has such a pattern of self-destruction. Maybe there isn't a brilliant answer to why Mojo read Rimbaud, Balzac, and wrote poetry, but the authors should tell that to us. Don't just trot out literary legends to satisfy your \\"personal belief that Jim Morrison was a god.\\"Two stars. Not a total waste of money if you're interested in some hangers-on writing down their prayers at Morrison's altar, but if you've got somethin' for history, you won't get out of this one alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLY WRITTEN WITH A ONE-SIDED VIEW","review":"I didn't like this book at all - I'm sorry I purchased it, let alone read it. Jerry Hopkins interviewed Jim Morrison on a few occasions and Danny Sugarman worked at a menial job in the office of the Doors. Does this warrant writing a book about Jim Morrison?To my mind, Hopkins is infatuated with Jim and Sugarman is a Jim Morrison wanna-be who practically worships the man. There is no new material here; it's rather dry and boring. I suggest skipping this book and reading others, such as \\"Light My Fire\\" by Ray Manzarek, \\"Riders on the Storm\\" by John Densmore, and \\"Strange Days\\" by Patricia Kennealy. Also check out \\"The Ultimate Doors Companion\\" - intelligently written with various perspectives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel. Poorly written.","review":"When I look at the Doors and Jim Morrison I see some of the most physicadelic people on Earth. Reading this novel truly gave me an insight on Morrison's mind, from his childhood to his demise. Reading this I learned how he was thought of as a hero by the public and a drunken frat-boy by his friends and bandmates. I loved this novel and I loved learning of the life of Jim Morrison.However, this is not an amazingly written novel. You see, The Doors made amazing music; Hopkins and Sugerman do not make the most suffisticated novels. For instance, one of Morrison's acid trips on stage will be described at the beggining of a paragraph and then a night on the town with his soul mate a month later will be described at the end.Reading NO ONE GETS OUT ALIVE is truly a stimulating experience. That is , if you can get past these written mistakes. I sugget you buy this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence in Research of the Lizard King","review":"I wanted to write a little note to say that I thought it is one of the best biography I have ever read.

She's reading it now and she loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Arrow Flies: This is the Essential Morrison","review":"Co-written by someone who knew Jim, the Sugarman-Hopkins bio does not escape idol worship of Morrison. Despite its flaws, it makes for a great primer on Jim Morrison and the Doors, capturing his trajectory from his awkward childhood, to poet, intellectual, drug user/experimentor, to rock star, to angry drunk and abuser. Morrison is a complex character, perhaps more interesting, introspective, well read and intelligent than any popular muscian has been since.Recognizing Morrison's Nietzschian influence, Sugarman-Hopkins capture Morrison as the personification of Nietzshe's Dionysus. Their thesis is compelling and obviously an influence of Oliver Stone's filmography.For those interested in the Doors or American Pop Music Culture, I throughly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fawning Portrait of a Big Jerk","review":"I don't care how good his music may be, this guy was just evil. Though it's not a bad biography as biographies go, the subject matter of this self-pitying, out-of-control, attempted-murderer rock star dude is just not very important or interesting. Maybe if it had been packaged as fiction, I could be more forgiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"An entertaining Waste of time","review":"I first read this book when I was fourteen. At that time I was the intended audience. While it is full of facts, it completely lacks any insight. All attempts at understanding the inspiration behind Jim Morrison's behavior were totally sophmoric. This is definitely a book that was written to sell copies by glorifying his excess. Like the movie, it is thoughtless and shows no understanding of its' subject. It damages the memory of a very human figure. The writing is callow and the man it portrays is an immature person's(read the writers) fantasy of what it would be like to be a sybaratic rock star. If you are really interested in some insight into the man, read his writings. If you want to get a personal sense of this creative force, whose life was really a tragedy, read Patricia Kennealy's Strange Days: My life with and without Jim Morrison. You'll get a lot more humanity for your buck. Paying for this book is like buying a Jim Morrison slurpee cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"I heart JIM","review":"I loved this book!

This burner installed with little effort and performed great. The way it's constructed it'll probably be the last burner in this grill -- it may outlast the grill.The only problem I had in the installation was solved easily and quickly. The way the tubes are constructed on the burner they would not bend to the angle of the ventura on the valve bank. The valves on my Sunbeam grill bent slightly down and there was no way to bend the tube on the burner so it would hook up. The solution was to remove the valve , disassemble it and reassemble switching sides with the venturas so that they bent slightly up instead of down. Everything worked great then and the fix took about 5 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent insight into Dominican society.","review":"I just spent a short time with a Church mission in a small Dominican community.

On the plus side he also show the engaging personalities of so many people and their ability to live in a civil fashion despite the poverty. My one criticism might be the abstract terminology that the author uses to link the events and people he observes to world systems theory. It does not quite work and gets in the way of an otherwise excellent characterization of Dominican society.

Many of the former members now belonging to the Edmonton, Calgary, and Saskatoon Chapters of the Hells Angels MC.The book is slow to read, and overly analytical. It was originally the author's thesis, so, unless you're a sociology or anthropology student, you'll get bored. Read Sonny's book, its more real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sports betting info and history.","review":"I agree. This book is the definitive sports betting thing. I read the whole book straight through. Great for netheads and sports freaks and all degenerates who love to gamble or want to know about this funky world. There is the critical stuff in here, but it's well founded and well presented. I don't know who Unc Mahony is but I want to put my money with him. Great on Vegas, the ponies, and lotteries ---and gambling on the Net. I was fascinated. Nuff said. The book rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is where the action is. Best gambling book I've read.","review":"Yeah, this has the usual crud about some of the evils of gambling but man this is a great book. I live in Vegas and bet sports constantly. I should hate the book, but it is fantastic. The sports betting chapter is the best I've ever read on this world I inhabit. There is incredible detail and the writing is gripping (I think I know who Unc Mahony is). Does anybody else know who Unc Mahony is? Anybody into sports betting or gambling on the Net should pick this book up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well researched, informative and entertaining","review":"O'Brien has written a masterful perspective on what much of America has done and will do for the chance to profit quickly on a wager. I had no earthly idea how much the essence of this thrill has shaped our very culture. Each chapter could be a prime time mini-series in itself and O'Brien's diverse collection of heavy hitter sources would make even Barbara Walters envious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare inside insights","review":"It may not be apparent to some readers, but getting inside the head -- even getting access to -- a poker player of Chip Reese's stature is freakin' difficult. The stuff in this book on Reese is rare, a treasure to read, and a compelling profile. O'Brien did some unbelievable digging here, matched with brilliant writing and analysis. Too bad the title of this tome is so horrendous...who thought that one up? A great book anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"If there's ever an award for \\"Most Boring Film Noir Ever Made,\\" this little stinker would be in strong contention. It is a miserable, plodding police procedural with essentially nothing to recommend it. About the best you can say is that the last 15 minutes are marginally less dull than the rest. Edward G. Robinson is squandered. Set in Montreal, the film has all the French-Canadian flavor of Frank Sinatra singing \\"O Canada.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time potboiler","review":"what might have been a taut thriller is hampered by a meandering plot that sluggishly makes its way to a mawkish ending (Raft's calculating hood isn't such a bad guy after all). What little style and authority the film has is due to Robinson, a dynamic actor who is wasted in this film. If you are going to buy any of the MGM film noirs, get The Stranger or Woman in the Window, both with Robinson and both superior to this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bullet For Joey","review":"I was so glad to get a chance to watch Edward G.

When CBS began to run the series I was skeptical at first but by the first commercial break I was hooked. In my house MASH night was like church for twelve years my family (first my parents and I and then my wife and I) watched every single epsisode and the night the show finally concluded there wasn't a dry eye in the house.

At this rate it'll be 6 years before all the seasons are out on DVD! What's with the slow release plan?Regardless, I am very excited about this amazingly wonderful show being available for purchase. You would have had to have been living in a cave to not know about it, and whether you enjoyed the show or not, you still have to respect it's pioneering in the way of television. Each Season is better than the one before it as the charaters are further developed and made real. Season Five is when it starts to get the best for me, so I guess I'll write a review about that one... in about 3 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great......Again!","review":"When I was growing up MASH just didn't do it for me.

Since reruns have been shown, I faithfully record episodes to watch, and was delighted when they finally produced DVD copies. The M*A*S*H cast was pure magic - everthing from the comradery, the humor, the sarcasm, the sentiment - it is truly magic.

Best series that there ever was. I echo the speed of the releases and the lack of additional features. I, too, would also love to see outtakes, and bloopers. Obviously there are some because of the recent specials on TV. All negativity aside, if you even LIKE the series..you need to buy this and every DVD set that comes out. You will NOT be disappointed. I love this show and I enjoy it even more that there are deleted scenes that aren't shown on TV anymore. Some scenes that are absent change a lot of the storyline sometimes (not much but enough to round out the story).I will wait for entire series to be released but wish I had them all NOW!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very heavy....","review":"I ordered this with the idea of taking it to Europe to simplify the difference in electrical current but I found it to be very heavy and not travel friendly.

(The latop battery can handle up to 220-240V power, and only requires a plug adaptor, but I wanted to use the converter as a supplement/buffer for the battery, and it came in handy as a kind of short extension cord.) This converter is designed to support up to 200 watts, and I only needed 130 -- but it quit on me 4 days into a 4 month trip. It ran hot, but did not smell burned -- it simply stopped working after about 12 cumulative hours of use. Truly a waste of money. I recommend trying a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work for me","review":"I just worked for 2 hours for me. I bought to use it with my speaker system which is 80 watt so I though I wouldnt have problem with a 200 watt converter, It was working at first but the next day I realize that it is burned.

However, when I went to go and change its internal clock, I noticed that the bottom screen very quickly starts having rendering problems. After just a few moments the bottom screen was completely white, and while it responded to touch, nothing was visible.

Portable enough to fit in a handbag but too big for a pocket. And the games disks were too fragile for my liking.Enter the DS Lite. I've carried this thing everywhere with me, it's been robust, reliable and really really fun to use. Nintendo are once again at the top of the league and deservedly so. I'd reccommend the console to anyone who wanted some fun on the move. If I had to point out a few minor issues, the charger is only 120V so it won't work in Europe and apparantly I've heard that there are limitations on which regions yo can buy your games - but that's a small price to pay for such a great toy.

And the tone of each story was way too high up on the positives of home schooling while minimizing the negatives (if any- a messy house? being busy? that was about it) All these \\"families\\" were saved by homeschooling and now they love each other, are responsible, get along great, the kids love it, they're learning so much, etc. It also felt like I was reading Lisa's story over & over again because pieces of it kept getting woven into each story she created. It's worth two stars because it tells you the different styles of homeschooling. The few resources listed in the back could easily be found in other books worth owning (Top 100 Picks by Cathy Duffy- that one's great). I skimmed through this in a couple hours one night (couldn't stand the cheezy chapter openings- it's all way too contrived) & now it gets to go back to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"This was a great book with a variety of families who homeschool.

I heard Lisa on Dr. Dobsons radio show and asked the library to order it. I was so caught up in it, I couldn't put it down. If your questioning your teaching style; this book is for you. It takes you through the lives of 15 families, their struggles and their teaching styles. A wonderful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview","review":"This book gives a great view of 15 different homeschooling situations.

It gives a wide variety of examples of families who have made homeschooling work for their situation. I really liked that it is written in a conversational manner.

It has a lot of good ideas and shows how successful homeschooling can be for families."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Introduction to Homeschooling!","review":"This book was my introduction to homeschooling and it was great! It was informative, yet not dry. It's an easy, conversational read, but she slips in a ton of information. I couldn't put it down, I zoomed through it in a day or two. This book has encouraged me to homeschool my children. I've gone on to read another homeschooling book by Mary Griffith, but honestly, it's not as captivating as this book. If you are curious about homeschooling, read this book - it's a great intoduction. I plan on lending it out to my friends and family, so they will understand the concept of homeschooling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, but also informative","review":"I borrowed this book from the library and found it very informative on different kinds of homeschooling and different ways that \\"families\\" do it (even if they're not real families).

If you want to read stories from actual homeschoolers, check out \\"Homeschool Open House\\" by Nancy Lande or \\"Real Lives\\" by Grace Llewellyn.I give this book two stars instead of one because it's an interesting overview of types of homeschooling, but in no way is it a REAL look at homeschooling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, good customer support","review":"Battery started losing its capacity after few charges.After only 5-8 cycles, the battery was not charging more than 70-80% of its max capacity.I contacted Oncore support and they said the one I got was defective, so they replaced it at no charge (their customer support was very fast and nice).I got a new one but I haven't used enough to see if is going to have the same problem (but from the few tests performed, it doesn't seem much better)."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING to mac G5 owners! incompatiblity!","review":"warning! trying to use this as a pci card will NOT work with a G5, even though this is listed as mac compatible.

A good book. If you're interested in factual stories about African Hunting I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent stories, fair writer.","review":"The author has much to say, first hand experience with the subject that cannot be had from many sources.

Yeah, I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great look at East Africas professional white hunters","review":"Herne does a masterful job of encapsulating so much information, excitement and adventure into so small a space. Well researched, well written and well worth adding to a collection of African hunting or general Africana. Herne writes from personal recollection, personal experience and personal connection. The last line of his dissertation on Bill Judd is unforgettable. Sure wish I had a chance to sit around a hunting camp campfire with a sundowner and listen to Herne reminisce.The editorial review by Svenya Soldovieri bleeds through with the reviewers distaste for hunting and lack of understanding of conservation.

The people he interviews are excellent, however, to attack Evolution, one must attack the entire beast, not just one or two of its arms. The book is heavy into refuting biological Evolution and mentioning geological Evolution but ignoring the clear evidence that refutes cosmological evolution (i.e. Big Bang) is sad. It appears that the writer, like many of those he interviewed believe the cosmological lie! I would like to see Lee do another book and investigate the evidence for a Young earth, Young Universe, and all of the scientific evidence that supports both!One recommendation for future readers of this book (or listener's of the cd's)...read Strobel's other works as well; The Case for Christ, The Case for Easter, and The Case for Faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploiting the uncritical mind","review":"I had a really hard time getting through this book because of all of the logical fallacies. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it does the job that is was intended to do: evoke an emotional response. It makes me sad to think that this is considered \\"evidence\\" for a supernatural creator. One of my students recommended this book and I am going to recommend some better books to him. Read peer reviewed science publications."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read!","review":"This man has no concept of science or any basic understanding of its purpose. Science and religion are in two different realms. You cannot compare them or use one to prove the other is wrong.His writing resembles a dialog from an infomercial. It is childish and written for the uneducated.His basic \\"reasoning\\" is based on \\"science can't disprove god, therefore god exists\\". He equates \\"intelligent design\\" to his god. He doesn't explore other possibilities behind the existence of intelligence whatsoever.For those of you that gave this book 5 stars, I'd like to see a good explanation behind his reasoning, including explanation why there's only one god.Lee Strobel would have made a better argument stating repeatedly that his god exists because he feels it in his heart.If you have any common sense and basic reasoning skills, read this to feel smarter and superior to the author and the recommenders of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful poisoning your children with this garbage","review":"Strobel managed to convince me evolution was wrong when I was a teenager, stunting my intellectual development, and postponing my true love for science and biology. I can not begin to tell you how foul of a book this is. Stay away from it at all costs. Richard Dawkins' book, The God Delusion, is increbibly more accurate in its description of life and physics. This kind of work poisons minds, and breeds ignorance, hate, and an inability to see reality. Strobel is an obvious backwoods hick, with no scientific understanding, and an ability to somehow herd others into his contagious denial of reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A spouting fountain of dishonesty and ignorance.","review":"Christians everywhere should ba ashamed to be associated with people like the author of this book. The blatant stupidity with which this book was written is astounding. Books like this should be banned. I think that it actually lowered my IQ. Please understand that I am a faithful, devout Christian. But the author of this book is a black hole where knowledge goes to die. If I had to come up with a single word to describe the book, I think \\"abomination\\" would apply. The only good part about this whole scenario is that I do believe this author will suffer for promoting blind, ignorant faith: Acts 5: 4 thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation is par for the course","review":"Strobel presents an array of common misconceptions in order to make his argument. He relies on the thoughts and opinions from like-minded individuals rather than do the footwork himself. That is, Strobel offers nothing in the way of scientific evidence to support his beliefs. The author is, in short, preaching to the choir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Former Atheist Strobel Defeats Darwinian Faith-based Notions","review":"The author utilizes up-to-date and overwhelming evidence to demonstrate the truth of a created cosmos as he refutes many of the basic faith-based pre-commitments which Darwinians are bound. The evidence for special creation is given in an easy to understand manner and this would make a great gift for an open skeptic of intelligent design and the information theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Creationist Propaganda","review":"Strobel starts off his book well enough, pretending to be a neutral observer only to descend into a laughably one-sided assessment of modern cosmology. Nearly every authority he cites is an evangelical christian.There are no new arguments here that can't be debunked by a quick internet search.Sadly though, this is probably the best that the intelligent design advocates have to offer.If you are a curious person I would say read this just for some perspective and then read \\"The Selfish Gene\\" or \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\" for a scientific account of the natural world. When you do that, get back to me and tell which is more convincing.

At one point he picks on the fact that Ernst Haeckel used to put forth embryological drawings that were later shown to be faulty. Ok. Haeckel was out and out wrong somewhat. But the author never states that Haeckel's theory of origins concerning embryos was roughly correct. Nowadays, due to all type of ultrasound machines, we can easily show live embryos of humans, apes, other mammals, fish, and reptiles. We see the similarity of all these life forms as embryos and that supports evolutionary theories. Blab all you want, creationists, about Haeckel being wrong on a few specific points of his theory. Over all the theory of embryology is correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Overview","review":"This is a good book for an overview for the evidence in favor of a creator and refute some arguements against naturalism. It is not as in-depth as some people would like and it is not intended to be a balanced view between the creationist and naturalist positions, neither of which are intended. Good for the beginner apologist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pared down version","review":"Stroebel makes some really good points in this book and changed some of my thinking about evolution, and it was a quick read, so I wasn't dissatisfied with it until I saw the non-student version at a book store. Maybe I should have done some more research on the differences between editions, but I really think anyone high school age or above could handle the 300-some pages of the \\"adult\\" version, which must contain a lot more information. So I'd recommend this particular version only to younger students or to someone who really just wants a small taste of the evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"","review":"Interesting questions raised; but ultimately unsatisfying.

Read this book if you are a hardcore creationist and love to hear the same old non-scientific arguments against an already well supported scientific fact (evolution). Overall i found this book lacking in scholarly integrity and spilling out the same old lies disguised as science to provide a skeletal argument for intelligent design. Truly sad, in other countries these ideas are laughed at and the minority belief that has no place in government, schools or politics.. how is it the united states is so far behind? Lee strobel for one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentalist Christian propaganda.","review":"If you're a Christian, this just reaffirm what you already believe. If not, it won't convince you of anything. It's just politics. Nuff' said."},{"rating":"1","title":"For believers only","review":"I saw this book at the library so I checked it out. I think it's good for people to read a book like this because it shows how strong/weak the case for a creator is. There really isn't any evidence. There are faults with aspects of evolutionary theory but nothing to support the idea of 'intelligent design'. A reader has to have a pretty strong desire to believe to take these faulty arguments seriously. How can you reconcile such poor reasoning ability with 'intelligent design'?"},{"rating":"1","title":"no","review":"As noted elsewhere, hyperbolic language is a not a mark of intellectual honesty. \\"Convincing evidence\\" is presented many times, and, once, \\"convincing historical evidence\\". The accomplishments, citations, and titles of interviewees are listed exhaustively. Over-the-top descriptions are seeded throughout the book.Strobel does bring to light complex theories and offers some of their history, though slanted to Intelligent Design. No book featuring science can be all bad.A created universe provides moral structure, according to Strobel. The idea of random evolution does not. Whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does God Exist?","review":"Is there evidence supporting that God exists? Why choose Christianity over atheism or evolution? In this book, the author, a Yale Law graduate and former athiest, answers these questions and others by interviewing top scientists and philosophers that are well known and respected by Christians and non-Christians alike. During each interview, the author asks questions that non-Christians have, and also discovers flaws in theories such as evolution. An EXCELLENT book for anyone wondering about the origin of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer drivel","review":"Being a biologist I read the chapters that pertained to biology (since that's what I'm most comfortable with) over a one hour span. By the end of those 60 minutes I wanted to shoot myself in the face.Essentially, all biology is dealt with in interviews with Mr. Wells and Behe (I refuse to call them \\"Dr.\\") and are just lame rehashings of the their dreadful books. Yet, Strobel takes everything they say as the truth and only half attempts to question their opinions. I wouldn't hold it against Strobel if he had actually talked to a real biologist (one who doesn't have a disclaimer on his department's website or has published anything even remotely scientific in recent history), but he attempted no such thing.I realize this book is a few years out of date, but the information contained in it is simply so flat out false in the small amount I was qualified to judge that I could not sit idly by and not comment on this literary and scientific atrocity."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL scientific information made understandable","review":"This book is powerful. Strobel talks to experts who know the scientific facts (but who are free from the typical naturalistic, anti-supernatural biases so many science teachers and writers are bound by), and forces them to speak in language that ordinary people can understand. The result is a highly readable but very intelligent presentation of the overwhelming scientific support for an divine creator. You owe it to yourself to read this book, and then to pass it on to friends (and to give students you know the new Youth Edition)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strobel comes through again!","review":"Once again Strobel does a great job of exposing a view lost in our culture today - that Christianity best explains the evidence both philosophically and scientifically. The days of the intellectually fulfilled atheist are over, and Strobel helps to bring the reader to that realization by getting the reader in touch with academic Christian writings and scholars. This book will get you in touch with the evidence you need, either in its pages or through its resource listing. You can come to the realization with Strobel that it takes blind faith to be an atheist and justified faith to be a Christian - because the Christian can follow the evidence where it leads!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction to some amazing people","review":"Like the \\"Case for Christ\\" by the same author- this book is more of a jumping off point for anyone searching the realm of faith. There is entirely too much ground to cover for Strobel to have possibly given too much attention to one argument. But it is a great introduction to ideas and professionals. Chapter 5's interview with William Lane Craig was impressive and I have now moved on to Mr. Craig's writings and videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Encourage Everyone To Read This And More.................","review":"The Case For A Creator follows a logical and well thought out process. Strobel poses the questions on such topics as evolution, faith and science, the big bang, fine-tuning of the universe, earth's place in the cosmos, the origin of life, DNA, and the mind. The authors facts and evidence leads one to the confident conclusion that we can make the case for a Creator with scientific facts. I would encourage everyone to read this book much like another one I found here on Amazon called \\"The Book Of Thomas,\\" by Daniel Aber and Gabreael.The Book of Thomas is written in a similar format to this one (Question and Answer), which makes it a quick, to the point, easy read. Some of the subjects covered in their book are: The Christ Consciousness, Universal Laws, DNA, Reincarnation, The Process of Charting, and much more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"The book was in perfect condition - exactly as advertised. No problems whatsoever with the transaction or shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashed for the 21st Century","review":"Lee Strobel provides no new infomation to support his view that the universe MUST have been created. Christians have been saying that Evolution is wrong every decade ever since 1859. They always claim that new evidence is out there. IT seems that only \\"evidence\\" they have are unwarranted attacks on evolution and other parts of science that conflict with their personal belief system. It is a curious fact that all the scientists Strobel consults are Christians and share his personal belief in God. The author doesn't really seem to be interested in the objectivity and fairness to both sides, although he constantly makes this claim. If you want your narrow-views of the universe to be comforted, this may be the perfect book for you. If you are interested in science, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about both sides?","review":"Why is it that Strobel never interviews people who could articulate a well reasoned position which is contrary to the one he is trying to arrive at?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A CASE FOR DECEPTION","review":"The one thing that I noticed early in Mr. Strobel's book was his less than honest statements about being unbias. He even goes to extremes as to say he is going to play \\"the skeptic\\". After this the first thing he does is surround himself with friends with the same or simular theological views. Then there's the disturbing fact that he doesn't interview one scientist with an opposing view. When dealing with the evidence that the earth is over 4 billion years old, he forgets his role as skeptic and simply says that the \\"when\\" is not as important as the \\"how\\". All this alone is enough to show what a farce Strobels's book really is. This book also reminds me of I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FAIT TO BE AN ATHEIST by Norman Geisler. Both play on the general public's ignorance of science to peddle their pseudo pyscho babble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently god is the default answer","review":"Lee is a very good writer and has a pretty good grasp of science but no understanding of the scientific method. He would go into extreme detail about a large number of scientific fields, look for gaps in our current understanding and then claim that it was proof of GOD.If something is not understood, the correct answer is \\"we do not know yet\\" and not some magic man in the sky.Don't waste your time on this book.Don"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strobel's 'investigative' evangelising","review":"Strobel has done it again - yet another book presented under the guise of 'fair and balanced investigative journalism' that is actually nothing more than another opportunity for Strobel to lob soft balls at his favourite fundamentalist preachers so that they can make his case for him. Strobel's stated intent is a lie. He has not set out to present a true treatment of the issues but to evangelise, pure and simple.Lee Strobel has no understanding of the scientific method, or even the many branches of science he chooses to take issue with. How any 'serious researcher' could take someone like Jonathan Wells seriously is beyond me. The supposed science in this book is, in fact, almost as appallingly childish as the theology.This book would be of use to someone wishing to create an amusing course in critical thinking - anyone hoping to become more informed about science and theology should skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Arguments","review":"This book is full of deceptive arguments. On chapter 3, which denounces evolution, the only \\"proof\\" is that the people who had proof for evolution lied. How convining. One chapter describes how the big bang must have happened. The Strobel exclaims \\"if the big bang happened, there must be god!\\". This book is very biased. It has shallow conclusions, unconvincing proof, and automatically thinks that just because a nobel prize winner believes in god, there must be a god. In addition, Strobel automatically implies that Christianity is the right religion. He doesn't mention other major god believing religions like Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Sihkism, Shintoism, and dozens of others. Many other people go further into the flaws of this book. I suggest that you look at all the 1 star reviews first to get an idea of how misleading this book is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend!","review":"This is the book that prompted me to take another look at God and religion. It covers a wide variety of subjects, each with a different look at how seemingly unrelated facts (the strength of gravity, the arrangement of the planets, why ice floats) all point to a conclusion - that there is intelligent design. A very cool book no matter your religious view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"I strongly recommend any book by Lee Strobel. He is an excellent writer. He presents complicated scientific evidence in a very simplistic fashion. This book is an excellent resource when teaching evolutionary theory. It provides very up-to-date data. Every Middle School/High school student should be exposed to this information in order to make an eductated decision regarding creation/evolution. I utilized it as a resource in my 8th grade science class and really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good research, bad writing","review":"I tried to read this book after debating evolution v creationism with my cousin. I found the research solid, but the writing horrible. The author comes off as thinking himself \\"better than you\\" because he was first atheist, thus better than Christians and their belief system, and then a born-again Christian because he found God and no longer believes in Darwin's theory of evolution. I honestly could not get through the book because of his egotism. It took away from the presentation of his research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's give this crap a rest","review":"Intelligent Design is not even remotely science and the attempt made by creationists to turn it into science is shameful. The silliness of the argument is beyond mere stupidity - it is deliberate lying. Intelligent design advocates will ignore anything that refutes their claim, but babble on and on about anything they think supports it. Unfortunately for them, there is not a single scientific fact that intelligent design supports. Not a single one. You know why? Because any scientific fact or hypothesis must be falsifiable. The core of intelligent design is not falsifiable because it is based on religious convictions, not science."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bible and Science","review":"1. The Bible is not meant to be scientific. (No doubt one can have a point of view and play with numbers to get everything to line up, but seriously)2. Science is not meant to be biblical. (Although it sure does require a lot of faith)That being said, I have to ask myself over and over again - Do these authors even read the Bible?I've now finished this book and actually feel guilty for not just turning to my Bible for answers.In my opinion, The Case for Christ is a far better book. That book dealt with more realistic \\"evidence\\" or \\"facts\\" than The Case for a Creator (which is filled with theory's and idea's).This book can be an interesting read, but one shouldn't take it seriously. For me, it has been a terrible distraction from my faith.P.S. For those that take Lee Strobel's \\"skeptic\\" approach seriously, I think you missed the point. I took it as a theme or style for writing, not as his literal approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawyers are NOT trained as Scientists","review":"I find it curious that Lee Strobel, who is a lawyer by training, asserts that he can adequately report on scientific evidence of God. Rather, this level of analysis requires graduate degrees in physical and biological sciences to fully understand the scientific method and how to interpret scientific literature.For a real book about science and the existence of God written by a Ph.D. scientist, see Victor Stenger's \\"Has Science Found God?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown","review":"I really enjoyed Strobel's other books--The Case for Christ and The Case for Faith, but this book was way too esoteric for me. Difficult to follow and difficult to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing is Hokey, but Information is Great","review":"As a Christian, I greatly enjoyed reading this book. It gave me some verbal ammunition to use when confronted by someone who does not believe in creationism. I believe that Stobel aptly presented his \\"Case for a Creator.\\" I particularly enjoyed the chapter describing why Darwin was wrong.Unfortunately, I think that the impact of this book took a direct hit because of the hokieness of Strobel's writing. His detailed descriptions of his discussions with his subject matter experts begain to wear thin. Did Strobel really need to mention that Dr. Gonzalez placed his hand on his chin as he described Earth's position in the solar system?Bottom line, if you can cut through Strobel's cheese you will be rewarded with a fantastic presentation of a Case for a Creator."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Case for A Creator","review":"If you want a well-researced analysis of why the only explanation for our universe, and us, is of intelligent design, read this book.

When they told us that their cd was coming out on March 20, I was sure to run and buy it. When listening to it, I realized how simplistic the music really was, and that most of it has been done before. The first six songs on the cd are pretty lame, and repetitive. But, when my favorite song on the cd, \\"Nothing\\" started up, the cd quickly redeemed itself. From then on, nothing but good songs came out of, \\"Healing.\\" The singer sounds like Scooter from Cold, Aaron from Staind, and Gavin Rossdale from Bush at the same time. The band, on the other hand, is rather straight-forward, like most nu-metal bands.

It gives you good explainations of how to do different stuff. I would have liked it to have a bit more colour and a few more diagrams, but other than that I think it's a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you are looking for a dictionary containing descriptions of all of Illustrator's tools and functions, this is the book for you. If you want to understand how to use those tools and functions, look elsewhere. There is very little guidance here. The instructions for the pencil tool, for example, are little more than \\"choose the tool and draw a line.\\" There are lots of books out there that will help you to be successful with Illustrator -- this is not one of them. I can't even think of an alternative use for this book. At 2 pounds it's too light to be a doorstop, and at 7 x 9 inches it's too big to be a paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Don't waste your money on this book. It is a complete waste of time. It doesn't really tell you anything that is not in the illustrator help. There are some cool drawings in the middle of the book, but nothing at all about how there were done. I am returning my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":">_<","review":"This dance pad works great, but I'm disappointed for a few reasons.First of all, it gives off an annoying scrunchy noise when you step on it, which makes it difficult to concentrate on the music... And of course, the entire pad slides a lot, as well as it's \\"wrapping\\", no matter if you play on hardwood or carpet.Try to find a metal dance pad instead of this cheap garbage bag. They're expensive, but better."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHACKY BUTTONS","review":"After a month the controll pad goes beserk. The sensors in the mat get stuck, and the mat registers the wrong way. Say you tap a button when the mat is new, it will register perfectly. Then about a month later you do the same thing, it will tell you you hit the mat early, late , or not at all. Next it will say you hit the buttons even when your not even standing on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly engaging.","review":"\\"Leading Lady\\" was my first Lawana Blackwell book, and I was very impressed. I love the theatre, so I was drawn to the plot immediately, since it is set around the London theatre, just near the turn of the century. The characters are warm and inviting, taking you into their webs of love, deception, happiness, and anguish. Though predicable and stereotypical, the characters were very alive, and will make you forget that you probably already know how everything will end. The antagonist gets their comeuppance, and the protagonist lives happily ever after. My complaint is that the main characters kept shifting, and I couldn't keep track of how people were related to one another. It didn't hinder me from understanding situations eventually, but it was perplexing. I immensely enjoyed reading about classic London theatre and the gossip that revolved around it. If you love reading about life in the late 1800s, and enjoy the theatre, then this book is a must. I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I happen to like all of Lawana Blackwell books! I have her entire collection, (as far as I know) and I would give a 5 star rating on every one of them.

I have a number of \\"real\\" laptop bags but they were too big and ugly as far as my wife was concerned. We looked around and she liked the look of this.The plus is it was cheap but sadly you get what you pay for.First thing I noticed is very little protection. I was looking for something to protect her laptop, she was looking for something to carry the laptop in so we had different requirements. I was going to send it back but she said she would try it.She doesnt travel a huge amount. Maybe she used this 20 times but I doubt it. Within that time both of the handles pulled out.Pass on this.

You will be betetr off in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish bag for your Macbook","review":"I love the look and quality of this bag, which I've been using for a couple of weeks. I bought it for dual purposes: carry Macbook when I work from home, and otherwise, a stylish, small bag to carry paperwork, newspaper, and datebook back and forth to work so I can actually use my collection of purses, too! (I was using a large briefcase and a way-too-big laptop bag).I would have given it a 5 if there was a removable strap to carry it over the shoulder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked well!","review":"Pros:Well made, heavy duty paint, and I did not have to put the bumper.Cons:Poorly packed, bolts were missing, one of the underside mount holes was poorly placed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie/Action Packed","review":"This movie is amazing compared to any of the previous movies. The authors seemed to have used more advanced animation equipment and software to make the movie stunning in its storyline brilliance and its animation. If you are looking for a great movie to watch, this is worth a look at. Yes, it may be a little more expensive than the other movies, but its a great value.

John needs to decide whether he wants to continue producing boring, spiritless albums like this one and Wildest Dreams, or continue in the manner of Faces and his other fine, previous albums. There's not a song on the album with any of the fire and passion that John possesses. He has one of the most awesome and beautiful voices in the music industry. He needs a new record label and manager. Desperately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Close to the Real JOHN BERRY!","review":"I waited eagerly for this new album from the most incredible voice alive, John Berry. What a disappointment! All the songs are bland, the music has no heart and John sounds like he's holding back. Other than hitting a high note here and there, his voice seems to lack power. Listen to \\"Live My Dreams\\" on his SADDLE THE WIND cd and you'll know what I mean. Don't waste your bucks or ears on this one. Get FACES and every album prior to it to get a taste of the REAL John. Don't forget his two fabulous Christmas albums, O HOLY NIGHT and MY HEART IS BETHLEHEM. He's not holding back at all on those recordings.Once you hear his version of O Holy Night, no other version will ever do. I'll just wait for his next album and hope for the perfection which has completely eluded him on this latest attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Berry Does It Again!","review":"Another great album from the man with the amazing voice. The mix of songs is great. From the upbeat \\"Settle for Everything\\" to the ballads like \\"How Much Do You Love Me\\", John's voice is clear and powerful. There is a song here for everyone, no matter what their favorite style is. A must have album for the John Berry fans out there, as well as those who are new to his name."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"What has happened to John Berry? All of the songs on this album sound bland and generic. No spirit at all. No soaring vocals. Even the music is boring. He hasn't had a quality album since FACES. Save your money folks; buy FACES and every album before that if you want a true taste of his fabulous voice and deep character. This album is a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"John, what has happened to your music???","review":"I adore John Berry. His beautiful, incredible voice can evoke such deep emotion. This album, like the \\"Wildest Dreams\\" albums possesses absolutely none of that beauty and purity. While country music has taken a decidedly and most welcome acoustic tone, this album drowns in overkill. I long for a John Berry like the one heard in \\"Standing on the Edge\\" \\"Things are not the Same\\" \\"Faces\\" and the most incredible album he's EVER done, \\"Saddle the Wind.\\"Where is that clear, powerful voice accompanied by beautiful, simple acoustic guitar???

Instead, seems to want to let this Greek \\"composer\\" guide the direction of the music.

On this, they collaborated with a renowned Greek composer: He wrote the basic tunes, they wrote most of the lyrics and made contributions to the arrangments (and played most of the music).This is most assuredly not rock. It's romantic pop with Greek flourishes. It was recorded, originally, as the intended soundtrack to a film. It was never used for that purpose, but it stands as a terrific album of music.Those who come to this album expecting an emphasis on rock and roll, as was the case with the other New York Rock and Roll Ensemble albums, will be disappointed.

The nitrosamines that result of the corn consumption are carcinogenic; it's worse in mice (MUCH worse), but do you really want to take the risk with your rats? I've raised both rats and mice for a long time now (mice longer), and once I removed the corn from their diets did I notice an almost complete reduction in early murine death (mice fed diets that contained corn kernals in them died quicker/younger than mice without the corn).Also, these ingredients:whole corn, striped sunflower seed, pumpkin seed, shelled peanuts, jumbo green peas, almonds, pecans, walnuts, banana chipscombined will make your critters obese. There's just too much fat in this concoction to even think about giving it to them on a daily basis. I don't think I could ever recommend something like this, no matter if my rats \\"liked\\" it or not. For treats, maybe, but not as the main staple of their daily diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOYCOTT BROWNS!!!","review":"Up until very recently, this was the only food I would feed my pet rats they were the only soy-free rat food on the market. My rats love this food. HOWEVER, FM Brown's has started using soy in their rat & mouse food within the past couple months. There is evidence to show, and my own experience is that soy is like POISON to rats. It cuts their lifespan in half and causes CANCER, particularly in females. Because FM Brown's recently made the decision to add the soy to their mix, the ingredients listed on Amazon are not even accurate. There is soy in the food and it is BAD for your rats!!!

My advice is that if you can buy it for $50 or less go for it. It's a great bike to figure out if you like road riding or not (however the shock absorption of it was terrible).

It's one of my son's favorite - he is enthralled by Ibn Battuta's adventures and likes to look at the beautiful illustrations. The Arabic script also makes this book interesting; it's not often that one comes across this sort of writing here.

Blue (we have this one) and Black don't show dirt as much. Have yet to find a table it doesn't work on. We even have a 2\\" hang that the chair will attach to without being a problem.cons- if there is a chair underneath it- baby can stand up, so you need to be careful. Must use the straps or else sits sideways sometimes or stands up. Red (my friend has) shows stains more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair","review":"This is a really good product, I bought it because I was moving out of country and I was going to be doing quite a bit traveling with my then 6 month old girl. This chair has been all over Ecuador & Europe. It folds flat like a medium size pizza box, it fits in my diaper bag. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it can't be used with glass or pedestal tables. Other than that is nice & useful luxury to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb GTA 2 theme","review":"This superb house track was used in the game Grand Theft Auto 2, where I first heard it.

I bought it because of the rave reviews. Got home, put the c.d. in, and within minutes I was shaking my head at the awful mistake I had made in purchasing it.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman Rugged Battery Powered Lantern (Family Size)","review":"I purchased this lantern because my neighbor had an old one and we had lost our power and I was surprised to see how well this lit a room and decided we needed to have one for our house. It is great it will light a good size room up and you don't have to all be holding a flashlight. There is a hi and low setting but I really didn't see a whole lot of difference between the two. Since we have purchased it our power has not gone out so we haven't had to use it other than to try it out once we purchased it. I would assume that since there isn't much difference between the hi and low settings that if you run it on low you probably will use less battery life. Living in FL and having the threats of hurricanes so often I'm sure when the time comes this will get plenty of use. Might even invest in another one to have in another room. Only drawback is it takes 8 D batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman manufactures terrific products.","review":"I bought two lanterns for backup in case of a power outage and they're terrific; lightweight, economical and reliable.

This one arrived broken, shedding a faint blue light no brighter than a candle. Coleman material says contact them. They have limited phone hours. The e-mail to customer service went unanswered. I did get through by phone several days later and the nice lady at Coleman did ship a replacement bulb and then everything was fine.

I left it out in a not very-heavy rain overnight. The next night, the light wouldn't turn on and I gave up. A couple of days later I opened the base and found that the base was full of water and the batteries and copper contact points had corroded. One of the copper points broke off, rendering the lantern useless. I called Coleman support to request a replacement base -- because the only thing wrong is one broken contact -- and was told they had discontinued that part. So, my only option is to throw the lantern away and buy a new one. I can promise that the replacement won't be a Coleman lantern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman Lantern","review":"I purchased this lantern for use in Afghanistan. Although, it requires 8 D batteries it puts out a great deal of light. It's perfect for environments where there is little availability for electricity. I recommend it. It's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries are expensive","review":"It takes 8 D batteries and the lantern only runs for about 10 hours on high, not 18 like it claims. Also the clear plastic shield for the light scratches easy enough to scratch it with your fingernail on accident. I would suggest a propane lantern if your looking to light up your camp at night, cheaper and brighter. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it will make a decent tent light until it gets too scratched up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great emergency lighting","review":"The weather has been brutal this year in the northeast.We recently lost power for three days, and these lanterns were a godsend.They're sturdy, well made, and light up a huge room.And like similar products, they don't seem to eat up the batteries as much.We have two, but I definitely plan on ordering a few more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This WAS a great product","review":"I have been using the full line of Lipton's Green Tea to Go for a couple of years now, and just love it. Have also turned countless friends onto it as well. Love the benefits of green tea, being able to avoid soda...and that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda was the primary reason for chosing the Lipton line. But NOW all that has changed and Lipton has made the decision to switch to Aspartame...which doctors tell you to avoid if you experience headaches. Aspartame is not very good for us, folks...but it must be cheaper. (Google it and see what you find!) Lipton has fallen out of brand loyalty for me and it is a window into their practices that they would switch to a lesser, more controversial ingredient. I'm sure there is plenty of marketing spin they can site for this reason, but facts are facts. I'm told by friends that Jackie Chan has a line worth checking out, now that it's Lipton no more for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aspartame!!!!","review":"I am so disappointed that the company switched last July from using sucralose (splenda) as the sweetener to aspartame!

I have changed my mind. Even though it states under Important Information that it has splenda under the ingredients, Lipton quietly changed these to ASPARTAME at least two years ago. You will realize it after it arrives, as it does say aspartame on the box. It is fairly hard to find green tea stix with splenda, but I discovered AriZona Pomegranate Green Tea Iced Tea Stix Sugar Free (Splenda), and that is what I drink now."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh!","review":"Not a good taste.

Supreme sound from this small but powerful tool for college students. Sometimes professors talk too fast, you just wanna get what he said in his lectures. You forget the whole lecture.

This recorder can record, non-stop, right through those 4 hour summer classes in HQ. You can archive lectures to your pc, burn them to cd or upload to an ipod. How about using the software to edit out the dead spaces on the recording? Try that with a tape recording.I usually sit in the front row of class and place my recorder on the professor's desk. I never have to touch the recorder until the end of class(10hr battery and 8hr HQ). When the tape recorder users do this, it's a distraction to the class. You can hear tapes popping through out the lectures and people coming to the front of class to flip tapes and batteries.

It is easy to use, and gives reasonably good sound quality. There are other recorders which can give better sound quality -- but the simplicity of use, and reliablity are what makes me use it for these purposes. I use recharable batteries with it as well.

Ben Cross did an excellent job of playing Barnabus, as did Joann Going on her part. If you were a fan of the old dark shadows, as my mom is, my advice for you is to buy this.

Lazy and irresponsible to a fault, he none the less manages to defeat enemy after enemy, through a combination of astounding luck and planned self-interest.The greatest part of the series is the character interactions, from the XO who constantly takes tranquilizers and stress tank treatments to put up with Tylor, to the ships doctor who measures his time sober with a 24 hour hourglass, the characters manage to create some decent laughs and push the story forward.Despite being a little low key on the action, what does occur is always apropos to the episode overall.

This new team and new story lacks any reason for us to identify with them. If you liked the old Challengers - you definitely should stay away. Even if you're just a regular comic book fan - I have one word: AVOID!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Sharpe at his BEST !","review":"I have always been an avid fan of Shakatak and their laid-back jazzy style of music. I find it amazing how they keep churning out albums and yet manage to avoid repeating themselves.This album is a collection of twelve Shakatak hits for solo piano, played by Bill Sharpe, who is also co-founder of the group. Don't expect the jazzy rhytms of Shakatak, but rather a calm, sometimes moody, sometimes soothing, sometimes immensely beautiful, rendition of the hits, serving best for a relaxed evening in front of the fire or just for easy listening after a hard day at the office.And believe me: you will listen to this album again and again !This album only proves, what I always suspected: Bill Sharpe is one of the best contemporary musicians/composers !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pugs and the Puppies...In Concert","review":"My four year old son loves Pugs and the Puppies!

Once I had the machine, it intimidated me because of all the features it offered but I quickly found out that it is extremely user friendly. It offers easy to use menus and even contains help information which can easily be printed out from the fax. Receiption on the telephone is crystal clear, even when used near a PC. Faxes received are also very clear. The only negative aspect of this system is the fact that it only comes with one extender phone and additional phones are a little pricey. That said, I am very happy with my choice and would buy this system again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"kxfpg391","review":"We bought this unit about a year ago and it seemed to work ok for the first few months. The telephone part of it works great. We don't recieve faxes to often so it's hard to tell when it went haywire but now the paper feeds in crooked so it can't complete the fax, so it stores it. Not a word in the book about how to recieve a stored fax. The onscreen notes say to check the ink and we do but it doesn't help. We've decided to throw it in the trash can and buy a Brother. The last Brother we owned worked perfectly. We thought upgrading to Panasonic would be nice.

I bought one extension & it's been OK. The 5.8 gig size provides plenty of coverage throughout my tiny house. The one thing that doesn't work well for me is the Toll Saver feature when calling to check messages - it may be the phone or it may be related to VONAGE, but I had to set it to five rings for checking messages. It would be nicer to have Toll Saver work properly, but otherwise the thing works well. I don't fax a lot but the few occasions I do, it's fairly OK - again, any problems I have may be related more to the VONAGE/phone interface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you just wanna get out on the track!","review":"I found out about this book through the CCS and WERA bbs'. I bought it on a whim. True to their reviews it was a fun read, and did a pretty good job getting you into the action moment. I enjoyed the story involving the racing, and the crazy cast of characters you can meet racing, especially. I'd suggest anyone wanting to start club racing to buy this book. It will either scare you completely away, or set the hook for good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"English-Navajo book about Navajo life in Autumn","review":"This is a great little book for learning Navajo. Along with illustrations of 'traditional' Navajo doing traditional activities such as weaving, dyeing, and spinning, there are dual-language narratives on common autumn activities. In the voice of a Navajo child, we hear about living in a hogan, watching animals, turning wool into woven products, and silversmithing. Good for reading aloud to both English- and Navajo-speaking children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The Academy Is... is certainly not the greatest band on the earth, but because they were local in my area and because I've listened to them for so long, their music is bliss.

They are well worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album but...","review":"I love this cd, probably as much as any of you here...The lyrics are completly genius and it is pretty musically in-tune...There live show is very awesome as well, but one thing I bet not a lot of you know about is there first EP...go check that out, it is more amazing than this cd will EVER be. I'm pretty sure you can go pick that up at smartpunk.com or even checking out at [...](there old label)the lyrics are out of this world and the music is unbelieveable...if you are a fan of TAI music and not the way they look or how much they sound like FOB then I suggest you go check The Academy EP out...what are you waiting for???"},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope this catches on","review":"I thought that this was an exellent album. The pace varies a lot from the up beat Black Mamba to the more melodic Season. The instrumentals are stellar and i thought that the writting was great. I'll agree with the reviewer that said that they SOUND poppy but if you pay attention to the lyrics you'll see the Emocore exisentialist sentament of other emo bands. I hope that on their next album they pull a spitalfield and go for a much more somber and refined sound. I think that the singing while not the best is very acceptable. I recommend this album for fans of Fall Out Boy, Taking Back Sunday, Further Seems Forever, Spitalfield, and basically any other band sighned to victory or fuled by ramen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This cd is really good. It ends up becoming one of those cds that you put in and end up singing along to.

After seeing them live I notice still that songs from this album hold a certain nostalgia in my heart. This album is original, innovative, and the lead singer's voice is utterly unique. I highly recommend this album, but if you like it like I do, be cautious their later work does not have the same style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doing the same thing as all the other pop punk bands... just not as well.","review":"With mediocre (at best)lyrics, and rather flat (and monotonous at times) vocals, I can't say this is the best CD I've ever heard but it's not the absolute worst either.

It's just kinda blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, The best album in the whole entire world!!! This is better than the beatles.","review":"Lyrically, this is the best album ever! Bob Dylan doesn't compete with this. And they rock crazier than the Rolling Stones. Oh, and did I say they were incredibly original. Oh, and the lyrics are so deep. They sing about things that no one else sings about like girls and relationships and stuff. I mean like everything. Originality should be the bands name. No one in the whole entire world sounds like them. Oh, I need to tell my mom to buy it for me again because I keep giving all the copies away that I have.This is definitely worth the money to buy it for yourself and five copies for your mother... were they on the cover of the rolling stone magazine yet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Live Performances Always Show Potential!","review":"With that, I must say this band has none.. whatsoever. It was horrible to hear the front man wail off key to a bunch of swooning girls, with half assed smiles on their faces, knowing all to well that the performance has nothing to offer other than the cute guy from the video, or the professionally polished, studio production Cd. However the band was good, well timed and had a lot of great enthusiasm, dispite the lead singer, but it didn't go farther than me wanting to revolt and stop listening.

It truly is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not saying that i'm not breaking some hearts tonight","review":"the first song i heard from this band was the song The Season, and i fell in love instantly, the grooving, solid pop drumbeats, the intricate and catchy as hell guitar lines, and some of the most infectious melodies i've heard in a long time, this cd is a must have for anyone that digs catchy, fun music, if you buy this cd and like what you hear, you'd also probably like Fallout Boy, Spitalfield, and My Former Self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Father's Sly & the Family Stone","review":"If you are looking for classic Sly & the Family Stone, this is not the album for you.

Every CD that I have purchased from Amazon has arrived in perfect condition; that is why Amazon is my favorite place to shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho, hum","review":"I could not wait to get this record. Debby Boone has one of the purest singing voices in the business -- top of the line. But why is this record so bland and blase? Debby even inherited all of Rosemary's musical arrangements (Rosemary being her mother-in-law), so what happened? Even Debby's voice is restrained. I was disappointed. Debby looks fabulous for being almost 50 years old (and check out the photo of her four adult children with Gabriel Ferrer). Sorry, folks, if you want a real tribute and a dynamite recording of Rosemary Clooney covers, you MUST buy Bette Midler's \\"Rosemary Clooney's Songbook.\\" That one is so great that we bought two copies -- one for my wife, and one for me! Sorry, Debs -- Two stars is the most I can do.

This is one of the most insipid, colorless efforts(or lack thereof) I have ever suffered though! No emotion or personality shows through on any of these songs. The only bright spots are the excellent arrangements, although they are truly wasted on this lightest of lightweight singers. What is most annoying is that Ms. Boone shows glimpses of potential, and just when she should cut loose and SING, she wimps out! Given the selection of stand-out material, this could have been a wonderful tribute. Instead, the incomparable Ms. Clooney must be spinning in her grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"An anti-tribute to Rosemary Clooney","review":"I bought this cd based on the rave reviews at Amazon. Boy, was I sorry! Those listeners were obviously raised watching American Idol where \\"slightly above average voices\\" are considered \\"fantastic\\". This album lacks everything that made Clooney great. Even the songs were unrecognizable as hers except maybe for track nine (It Never Entered My Mind). Rosie sang with tremendous heart AND an incredible voice. Miss Boone, though pleasant, has no range and definitely none of Rosie's energy. In every song I kept waiting for that special something to happen and was left disappointed over and over again. In fact, I was bored to tears. If you love Rosie, this cd will definitely not be a welcome addition to your collection. If you like tribute albums done recently, try Tony Bennett singing Frank Sinatra's hits or Bennett singing Billy Holliday. Both of those tributes would have made those artists proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my listening ear","review":"Just because she's your mother-in-law doesn't mean you should make a record. One hit wonder does not a chanteuse worthy of this music make. Too white bread, nothing redeeming except pitch - Boone's voice is just too pure, practically the opposite of Clooney's voice, a pedestrian, gruff yet elegant mix for her time. I like Boone's contemporary christian material, very pop, almost rough. This is sickeningly sweet.

They're also very useful at the swap meet or someplace like Disneyland to keep track of subsets of your group.They're tough, we haven't killed one yet. You'll have to look at a few pages in the manual to see how to work the radios, but it's not like it's trigonometry or anything like that. You can easy learn to operate these radios.Simple, bulletproof, decent performance... this is a good product and I'm glad that I bought a pair.We tried a VOX headset but it was not a big success.

The hole is too small and a great deal of water spurts out the sides (which is not going through the filter so it is impure water getting into the cup). Also, the little holes on the lid are confusing as to their purpose.

It is not heavy and leaves the water with a slight iodine taste (much more subtle than using iodine tablets). Each filtration system, which screws into the inside of the water bottle, lasts about 26 gallons (about 100 liters) after which you have to replace it, costing about US$22.I have been using the bottle in rural peru and have had no problems. I would recommend this product for anyone venturing into areas with unknown water sanitation, all you need is the bottle and a puddle, stream, river, etc. I don't know its results against pesticides, arsenic, lead, etc. but for short term use this is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very functional","review":"We like this product for a day hike. And the upside is that our toddler has figured out how to drink from it.

So harrowing, in fact, that I simply couldn't finish the book.The writing and style is shaky - it varies from extremely good to jumpy and poorly written. But considering the subject of this novel, the style of the writing doesn't really matter. It's the time and place that are important here, and despite the variance of style, MacMillan more than puts his point across.

Other than that this CD was exactly what I was hoping for when I had previously heard the song glorious elsewhere. Glorious is just the type of song that makes a person want to have the whole album and not worry about the quality of the rest. Because of Glorious, you trust that is has to be good. And it certainly is. There is a constant liebling-esque strain that flows throughout the entire album, tying the songs together and creating a flow between them that makes for a lovely transition from one catchy tune to the next. A good album for de-stressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tablesaw accessory you can buy","review":"Jet 708150PK 37-Inch Folding Outfeed Roller Table Attachment for Table SawsThis is the best accessory I have purchased for my tablesaw. It allows me to rip or crosscut without worry about the wood falling off the back side. It is a great safety issue because now you don't need to reach over the blade to grab your cutoff.It takes a few hours to install but once it is done, you are ready to cut. The raising and lowering of the rollers is very easy. The instructions could be better, but they are about like most wood working tool instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell Apart","review":"This hamper looks nice and holds a lot of laundry. The problem is that it fell apart very quickly. The inside cloth bags all tore at the seams within 8 months. Also, the wicker outside is flimsy and the basket didn't hold its shape very well. We used ours for 2 years, despite the wear, and are now having to throw it out. If you purchase this item, don't expect it to hold up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look for small spaces","review":"I ordered this for my bedroom which has no closet space to hide a clothes hamper. It looks great placed in my room. The large sorting bins makes is very easy when it's time to do laundry. The only con is you can't easily removed each bag from the sorter. It would be great to be able to pull each section one at a time when doing laundry. I would highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for the price","review":"The item was very easy to setup. The only problem I had was with the velcro that holds the laundry bags in place. The problem was getting the velcro to line up properly. There is a slight grass like smell to it but it isn't strong. I understand the comments about sturdiness. I believe the frame could have been made a little sturdier but if it isn't abused there shouldn't be any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why sell this item?","review":"I can not bekieve this item would even be on Amazon.

The unit is not exactly what you would call sturdy, and it is certainly not \\"furniture\\". It looks exactly like the photo...no surprises. The \\"grass smell\\" that another reviewer found unpleasant and objectionable, for me, is actually one its nicer qualities! I would call it an \\"aroma\\". I purchased this item to use in a country kitchen as an upgrade from open bags to hold clean trash, and glass, plastic, metal and paper recycling on their way to the basement. I'm planning to put the currently used bags inside the compartments for easy removal when full. Having noted the \\"central sag\\" issue of another reviewer, I will either attach some support below, or put heavier items in one of the end bins. I will probably be functional, and is not particularly unattractive. Sorry... Can't figure out how to insert product link..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks nice, sorts laundry, don't bother with the wheels.","review":"This product is very nice. It is on the delicate side, if you sat on it you would break it for sure. its pretty, looks nice, etc. Cons? It sort of falls apart, if you will. All the pieces just sort of set inside of each other.. Nothing really \\"fastens down\\" or \\"snaps in\\". So if you scoop into the basked you may bring the entire basket and the mounting brackets with you. Thats ok, you just put them back into place, not a big deal. I would of like to have it snap together a bit.The wheels? don't bother. If you want this as a roll around unit, you have come to the wrong place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. Amazon really sells this junk?","review":"Same as other bad reviews: Pricey yet cheaply made. One foot snapped off at end, so couldn't even use the regular feet. I have a brick propping it up. Read the reviews on Target.com of this piece of carp: Target stopped carrying it because of all the complaints. Do not kid yourself: the picture looks nice but it's cheap and won't last, assuming it even arrives intact. There's no quality control here."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE!","review":"I love this product!! It dresses up my laundry room instead of typical laundry baskets.

I have two of these, and I also love the option of wheels or legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"laundry sorty","review":"This hamper has really helped keep the laundry room more organized. Most of the laundry is now sorted before I wash, leaving the floor more tidy. It looks so much nicer than several baskets overflowing with underwear when friends walk through the room. I can also roll it closer to the machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looking but NOT STURDY!","review":"This is a very pretty laundry sorter that looks great in any room of the house and blends in with any decor/color walls. It was super easy to assemble. Took me all of 5 minutes. The only complaint I have is that the whole set-up is very flimsy and bands and gold with the slightest pressure. For instance pushing the sorter over to the laundry room is an effort as I'm always worried the whole thing is going to collapse. It's not sturdy at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"caster leg breaks","review":"The hamper is nice and service was quite good. The first one had a broken leg when it arrived and had to be returned. The new one was fine but there is a pin fastened to each of the legs. To attach casters you have to remove a plastic foot. I was able to do this on three of them but the fourth was bent and came off. So we have three legged hamper. Will probably send it back as well. Can't recommend. Noticed some others have this problem as well. So if you are looking for something without wheels (as in the product picture) it may be ok. If you want the casters on be real careful with setup as they appear soldered not welded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, but the bags aren't any good.","review":"I've had this sorter for 2 years or so and the seams on the bags have come undone. It still looks nice on the outside, but I will have to replace it soon or make me some new bags. I don't like how the bags are fastened at the top, either. They have velcro strips across the top that fastens to the hanger. The middle hanger holds both bags on either side so if you want to remove the bag, you have to undo the velcro strips in the middle and then re-fasten them. My hamper is a short distance from my washing machine and I have found this to be a huge inconvience. Personally, I wish I would have kept looking. However, if your laundry sorter is next to your washing machine, I'm sure this will work for you. At least until you have to sew the bags together again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty awesome little hamper!","review":"I think this hamper is really great. it looks wonderful in our closet and hides the dirty clothes perfectly. It fits in and look slike a nice decor piece. We set it up in about 15 seconds! Lots of people have been complaining of a smell but I didn't notice anything overwhelming. Its subtle beachy smell! The bags do have some strings hanging off but since I don't intend to leave it open it don't care about that. I may have DH put a board in the bottom to keep the bags off the floor though. It seems reasonably sturdy and is VERY nice to look at!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT","review":"Just received this laundry sorter. Arrived very quickly. Put it together in 5 minutes. Good size bags; 1 load each. Yeah, the bags are stringy, but big deal. It won't effect the functionality. The stitching that's there looks good. It could have been sewn with a serging stitch, but if you're at all handy with a sewing machine, any problems you MAY have could be easily fixed. AND WHAT'S ALL THIS FUSS ABOUT THE SMELL? Mine has no discernible odor at all. Very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Install Casters?!","review":"I wanted to install the casters and the instructions state \\"If you want to install the caster, pls.take out the rubber at the bottom feet first.\\" I have tried pulling, turning, yanking w/pliers and the bloody rubber does not come off of the feet. The only way I'm going to get the casters on is to destroy this crap product.Back to the store you go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hamper","review":"Very cute and works well. The hamper has a very slight smell that goes away over time - nothing to bad though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total trash","review":"DO NOT buy this product. It came in a flimsy bent box and bent several of the pieces inside. In order to remove the rubber feet to install the casters, you must destroy the rubber feet. Then you find that the casters don't rotate. In addition, every time you disturb the cross pieces holding the laundry bags, the pieces come out of their useless little holders. The cloth bags have so many untrimmed strings that the strings hang out of the bottom and are totally unsightly. I would send this back if the box was in any condition to be reused. I wouldn't re-order anyway, because I would probably get the same piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply built, No Quality Control","review":"This laundry sorter seemed and would be an ideal solution except that it is cheaply built. It is way too expensive for the quality of material and work. The metal frame is flimsy at best. The worst part is that one of the metal dividers has to sit just outside the frame instead of going through the round hidden metal loop/hoop where it should be securely hooked into, because the loop is closed off. It looks as if there was no quality control in the making of this product and so it is highly imperfect. Take your chances in purchasing this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceed my expectections","review":"I bought two and I love them. They are very sturdy and hold quite a bit of laundry.

Fortunately, I only rented it on Instant Video rather than purchasing it. I didn't have high expectations before watching it, but thought it would at least be entertaining. It was not.Everything Randy Marten wrote in his review is true. I would just add that I could have forgiven the abysmal acting and cheap sets if the story had been at all interesting or original. This is just a painful, boring crossover fan fiction of Phantom of the Opera and The Da Vinci Code. Even if you love both of those stories, you won't love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treat for Any Phan","review":"If you are a Phan of The Phantom of the Opera you should consider giving this film a try.I was happy to have stumbled across the trailer for this film online. As I investigated more of the story, I was immediately interested in seeing the actual movie. After watching it and all of the bonus features, I stand by my sudden choice to buy the independent film.The story takes an interesting spin with one heck of a twist for the finale!! It is amazing to see what determined people can put together on an independent film budget. Don't expect a Hollywood blockbuster- it is an independent film made by fans of the story of Erik and Christine.Many fans simply draw doodles or write fan fictions to contribute to the phandom of the Phantom.... ANGEL OF MUSIC takes it a step farther and makes a 50 minute long movie.

When I saw the title, \\"Angel of Music,\\" I was intrigued, since the Phantom is referred as the \\"angel of music.\\" The description mentioned that it would make you rethink Lerouxs's romantic story, so I knew I had to see it. But after I watched it, I was disappointed.Even though it did make numerous references to the story, I didn't care much for the storyline involving a mysterious cult linked to the novel. The actual \\"Phantom\\" scenes were OK, but it was like watching a school production. The acting and action (or lack of) was corny.This version might be better off hiding underneath the Paris opera house or destroyed by a falling chandelier..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for what it is.","review":"I did not enjoy this Phan-made film.

MAYBE there is a kernel of a concept here, but despite the obviously earnest and sincere efforts of all involved, it is a total failure on all levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided and inaccurate","review":"This book unfortunately flies in the face of proven scholarship and years of time-tested truth.

I've been a NIN-fanatic for about 3-4 years and at one point in time I had everything they released because I felt the need to complete the whole set of Halo's. I was a NIN-sheep, what can I say. Don't make the same mistakes I did. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete your NIN collection!","review":"Well, this one gets five stars for hardcore NIN fans (like me) only, because you get the Copper and Slate mixes on the 10-track-Maxi as well. So the Opal mix (like the others remixed by Trent himself) is all that's new, but it's worth it, because it's very different from the other Head Like a Hole remixes, and very stylish. However, if you're not a total Reznor junkie, you're better of with the 10-track. If you are, you got it already and just gotta have this one as well, don't ya? Doesn't have a Halo number, by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contains the best remix of the PHM era.","review":"A nice mix of phm songs, as it has the edit and the flood mix of head like a hole. also contains the incredible Opal mix of head like a hole, which is sooo ahead of its time, its not even funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"pay-back","review":"I just didn't care about this family drama. The Woodman's are a couple who inflict there obsessive urge to be creative on us. There may be a modicum of taste and technique but we live in an age where all amateurs want to be players judging by their ridiculous price-tags and profusion. Mrs Woodman's art sells precisely because it looks like anyone might be able to do it and to the non-amateur alike.Francessca their daughter- had more talent than her parents because she was being coached and encouraged \\" to be an artist \\" since the day she was born. If she had less angst about being famous she would not have committed suicide. It's that simple.Real artists create for their own pleasure and meaningfulness ; process AS important as result And don't kill themselves if not admired.

Loved them, but for some reason they discontinued it.I wanted to try these but was disappointed to learn, after I bought them at Staples, that they are not a typical card stock weight, but more like perforated paper. Also, because they're perforated it does leave a rough edge after you separate the cards. It would be nice if they could make these with the same non-perforated edges used for their clean edge business cards (which I love.)If you want note cards for personal use and you don't mind the less than \\"real\\" card quality, these will probably work for you.

Few modern books go into as much detail for this region as does Leiby. His documentation is sound and he uses it to construct a dramatic narrative of the Revolutionary period. Excellent also for genealogists. However, genealogists may sometimes be a little frustrated that Leiby chose the most archaic form of each surname rather than attempt to arbitrate the most \\"accurate\\" spelling.One serious complaint, from the perspective of an historian, is that Leiby sometimes seems methodologically naive in his nearly uncritical support for the American side. He does not try to understand the Loyalists. Many of them were decent people, as demonstrated by books such as Philip Ranlet's The New York Loyalists. I think Leiby's book would have been much richer for it. Leiby is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Ballard Resource . . . though dated...","review":"This Re/Search volume includes a comprehensive bibliography and numerous interviews with Ballard, most done during the 80's.

It's basically a brief photo guide through the first few weeks of the series, ending with the wild card episode and the selection of R.J. Helton as contestant. Oddly, the book chooses to end there, a pretty strange place to end. I would have liked it better if the book had gone up to and including the final episode, and maybe included photos from the concert tour and Las Vegas spectacular televised concert. And maybe the lyrics to Kelly Clarkson's songs? Whatever. It's still a nice photo guide, but it's mainly that - glossy photos. There's some brief contestant interviews with the final ten that don't reveal much, a look at the elimination shows and some pages devoted to the auditions.

With the excepton of the National Express, admittedly a lively and quite melodic tune, this album is forgettable and truly dull. What's shameful is Hannon has a wonderfully unique voice which realistically should compliment the music he writes. Alas, it is not so. Hannon's voice is simply overpowered by the annoyingly playful lyrics and predictable pop sentimentality on offer here. It's the kind of tripe we've all heard a 1000 times before. Bottom line, A Secret History:An Unquestionably Dire Offering from a band who could do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"swoon!","review":"This is definitely one of the best \\"Best-of\\" compilation albums on the market.

I was delighted to know that God still works in many ways, as long as His people desire to call out to Him. Our church is beginning to return to its roots and several groups have started with its main purpose of prayer.

His new book, \\"Fresh Faith\\" really does help one to yearn for that freshness of spiritual faith. Pastor Cymbala, not only shares some of the things that are happening in his congregation (and those stories ALONE are breathtaking), but also helps us to understand some of the great biblical stories from the aspect of faith and God's faithfulness.Don't be mistaken: This is NOT a \\"Word of Faith\\" book, and the author quite clearly states that fact. But, if read carefully, it will help the seeking believer to trust God's Word and to have faith inspired in their soul. All the stories and scriptures are inspiring. What is even more inspiring is a TRIP up to the BIG APPLE and a worship experience with this congregation. The only thing better than the book is THE TRIP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration for new believers","review":"This book was a great inspiration to me and my family. It gives many great examples of how god's grace grabs normal people like you and me and won't let go. Mr. Cymbalia puts things in terms to where you don't have to be a college scholar to understand things such as, the power and importance of prayer. My husband and I are new believers in Christ and this book has truly inspired us to continue our search for Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"*fresh is best!!!! *","review":"If you read fresh wind, fresh fire, YOU must read this book! This book I feel is Jim Cymbala's best yet. Do you feel like your prayers are going nowhere? Do you honestly know what faith is?...

You will not be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Strong \\"Follow-up\\" Book","review":"I read Fresh Wind Fresh Fire and could not put it down. It changed my life. However, I was very disappointed in Fresh Faith. I struggled to get through it. There is one section of the book that deals with Jeroboam that is outstanding - illustrating that we must trust God's plan and not our own thoughts. Most of the other stories and scripture references do not seem to interrelate well. Some stories are too short, some too long and few drive a point home. If you have read Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire, I would recommend re-reading it before purchasing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspiring to an extent","review":"The only drawback in my opinion was that the book focused mostly on all the good things - the situations that ended up happily-ever-after.

If you expect to hear a loud, bombastic, skirl indicative of the highland pipes emitting from your CD player, then prepare for disappointment. What you will hear is a buzzy and and somewhat reedy instrument. The pipes are called a \\"duda\\" or \\"\\"dudu\\" and are quite crude in design and sound, but still produce the fine music you hear on the album. Most of the tracks are dance tunes, many of them have signing. An interesting listen if you enjoy unusual music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Drill, Crappy Battery Life.","review":"I use this drill professionally since I'm a mobile electronics installer. I thought this drill was a good deal: 18-volts, case, charger, two batteries, and even a flashlight that uses the same battery.Problem is, the batteries won't hold a charge and this occurred only after a few months. Now I have to charge the batteries and use them immediately or they run dead. I can go through four or five charges in a day with only light use. The local hardware supply wants $89 for one Hitachi battery, more than I paid for two and the entire tool set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Drill","review":"Nice torque on either low or high setting for this drill. What surprised me was the second battery that came with it. In the details it does not show that. It also has a light/hook combo that lights the area you are drilling, although dim, it works better than no light. It also has a hook for your belt or pocket built in to it.

A contractor suggested that hitachi is one of the top brands and it rings true. I borrowed my friends 18v dewalt and it seemed a lot less precise than the hitachi. What i mean to say is that as soon as you let go of the trigger the drill dead stops unlike the dewalt where it keeps moving for a fraction of a second. That way you don't strip a screw more than normal. battery life seems good and it actually comes with a second battery and a flashlight that also uses the 18v battery.

I went on a 15+ mile backpacking trip down the Grand Canyon with this pack. It is fairly small and only intended for a night or two. The upside is that it keeps you from packing too much weight. The pack itself is pretty light and made of a thin vinyl type of material. Though it is thin material it held up really well. 15 miles and still looks like new. the straps are really comfotable and all adjust to make the pack fit almost perfectly. The only other way to get a better fit is to spend twice the money and get a fitted pack with a custom molded hip belt. The only reason the pack isnt getting five stars is the lack of easily accessible pockets and maybe even the location of the hydration bladder pouch.

Dark Funeral should take note that Mayhem aren't resting on past laurels and have moved beyond that album and created original music while maintaining their identity. I don't even know why I bothered buying this. None of their other CD's have had more than one spin in my player. The corpsepaint, new drummer and Tagtgren production can't hide bad songwriting and one dimensional vocals. I also like how the vocalist considers himself an emperor.

I usually wear Bali but was thrilled with the idea of the gel straps. But when they finally arrived and I ran into my room to try it on like a little girl with a new toy, my elation deflated. The girls looked like traffic cones!

While Katz' advice is cogent and can be practically applied, Holmes sounds like a loser wallflower who wouldn't know the first thing about attracting a man.

Jerks are not really attractive; after all, how many of you have fallen for a really whimpy, ugly, nerdy jerk? And if you do happen to luck out and find a guy whose both sexy and kind, wouldn't you fall for him instead? It' simple; it's the law of the jungle.

These little hellas feel nice in the hand and the wiring kit is pretty good quality as well. But thats where it ends. I installed them and they light up pretty well for the size. Next day they were filled with water! Both of them! We had a very small rain shower and both these things were fogged up with standing water in the bottom. These are supposed to be driving lights, and they can't stand up to a single day of use. Now I have an empty hole (switch) in my dash and drilled holes in my grill, so I basically destroyed my truck for no reason. I feel hella should reimburse me for this, as this is unacceptable by any means. Please listen to me, save your money and spare yourself and your vehicle the aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driving lights not as expected","review":"Installation instructions were good and easy to follow. However, lights made almost no noticeable difference when operated with my halogen sealed beam high beams. Now holes have been drilled and they have been mounted and I won't remove them but, just a word of advice; don't expect them to provide any improvement over your properly aimed high beams. These are not fog lights. I ordered \\"Driving Lights\\" to improve my long range visibility at night. I have a lot of deer that are active at night and are often on the road I take to work. Many near misses and these wimpy driving lights won't help. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent lamps","review":"I bought these to use as a daytime driving lamp.

It was more in line with what my practitioners were telling me, and had useful dietary information not only for use during cancer treatment, but for life.

Humans aren't machines! The theory is greatly flawed even though the exercises are probably good for light stregthening. Many of them borrow concepts from yoga or pilates. It is true that doing egoscue exercises can be good, if one has led a mostly sedentary lifestyle. At that pont, ANY exercise can be good. But I wonder about the good intentions of egoscue, especially when they will not answer any specific questions unless you sign up for a online menu (evaluation).

The exercises do not get very advanced. However, this is still a good book that will motivate you to find more advanced exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"good with some flaws","review":"This is a good book with some flaws. The exercises are great. However, once you determine which type of exercises you need and go to the list, there are no page numbers (only names of the exercises) which would have allowed you to easily refer back to the page that the particular exercise description is on. This makes it extremely frustrating to have to flip back and forth to find the needed exercise. I ended up putting lots of post it notes in the book with page numbers sticking out. This could have very easily been avoided with the addition of page numbers on the exercise list. Also, several exercises do not have illustrations making it difficult (unless you are a trainer or physical therapist) to know if you are really doing it correctly. ALL of the exercises should have had illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved Me From Surgury","review":"Excellent book..... Best kept secret.

Better body. It allowed me to focus doing the right thing for my body. Much easier than traditional PT, yoga or weigh lifting.

I opened the package while he eagerly awaited. Unfortunately, the set is a EXTREMELY poor quality. The rod fell apart in my hands -- the little trigger piece fell out and the inside of the rod crumbled into the table. I re-assembled it. But, the rod just would not work. The line wouldn't come out when I pressed the trigger release. To no avail, I tried every way possible to fix the rod and had some friends look at it. Nothing worked.Overall, this set is really weak and exemplifies the problems with selling a cheap Chinese-made pole. It tarnishes the good \\"Shakespeare\\" name and the history of decent fishing poles. I'd willingly pay double the price to have something that would last and actually work!Also, this is not a complete set.

I practically leaped for joy. I have a lot of jazz albums in my about 2500 album collection (a lot!) but I haven't yet found a collection of jazz piano recordings that gives such a comprehensive picture of all of the major players from the beginnings of recorded music on down. Unlike a lot of box sets, this is not merely a history lesson, it is a pleasure to listen to, and even the earliest tracks sound wonderfully remastered.

I have several. They take four C batteries if I recall correctly and they will last the entire season. Its really nice that they come on and off with the light. They have a switch you can turn to keep them at a steady light or a flickering option which makes them appear as real candles. They aren't as bright as I'd hoped but that just makes them look more like real candles. However, this is NOT a super-saver price.

I don't get the full effect I need a little more height. I did not think to measure the wooden frame around my windows. So the frame is to high so you really can not see the full candle from the outside. I would buy this product for the other windows that I have to go in the back of the house but I need to shop around now for height to get the look that I want.

The story circles around two characters; Kenji Harima the rebel and Tenma Tsukamoto the ditsy sweet heart. Harima loves Tenma but Tenma loves the awkward Karasuma, thus begins the funny, heart warming love triangle.The only problem I have with the anime is the ending, it leaves no closure and you have no clue what happen.Overall I loved it and would recommend it to everyone, the manga is more well rounded and even more funnier.

As for the set itself, I was sad to see that the third season was never made (it was a manga, not an anime... Although, they did a couple episodes as an OVA that are not included because of licensing issues apparently) It doesn't matter really, because the OVA didn't do season three justice.

The initial assembly was a tad cumbersome....but after getting into assembly line mode....went quickly after the first 2 or 3 were together. After that.....getting them spiked into the ground and lighted up took about 15 minutes. The clip-on electric terminals for each light to the main wire worked very well. Had them now for over three weeks...no problems. Included timer is a nice bonus, although I turn mine on/off with the outdoor light switch.We'll see how they stand up to time.

You can't select your coordinate system or datum. For those of us who want to actually work with maps or use these units in the field it's a major design flaw.It's far easier to work with UTM when you are going back and forth with a map than trying to deal with lat/long decimal numbers. I'm disappointed in the unit and frustrated that the lack of such a basic feature was not clearly stated in the advertising.

Unfortunately, it has kind of a \\"B\\" movie feel to it. As the lines are delivered rather flatly and the acting is lacking some spark. It also dwells too much on the lead's difficult relationship with her husband. On the one hand, it does show the having a family versus having a career dilemna that pretty much every girl faces at some point in her life. And it shows the very traditional male's mindset of what he expects in a wife. So it would be a good movie for a gender studies class or women's history course. However, as far as leisure watching is concerned, I was the only one who finished the movie. The other's with me, who were watching it fell asleep.On a side note, the lead movie star is quite an attractive actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is the cdrom light?/","review":"i purchased this album with full intent to harmonize while driving.

Her sound is an amalgamation of existing styles (to the extreme). To consider her a \\"Jazz\\" artist is pure fiction. My advice is to seek out the original practitioners of this sound and leave the imitators to the confused masses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony VAIO VGN-AR320E 17\\" Notebook PC Review","review":"I purchased this item in March 2007. The OS Vista has a lot to be desired in terms of program compatibility and internal bugs. I had to purchase accessories to interface with existing connections when the literature indicated these connections were on the lap top. The lap top is very annoying without an optical mouse. LCD quality is good and the screen is large but you still have to sit 2 feet away to maximize your visibility and to resolve the image. The speed is good and video is good for DVD and presentations.Would I buy this again? yes, but with XP not Vista."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total nightmare","review":"I bought the ar320 over a year ago and have had nothing but problems from day one. The keyboard had to be replaced twice, replaced the processor and finally the motherboard. It worked ok for a few months and I went to turn on yesterday and it would not power up. Sony tech support is a waste of time. Windows Vista is a joke. I regret the day I went with a sony. I totaly bought a lemon and I now own a $1800 paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk, do not buy any Sony Product","review":"This laptop is a piece of junk. Sony now is not the Sony like it used to be. This laptop has horrible battery life, and slow as hell. I bought the same laptop spec. from Dell, at the same time for my father, and his is still going strong. This Sony laptop that I have, the screen already has a big white line going straight down from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen about 1\\" wide, so the screen is split in half with zero pixels between this 1\\" wide defective screen. It's not even 2 years old. I bought it brand new. Never buy any Sony product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good","review":"I didn't like this book as much. I own every Robin Jones Gunn book available and i was sadly disappointed with this book. I found it kind of boring. I read it really quickly and got very little out of it. I also didn't like that this thin little diary had 5 years of her life in it. It missed way too much. The only part i really liked was when she was talking about the meaning of her 'Forever' bracelet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"Its a great book, but keep in mind that it is basically the summary of the first 4 volumes of \\"The Christy Miller Series.\\" So if you have already read them, it just gives you the stories in Christy's point of view as she writes in her diary. But if you havent read the volumes yet, then this can catch you up..i highly recommend reading the first 4 volumes, because her diary leaves out alot of my favorite details! But, it was really nice to read things that i had missed before!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A look at the Past and Future","review":"The Book of Daniel was just completed by our men's Bible study. These MacArthur studies are great because they allow lots of discussion on the Bible subject as well as current and introspective topics. Daniel, in particular, was a wonderful study for the absolute miracle of his prophesy. Current readers suddenly realize the fantastic depth and scope of these prophesies, which reach forward hundreds of years from the time they were written in the 6th century BC and are all completed except for those of the Antichrist. This book will astound you! This book is not just about Daniel and the lions den. This is about prophesy that co-responds with the Book of Revelation. I also recommend the commentary on Daniel by Phillips and Vines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crusaders of might and magic is the coolest","review":"Crusaders of Might and Magic is the coolest game I've ever played in this genre. Drake (the main charecter) is the only survivor of his village which was destroyed by the Legion of the Fallen. Necros, the boss of the legion, is the most powerful Necromancer alive. He can only be deafeted by \\"the scared one\\" the legends tell. Drake is the scared one. He is the only hope of good in the world.You play as Drake. You explore the land, killing any enemy in your path. You must complete every quest given to you. You collect magical items and weapons along the way and you can sell them at stores in the towns. You have to defeat Necros at any cost.The grafics in the game are the best I've seen for this type of game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I bought this CD collection to introduce my new gf to the wonder that is Louis Armstrong and since then she's never taken it out of her car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them!

After I took it home and played it I was very disappointed. You use a tank throughout the whole game and do nothing but shoot the same o same o.

YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON MR GRAHAM FOR HIGH QUALITY MUSIC THAT ISN'T \\"CHEESY\\". IT BEGINS PRETTY DARK AND PROGRESSIVE BUT PICKS UP THE PACE AFTERWARDS. AS GOOD AS IT IS HOWEVER, IT DOES LEAVE A BIT TO BE DESIRED. NOT THAT I CLAIM TO KNOW WHAT COULD POSSIBLY MAKE THIS MIX BETTER, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE MISSING A COUPLE OF ELEMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO PUT THIS CD IN MY ALL TIME TOP 5. I HAVE ENJOYED ANYTHING I HAVE EVER HEARD THAT JON GRAHAM WAS INVOLVED IN AND HIS TRANSPORT CD IS NO EXCEPTION.

But, what it is, is a great progressive house CD. Quivver knew what he had in mind when mixing this CD. Keep it dark, keep it deep. The CD cover even fits the mood. I am a big trance head, who just recently fell in love with the deep progressive sound, and i had this CD for months before i actually \\"heard\\" it. One day, you just listen, and the progressive sound hits you, just like trance did, or will do....i recommend this CD, but keep in mind, it is not a clubby,... shakin', hands in the air mix.

I would seriously consider picking up a copy of this, so get on your Trance Pants and get ready to be Transported to another dimension....:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"It is a fast scanner, however - its is neither accurate or is the software good. It's constantly saying \\"Not Responding\\" and freezing up. Also, there is no batch settings where you can tell it to save names in a cretin order. It likes to save them as \\"LastnameFirstname\\". Also, you cannot break out the address or name fields so it is hard to do a fast edit.It does export to many types of files and I like that a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Accurate Enough","review":"I've had this for a couple of years now and am overall disappointed with its accuracy. While it is definitely a time-saver (and somewhat of a headache-saver), it really isn't anywhere near accurate enough, so I still have to go through each card I've scanned to edit them.The only benefit to me is that I can enlarge a copy of the business card and so it saves my poor, aging eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not good enough","review":"The Scanner caused a little problem at first. After I restarted my computer, it worked ok. But the software was not good. My computer was P4 3.2GHz with 1G Ram, but the software consumed pretty much all the power of my computer. No other application could run. The user interface had to refresh for every inch you scroll. Imagine spending 20 seconds just to scroll from the top to the bottom of your contact list. I had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scanner Great Software is Poor!","review":"When I received the scannner I was impressed how easily it connected and machine calibrated itself.

It is my first scanner and I read the reviews before I purchased it. I understood that the scanner will not recognize any fancy fonts, thick cards, or unusual card designs but no one mentioned the fact that this scanner freezes after 3-4 cards. Once if freezes, you have to unplug it, and plug it again and redo.I am very disappointed and do not recommend it to anyone. I ended up scanning 400 cards, but it took me 9 hours to do (did not even include my hours modifying each card). I know I did spend that much time because I am a bookkeeper and I use a timer when I work on projects.My recommendation, shop around and go with a scanner that has better reviews even if it cost you a little more. If I had known then what I know now, I would have bought a different one. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for the Price","review":"Easy to install, and easy to edit. I've scanned about 100 cards so far, and most need about 1-2 typos changed per card, but it is so much easier than typing in ALL the data.

Amazon did not have information on this scanner to say for sure, but some other sites online did note that this is scanner can do double-sided scanning. This is *not* a duplex scanner. The included software allows the user to scan a double-sided card as a single record, but the user must manual scan both sides of the card separately. There are other scanners out there that can scan both sides in a single pass...Ambir and ScanShell both make these types of scanners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I have scanned over 500 cards using this new scanner. It has worked great and recognized over 90% of the content correctly. Only has problems with fancy fonts or cards that are hard to read in the first place. I highly recommend this card scanner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful for our business","review":"We purchased the card scanner because we acquire a lot of business cards/prospective customers from trade shows. This machine is a life saver - it will scan the card in very quickly and displays the scanned image right away. The contact details (company name, name, address, phone, fax, etc.) are also listed. The only problem we saw was that the card scan was not 100% accurate - it would scan the text correctly, but would populate some of the fields incorrectly. I would probably double-check things out a little bit, especially if the business card is very non-traditional.We currently use Salesfoce to keep track of these people and you can import this directly. Another great selling point is the fact that it is Windows 7 compatible. At work, we have Windows 7 and XP computers, so it's nice to be able to use this software/machine on any computer.All in all, it's a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saves a Lot of Work","review":"This product is very nice and easy to use. I installed it easily on a PC running Windows 7 64-bit OS and encountered no problems. It scans quickly and in most cases, accurately. The OCR is good, but it does do some funky things once in a while with cards that may be formatted unusually, it's fairly easy to correct errors, though, and the info appeared automatically in Outlook with no prompting from me.Overall, it's a very nice item with easy to use, intuitive software. Plus, it's way cheaper than other card scanners.As for scanning photos, which it claims to do, I don't know, I didn't buy it for that purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented","review":"When looking for a card scanner that would work with my Macintosh computer, the ad for this scanner state that it would work with both PC and MAC computers, which caused me to purchase this item.

The Penpower scanner had good reviews & seemed user friendly. And it was, at first. I successfully scanned TWO business cards before the software stopped recognizing the scanner hardware. I have since attempted to contact customer service literally DOZENS of times (it's now just the first thing I do when I get to work every morning) & have yet to hear back. Their website has a form that you fill out & submit - no 800 number is listed or anything. I just fill out the form & send it over & over & over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Card Reader","review":"Love this tool.

On our network it was a pain to load the software. The scanning was sub-par at the beginning, combining information from one card to another until I realized I had to mess with the settings repeatedly. It doesn't scan special fonts or logos well and almost every company we do business with uses one or both. I've transferred the info to Excel so that I can make corrections quickly and more accurately but moving them back into WorldCard or transfer to Google contacts is a messy process. I'm less than impressed and would have gone with a more accurate scanner had I known."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWII GI Gift","review":"In this time, when our Veterans from World War II are realizing how much we all need to hear their stories, THE AMERICAN ST.

No matter that the young men thought what they were doing was just a lark.Rebeccasreads highly recommends THE AMERICAN ST. NICK as a fine recollection of one shining moment in a dark horrendous conflict that glows like a child's grin. It is a tale, simply told, of bringing joy to some needy children & their community. It is also the story of how one town never forgot the GIs who gave of their bounty, & by doing so resurrected the Spirit of Christmas for a devastated people. Nor have they forgetten those GIs who gave their lives & never went home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wartime Christmas in Luxembourg","review":"This well written account by Peter Lion will touch your heart as you follow the story of GI's in Luxembourg in 1944 and a Christmas to remember. They donate their packages from home and Corporal Brookins plays the part of St. Nick. The people of Luxembourg remember this act of kindness on the part of our soldiers because it is still celebrated today as year after year the story is reenacted in the small town of Wiltz with our GI's as the honored guests. The book is well written and will give you a glimpse of the compassionate side of a terrible war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily misunderstood but groundbreaking","review":"This book is written for scholars of political science, not for casual readers or the anti-establishment. Claes Ryn describes a movement throughout Western politics that he calls the neo-Jacobins. The neo-Jacobins bear a resemblance to Rousseau in the sense that (1) they advocate the eradication of tradition and political and individual restraint, (2) their morality is such that they are always right, and anyone who opposes them is wrong. Neo-Jacobin thinking permeates through intellectual elites who stand to gain power from the two points above. The one criticism I have is that his description of the Jacobins may not be taken seriously because it comes across as a \\"conspiracy.\\" In fact, it is not a conspiracy, and many of the Jacobins are not aware that they are or have not thought carefully about where they stand. Still, such a manner of presentation may discourage serious readers from accepting his views."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yasmine Scores Once More","review":"I really liked and characters in the first book in the Chintz and China series. Emerald and the children grabbed me right away in \\"Ghost of a Chance.\\" I love the paranormal aspects. I found \\"Legend of the Jade Dragon\\" even better than the first. More intense, I had to stay up and finish it. I can't critique paranormal aspects like astral projection, never having experienced them, but I find it all great fun to read. I like the humor and reality of the characters, the fact that they have the same job, relationship, romance problems as everyone; they are not super heroes but come through in a pinch. What more could you ask of your friends and these characters have become friends. Can't wait for number three.
