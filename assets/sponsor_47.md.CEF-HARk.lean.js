Some of them can be tightened back up but come loose again. The company I used to get these from no longer carry them. They have been in business for over 75 years.

My dad bought one last week because of the price, but after we set it up we assumed we had a bad one. We took it back to the store and got a replacement. It looked just as bad. Finally I asked my dad if he looked at the one in the store. He had, but they were running a screen saver so he couldn't tell too much about the quality. So we took this one back for a refund. We had them stop the screen save and the minute the Windows desktop came up you could see how bad it was compared to the other brands in the store.

Since purchased, it's been repaired under warranty 4 times (in the last 6 months). I can guarantee you, if you want to waist your money and time, buy this KOGI monitor, then refresh your memory what I have told you and warned you about. Even the fact: the company Kogi doesn't exist in the world. They are making this item under the company name Gvision, which most likely the same garbage, as a Kogi. They are based in the S.California and their customer support is NULL. I have purchased this item with a rebate, which I have never received from them. When called them on the phone, they said that they have never received anything from me, although I have a mailing receipt. The bottom line is: this monitor is GARBAGE, the company is fake and there nobody you can possibly complain about all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine arrived with a Racing Stripe","review":"Appears to be a very bright, focused monitor. Text is very clear. No problem tuning it in. Only one problem, a 1 1/2\\" vertical stripe down the middle of the screen. Called Gvision tech support and they said to return the monitor, but they had a curious question. The tech asked if it was a black monitor. From that I gather there may be problems with the black ones. Also, the one I received was manufactured in Dec. 2002. That makes it nearly two years old already. If it hadn't been defective it could have easily gotten 4 stars maybe five. Didn't try the speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for one year, then died","review":"I purchased a 17\\" Black Kogi LCD flat panel in November of 2003 and loved the monitor that I got for the money. The speakers were quite pathetic, but I used my surround sound system instead. The image quality was very good, and I used to brag to my friends about the low price I paid for this LCD. Well all that changed in December 2004, when the unit completely died and won't power up. My unit died just a few days after the one year warranty expired, and trying to work with this manufacturer is a nightmare -- they never call or email back ever! Because of the poor customer service and bad warranty, I can not longer recommend Kogi, but only tell you to buy an LCD that has a good warranty. I recently purchased a Princeton 714, and it comes with a great warranty (full 3 years, even on the backlight) and DVI input for less cost than the Kogi.My Kogi has been retired to the landfill, and I will never again purchase a Kogi/GVision product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright, No Dead Pixels, Excellent Value","review":"For the price, this monitor can't be beat. It is very bright, and not a dead pixel. Of course, that's not a guarantee for the next person that buys.

At full price, this set might be a little overpriced, but the clearance price is a great bargain. There's a lot of possibilities for imaginative play with these sets, particularly when they are combined. My only hesitation would be that they appear very fragile, but so far we have not had any breakage. Also, they are ridiculously difficult to get out of the package. But other than that, I highly recommend this Bess set. Get the Rani and Tinkerbell sets, too, if you can. This is the stuff little girls dream of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total junk","review":"My daughter didn't play with it much, she didn't \\"get\\" it, and it still managed to break in no time.

Age, honesty and lyrical range make them the most mature, creative unit in the hip-hop game. From the first track until the end, you get slammin' stripped-down production and complex lyrics, and even a couple of the skits (De La, for better or for worse,were the pioneers of skits)are hilarious.The first few tracks are the best: \\"Bionix,\\" \\"Baby Phat,\\" \\"Simply (where Dave flips perfectly like Greg Nice and Smooth),\\" and the best track, \\"Simply Havin',\\" where they flow over that still-hot \\"Footprints\\" track from Tribe's first joint.The drugs and sex joints sound out-of-place, and the CD starts to lag at the end, but overall, this is a solid De La CD. I'll be looking for vol. III."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dope","review":"I must admit it took me several years after purchasing to listen to the album.

It means that you recognize their talent, creativity & hard work. De La blew my mind with this album. Those of you that didn't like Pawn Star have no sense of humor & wouldn't get satire if it pimp-slapped you in the face. The B-Real track is one of my favorites in their entire catalog. It is a joke guys, open your ears. Anyway, I thought the previous album was a little uneven & it didn't get a lot of play from me but I played this album @ least 200x in my car.

This album continues the tradition of superior lyrics over good beats. It is too bad the masses will never truly appreciate De La. If you are looking for \\"studio gangstas\\", don't buy this album. If you want good, quality music, but this album. Baby Phat is one of the tightest jams to hit the airwaves in a while and it gives props to thick, beautiful women, not those skinny video ... Slick Rick joins the party on \\"What We Do For Love\\". the jam \\"Special\\" is my favorite cut on the album even though it strays a little from traditional De La. I think a lot of guys can relate to the lyrics.I don't think \\"Bionix\\" is as good as \\"Mosaic Thump\\" but not many other albums out the are. Can't wait for the next installment of A.O.I.

They did hit me with a fresh, unexpected style. Unfortunately, this style sounded more like R. Kelly than the Roots. Maybe it was because they were trying to be as futuristic as the album's concept, but the album had a generally overproduced, whiny, R&B sound. Not a lot of tight, forceful rhyme-dropping. And not much of the laid back, silly style that endeared us all to these guys to begin with, though I guess that has been gone for a while. One bright spot is \\"Held Down,\\" which, though kind of R&B-like, has a great beat, and features some good verses. Inspiring and passionate--certainly not typical De La Soul, but very good. Let's hope that the third incarnation of Art Official Intelligence, which they left no doubt they would be releasing, is nothing like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT Better, Stronger or Faster...","review":"When I bought this album I was most definitely disappointed. It was really not worth the money.All the tracks in the album are mediocre especially \\"Baby Phat\\", \\"Pawn Star\\", and \\"What We Do\\"One reasonable track is \\"Simply Havin'\\" which uses a sample already by used A Tribe Called Quest. Along with the electronic female narrator De La do \\"borrow\\" quite a bit from A Tribe Called Quest in this album.The only track that is close to being good is \\"Watch Out\\", which uses a sample from Cal Tjader's Cubano Chant, but having said this the sample could have been used a lot better.I think De La have just finally succumbed to the Dollar which soon enough tempts and destroys hip hop artists.De La Soul IS Dead"},{"rating":"1","title":"on because there weren't half stars available","review":"what can i say... de la's first 4 albums are heavy rotation classics for me, and this entire AOI series has been a disappointment so far. i know it's what's going on in hip hop today, but where the hell are the break beats? whatever happened to the art of sampling?if you're green on de la, and don't own any of their albums, i would suggest de la is dead, 3 feet high, stakes is high, or balloon mindstate (probably in that order)before purchasing Bionix or Mosaic Thump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"I would have given this 5 stars but the two tracks on here were totally [bad] so I have to minus some cool points and minus mad cool points for the young kid who wrote lam.

Coming into track 9 (Special,) I was pretty surprised how decent this CD was turning out to be. However, by the closing of the aforementioned track, the album took a nose dive that it would never come back from. All of the badness in Bionix culminates in what is quite possibly the worst song of all time, Pawn Star. Extra disrespect goes to Simply Havin, which uses the exact same sample as in ATCQ's \\"Footprints.\\" One would think that they're familiar with Tribe's material, but whatever.For the most part, this CD is garbage and doesn't hold up to De La's standards in the least. Perhaps you could buy Simply and Held Down on ITunes, but buying the CD as a whole is a complete waste of money. It certainly isn't worth the 14 bucks I spent for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Sad Sad","review":"This album makes me very sad. Its really horrible to hear such a great, once innovative group make an album that is so...blah. The vibrant neon colors of the first three albums are now washed to grey.

This CD is just fabulous and so powerful. Although it seems like most people don't like the song \\"For Always\\", I find it quite pleasing to the ear if you don't listen to it more than 10 times. Track number 12 really brings back memories from the movies finale and brought me to tears the first time I listened to it. This is a CD that needs to be bought AFTER seeing the show to be fully appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A. I. - Absolutely Incredible","review":"An incredible effort by Mr. Williams. Haunting, touching, enegmatic, exhilirating and heartfelt.I really enjoyed the score while watching the film, but now that I've heard it on it's own, it's full power has been revealed to me. I especially like the Abandoned In The Woods and Stored Memories cues. Also impressive is the original song 'For Always' which appers twice on the soundtrack (first sung by Lara Fabian and then later on as a duet with Lara Fabian and Josh Gorban), but nowhere in the film. I was a bit nervous about hearing this song, but it captures a feeling of the movie terrificaly and I find myself listening to it more than the score itself at times.It seems that most of the score has been included, but I thnk there is a bit that didn't make it onto the disc which is a shame. Also the tracks aren't in chronological order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is a wonderful score. It features Josh Groban, Lara Fabian, and of course the master... John Williams.I would definately say this is one of his best. It reminds me of some of the other Spielberg collaboration scores. Mainly, Empire of the Sun, and War of the Worlds. Lots of the score is wonderful emotional underscoring. It's very complex, and full of interesting scales and keys. Of course, there is plenty of gorgeous thematic material to make the score complete. Honestly, I have never heard a bad John Williams score. Come to think of it, I've never heard one that was less than brilliant and amazing. Really, give this a listen.Please vote me helpful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Usually a huge fan of John Williams, I found the soundtrack of A.I. to be boring and not up to his usual standard of excellance.

I have not bought the soundtrack but from the listings, Rock is not included. Can anybody tell me if this was Kid Rock or know of who it was playing? Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Score","review":"Yet again, John Williams has produced an excellent score to an intriguing film of Steven Speilberg. The score features many tracks very similiar to his previous work with shades of Close Encounters and E.T. Definitely worth listening to and purchasing if you are a fan of his work.A particular favorite of mine is his song \\"For Always\\" which tenderly serves as the mother/son theme for the film. Just beautiful. It wonderfully expresses the strong feelings of David's love for his mother. A nice contrast to the cold and dark themes that are always present in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Williams Continues To Be A Movie Music Maestro","review":"This is just another case for making John Williams a Conductor Laureate in Cinema Movie Score Heaven. The soundtrack for Steven Spielberg's 2001 movie A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is yet another masterpiece for the man. A thoroughly unconventional mix of orchestral, electronic, and choral sounds, with nods to the classical music of Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and the minimalism techniques of such composers as Phillip Glass and John Adams, the A.I. soundtrack is brilliantly conceived. But it must also be seen in context with the movie, which I believe in my heart of hearts was grossly and unfairly trashed. Both film and music are poignant in their own ways. This soundtrack score is one of the best in Williams' long and extremely distinguished career."},{"rating":"2","title":"JOHN WILLIAM'S ODE TO ARTIFICIALITY","review":"Yet another fine piece of orchestation from the talented William's! Like on his other soundtrack work, Williams has managed the pack the emotional content of the film into his beautiful melodies. He has also ventured into new territory with his use of electronic sounds, this seems appropriate being that the movie is about artificiality. This is great stuff! I gave just 4 stars simply because it doesn't quite achieve what William's accomplished on such films as Star Wars and E.T., but whose complaining? It's still quite amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my Lhasa Apso","review":"This blade is the perfect length for my Lhasa.

Also, I have read it is not great to carry an infant hanging by his/her crotch with the feet dangling.I got an Ergo Baby Carrier instead and I love it so much more - it doesn't allow the babies to look out like in the Bjorn, but my baby doesn't mind, and the Ergo can be worn on my back when my baby can hold his head up better. In the Ergo, his weight is distributed on my hips mostly and it makes him feel so much lighter than when he is in the Bjorn. Plus, it fits my 6'5\\" husband and the Bjorn does not.

This carrier did not achieve that goal. I ended up returning it.This carrier is simply not that different from the original. I really do like the original one, and I switch off using that with another carrier (the AWESOME Sleepy WrapSleepy Wrap Baby Wrap Carrier -Gray, also available on Amazon). We are now also experimenting with the Ergo."},{"rating":"1","title":"try the ergo or moby wrap","review":"I tried the Bjorn when my baby was only 10lbs. and my shoulders ached for days after. I returned it. I thought because of the high price and name, it would be worth it, but boy was I wrong. I used the moby wrap and loved it. A little warm but baby feels so light in there. Great for travelling on the plane. I love my Ergo as well. My baby is 21lbs. now and I can still easily carry her in the Ergo."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have!!!","review":"This has saved me so many times. Have you ever been home alone and your little one will not let you put them down so you can do some essentials around the house???? This has been a lifesaver for those situations. I have been able to water my plants, fold laundry (takes a bit more time when he grabs the clothes I'm folding), make dinner, clean bottles, etc. The key is to start them early so they get use to being in the carrier. My son has never had an issue with being in it, he really loves it b/c I think he feels like he can see more and be apart of what is going on. I'm not sure if the back support really supports your back, it doesn't seem any different than others I have tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"The Best there is, very comfortable and supportive.Good price for what you get.Back system is the best you can find"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better carriers out there","review":"Baby Bjorn was the pioneer for baby carriers 10 years ago but since then there has been an explosion in the market - slings, front carriers, pouches, etc. The BEST, in my honest opinion, is the Ergo. The baby sits with correct posture (The Bjorn is not so great for the baby's spine) and the parent is not in pain! I can walk for hours with my 20 lb baby in the Ergo -- not so in the Bjorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine if you just want a carrier for a newborn","review":"Don't be fooled into thinking that this carrier is the best by the sheer number of them out there. We were given one by our parents when our son was born and it was fine for the first few months. However, as soon as he hit 15 lbs the shoulder pain became unbearable when wearing him for more than 5 minutes. We did an incredible amount of research and switched to an Ellaroo Mei Hip (also available on Amazon) and have never looked back. They are incredibly comfortable and shift the weight to the hip instead of the soft part of the shoulder. (Our friend has the Ellaroo Mei Tai carrier for her newborn and loves that too.)Again, this isn't a bad carrier, it just isn't that functional afte rthe first few months. Its also padded in such a way that it is difficult to fold it up small enough to carry in the diaper bag and still have room for other stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works better than original one!","review":"I like this baby carrier a lot. I tried few other carriers but i can say the back support really helps. I am a tall person and my baby is heavier than avarage babies. I traveled overseas with him when he was 5 months and it was so comfortable. It wasn't a problem carrying him and two carry-ons at the same time at the airport. I recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I thought I am buying the best one on the market but from day one my son never fit in it right. He is 8 weeks old and I used it once. When he was couple of weeks old at almost 10 pounds he was very very tight in it and now at 8 weeks we have to put him face front and he is still tight in the carrier. Don't recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you believe it's made in China???","review":"This is my second Bjorn. I can't believe I thought this was a Swedish product. Talk about false advertising. My poor baby has licked so much of this....how awful! We have really tried to rid our home of made in China baby products. It's not easy.I think it's really shameful that Bjorn pretends it's a Swedish product. Imagine the fat margins on this product!! It's about the same price it was 10 years ago when it was made in Sweden.By the way, my son is 18 lbs and after 20 minutes or so, this carrier hurts."},{"rating":"1","title":"hurts my back","review":"This worked fine until my baby was about 10 pounds. Then my back started killing me on our long walks. So I bought the Ergo carrier, which is much better. My baby is now 10 months old (about 18 pounds) and she loves being in the Ergo. And I love the Ergo too, because puts the weight on my hips and feels great even on our long walks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mommys helper","review":"I find this item to be a lifesaver myself. I wore the Bjorn through two babies. It allowed me to feel a sense of freedom inside and outside of the house. I wore this to many functions for long periods. The two issues I do agree with is that the flap does pop up into the baby's face at time. They should definately put some sort of snap there. Also, when the baby does get to the 23 pound mark, the shoulder straps could use a little more cushion. Otherwise, I love this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"This carrier is very comfortable for both our son and I. It's lightweight, durable and easy to use. I'm 6'2\\" and 280 pounds and it could work on someone bigger than I, the straps have about 4 inches leftover on each side after I pull them snug. Getting him in and out is easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better for the back","review":"My baby is now 20 pounds and my back can't take carrying her in the original anymore - even a short trip to the grocery store was getting too much. The lumbar support makes a big difference (for some reason for my upper back mostly), but still a bit sore in the traps on long walks. She loves it, and the front flap stays down great, in contrast to what another reviewer said. I did notice I have to tighten it quite a bit for the back support to work, but don't even notice it once we get going. I am 5'7 and 140 if that makes a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it!","review":"We used the carrier only as long as the baby was under approx. 6 kg, and even in that time it was not really confortable. When our son got bigger we was hanging to low in the carrier, almost up to our knies, and for us it was very painful to carry him because of a presure on our shoulders. Besides, it is not healty for the baby to be carried like that: in the babybjörn the baby is not sitting properly, the hips are not at the 90degrees angle, how they should be, but the legs are hanging almost straight down, which is really bad! And it is even worse for the hipps to carry the child looking in front, I just do not understand why people are still doing it! Do not buy a babybjörn, there are some much better products than that carrier, like e.g. from ErgoBaby - we are still carrying our son in it for hours and he weights 12kg now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best for bigger infants... not newborns!","review":"I own this one in green and love it. It actually SAVES my back from carrying my daughter a lot. I have a colicky baby so that I can hardly put her down. It's really comfortable for my child and I and SO easy to use even it looks complicated. It only takes me seconds to put it on. When my daughter was under 3 months old, it was a little bit big for her (her head flopped way back in a very uncomfortable position. I had to use the Original style instead). Now when she is older and heavier, this one is the perfect carrier. I absolutely recommend this style for bigger infants, not newborn though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ubiquitousness does not equal greatness","review":"I got this carrier because I have seen it everywhere, so I figured it must be good. I am writing this review in an attempt to save you from making the same mistake I made.Baby Bjorn carrier active:PRO:-only carrier I have found where baby can face outCONS:-weight of baby is not evenly distributed, so nearly all of baby's weight pulls on your shoulders (very painful)-baby must be at least 8 lbs (slings and Ergo carriers take any size)-the fabric doesn't breathe, so you both get sweaty even in cold weather-there are 3 large strips of fabric that hang down, getting in the wayIf you are looking for a comfortable, easy to use, versatile carrier that can be used for all ages as both a front, side and back pack, get the Ergo: ERGO Baby Carrier w/ Solid Lining - Black w/ Green. Wrap carriers seem great, too, but I never could figure out all the straps.Good luck and happy carrying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I highly recommend the baby Bjorn active carrier it is very comfortable. First I purchased the jeep model because it was much cheaper, but after a trip around the block with my 8 lbs, one month old baby, I realized that I need a back support- I felt pregnant again. Thus, I ordered the baby Bjorn model and what a difference, I can do so much more around the house, I also use it outside like going on a hike or shopping. It is much easier than caring a car seat everywhere. In addition, when I place my baby facing me he falls right back to sleep in it. He seems to be very secure in it - just like when he was in the womb. My baby is now three months old and he is at the stage where he gets to see the rest of the world in the carrier. He is very quiet every time I place him in it. from my own experience the baby Bjorn active carrier is the best help I could get around the house - and its well worth its price."},{"rating":"1","title":"need a bottle of mucsle rub after you wear this","review":"I wore this for an hour and my neck was killing me!! I had to send back, I haven't found one that is comfortable yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't live without it!","review":"I love my Baby Bjorn. The lumbar support is key! The only thing that I wish is that the weight limit was higher. My daughter at 11 months has already grown out of it. But she loves her Baby Bjorn so much that she walks around with it, kisses it and makes us kiss it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"supports only small baby","review":"It works very good. I like it. But it supports small baby only. I would hope it supports bigger baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carrier","review":"I have been using my carrier for my 2 month old and I love it. She is very comfortable in it and loves to look around. It feels snug and secure, no back or neck pains, but she is still only around 13 pounds. The only thing I don't like about the design are the three staps that just hang in the front. Seems like a lot of extra material that needs to be cliped or tied somehow. Otherwise, a great product at a great price on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't live without it!!","review":"My hubby and I LOVE this carrier, it is very comfortable on our backs, easily adjustable and I don't know how people would do without it!! We walk with our son and our two dogs, he loves it and the dogs still get their attention too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought it because of all the good reviews but it is not worth the money. It made my shoulders and neck stiff and I couldn't use it more than 15 minutes at a time. Save your money, shoulders and neck and don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lumbar support does nothing","review":"I got this based on the fact that everyone seems to have a BabyBjorn. It is useful for the first few months since it's easy to use and provides head support. However, I abandoned it as she got older since the weight of the baby rests entirely on the shoulder muscles making it painful after a short time of walking. The lumbar support doesn't really do anything since the weight stays on your shoulders anyway. Definitely not worth spending the extra for it. I have since purchased a different baby carrier that distributes weight mainly to the hips. This was really useful for travelling as I can walk around for hours with her on and not feel anything other than sore feet from walking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the petite woman","review":"I purchased this carrier and found that once I returned to my pre-baby size it didn't fit. I am 5ft and have a slight build. I am not able to pull the straps tight enough to feel that my son is secure. I am now on my third carrier and it seems to fit perfectly (The Ergo carrier original works, Red Castle Sport is also too big). If you want to purchase this make sure you try it on and put a real baby into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for traveling","review":"We used this carrier recently on baby's first trip via airplane. It was great carrying him around in the airport and having my hands free for luggage and other stuff. The carrier is sturdy and comfortable. I was able to sit on the plane with him strapped in asleep, which was nice. We used the carrier with him facing him forward as well. The nice bonus with this carrier, and I suspect with other carriers, too, is that you don't have to take him out of it when you go through the metal detector at the airport security gate, since the carrier has no metal parts. This is especially wonderful if your baby is already asleep and you don't want to disturb him/her just to get through security.The only downside with the carrier that we've found is that it's pretty difficult to adjust it for various baby sizes. The carrier did not hurt my back at all, and I'm fairly petite with an average-size baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for flying babies!","review":"I got this carrier after taking back the Eddie Bauer brand. So much nicer quality! I use it all the time! Very easy to take on and off and to get a squirmy baby into and out of! This was perfect for flying with my 3-month-old. I just strapped him in, he fell asleep, and I had my hands free on the plane! I also use it when at the mall, the grocery store, or out walking the dog. The back support is great too. Washes up well. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving Opera a bad name","review":"As a an Opera listener, this music hurts my ears.This CD is nothing more than pretty packaging to conceal Bocelli's voice which is woefully inadequate for his style of emotional pop, much less opera. As a performer, he would be much better off singing pop tunes, but of course that does not pull on the heartstrings of a less than aware consumer like his \\"syrupy\\", over done version of operatic pop. As a listener, there are many choices in opera and contemporary Italian music which far surpass this weak, misguided attempt.If Bocelli were not blind, he would never be the star that he has become."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobble wobble wobble","review":"Weak singing of boneless music by overrated musician for lazy listeners.

It is so beautifully composed and sung by Andrea Bocelli. I was so pleased with this CD that I bought 6 of them, so far, for myself, family and friends. I have spoken to many people about this CD and am honored to write this review. It is truly a masterpiece that I highly recommend to anyone who loves classical music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bocelli at his best...","review":"This is a magnificent album, one of the best yet of Andrea Bocelli. My personal favorite is \\"Il misterio del amore\\" (no 7), but all the songs on this album are fantastic.Bocelli's voice has a ring of sincerity and warmth that is unrivalled. Bocelli brings into his songs all the qualities of his personality, without ever being pretentious.A great gift, but also an album you should not be without yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cieli di Toscana","review":"The first time I listened to it I did not fully appreciate how lovely this CD is.

Since then I have purchased all his others, but none come quite to the height of inspiring me as the first one. His feelings are apparent in all his singing. One can't help but feel the emotion flowing with the fantastic music. He may be called the \\"fourth\\" tenor, but with me, he is the \\"first\\". If you are looking for music to touch your very soul, this piece is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"What took me so long?","review":"This was my first Andrea Bocelli CD and I've since bought most of his others. I love both his classical and pop albums, but Cieli di Toscana is my favorite so far--I'm only sorry I didn't find him years ago. E Sara' A Settembre never fails to make me smile. L'Abitudine is one of the best on this CD, but every track elicits emotions that only Andrea's moving, heavenly voice can inspire. When I'm having a rough day at the office, I put on Cieli and actually relax a little when I hear the first notes of Melodramma. Thank God for Andrea Bocelli!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bocelli Fans Will Love This CD","review":"OK, Bocelli does not have a \\"great\\" operatic voice. But lets be honest, some \\"great\\" operatic voices have been known to cause people to roll on the ground in mock pain, at least the entire male side of my family.Bocelli has a lyrical, warm and very pleasant voice, which is enriching to the ears and to the soul. He stays away, again, from operatic gymnastics which lend themselves to the \\"pain\\" performances.This CD is relaxing and enjoyable, light but fulfilling. My husband and sons actually \\"don't mind\\" it and one of them actually likes it (he insists on staying anonymous)Great dining, romanace, day dreaming or Sunday-Read-The-Paper with coffee music."},{"rating":"2","title":"SENSATIONAL","review":"This cd is AB's best pop album yet.

It is a pleasure to listen to from begining to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VOICE IN THE WORLD","review":"Of all the CDs by Bocelli, this is the most original, and I think his most passionate POP music so far. The orchestrations are beautiful, and his voice makes this CD, for me, a Five star production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Love Songs","review":"Love songs in a setting by the sea, ALL very BEAUTIFUL. There is somewhat of a contemplative mood to this album. I think that the \\"paced\\" tempo in some of these selections is meant to evoke the sea through wavelike repetitions, but there is a certain monotony to the album as a whole.My favorites were Melodramma; Mille Lune Mille Onde; Mascagni; Il Mistero Dell' Amore; Se La Gente Usasse Il Cuore; L'Habitudine; Il Diavolo E L'Angelo.L'Habitudine ends as a duet sung with Helena. Prefigures the great Vivere album which contains several stupendous duets.L'Incontro was written by Bocelli about his baby son.An attractive pamphlet comes with the album and contains some nice pictures of Bocelli. It includes English translations of all the songs, for which I was very grateful.There are a few passages where the loudness of the orchestra seems to overwhelm a softness of the voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Became A Andea Bocelli Fan this past Christmas......I am Hooked.Slowly aquireing his Cd's & Dvd\\"sThis CD is awesome..Of,course, Anything Bocelli would sing is going to be awesome.Delivery was fast, CD' still sealed in package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cieli di Toscana","review":"First of all the sound is terrible.

Very disapointed in this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good Eurotrash balladeer is a very bad opera singer","review":"I think Andrea Bocelli is a likable EuroPop singer, but I cannot imagine why he ever thought he might sing opera. His voice is tiny, uninteresting and utterly dependent upon amplification. It bothers me to know that people who don't know opera think he is a real operatic tenor. What a horrible insult to real opera tenors!I love Bocelli as a pop tenor, and think he is the perfect Italian answer to Julio Iglesias. However, as a classical singer, I think he is an embarrassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on people....","review":"Bocelli is a vastly overrated singer with shockingly little talent when you get right down to it. It works on some of the real crossover stuff he sings (like with Sarah Brightman), but not on this CD. The magic of the producer and modern technology cannot overcome Bocelli's inherent mediocrity. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toscana","review":"What a disappointment! Absolutely stultfying compositions- so uninspiring that from the first song I was yawning . Half the time he sounds like an untrained singer, sliding up to reach his note, and half the time he's flat. The worst part is that he inspires no EMOTION! He walks through his songs. He is VERY overrated!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A ridiculous offense against good singing!","review":"Another hideous travesty unleashed against a public who, by now, should know better. Bocelli's voice and abilities at musical interpretation are absurdly substandard by any metric and even the miracles of 21st century signal processing cannot improve the thoroughly annoying sound of his voice and his feeble attempts at evoking emotion. The overdone instrumental accompaniment only accentuates the comic aspects of this magnificently inadequate rendition.Anyone who would prefer to listen to this ineffable rubbish over a ninety year old recording of Caruso deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"malavoce","review":"Here's the truth: What little voice he once had is now gone. He will sing a few bars and then rely on the instrumentalists in his group (i.e., the flutist, violinist, etc.) to fill in the rest. His range has shrunk; his tone, always thin and reedy, has diminished almost to the vanishing point. His forays into opera have stretched his limited resources to the point of collapse, and, worst of all, he has become even more tedious and dull. I once thought of him as the Yanni or John Tesch of Italian pop, but that would be an insult to those men now. He needs to hang it up, but as long as there are the tone-deaf and uninformed in the public, willing to purchase his recordings, I guess he'll stick around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Molto Bene","review":"Sempre con la musica di Bocelli nel cuore, una voce singulare - I always have Bocelli's music in my heart, such a unique voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bocelli","review":"I think that Bocelli has a pleasant voice, but as a musician he is unprofound, unsophisticated, and ordinary. Because he has no passion or fire in his voice, he comes across boring. I think this CD was successful because the pieces he chose appeal to the general public. In my opinion, this CD will be good for somebody who enjoys pleasant background music; however, it is not recommended to somebody who seeks high quality classical music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Thin in Sound and Content!","review":"I drove over 50 miles to get this CD on the day it was issued, such was my exictement about a new Bocelli work!! I am SO very disappointed in his effort to produce a match for his Sogno and Romanza music. This work is thin in production and on many cuts his voice seems stretched to it's limit. Although there are a few songs I enjoy, I find overall that I am vastly disappointed in what is considered an effort of two years to produce. Had this been the first CD of his I were to buy, I would surely not purchase any others. SO, for those of you contemplating a piece of work by this incredible performer, please purchase Sogno, or Romanza to hear the true talent and wonder of this amazing man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new under the sun","review":"Anything by Andrea is worth listening to right? Well no. This CD lacks the spirit and soul of previous recordings. It is at best tepid and at worst boring. I did not care for any of the songs and when Andrea sang of a thousand moons I could only think of a thousand reasons to return this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing This Time","review":"Andrea is such a talent, but he misses the mark this time. The tunes are pretty, but what happened in the studio is puzzling. For most of the collection Bocelli's voice is very weak and the instrumentals overpower him, upsetting the balance. There is little of the energy and power displayed so beautifully in Sogno and Romanza, in fact, the musicians seem bored. Try again Andrea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for fans of classical music and opera","review":"If you like true classical, operatic singing, than Andrea Bocelli is not for you. This fellow has a pleasant voice but does not sound like a classically trained singer--he strains for high notes and sings terribly out of tune, and his repertoire is schmaltzy pander. He, like poor Charlotte Church, is simply the product of slick marketing.If you want to hear a real tenor, listen to Jose Cura or old recordings of Fritz Wunderlich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly.","review":"I have heard Mr. Bocelli sing before and I don't believe all the audiences he's reached. Fine, he has talent but also horrible training, and his voice isn't felxible at all. All of you should try to listen to Caruso or di Stefano then you will hear a big difference. Honestly, if he wasn't blind he wouldn't be famous. The truth hurts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"It's not opera, and maybe there are others with better voices, but this album is beautiful from beginning to end. I play it all the time and it is soothing to the soul. I'm glad he didn't share any of the songs with other artists.

Second, while I like both performances of the Live in Studio A set, I think they really should've thought to just do one CD because both are essentially the same performance just a different arrangement of songs. Because to be honest, I doubt I'm going to be playing all 3 in a row ever again. Both of the Alive are good and the Scream for me Brazil disc is incredible, it's just like playing the same CD twice.

It isnt incredibly accurat but i would get it unless you are shooting something smaller than the target they give you which sucks because wen you hit it it falls over so you dont know where you hit it no point in the target over all i give it a 4 because there is better but this is like a average good gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!!!!!!!!","review":"when i got this gun i found that the laser is not accurate but the gun is totally awesome.it shoots so far!!!i love it.!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nite Finder is great!","review":"This Nerf gun is awesome! It shoots great! Its laser thing works okay if you are shooting about 15 feet away from your target. It is easy to modify (if you no what your doing) and by simply removing one part gets about an extra 10 feet. The only bad thing is that it only has a single shot barrel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice.","review":"This is a very nice nerf gun. It's well built and feels very solid. The laser (it isn't a real laser) targeting system is a nice addition. My only complaint is that it can only shoot one shot at a time. It would be nice if the darts were smaller and the gun was magazine fed. Other than that though, it is great. It kinda reminds me of the Falcon 2 from Perfect Dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably cool!!!","review":"When I bought this gun, I was like, \\"Ok, for 8 bucks I'll take it.\\" I thought the laser sight would be a piece of crud, but I was amazed. It actually makes a dot even 20 feet away. If you adjust the sight right, it's dead acurate. If you're looking for a sweet nerf gun with awesome acuuracy, get this. (Fun to annoy siblings with)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price","review":"For the price this is one of the best nerf guns you can get. With some simple modification (ie rubber bands to make it pull in faster, to bigger springs and taking out the air restrictors) it can be a great gun.In stock form it also has the benefit of being fairly silent, while still shooting a decent distance and being accurate. The led \\"laser\\" sight once adjusted is also fairly accurate, although whenever I lay the gun down the adjusting arm hits something and becomes off again..so pretty much worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy is not that great besides cool light beam","review":"This is a good toy when modified but its still pretty cool unmodified too. The light beam is what makes this toy so awsome because you can blind people before you shoot them. When this toy is modded it will be a powerful little gun. Personally I think you should buy this toy if you know you are going to have fun with it but after a while this toy gets boring and gets thrown in the closet. But if you mid it you will have more fun unmodded."},{"rating":"2","title":"nerf is good","review":"This gun was over all great but after getting it a few days ago I ran into some problems with the ammo.

I mod guns I know how thick the plastic shells are.Want a light for your gun? get some duct tape and a laser or a flashlight. This single shot gun sucks for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty awsome","review":"The toy is pretty good and has deadley accuracy but only one out of the three they give u work so I highly recomened the seperate 20 pack of Darts(or any other size).

Unfortunately I found myself aching to put this book down and pick up something else. The story is about an assassin working for munitions suppliers who kills an influential British anti-war figure in the days leading up to WWII. He is betrayed and races to confront his betrayers before the police catch up with him. Sounds like good stuff, but for some reason it isn't. Part of the problem is that Greene gets sidetracked into painting little portraits of every peripheral character encountered. While well-fleshed out characters are required ingredients for any good story, Greene goes overboard and the story drags and suffers as a result. Next time I'll try one of his more famous books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful watch for women who don't like bulky jewelry","review":"Compared to other Seiko watches I have worn, this model is much flatter and lighter. Although the band is somewhat less flexible than on other watches, it is still comfortable.

The only problem I've found is that sometimes the dustpan doesn't automatically turn on when I bring the broom close to the sensors.

The plastic piece covering the fan became very hot to the touch. I would usually just move it around until the fan eventually stopped making the sound and the heat would slowly dissipate. The charger eventually shorted out (it literally sparked) and is now completely dead.The product worked great for the last four months.

Flesch Quartet reveals these works are real masterpieces. Their tempos are generally faster than those of rival versions(Pro Arte on Laurel, New World's No.1 on Vox). These new performances are refreshingly straightforward, full of vitality and Hungarian spirit. Recorded sound is clean and clear. It is easy to say this is the best recording of two great Quartets after first listening.Sonata for two violins is beautifully played by Mark Denham and Robert Gibbs. Their tempo is slower than that of Jiang Duo on Eroica. Denham & Gibbs are very fine players who give the work more Hungarian colour and sensual beauty than Jiang Duo.All in all, a rewarding tryptich.

Ms. Charlton is eminently democratic in her even-handed discussion of ALL important rock acts, from Chuck Berry and Bill Haley to Ten Inch Nails.

As a long-time Supremes fan, I am happy to own these tunes from the \\"lost Supreme.\\" But one thing is certain: after hearing the CD, it is clear that while Florence certainly had a strong, melodious voice, it is no mystery why Berry Gordy chose Diana Ross' voice as the one that would lead the Supreme to the top of the charts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Florence Ballard","review":"It's obvious that Florence had a great voice.

Her best ABC solo recordings are \\"Love Aint Love\\" written by Van Mccoy (he wrote the disco song \\"The Hustle\\"), \\"Forever Faithful has that Motown sound and should have gone far and \\"Like You Babe\\" a song with a Memphis/Stax soul sound. I'm glad this c.d has finally come to light to showcase the beautiful and talented Florence Ballard. It's about time. My only wish is that this cd contained her beautiful version of \\"Silent Night\\" (from the Supremes Merry Christmas album) and her rendition of \\"Oh Holy Night\\".

The waterproofing feature is a rubber gasket built into the plastic cover, not the locking cover. So basically if it gets hot enough to melt plastic that's flush with the concrete floor the waterproofing will fail. Other than that, the safe was simple to install (breaking through the concrete slab wasn't a picnic. It took about an hour and a half with a rotary hammer to get a hole 16x16) and the price was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definetly keeps everyone out!","review":"I had to purchase a new safe due to a break in where I had the same particular Style tube safe.. The old model had the full size number dial where this one is the size of a half dollar.. Very small if you have it in ground or in a concrete box. I donnot encourage anyone to buy this safe unless you have 15-20 min of time to open it... It is also a 4 number safe that you cannot change and the directions are ridiculus!!! Spend the extra bucks and get an upgrade!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the Price!","review":"Very good safe for the price, well worth the money. Not the best high end but very good price, easy install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice value for the money","review":"I bought this and installed it myself. It was a bit troublesome getting through the 4 inches of concrete in the floor, but after that the install was a breeze. A plastic bag surrounds the outside to keep out moisture. The o-ring seal cover makes it look like sewage pipe access. When embedded in the floor I suspect it is fireproof and nearly flood proof as debris and the pool of water on the floor during a fire/fire fighting, will keep the plastic lid cool. I have had it for a year now and it continues to function well with no signs of corrosion failure. Best value for the money in my opinion, if you can handle jack hammering through your floor or wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can sleep now","review":"Originally bought two, one for each kid's bedroom. It was so awesome that we took one of theirs for our own bedroom. Now I don't wake up when the cat is destroying the house or scratching in his litter box. I don't hear my hubby waking up at 0200 to get ready for work. We can do afternoon naps if needed. There is a volume control to it so we put the kids Marpac in the hallway and it's up loud. DO NOT let it get covered up. We accidentally had laundry topple over it and that thing heats up pretty good when there isn't ventilation. Almost can't sleep without it. Have to bring it to any hotel stays that we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect solution!","review":"The Dohm-SS works great!

I did not want a machine that plays waterfalls, I needed a white noise that was easy to use at home and to take traveling. I agree with the person who said it takes about a week to get used to this sound conditioner, however it does have variable pitches and noise levels you can adjust. It sounds more like the air conditioners in hotels than it does a fan, which is fine. It is loud enough to block most noises. I recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Product","review":"It's well worth the money. Our daughter has been sleeping through the night since. I highly recommend this product for difficult sleepers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marpac Sound Machine","review":"Can't sleep without it now!! I forgot it on a trip and could not sleep. Even my dogs sleep better!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plain white noise","review":"We got this for our 2 1/2 year old son's room. It helps to block out the neighborhood noises during daytime naps, and at nighttime it cancels out the comings and goings of mom and dad outside his room. It is great to bring on trips too because hotels can be noisy, and it offers a familiar noise that helps the little ones sleep - and with toddlers, anything familiar when away from home helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent White Noise, Better Than Total Silence, Not Completely Noise Cancelling","review":"My roommate in the Cayman Islands had one of these and I found it to be helpful in attempting to fall asleep at night. It is much better than listening to silence in the daytime, so I have it on the lower setting in the daytime and the higher setting in the nighttime. While is emits an excellent white noise and aids a tad bit in cancelling noise, it DOES NOT completely cancel out all noise like earplugs. I was not expecting it to do so, and I didn't buy it for that purpose, (it is also not advertised to say it will cancel all noise), but buyers should be forewarned that if they want to completely cancel out all noise, this is not the machine for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate reviews for a good product","review":"I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this and I'm happy to write that the positive reviews were accurate.I accidently ordered the 580A instead of the 980A, but decided not to return after reading that the low speed on the 980A was not very useful and few ever used it. The 580A gives off a mixed sound of static and fan sound and does an excellent job of blocking and minimizing the noise from the TV when my partner is in her office. I'm only about 20 feet away from her and with the door closed I can crank the TV up to over 17 on the volume meter. Way louder than I usually turn it up (12 or 13 is normal for me).The only things it doesn't block well are distinctive noises, like talking on the phone, although I do have a rather loud and projecting voice.I would definitely recommend this and will probably buy another one for the bedroom when one of us goes to bed while the TV is still on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I got this to drown out the sound of my husband snoring and I love it, if he really gets cranked up I can still hear him but it is muffled. Low normal snoring is completely drowned out. It also drowns out everything outside I never hear our dogs when they bark. It is really easy to get use to the noise, it is kind of like a fan blowing on high without the air blowing on you, it does have a small adjustment but I leave mine on high all the time. I freeze in the winter so I was worried about using a fan to drown him out because I didn't want to have the fan blowing on me all the time. I would definitely recommend it, this has made my sleep much better before I bought this I was sleeping on the couch most nights now I get to stay in the bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep mate sound conditioner","review":"I have been using a sleep mate to help me sleep for 50 years and all my children use them too.

My son has unusually acute hearing so noise tends to bother him. Finally, he is sleeping with his brother in the room without getting up and whining in the middle of the night because he can't sleep. We're very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"I purchased this product because I'm a light sleeper. The sound conditioner is a no-frills device that works adequately to block out unwanted noise, and overall I'm satisfied. To me it sounds like a cross between a fan and a humidifier. It's small enough to pack easily in a suitcase if you wanted to bring it with you to a hotel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, and small enough to take on trips","review":"I bought this, because I got tired of having to use a fan to get that white noise I need to sleep. If all I want is the noise why should I have the breeze to contend with too?I like the sound it makes, because it reminds me so much of the fan I used to use. It's not so loud that it blocks everything out completely, but I wouldn't want that anyway.The big plus is a super long cord, and a small form factor; these facts make it great to take with you on trips. Nothing is worse than trying to get to sleep in a hotel room without some sort of noise. No more having to set the radio to static or turn on the bathroom fan (which most places don't even have anymore).I'm so pleased that I'm going to buy another one for our daughter's room."},{"rating":"2","title":"product","review":"I love this soundmaker. I've ordered a couple of them. Some as gifts. It allows me to watch TV after my husband goes to bed...because he is such a light sleeper. He complained at first that it was too loud. If he would use his eyes and not his mouth and read the directions he would have seen it has a volume control on it. I didn't say anything..he hee, so I can hear the TV in the den when he goes to bed YEA!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fully adjustable, organic noise!","review":"I love this noise machine. When compared to speaker-based models, the noise is much more soothing. For me it is plenty loud, and there are adjustments on the top and sides for volume and pitch, depending on your preferences. I like it loud and low! It's very easy to turn on with just the flip of a switch. It's not quite as portable as some smaller devices, but it's better than lugging around a full-size fan! We take them everywhere we go, especially for the kids. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I need some sort of background noise to be able to sleep while my wife gets ready for work. Normally, I turn the fan on, but it is too cold to do that in winter.This provides the perfect white noise to allow me to sleep. Not too loud, not too quiet...just right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We have one for each bedroom","review":"We bought one of these when my daughter was born 2 1/2 years ago, another when my husband started snoring, and a third when my son was born this year. It is not fancy, with only two volume options and some ability to adjust the pitch, but it makes a wonderfully soothing white noise that helps to cover up noises that might interfere with sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it!","review":"We bought this sound machine for our 2 year old \\"light sleeper\\". She was always being awoken at naps and early on in the morning by our neighbors' barking dogs, trash trucks, my husband starting the car in the morning, you name it...Ever since we bought this, it has helped SO MUCH!! We recently had another baby, and our 2 year old rarely even stirs when the baby cries at night, even though she's in the room right next to hers. My only complaint is that it only has one speed. I wish I would have gone ahead and gotten the slightly more expensive one that has two speeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!!","review":"My sister has been bugging for over a year to get one of these. Even my 87 yr old mother sleeps with one! I have trouble sleeping due to a variety of reasons, ie, noise, snoring, menapause, etc. However, from the first night I have slept so much better. I feel like i'm in the deepest sleep. If I wake up to roll over, I think to myself, \\"wow, I feel like I've been in a coma!\\" Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what I wanted it to!","review":"Between dogs lick/scratching and delivery trucks driving by in the middle of the night.....noises tend to wake us. We've been sleeping with a fan on just to have some background noise and that works....except it's getting too cold to keep sleeping with this fan! I bought the Dohm-SS Single Speed Sound Conditioner hoping that it can replace the fan. Ironically it sounds a lot like the fan, except I'm not not being woken up cold with sore throat/stiff neck. It's great too when taking mid-day nap and you want to drown out the noise from the rest of the household. It does not make a \\"pretty\\" sound, however it does exactly what I expected it to and I don't think I could sleep without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blew my fuse and broke immediately","review":"I read such great reviews, but the very first time I plugged it in, it sparked, burned and wouldn't turn on again :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"After all the rave reviews, I thought this would be a great way to block noise for my baby's nursery. I was really disappointed when I plugged it in to test it, and it is nothing more than a fan in a small package. Even after playing with all the different adjustments, it wasn't nearly enough white noise to be useful for blocking any sound. Forget it being enough to block the sound of my other children playing, even from across the house. I could still hear everything. Maybe it would work for people that don't have much noise to contend with, but I'm definitely returning this. That's a lot of money to cough up for something that doesn't do what it's supposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps Cover Up The Snoring...","review":"First of all I am a very light sleeper, waking up at the slightest of sounds. My darling wife can emit some pretty ferocious snoring so I thought this sound conditioner might prevent separate beds. I can say after one night of use that it is definitely a keeper and after some 'getting used to time', this just might be the magic bullet. By the way, this would be a 5 star item if it had a remote that you could keep by your bed side so you could turn the unit on after the TV was turned off. Who wants to get out of bed after the sand man attacks?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noise Machine","review":"The best noise machine ever. I have 3 in my home and would recommend this product to anyone.

It does a great job of drowning out outside noise when he's sleeping. The timing of my purchase was great as it was right before we left for vacation. The sleepmate machine was very easy to pack along in the suitcase so we could have it with us during our trip. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a white noise machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound machine for travel","review":"I bought this for my husband to use while traveling. It was great for a hotel room to drown out noise. It's not as loud as a regular box fan, so we won't be using it at home. It's small enough to fit into luggage with no problem. Isn't it amazing how many people can't sleep without noise machines now. My daughter thought that she would be the only one in her college dorm that had to have a fan to sleep and turned out almost all of the other girls used fans as well. Must be the noisy world that we live in now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"My husband and I are both nurses and routinely work night shifts. Whoever is not sleeping during the day is running our household with three children. I purchased the Marpac because of its wonderful reviews and actually kind of \\"blew off\\" the few negatives I read. What a mistake. While it is small and has varying pitches of sound easily adjusted by twisting the outer shell of the unit, it is absolutely NOT loud enough to cover everyday household noise. During the day I \\"slept\\", I heard my children playing, the microwave and kitchen doors closing, our garage door going up and down, the garbage truck, and the school bus (just to name a few). This unit is perhaps suitable if you only need it at night as white noise to sleep better, but if you are a shift worker who needs it to cover noise during the day, skip it. I am purchasing another Honeywell fan to replace the one I've had for the past 10 years and cost me $15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marpac Sleepmate 580A Sound Conditioner","review":"This product works very well at neutralizing background noise so you can sleep better.

The price was fair for this well made machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I luv this product!!!!!!","review":"I just love this machine since it cancels out all the other annoying background noise. This product is definitely a white noise machine & for anyone concerned about this product emitting anything potentially harmful I put mine on the floor next to my bed & the sound is loud enough & perfect for me to drown out traffic, bird & airplane noise. The only thing I am sad about is not knowing about this product decades ago since it is a really wonderful product. The sound of the machine sounds sort of like a regular fan or a bathroom fan. For me it's the perfect sound machine & makes it where I can fall asleep with ease & just what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!","review":"I am extremely satisfied with this product.

I used to run fans in my kids' rooms to drown out noise and help them sleep, but their rooms would get too cold in the winter. I looked all over for a noise machine that sounded just like a fan and came acroos this one and we LOVE it! I have bought 3 of them (for each of my kids' rooms) and we all sleep better.

Don't bother buying the more expensive one that has the low and high speed switch, as you will always be using it on high. We only need to use it in the wintertime because when we run a fan in the summer on high we get all the white-noise we need with that alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two defective units in two months","review":"I ordered one of these units at the end of December.

Now I get to sleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Sleeping Baby","review":"Our circa 1923 house has terrible squeaky wood floors, and all of our kids walk like elephants, so it is really tricky to keep a baby asleep. After reading reviews on several sleep-machine products, we decided the SleepMate 580A sounded like our best bet. We have been using it for about 3 weeks now, and we are very satisfied. It sounds a lot like a vaporizer running. I honestly expect to feel a cool mist when I walk past it. In our opinion, it is too loud to have right in our 12x12 bedroom, but the amount of noise it makes sitting right outside the door is perfect. You can still hear all of the other noises in the house (I still know when our teenage son gets home at night.), but the constant humming keeps other noises from being such a jolt to your system and waking you up. I really do think the baby is sleeping better. I would recommend this for anyone trying to sleep through noisy situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"too loud","review":"it has a great sound but is just too loud.

It has worked great for the past 6 months and a few days ago the motor sounded like it was dying and now the sound is very faint and pretty much pointless. I love amazon for it's return policy, but since this was an independent seller, the return policy they have is for a partial refund (whatever that means) plus shipping costs.

And don't bother trying to use it as a privacy-helper in the bathroom--you might as well just turn on the faucet for all the help it provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very loud!","review":"I have always used a noise maker for sleep - ranging from electronic noisemakers to box fans. I was excited about the Marpac because it's mechanical, which seems to have the best sound quality. Alas, this unit was way too loud for my bedroom, even at its lowest setting. I think it would be great for a very large room or perhaps a collection of rooms. It also vibrates a bit, which made my wooded bedside table resonate unpleasantly. I reckon I'll stick with my box fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"My wife used to use a large house fan for noise. This is a little higher pitched (faster rpm) than the fan but still sounds pleasant enough and can be quieter or louder than the fan was depending on the setting.

I love this product and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great, Perfect for Travel","review":"We bought the Marpac Sleepmate 580A to replace the fan we'd been using for years. We both work second shift and white noise makes it possible for us to sleep through the morning neighborhood noise. This is an excellent replacement for our fan. The sound is louder, more uniform and can be adjusted to suit our preference. It doesn't block out external sounds, but I don't think we could sleep with something loud enough to do that. It instead smooths out the background sound so you're not startled awake by sudden loud noises. We travel frequently and brought the machine with us on our last trip. We were very thankful to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud fan white noise","review":"It's like having a super-loud fan in the room, without the air blowing. I love it; I think it blocks out neighbors and the TV in the other room and occasionally, even my husband's snoring. But he hates it, thinks it's too loud, and usually turns it off, which defeats the purpose. There's no volume control; you can twist the side and the top to alter the sound somewhat, so I made it lower instead of higher, but that wasn't enough to get my husband to leave it on.I think it's much too loud to take to work in a cubicle setting. I was hoping to take it in to drown out annoying co-workers, but I can't imagine everyone would put up with the sound and I'd be \\"requested\\" to turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Noise Machine","review":"The perfect white noise machine. Tunes out unwanted noise (in my case traffic) and creates a calm environment. I have tried many machines, with poor results.

This one is the BEST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does we we wanted!","review":"I wasn't sure this Dohm sound conditioner would do what we wanted and needed, but it works perfectly!

Save the $10 extra for dual speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Noise","review":"I am very pleased with this noise machine. It has no repeat pattern that you lie awake to anticipate the pattern. It is simply noise. The unit is small enought to pack in a suit case and carry it with you when you travel, which we like very much. Much better than our other machine which has sounds of wind, train, rain, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"If anyone is looking for a white noise device, don't bother with the electronic/digital options. Like others have said, I too get annoyed when the digital track loops, causing a hiccup in playback. Since this is mechanical, you have a steady, natural sound that will drown out most noise. I can't hear my wife talking to me in the hallway when this is on! Helps my 6 month old sleep so well, we are buying another for my 3 year old, to help her sleep too. Can't go wrong with this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"get this one, don't get 980a","review":"My ex-roommate has the 980a and I have the 580a. 980a is $10 more and it has two options instead of one seen in the 580a. The sounds from 980a and 580a is very similar. It has a very constant noise (no recording/repeating sound) and they both work well to sleep or drown out the noise from outside. If you sleep in a small, decent size bathroom, 580a is loud enough for daily usage. I have the 580a and I have to cover all the holes to minimize the noise. It can be loud if I don't cover all the holes. Overall, $40 is good, I just hope it lasts a while, like a year or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product; very effective noise reduction","review":"This is the premiere of sound machines. Creates very loud (if desired) yet pleasant white noise. Started out using in the baby's room, and now it is also a mainstay on all our trips. It is really great for hotels or cramped quarters with relatives/friends! We recently used on a trip with our friends; their toddler and dogs were one room over with very thin walls. Nothing woke us the whole night thanks to this sound machine. It's a little pricier than others out there but worth it for the quality.

At first it worked normally, projecting a smooth white noise sound. Recently the white is being drowned out by a grinding/crackly type noise. As it is too late to return with Amazon, I will be asking the manufacturer for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but not loud enough.","review":"Had high hopes for this. It's compact enough to travel with and only makes one sound...white noise. To that end, it is fine, but it isn't loud enough to block the external noise by our house. Plus, could still hear television downstairs even when running. Would have been great if the thing would have gone a little louder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for Work!","review":"Ordered a couple for outside our supervisors' doors and apparently they work very well, as they had me order a couple more!

I don't think it's worth the money honestly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was excited when I ordered this book, but the first time I looked through it I was hugely disappointed. Only a few of the paintings in the book do any sort of justice to the imagery, whether implied or described, in Tolkien's books. Many of the paintings are by Michael Hague, and his style does not appeal to me at all. Roger Garland's paintings are elegant, tasteful, and mythical, especially the last one in the book, which I think is just perfect. I also like John Howe's paintings, as well as a couple by Alan Lee and Ted Nasmith. The rest (which comprise the majority) seem chunky, futuristic (certainly not the way I or anyone else I know of thinks of Tolkien's books) and boring. They do not capture the mystery, magic, tragedy, joy, sorrow, or beauty we are all acquainted with in Tolkien's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Tolkien fans!","review":"The book provides a rich dimension to the text version.

I LOVE it! It is butane, easy to refill, and perfect for lighting large jar candles that are more than half-used. Much better than using regular lighters - I kept getting my hand stuck in the jars! It is also very pretty, unlike those ugly long bic lighters you might find at walmart checkout lane. (although I have also seen these at the walmart jewelry counter, but not this silver color) To operate the lighter there is a button you must hold on one side, and a slide mechanism on the other to make the spark. You just click the slide over and it lights every time. Although the lighter is butane, it does not have that strong fast release that causes the whooshing noise when it is lit. It looks and sounds like an old fashioned zippo when lit. This is a great gift idea for any candle lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gluten-free staple!","review":"Not only is Grandma's Molasses a classic, but it's gluten-free naturally making it a must have for any Celiac's pantry.

However, the producer of this collection took it upon himself to modify most of the tracks to help DJs find and use the breaks. Sadly, this means that what you get is not quite the original recording. For instance, on \\"Amen, Brother\\" the track slows down just for the famous break and then speeds back up.Had these tracks been unedited, this collection would have been a 5-star affair. If you're a DJ looking for a great breaks collection this is it, just don't expect each track to sound right played straight through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Your Money","review":"Great for Biblical principals related to money and budgeting.

The book reads like a list of stories about Robinson's life, told without the benefit of insight into the magician's psyche, and lacking much of a plot or theme to pull them into a continuous whole. At times the book seems to be a collection of loosely related encyclopedia entries. Moreover, the writing style is overly simple and lackluster, as if dumbed down. Fortunately, the stories are often interesting -- the tales of the Great Lafayette are entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious Deception","review":"Book like new;reads like a novel; factually loaded.

The one thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars was the fact that it is a little hard to hold comfortably. I got it to play tug of war since the rope bones don't last at all. I'd seen other tires that friends have that work really well. The difference between this tire and those tires is that the other tires are slanted inward so you can get a better grip on it when playing with the dog. This is like a miniature truck tire in that it is basically straight from the edge to the center. So it's a little uncomfortable to hold when the dog is pulling on it.

I have more important things to read than a story I found bo-ring.If you want a bad imitation of Rosemary's Baby then this is your book - If not then I would recommend that you stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, horrible story","review":"This book starts out with quite a few details missing, as if the reader is supposed to know these characters from a previous novel. The characters aren't fleshed out and the supporting characters are so sparsely developed that you almost have to create them yourself. The ending isn't climactic; it's extremely anticlimactic. A main character is shuffled off like he meant nothing to the story and the villain could have been developed so much better but he ends up coming off as a little creepy. Jeff Long, author of the Descent, which was even more mind-numbing than Vigil, said it's as terrifying as The Omen or The Exorcist. Maybe Jeff's never read another book in his life. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than expected","review":"i had never heard of robert masello and was reluctant to read it because i expected a stephen king like horror story with loads of blood, gore, splatter and other nasty details. i had promised myself that i would give the book to the goodwill immediately if it started to gross me out. instead i found a well written book with interesting characters. am not quite sure what character development is supposed to mean. why does a character have to change over the course of a book? isn't it enough if the character is well described and fleshed out and has believable emotions and actions? these characters had all that. it's one of those books that are really hard to put down and leave you disappointed when it's over because you want more. i will certainly look for more books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as Bestiary","review":"I picked up Vigil after reading in the back of Bestiary that a character is a continuation, but you don't need to read one before the other. Both books are stand-alone and are enjoyable. Vigil starts off like all thrillers - hits you over the head with a hammer of suspense - then, like all thrillers, sort of slows down to get into the plot. There are several missed branches that the story can take (don't get too tied up into the fact that there is 'something' in the basement of the science building, as that peters out after its mentioning.) Still, enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous and not-to-be missed!!","review":"Vigil is a fast-moving, brilliantly plotted adventure that's fascinating from first page to last. The characters--from the intriguing Arius to the well-drawn hero Carter Cox--are fully drawn and realized. Author Robert Masello has a profound grasp of his unusually riveting material, and the depth of his knowledge adds immeasurably to the vividness of his story. Despite the supernatural elements, the story is completely believable. Like Dan Brown, Masello has transcended his genre and written an exciting, action-filled story that should have a huge readership. I found myself finishing the book at 3 am, under the covers with a flashlight. You really can't put this one down. A wonderful book that you definitely shouldn't miss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was lead to believe.....","review":"I too was drawn in by the cool cover and blurbs by Jeff Long...this book in no way, shape or form is in the class of either The Omen or The Excorcist.

Just a bad choice on my part..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeveloped Potential ...","review":"First of all, kudos are in order - Robert Masello's \\"Vigil\\" enticed me based on the back cover and illustrations. I read it all the way through. Good job, Masello.That said, this story fell FLAT. It raised too many questions, offered even fewer answers and, frankly, the ending left a lot to be desired. Character development was also lacking, and a fair number of them get killed off before the reader ever really gets to \\"know\\" them. And if you're going to base a story on a mixture of angels, mythology and science, be kind enough to actually carry through on the premise instead of ending the story with a corny \\"showdown\\" of sorts in a barn.To sum things up, \\"Vigil\\" had potential. Unfortunately, it was never fully realized. My recommendation? Either check it out from your local library, or buy it used.M.

His GRACE is all that Sonship is about:) It has changed my parents life and mine, and I recommend it to more churches (not just Reformed churches!)...My review:Ridiculous. One of the poorly written books by Jay E Adams. Disappointed he says his view is biblical, while all I see all over SONSHIP (by Miller) is all Scriptural (mostly focuses on Galations)!

The metal to plastic insures it traps moisture between the two surfaces which guarantees the metal will rust. You need to a) either remove these shelves and store them, after every use, where they never get wet, OR b) Buy them again and again as they become corroded and unsightly.IF Weber had made the frames of stainless steel, or even plastic the need to replace them regularly wouldn't exist. Powder Coating metal never seems to last long before the rust appears. On a BBQ subject to high temperatures, and exterior storage it is a sure thing. When you factor in a design to trap water against the metal it is a constant annoyance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacing Parts is Cheaper than New Grill","review":"We recently spent about (...) replacing shelving, cooking grates, knobs etc. on our 9 year-old Weber Genesis grill. The grill looks like new and the new porcelain enameled cast-iron grates are awesome in that they combine the easer-care, durable cooking surface of porcelain with the heat retention of cast iron (which allows for perfect searing and indirect cooking which keeps everything nice and juicy.) So for (...) we have a grill that cooks and looks like new - much better than $600 for a new Weber grill comparable in size and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tea for Four","review":"Listening to this tape is like sitting across the table having tea with these three wise and wonderful women.

It also did not stay in place once I managed to get enough out to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"This guy has sexual issues. Even without him saying so in the beginning you can tell. His technique is okay but to say that hardly no women can cum during intercourse is just wrong in my opinion. He could teach his technique in about 25 pages but the book is over 200. So to say the least you get pretty bored and just start glossing over all of his droning. I feel sorry for a person with no sexual experience at all that reads this book, whether man or woman, they may be scarred for life and actually believe this guys take on sex or the fact that intercourse is meaningless. I understand he had to learn to go down on a woman to please them but come on. So my take on this book is if a man for some reason or another can't please a woman with intercourse then by all means read this book. But if you're looking for a book to teach going down then please get a different book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I enjoyed reading this. Even though I've been a devotee of the subject for several years there were still some things in it that I didn't know.

It is written from by a male so he explains everything as if the reader cannot feel what is going on. The first half is background information, and quotations and experinces pepper the book. However, the later chapters are by far the most precise method for bringing a woman to climax. They are written like any other instruction manual, and if you can follow the instructions, it will work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont Be the Guy who Does not read this book","review":"I really enjoyed this book and i still enjoy it.

We have the hardcover edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"no hair left","review":"Mr. Kerner tells us several times what he's going to tell us and then more than halfway through the book, he tells, but... in excruciating detail. What he says is exactly correct, but wading through the specifics is enough to make ME pull my hair out and throw the book across the room and I'm a thinking \\"SHE\\". I can't imagine a 'thinking man' trying to follow these directions without getting frustrated and giving up before the \\"20 minutes\\" are up. And I can't blame him. Mr. Kerner heavily referenced Elements of Style, but I think he forgot who his audience was."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time!","review":"Finally a coming of age book for men so that they can no longer say they don't understand women. A great read. Well written and clear, concise explanations. Will women remain a mystery to you after this?

Most books dealing with giving women what they richly deserve - that is, a loving happy tongue - are always of interest as I love to do it. See, lavishing her gorgeousness with your tongue is one of the greatest things a person can do. It makes her happy, loved, thrilled to be alive. Reading this book and applying your knowledge (along with your innate desire to satisfy her) will only reap benefits more rewarding than ANYTHING. I'll end this review with a tip from me that usually sends my girlfriend through the roof with ecstasy - have her lie on her side with a couple of pillows between her knees. Then, as you're getting busy take a lubricated finger and delicately massage her ass moving down slowly until you're penetrating her. Then, slowly work to establish a rhythm with your finger and your tongue until she gets hers.

Read a page or two of the book before buying to make sure this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"how can a title like that not sell?","review":"A bit over-rated, this work is extremely thorough in mastering her oral pleasuring. I wouldn't, however, say that it presents anything that hasn't been discussed in other literature. The book has simply been packaged and promoted well.

I'll definitely give it to my husband and maybe Mother's Day will be here sooner than expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Wife Must be the Happiest Woman in the World","review":"I can't marry Ian Kerner, but I can sing the praises of his funny, honest, liberating book. I've seen him a couple of times now on the Today Show and he's always dead-on when talking about sex and what's happening in America's bedrooms. I've even emailed him anonymously with a couple of sex questions and he's been really responsive and caring. Katie Couric won't say the title of the book on TV, but she's a smart girl and I bet you she's got a copy on her bedside table. Smart women like smart guys and She Comes First really is the thinking man's guide for pleasuring woman. It's about time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Informative and Thorough","review":"I can do nothing but praise Ian Kerner's work, She Comes First. Don't think that it's training men to be more generous out of charity. It plainly explains WHY men should make sure their partners have been given ample attention as well as HOW to do so. This book brilliantly addresses issues of safety, effective technique, variety, philosophy, biology, psychology and so on. This work is the perfect blend of humor, humility, statistically-based facts, genius insight and creativity. You can feel illuminated just by the first few chapters and still want to take more in. I know this is definitely a great read for us guys and imagine women would likely enjoy learning more about how exactly their bodies are working. Pick it up now and hope for more from this author. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beam me down, Scotty!","review":"Kerner's book is both funny and informative, adding many insights to an often-neglected subject. Do these techniques work?

Watch for wider notice of this important work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author comes first?","review":"No doubt if seeking a way to pleasure your female partner, the title sounds great but doesn't deliver.

Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over, Grandma!","review":"I saw the author on the Today Show talking about sex and I was blown away: not necessarily by what he had to say (i don't even remember the subject), but by the fact that he wasn't like one of those grandmas you usually see on tv like Dr. Ruth or the Canadian woman on Oxygen. When it comes to sex advice, I want mine from someone I can relate to, not from a grandmother who probably last got it on in 1906!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not every woman enjoys oral sex","review":"This book is nothing but a one trick pony's guide to nowhere real. Not every woman enjoys being slobbered on. Buy yourself a good book on tantric sex and learn to bond with your woman instead. Sometimes sexual problems come from men stumbling around like the 13 year old boys that they never outgrew but it is still 90% in the brain. Learn to love all of your partner and make love to her heart and soul if you want to really satisfy her. Grow up instead of playing the adolescent Peter Pan. It is not a game or race to see who gets to climax but an orchestration of two people coming together in one space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read... good info... great time!!!","review":"Easy read. If you don't know what they book it talking about-- get the book. If you do know, it will reinforce things. If you are like me, 1 or 2 little details make it work the read.

I was concerned when I noticed that these reviews simply repeated the book's jacket and text, and like the book itself, they are full of hype and hot air.

The rest of the 48 chapters take every chance to reiterate these points while giving the reader's ego slaps of shame for undervaluing cunnilingus and pets of self-congratulation for buying this book. The idea of a basic book on female anatomy, cunnilingus and its techniques is a great idea and I'm sure this was a well intentioned endeavor but if you are looking for useful information in this book, skip to the Appendices where the information is succinct and the author's voice is almost, (thankfully), completely missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lol wow so lame","review":"This book was really really bad, basically i wish i knew beforehand its for people who dont know how to go down on a women.

While the subject matter could have been slanted in any number of ways, the author seems to given a fairly holistic treatment to the differences/similarities in approaching pleasure between the sexes. The book makes an excellent case in promoting cunnilingus as something worthy of more than mere foreplay, but an arena that should be thoroughly valued and everyone should explore. It describes a lot of why, it includes some anatomy to give a greater understanding of the geography, and last but not least, it gives some instruction, which is interesting even if you think you know the topic well.Beyond agreeing with the thesis of the book, it was an informative read, to further understanding this aspect of female sexuality without pandering to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"Well I'll keep this short and sweet.

Author Michael Levine contends that the product whether it is a consumable, durable, or even the consumer selling themselves can become more recognizable than competitors among the buying public through proper public relations.Mr. Levine includes strong examples of the winners and losers in the branding process. He also follows a fictional campaign selling a new brand of ice cream so that readers with background of years of marketing to a consumer who only knows commercial jingles will appreciate this insightful look at building the reputation of a product. With this primer, Michael Levine should become the branded name in PR creations.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Judge a Book by its Cover","review":"I recently read \\"A Branded World\\" for one of my classes and I can honestly say that I read it from cover to cover. Unlike my other textbooks that just collected dust in the corner of my room, I was fortunate enough to pick it up and flip through the first couple of pages. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. Michael Levine's latest book has been more than a textbook; reading the book has been a life changing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big sales pitch","review":"I agree with the skeptics here. This book is very salesy with few, if any, valuable lessons.The vast majority of 5-star reviews were written by people who had never reviewed any other book. Puhleese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful Book Or Just A Sales Pitch?","review":"I have to agree with Steven Willis from Los Angeles. This book might hold up a little stronger if it wasn't written by a publicist who seems like he is just trying to drum up some business. It's like those chiropractic offices that set up booths for free spinal exams at various sporting events. They give you the free exam, then surprise, surprise! Turns out they seem to think your back needs some chiropractic work. It's the same idea here, and while the book has a few instances of making good points, they aren't really strong enough to persuade the reader to adopt the author's point of view. On the positive side, it is written in a manner that is pretty easy to understand so you can finish it quickly enough, but it's just never all that compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Hoping For","review":"The majority of this book reads more like speculation by the author rather than solid fact. The impression this gives the reader is the the author has not dealt with many big brand names on a publicity level. The problem with this is that dealing with smaller entities is quite a far cry from dealing with a major brand such as Nike or Toyota.I kept reading hoping for some interesting inside scoops into the world of big name brands, but was let down. If you are new to the world of branding you might gain a few nuggets of information from this, but I found it all to be common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE RUBBISH","review":"I do say, nary a passage within this book made for adequate reading.

I read this book ten years ago and it remains a benchmark for me when comparing other epic novels I've read.I loved the characters, the young doctor and nearly as young step-mother, the other missionaries, the young blind girl and the tribal chief. This book really grows as you read, and has a great ending, very emotional for any reader.I may be a bit biased as i grew up on a diet of Wilbur Smith novels, however if Wilburs' tomes are your favourite monday night sitcom then Gloria Keverne's A Man Cannot Cry is like going to the movies on Saturday night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mitts are scented.","review":"Though the description of this product says it's filled with natural buckwheat hulls and rice, mine had a strong smelling deodorant coming from the removable bags you heat.

The authors lack of command of the English language is only exceeded by his inability to explain relatively simple concepts in plain language.

His narrative allows you to feel the physical pain and frustration of high altitude climbing. From my armchair, I was rooting for him every step of the way. Although a competent climber, he's no superstar. Climbing is not as easy for him as it seems to be for Krakauer and therein lies much of the book's appeal.From the title, I was expecting more of a focus more on high altitude medicine per se, but it's really a personal adventure story.Definitely worth reading for a different perspective on Everest.

She is presented as the anti-Elinor Roosevelt - not in a derogatory way, just a different approach to problems and a different political ideology. In the book Lou Hoover comes across as a devoted wife, an educated woman, and a world traveler.

But for me, the real revelation here is Tell Me More, a totally forgotten Gershwin musical from the Twenties. I only knew one of the songs, \\"Kickin' the Clouds Away,\\" but this score hits all the right notes, from gently melodic to flat-out funny. And the cast couldn't be better. David Garrison and Christine Ebersole are hugely funny in the comic roles, tossing out their one-liners like the Broadway pros that they are. And what a delight to hear the romantic couple on one of these vintage recordings -- in this case, Diane Fratantoni and Philip Chaffin -- sing just like a real period couple: him with the creamy tenor voice and her with the boop-a-doop flapper sound.

It could, in all seriousness, be considered a great peice of literature, regardless of the fact that it deals with the nature of a non-existent 'force'.As a huge fan of the Solo Twins I wasn't sure I'd like a book centered around Jacen and his apparent anti-war beliefs, but Stover brought in so much insight through the creature Vergere that you actually begin to side with Jacen. Vergere was writtin beautifully, colorfully, and very bold. Her contrasting dialogue intrigues you and captures you. \\"Everything I tell you is a lie,\\" what a great line!!! Her views on the force are slipped in so purposefull that the reader can't help but believe that she is telling the complete and total truth.You don't have to be a fan of the New Jedi Order, the Expanded Universe, or even Star Wars to enjoy this book.

It develops Jacen's character from a indecisive bleading heart to a man who is very sure in himself. I like the development between him and Vergere.

I like the ending the best and how it plays into the problems that the Vong are suffering in the current book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"While I personally like the author's other works I cannot say that I enjoyed his addition to the NJO. It was dull. The endless philosophical journey of Jacen in this book came about in a painfully slow story arc. His breakthroughs were just not interesting by the time he made them. I also found this sacrifice of a fellow Jedi to be not only inconsistent with his previous persona but implausible to say the least.You can probably take a pass on this book and not miss a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"Is this supposed to be Star Wars? This book is just a collection of sick and twisted violence and torture. The whole NJO has been stupid. Why did they have to ruin Star Wars?The wonderful series that Star Wars used to be is gone forever. I refuse to buy the books anymore. I just read borrowed copies or skim them in the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking","review":"I don't know how they got Lucas' approval to write this drivel, but apparently the author doesn't like Star Wars at all. According to one of the main characters, everything we know about the force is wrong, Yoda was a deluded fool, and all wisdom comes from a humanoid chicken. Apparently this science fiction writer didn't realize that Star wars is not science fiction, but space fantasy, with clear good and evil. I'm sure the author is fine in other settings, but he really does not understand the dynamic of Star Wars, and so he makes our beloved characters out to be idiots for holding the beliefs that Jedi have held fo thousands of years. The Power of the Jedi sourcebookfor the Star Wars roleplaying game handles these subjects in a much better fashion, consistant with the wonderful fantasy world that George Lucas originally created."},{"rating":"1","title":"The death of the Force","review":"I'll start with the good... this book was well written. That's about it. In my opinion, it destroyed Star Wars. So many people are now jumping on the no Dark/Light side of the Force bandwagon and it just drives me crazy. The Expanded Universe had already degraded the movies when Jedi started getting tired just because they used the Force but this... please George, DO SOMETHING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"somebody shoot me.","review":"in my opinion the only reason to read this book is so that you dont miss any thing in this series, it takes about 250 pages for this book to get exciting. another problem i have with this book is the fack that stover alway made made ganner look like a blubering fool. in the previous books he was only an insecure man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treachery at its finest","review":"This book is the thirteenth addition to the New Jedi Order series in the Star Wars Extended Universe. Devoted mainly to Jacen Solo and a cast of five other characters, this story is not only intriguing but perplex. Fluid and omniscient, the author, Matthew Woodring Stover, demonstrates an acute knowledge of the Star Wars Universe as well as the ability to entertain and mortify concurrently.Matthew Woodring Stover handles many subplots converging onto one another creatively with passion and detail unrivaled in the Extended Universe. A strong psychological thriller as well as science fiction novel, Traitor did not leave the reader confused. Rather, the reader becomes infatuated with every turn of the page and is committed to reading the entire book instantly.Want more reviews, visit:http://www.oddworldz.com/thehallow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"To me, it is different to every other book of the NJO series. It is so focused on psychological issues it astounded me I was reading a Star Wars book. What started as some fun actually caused me to go into deep thougt and i remember some of the things Vergere cryptically tells Jacen to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, Very Interesting","review":"I must say that this was a great book. Got it and was done with it in about six or seven hours. It kept me guessing on who the \\"traitor\\" was. I don't want to give it away for those who haven't read it but it should make you quite happy. Now the real problem is waiting till the next book comes out. That part is just now fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST STAR WARS BOOK I HAVE EVER READ","review":"This is by far the worst Star Wars book I have ever read. I had to force myself to keep reading until the end. I was hoping to learn something about the force and why the Vong can't be felt in it. It didn't teach me anything. I stayed awake for hours at night trying to grasp the meaning of want Vergere was trying to teach Jacen but to no avail. It got better toward the middle and than at the end it went down hill again. I don't know, mabie I should re-read it if I can force myself to sit through it again. If Matthew Stover never writes another Star Wars novel again it is fine with me. I don't mind philosophy but this was way to much, and than all the answers where vague if he answered anything at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of the series","review":"I have read almost all of the books in the Star Wars universe, all the way up to NJO Traitor. This by far was the worst book in the Star Wars universe. There were so many questions answered with more questions that it actually gave me a headache. It was a very slow read and just not as exciteing as the other 12 books. I thought about not finishing the book but decided to finish so I don't get lost in the series. I just hope that the rest of the books do not go down this road."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST star wars book ever","review":"I have read a lot of star wars books and this is the only one that i haven't liked so far. This book is not just bad, it's terrible. The author goes on and on about philosophy and meditation. The book would have been good if it had been about fifty pages long. I was able to skip several sections and chapters without missing a single thing. Do NOT buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great change of pace!","review":"Instead of endlessly jostling back and forth between the various involved subplots of this seemingly endless tale, this book is all about Jacen Solo. Although probably the most powerful of the Solos, he is basically a pacifist. This makes what happens in this book so great. He is really in one heck of a hole, and the climb out is a great talk, although at times it gets a bit hard to swallow. I appreciate Vergere now, but in the book I was getting a bit tired of her answering questions with questions; it seemed to go on forever.But in the end, characters are put to good use, the story is advanced considerably, and the locales will creep out any fan of Star Wars. What great dramatic risks this series is taking! I guess there's only 4 more to go now...."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRAITOR","review":"This is an incredible book. i can't say enough good things about it. Jacen is finally done some justice. They have been portraying him as a weak idiot, and finally he is developed into a great character. the inclusion of ganner, a favorite character of mine, really made the book. Vergere was an awesome character, and has become the new yoda. the way she spoke in riddles, and tought jacen was harsh but effective. the book really tied up a lot of loose ends as well. i recommend thid book to all"},{"rating":"2","title":"He keeps reading","review":"My son loves these books, he wasn't much of a reader till I got him a few of these. Now all he wants is more ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Traitor By Matthew Stover","review":"Traitor is a book about Jacen Solo and Jacen Solo alone. It contains only a few other \\"good guy\\" characters, and Vergere, the wierd bird that tends to flip flop. It seems confusing at first, but once you get used the style of writing used, you can really get what is going on. This book is filled with plot twists and keeps you wondering what will happen until the end. It is a perfect setup for the next book, because it doesn't really focus on the galactic struggle going on in the Star Wars universe. It is focused just on Jacen and his struggles. I liked this book and hope for more like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Stover, thank you.","review":"I really don't know what to say about such an incredible piece of literature, except that it is perhaps the greatest character journey ever written in Star Wars novels. Though this is just one book, and not very long (at only 290 pages), Traitor gives the reader a truly epic story, something reminiscant of the Star Wars novel trilogies of old. I truly believe that anyone can enjoy this book, even if they haven't read any of the New Jedi Order series. Traitor is an absolutely wonderful philosophical study of the Force and those who weild it, while still keeping the Star Wars action rolling right along. Thank you Matthew Stover for bringing the New Jedi Order out of the dark ages created by Troy Denning and Elaine Cunningham. (P.S.: If there are any of you out there who are currently reading Star by Star or choking through Dark Journey, don't loose hope, the next few are actually good.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Self evaluation","review":"This was a very different type of story for me. It made me think and ask questions about what Jacen and I thought of as truth and ourselves. The NJO is a very strong dark series and I feel that Traitor is going to be very pivitol in the next books. In a world that has good and evil, right and wrong Traitor brings a new look into the thoughts of the Force and ourselves. I highly reccommend Traitor to be read with the understanding that it is slow in some parts. And I'm very interested on what the future holds for Vergere and Jacen Solo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets you thinking of what you do not see.","review":"This book is more than a \\"Star Wars\\" story. Like every good tale, it is first a story about a truth. This author not only gave a look inside these characters, but did so by giving the reader a doorway in to the real world - if you choose to step through. We all ask questions. In the story, Jacen asks many and learns to see his own answers - and also new questions. I am not saying this book is a guide to self discovery, but it is a push in the right direction. Yes, several of the books in this series are dull and SSSSSSSSLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW reads, but this book comes at a perfect time, and in a perfect way to put the previous 12 books in a new light. This one book makes the others better."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is diffrent from other star wars books","review":"corsuscant has fallen to the enemy. anakin is dead. but whatactually happened to jacen solo? the last we saw he was captured and betrayed by vergere. she has him prisoner and is subjecting him to some of the most interesting tests i have ever seen. thewriter is clever not to let any one test last too long, but makes it interesting enough that you are clamoring for more. these tests will give him some answers that he did not even knowhe was seeking and make him a stronger and better person. if youare looking for fights, family interaction, this is not the bookfor you. it is well written and i cannot wait until destiny's waycomes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"JASON SOLO FREE FROM THE VONG AT LAST","review":"I had mixed feelings about this book. This story is about Jason Solo's escape from the Yuuzhan Vong. The whole story and details of his escape are uneventful and unmemorable, minus the role played by the character Ganner Rhysode. Here Jason solo has been captive through 3 Star Wars Novels and thought dead by his family and members of Jedi Council. More time and effort needed to be applied towards this portion of the story.In this book you get a great insight into the mind of Jacen Solo and a better understand of the Yuuzhan Vong race. The change and maturity of Jacen Solo from his imprisonment is well documented in this book. Jacen Solo is changed forever due to these events in his life.If you are a true Star Wars fan, you will enjoy this book. If you have not been reading the New Jedi Order, put this book back on the shelf and begin reading \\"Vector Prime\\" from R.A. Salvatore. Otherwise, you will be totally lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth....?","review":"This book opened up whole avenues of directions for the New Jedi Order series to go from here. Full of conflict, but not of battles, full of questions, missing answers, full of truths, equally full of lies, this book was enigmatic beyond belief, and it will completely shake the foundation of everything you believed about the force. Two sittings, and this book was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"$90 for a \\"Don't smoke pot or you'll end up in the gutter video?\\"","review":"And only 24 minutes at that.

It is a harmless plant that has been misunderstood by those who are heavily influenced by others and those in fear of the unknown. Marijuana saves and helps lives everyday and is less addicting than caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and many other overlooked legal subtances . The people in this movie put the blaim for their problems on the plant rather than on themselves for abusing marijuana.

I scroll through all of the information as closely as I can view, no less put in the edition type I'm looking for with no help at times.

Unfortunately the openings for the wallets is only 1.5 x 1.75. Our photo packages include 2x3 wallets as the smallest size and with that opening you can only get the head in (if lucky). The description claims the mat is suitable for 2x3 wallets, but cut out a 1.5 x 1.75 opening and check that it will give you a nice crop before you order this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true pop gem!","review":"I like most people have purchased this cd because of the Wall Street Journal article. How can a company spend all that money and not break an artist? That's another story. This is probably the best sounding pop cd in some time.

Don't miss this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't this artist a big star?","review":"Like the earlier reviewer Frank, I only became aware of this artist because of the Wall Street Journal article that appeared about this album.

I bought her CD (along with Brooke White's) because i thought it was going to be like the music she sang on the show and on tour but I was wrong. It's just bubblegum pop that doesn't fit her voice at all. Carly has beautiful range to her voice and it never showed in this CD. Pop music works for some but I expected more from this CD. The music compny screwed her in this cd. It should of showed her range more."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's No Sanjaya","review":"But, she did a decent job on this album.

Good luck, Carly."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unfound gem","review":"I'm not really into this genre of music, however this cd works. I really liked Carly on AI and felt she was let go way too soon, but that's the voting methodology for AI. She has the vocal capability, she had well written and produced songs but the album didn't do well. There are quite a few radio hits that never made it to the masses and so this album ended up in the bargain rack. That's not the way Carly Hennessey's bio should read: very talented singer but wasn't marketed properly. She was 18 years old when she came out with this album and it's very good, anything she did today might be spectacular. Give this album a try I think you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a confidence and maturity thing ..........................","review":"Carly has a good voice but here tries much too hard to be cool.

On top of that he was having accidents in the house (something he never ever had in his life) he also acted like he didn't know who we were sometimes. In short all the signs of senility. At first we had to drop back to 1/2 tablet a day as he seemed a bit agitated and after about a week we went to a full tablet a day. WOW what a difference! He is like our old buddy. Sharp as a tack and full of energy or at least as much as you can expect from a 15 plus year old Springer. Also you should look into the clear eyes for cataracts if your dog has them, those drops are amazing and really have helped our once almost blind dog to see fairly well again and the white cloudy look in his eyes are almost gone.

For each clerkship, a review of books in the categories of textbook, review size book and pocket size books is given. Definitely use their reviews as a guide to the immense amount of shelf and board review material available. The rest of this book consists mostly of description of different clerkships which may be more or less applicable to those at your home institution. I would suggest a quick skim of those areas. If you have this in your medical bookstore or library you may just want to skim the section about the clerkships shortly before it begins and use the review of books to chose reading material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book before wards","review":"This book will be useful particularly for those who have taken some time off between their basic science and clinical years in medical school.

It was useful for just one thing: making me feel less nervous about starting clinical rotations, since it gave me a general idea of what would be expected of me. The most useful parts of the book are the ward tips that give you a feel for the setup of each service. The actual review of relevant topics was pretty poor - too many details to be a broad overview of what you should be learning, but not enough details for you to learn each topic well enough, so you end up reading the same information again in a textbook. Also, once you do one rotation, many of the tips given in the book are useless, since by that time you will have a pretty good idea of what is expected of you and how the wards work. I didn't spend much time on this book once my first rotation started, and I stopped using it completely during the second rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is small!","review":"I bought this for my MP3 (Creative Labs Mosiac) and it just fits.

Not that I intended to but that is how quickly the story grabbed me. What elevates it above mere fiction is that imbedded in this gripping Graham Greene-esque tale is an equally Graham Greene level of insight into America's latest Wilsonian foray into the international arena. Moonlight Hotel just smacks of this generation's Quiet American - only told with more humor. Some of the scenes with the Col. later in the story are a scream.

That Carl Thomas song is wack and the best new product isn't even on the album. There's a hot song floating around with Ghost flowin over a Barry White track that's missing, and the album version of \\"Flowers\\" is weak compared to what I guess is a remix. Overall, the production is poor and although Ghost is always witty with his rhymes, I expected more. With little contributions from other Wu Tang members and Rae's subpar performance, this album will not be in rotation very long?

Now I come from a time when you respond to what you hear on tape: beats, word play, new ideas you know, Hip-Hop.

Not to diss on those of you who like this album, but hearing Ironman many a moon ago and then progressing, or should I say declining to this is just unacceptable for one of Wu's best lyricists.

First of all what is Ghost thinking of when releasing an album where all the songs are in a different order and others are not even on the album? For example one of the best songs in a minute was left off but in the track listing it is listed as track #1 (the sun). That's just unacceptable.The production on the album is very mundane as heard from the first single. This song is shameful to the Wu Tang legacy. Does Ghost really think the average listner is going to pick up his album because his first single has Carl Thomas on it? There are not enough Rza beats, plain and simple. Furthermore, where are the Wu posse cuts? THe best song on Supreme Clientel was Wu banga 101 with the fellow Clan. On this album they are for the most part MIA. Even the potentially classic track the watch has a different beat on the album that cannot even touch the non album version. Overall a disappointing release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Does it again with percision","review":"This is the best hip hop album of 2001.

He isn't just writing history. He is making it interesting and exciting. You will discover facts about old forms of media and specific programs that you didn't know before.

Although the best songs in this album might not be better than his past hits, it is a more complete album with a more mature sound and experiments with sounds from South America, particularly in the beginning of track five.

Absolute waste of 36 bars of chocolate. I would be less offended if this was the first time I heard of this problem. After reading other reviews, I see this is a recurring problem. Sending me almonds was relative to a slap in the face, just as this was to the other purchaser. Do not order this chocolate. The warehouse staff working for this seller clearly does not care what you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing restoration on this 6 movie set. I don't think we will ever see these John Wayne classics every look and sound better","review":"I love John Wayne but normally the b-movies he made in the 30's are in such bad condition they are almost not watchable except for the most hard core fan. Legend did a wonderful job on cleaning up the sound and video on these classics. Each volume shows the movie in color and you also get the restored B&W Version. I must admit that I enjoyed watching them in color for the first time. The restored B&W version look really good too. They did some new editing of the films to make the flow better and added a sound track to them. I personally found the sound track and tightening up on the edits to make a big difference. It is the first time I found these old movies to be easy, fun and enjoyable to watch. Great job legend I would like see you do it with more of these movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Wayne Movie 6 pk","review":"On No.Not again.Dont tell me they are going to release the Black and White John Wayne classics in colar?Didnt we have enough with Casablanca,Maltese Falcon(Blue Skies in a Film Noir?I dont think so)Suddely(Frank Sinatra has brown eyes),Captain Blood,White Heat(The flames from the oil tanker as Cagney shoots it out with the TMen look very phoney to me)etcI think they should not mess with perfection.Stick with the black and white."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific movie good actors","review":"I really enjoyed the movie very much.

This is one in a series of Studies in Global Archaeology, not studies in coffee-table pretty picture books. Blackwell is a reliable publisher in this area and having read the Classical Archaeology contribution to this series I can say that the scope of the books in this series is narrow and to the point. I will update this review after I've gone through this text in my spare time later this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the layman","review":"This volume is a scholarly work and not intended for the layman. I was looking for a general history-type book, but you would probably need a degree in ancient history to get much out of this collection of essays.

I chose the Tungsten T2 based on the reviews.In order to save a few bucks, I made the mistake of ordering my handheld from palmone.com instead of from Amazon. I received the box in the mail...but with NO HANDHELD IN THE BOX! I have been working with PalmOne for five days, and I still do not have a handheld. While they are polite when I call, I don't think they believe me. I may be out $250.Amazon is very reliable, but I have nothing good to say about the service from PalmOne.

I'm returning this for another mnufacturers' handheld."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept-lousy execution","review":"When it works it's marvelous. Unfortunately it is a huge source of frustration. The big problem is in the \\"hot-sync\\" function. I have installed the software on four seperate computers, with three different operating systems. They all react the same way: within a short time when a \\"hot sync\\" is performed you get a \\"Fatal Alert\\" error on the Palm. Sometime a reset will clear it sometimes it won't. Sometimes you have to do a hard reset and lose your data. Their customer support is off-shore and the language problem is overwhelming. One-half hour on the phone just to get a Service Request number. When it came back it was exactly the same. The software has to be reinstalled regularly on the PC to keep it working right. I have reinstalled the PC software over a DOZEN times on four different computers just to make sure my data is safe and functionable. The software is MISERABLE!!

The Tungsten T has a delicate cradle - I've replaced three cradles in nine months. Also, I have replaced two of the handhelds for reasons that were not explained to me.Technical support is nice, but I have yet to have a discussion with technical support that lasted less than 30 minutes!!!! This product has done the opposite of save me time. I am looking into purchasing another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Palm Support is Non-existent","review":"I own the Tungsten T2 and it's a nifty piece of hardware with a beautiful display and innovative features. However, mine arrived without the software CD. After two long distance calls to support including total hold times of nearly 50 minutes, I was told I could not obtain the missing software that there were no CDs to ship and nothing they could email me. This means basic Palm apps like the calculator and photo viewer are not present on my device. The representative suggested I return the device (at the expense of the retailer?) and either purchase another one or keep my Dell Axim. Free support for Palm devices only lasts 90 days (after that $25 a call) and they were not willing to help me, unlike Dell which has provided support and replacement without question or cost. The Palm hardware is nice, but the software is nonexistant and the support is laughable.

The unit itself is just as good and useful as I remember it. The problem I've encountered is that the desktop software is out of date-- it isn't compatible with the last 2 or 3 versions of Windows, so the only computer I've been able to sync it up with is a 10 year old laptop that a friend gave me (because she no longer uses it). It wasn't until after I bought it, unfortunately, that I saw it listed on Palm's website under devices they no longer support.I still love the PDA's, just make sure you get one that's a little newer and is sure to work on your computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Palm","review":"Everything looks Ok except that I cannot use the botton corner of the screen to use or touch with the pilot because do not work .Seem that the screen must be replaced.

A soft and hard reset, and a call to Palm support did nothing to resolve the problem. Anyways, here it goes: The unit incessantly moves, without prompting, between screens. For example, it'll move to Brown, Joe while I'm still looking at the details of Alfa, Romeo. I've resorted to using the find feature to access telephone numbers, which I'll jot down quickly enough because tapping for details simply repeat jumping between screens and contacts. This erratic behavior is not unique to the Address book application. It's the same in datebook, photos, etc. I've only used about 7mb of my 29.7M, so it can't be because of memory.Palm's 90 days warranty, which I find suspicious, meant I was already outside warranty before I realized the defects. This will definitely be my last Palm PDA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"That's that. Useless. The lens gives cloudy images. The fittings are difficult to handle. The bag is over sized. The only good thing is the tripod. Which I still use. But you can buy tripods cheaper than this garbage can with which it comes. And oh if matters were not bad enough, the shipping of the company is worse than terrible"},{"rating":"2","title":"unless you're really, really serious","review":"This is an excellent coverage of single pawn minor piece endings because it's exhaustive. The explanations can be difficult: this should not be the first, second or even third endings book you take on!

Nunn's explanations, although they can be difficult, really are helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"typical nunn quality","review":"excellent detail, but very narrow focus. only covers endings with one pawn on the board, and one piece each side. with the advent of endgame databases, is this book worth buying anymore? but it is well done nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well it hasn't caught on fire yet.","review":"It doesn't work at all. The drive is recognized by the USB driver but the RAID utility can not find it or initialize. I have 20 years experience with PC, build my own, have done software and hardware raid under Windows and Linux. This thing should just work. Technical support has hung up on me after being on hold for 15 minutes twice.

I downloaded the latest Raid Utility for Windows and it still cannot find the drives. I disabled the drives as suggested on the BuffaloTech web site and still cannot find the drives.I've been on hold for 40 minutes for tech support. This is the second call. The first call, I spend 10 minutes on hold, and then got hung up. It seemed like the company rushed the product before testing and probably too cheap to hire tech support people to deal with all the problems.This is my last Buffalo Tech product."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAID is fixed","review":"I had trouble with the RAID utiltiy, too.

The most pressing need for visual experience designers is knowing when to make information speak for itself and live on its own. It doesn't need to be fancy or dressed up like a overdone light show at a rock concert. Please, more substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self indulgent pap","review":"With a back cover description extolling the book's virtues such as \\"...interaction design, information design, visual design and more related methodologies...\\", the book misses the mark completely. The book mostly comprises of a collection a screen grabs, arty photos and some of the more avant-garde advertising campaigns (available in a million books elsewhere). The book is so light weight that I challenge anyone to learn anything meaningful from such prosaic descriptions that accompany each example in the book. The following occupied two pages of the book, and was accompanied by such necessary elements as two photographs to demonstrate what a match and matchbox look like;\\"Matches are about as simple and clear a device as you will find. Of course, they are only half the solution, requiring a suitable surface to strike them against. However, a match's operation has been reduced to a minimum of steps and a minimum of possible mistakes.\\"Thanks.... may I suggest you save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Intro -- Not just for Web Design","review":"Experience Design is a good intro book for designers, especially those interested in interactive media, environmental design, and museum installations. I found it a very helpful \\"dictionary\\" of experience terminology, philosophy, and examples (off-line examples too!). It's not a very extensive book, but it will get your mind \\"juiced\\", thinking in new ways and taking you in new directions. As I kept reading, I kept wishing it dove deeper into the thinking behind user's individual experience and memory. Nathan makes up for this by having an extensive resource section for further reading.Of special note were the ideas presented in the book on storytelling, the senses, and different cognitive models. Nathan hits you between the eyes with a lot of one-liners too. My favorite that a LOT of designers get wrong: Data is not information. In the end, I've absorbed a lot of the book and plan on \\"taking it off the shelf\\" for future projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting premise","review":"This was a rather underappreciated episode of the original series. The Enterprise comes in contact with a planet that is an exact repica of Earth and beam down to a deserted, probably Midwestern American town reminiscent of the 1960's. It is found that the only inhabitants are children who have aged very little in over a 300 year period and that all the adults were killed as a result of a medical expirement that failed. The idea behind this story is great, but the storyline is lacking in interest and the acting is mediocre. Plus the children are a total nuisance. Production design is interesting portraying a decaying town that has not changed in 3 centuries, but the model of Earth is too artificial and map-like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bonk, bonk on the Head!","review":"This episode was entertaining, but not one of the best. As stated in other reviews, it was the obnoxious kids that really detracted from the other particulars including: curing the disease and, the budding feelings of Miri for Kirk."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Episode That the Series Could Have Done Without","review":"There are some good ideas and concepts within this episode, but they are drowned out by the annoying chants of too many children.Yoeman Janice Rand has a decent role in the story.

Be prepared to find hilarity in things which are neither politically correct nor particularly kind - I caught myself laughing out loud about a comment on famine on page one. Not really what you would normally consider the stuff of comedy, but that is the brilliance of this book. The main character, Steven Ralph, says it like it is and how many of us would probably like to. It is this which makes his somewhat unorthodox take on life and way of dealing with it paint him less like a lazy sociopathic slob than a guy you can actually sympathise with. Utterly entertaining, I just wish there was more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of talent","review":"What a waste of talent. Having heard Nestor since the 70's, I cannot believe he has fallen into the instrumental hip-hop pop commercial smooth music, it is not even jazz. Nestor is one of the best flutists in latin music, be it latin jazz or salsa.If you want to listen to Nestor at his best, get \\"Morning Ride\\" or \\"Dance Of The Phoenix\\". Or listen to him as a sideman in the 70's Orquesta Novel albums, Batacumbele's \\"Con Un Poco De Songo\\" or in Cachao's Master Sessions Vol. 1 & 2.If you are into instrumental, hip-hop, pop, commercial, smooth music, this is an excellent album, but if you are a hardcore latin jazz or salsa fan don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed full of information and insight","review":"Besides plenty of practical information (hotels, restaurants, etc), this book contains seven suggested walks in St. Petersburg. They range throughout the center of the city, Vasilievsky Island, the Smolny area and the outlying palaces (and full attention is given to five of them rather than just Peterhof and Tsarskoe Selo as in most guidebooks). It also includes a walk in the Hermitage. These walks include good maps. Additionally, this book has excellent sections on the history of the city, customs and various subjects (the \\"mafia\\", icons, vodka, etc.) that provide context for your visit.

My only favorite band besides Joy Division would be the Deftones and Minerva is a nice track.

Not just the title, but also the plot and even key events. The Chinese setting and ambience are different enough so that this isn't necessarily violating copyright laws, but it's nonetheless pretty blatant copying. The characters do have different quirks and have their enjoyable moments. Basically, if you want a romantic comedy like the original What Women Want with a Chinese flavor, this movie will do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of hand waving, but does help","review":"A little too wordy, but as a management text, I guess its a prerequisite. It covers the gamut of fixed income securities, but only approaches the problems deterministically. The first thirteen chapters are \\"text\\" chapters, with the real math starting in chapter 14. However, the math used is elementary, and will not be of much help in the real world. For the fixed income math portion look into \\"Bond Pricing and Portfolio Analysis\\" by Olivier de La Grandville.For a first course in bonds, and if the student has no prior background, this book will indeed be useful.

But the only thing that concerns me with this album is the corney parts like the roleplay of the mother and father arguing, its just so scripted and fake \\"I hate you\\" and its all your fault and errrrr just stop plz!! lol Play the ace songs!

Just a shame they broke up :( lets hope they return sometime in the future for another album ehh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"This is one of the coolest theme albums I've heard.

Everything about it is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, I love it","review":"This is another example of a young band growing up and getting better, tighter and more creative. Save the growl (to the other reviewers point, I do agree that it does ruin some of the best darn music out there), Floor is in top form and keeps getting better.Joost on keyboards has added another dimension to this band. The music is fantastic. Floor is a goddess, and with the exception of the growl vocals, which are generally buried in the background, dominates the record, and makes it amazing.I cannot find anything really wrong with it, and I can't stop listening to it, growl and all. Absolutely terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"On of the best","review":"This is one of the best Symphonic Metal bands I have ever heard.

Check out dimmu borgir, atreyu, unearth, lamb of god, susperia's new albums**(follow up review) 8/18/04 - To Glam boy: \\"nallen\\" when I called this glam metal, I was being sarcastic, compared to what I listen to it is. I would better categorize this as Progressive Gothic music (more progressive than anything else). And you can't read either, you said listen to the music and stop being stupid? I said their music was fine, it's the glass shattering singer! Finally - the darkness stinks even more than this band, you have no clue what I listen to. You want good gothic? Listen to My dying bride, Tristania, Orphanage, hardcore goth? Cradle of filth, Emperor, old mans child. Go buy a Van Halen or Dio album dude (lame bands like that you dork)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent. Extremely comprehensive. A superb resource.","review":"This is Dillow's magnum opus. He covers all the bases concerning the gospel, assurance, eternal security, perseverance, and rewards. He takes a stand that is somewhere between Calvinism and Arminian.

Great deal 3 bottles for the Price of $19.17. I could not ask for a better price & potency.

There are only three tracks, and each one ranges in a 10-20 minute play time. Unlike most of Bhagavan's albums, there's a strong gospel blues leaning here. It's beautiful, dark, and transcendent. The opening and closing songs are both stark blends of Christian traditionals, Delta blues and Hindi bhajans set to a spaceous landscape of acoustic guitar. At times these are a little too intense for me. The ultimate gem of this album is the 16-minute \\"Radhe Shyam,\\" an organic, passionate devotional. This is a beautiful, melodic track that stands out against the others. If you like bhajans, I strongly suggest buying Holy Ghost Sessions for this song alone. It's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Read\\" book for all parents.","review":"Every now and then a book comes along which combines wisdom, common sense, and a touch of genius.

Save your money, get the abc book or the full length version for an older child and try some of the many online book related activities you can find for this book on the web.

It was full of limitless qualifications, redundancies, and undefined terminology (there was no glossary).If you are unfortunate enough to find yourself in a position of having to actually have to wade through this, (for a class, for example), expect to find flatly unexplained contradictions in fact. (EG, the chapter on population sates that the rate of human population increase is steadily increasing, but then go on to repeatedly quotes Joel Cohen who states that it had slowed down in the 1970's).Trying to study from it was a big enough ordeal to put most people off the subject for life. This textbook's abdication of explanatory rigor is probably one of the reasons the environmental movement has not gotten the popular traction it deserves.Truly this textbook is a case study in obfuscatory humbug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"When I saw this as being available,could'nt wait to get my hands on it! Once I listened to it,completely let down. Where are the original versions of IOU & I want it to be real! Thats what I remember,thats what I have on vinyl! Being a part time DJ,& using only CD's,I wanted this as part of my collection. Turns out the remixes do not have the energy that the originals do. The review did not say the original versions were not on it. I love a good remix as much as the next person,but the original is what I remeber mixing,and what was heard on the radio when it hit. Sorry Johny,if you are going to make a greatest hits,keep it original,I played this for other friends & DJ's and they were also disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Road Warriors !","review":"I travel every week out of town.

I think they're good, they serve their function and even get people's attention sometimes because of the cool way they are assembled. The only reason I give it four stars is because the plastic top that holds them seems extremely cheap and flimsy- and this is just my opinion ha but it is also unatractive. I threw mine away (the top that is). If you're like me and do that, just make sure you wrap them around a napkin or something, so they don't fall out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why haven't I heard about this?","review":"The perfect sort of novel: fast-paced but heady, filled with wonderful character descriptions, and soaked in mystery.

I have a masters degree from a prestigious university. I have been to Ireland. My grandmother's maiden name is O'Flattery. With all of that, I simply can't make any sense of this book. Niall goes off to Trinity College and on the very first day has a strange encounter with the attractive but elusive Pablo. Although there are references to him, we don't actually see Pablo again for at least 150 pages. Meanwhile, Niall falls in with some uninteresting characters who live their lives asking questions then finding the answers in random literature. He has a fling with Chris. Beyond that, not much at all happens but the prose goes on and on and on. I finally gave up around page 200 (of 350).

Instead of a typical commentary, however, his book is more like his own personal running commentary on how he thinks the passages apply to life and counselors. The harsh tone of the book (especially toward the counselee) would have driven me away if I was the one being counseled. To clarify, it would be the harsh tone that would drive me away, NOT the truth that meaning can be found in Jesus alone.I did not understand the book of Ecclesiastes at all before I read this book. Unfortunately, I do not feel I understand it any more after reading this book. For further study on Ecclesiastes I would recommend Derek Kidner's book on wisdom literature (The Wisdom of Proverbs, Job and Ecclesiastes) and Tremper Longman's commentary on Ecclesiastes (NICOT, Eerdman's Publishing). Both are more academic sources, but they are clarifying and not too \\"weighty\\" or difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant!","review":"I finished the book in the gym today.

The pouch holds the 15 rd. magazines just fine, however when I went to put it on the rifle I had to take the barrel & reciever out of the stock to slide it over the stock as it would not slide over the charging handle or fit by sliding over the butt-plate end of the rifle. It was a tight fit and the seams ripped a few stiches while getting it on. Once on the rifle, I inserted the magazines and they made the fit even worse. I ended up giving the pouch to another M1 Carbine guy who wanted it just for the sake of having it. I will not buy another.

John Carradine was a memorable character actor who gave rich performances in big and small budget pictures. Finally, a book has been written about him that not only explores his life via anecdotes and interviews interspersed throughout, but his vein of work that stretched innumerable decades and genres. Author Tom Weaver has crafted a fun and lively chronological read, putting together little-known information and revealing asides to enhance our knowlegde of the work of an aspiring actor. Perhaps now, more people will seriously reappraise Carradine's work and give him the consideration he's due."},{"rating":"1","title":"Floppy disk? DOS?","review":"While there are some fair to good suggestions for anyone who is trying to start up a Human Resources department - one of the things that drew me to this book was the mention that there were electronic forms that came with the book. The forms are on floppy disk and are available in DOS. Not a really good choice for a person who has been working with Windows 95 for years.The one thing that I was able to use when I first got the book was the layout of Job Descriptions.

In our zeal to make the world \\"accept \\" the Gospel, we must be extremely careful, that we dont then go and \\"create\\" a gospel that is \\"acceptable to the world\\". The Gospel has always been an offense and a stumbling block (KJV)and those who would dare to say they can somehow improve on Gods Eternal and Unchangining Gospel, are deceived, and, much much worse, are leading men and women and this nations children to a powerless false gospel that can save no one.Is there any thing more diabolical ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is Sundquist?","review":"I am not really sure who James Sundquist is.

It seems Warren's success, both in terms of earthly recognition and spiritual fruit, is too much for Sundquist. The arguments are overblown and not based on reason. It seems he was out to do a smear attack on Warren from the start, and his agenda drives the \\"facts\\" he uncovers.I am not Warren's #1 fan, but let me say this: If I ever have 1% of the effectiveness that Rick Warren has had for the kingdom of God, I will be thrilled. Let me also say that Rick Warren \\"reverse tithes\\"--that is, he GIVES 90% of his income, and LIVES on 10%. And, once his \\"Purpose Driven Life\\" book became such a bestseller, Warren actually gave all the salary he'd earned in 20-plus years back to his church. That's an example I can't argue with.

If you don't understand what is wrong with your church or our churches in general this book is for you.

But that NRG is ruined too soon by a boring drum track. And then we get back to powerful vocal starting Saving My Soul...pretty poor programming if you ask me. Things finish off with 2 more vocal anthems. So overall, this is a pumpin mix, with just a small number of useless tracks that slow things down a bit.

I felt as if womeone tricked me. Some books are not necessarily bad, But contain a dull story disguised under a really thick and \\"edgy\\" surface. Survior was one of those books. It starts off well enough. The first half is quite catchy. There a neat loittle quirks in the characters and the writing style is casual enough so the humor does not seem forced. But then the actual plotline comes in. BAD BAD BAD. It appears as if Chuck Palaenguck created these very offbeat roles in the story and then had nothing to do with them. So an elaborate over the top storyline takes place. It is only supported by having the characters suddenly able to do impossible things, like tell the future. bad job Chuck. you pissed me off with your crap writing.two stars for readability and the first part of the book. but thats all. YOU THE READER OF AMAZON! DON'T READ THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak gimmickry doesn't carry","review":"this has to be the most overrated author on amazon. there's a huge divide in his audience -- traditional / educated fiction fans seem to be very disappointed with his style. on the other hand there's a strong cult-like contingent of fans who aren't traditional readers.it's my opinion that anyone who has read a decent amount of fiction will see right through this guy's prose techniques. i guess it's good that the masses have found something to like, beyond comic books, but that doesn't make it good writing.and even though chuck personally attacks people who give him bad reviews, he'll not get good reviews until he writes something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunk!!!!","review":"The story was terrible. Didnt care for any of the characters. Couldn't put it down cause I was just trying to get to the end in hopes it got better.... It didn't. The best thing about it was it was a pretty quick read and I will now avoid Palahniuk in the future. No idea why everyone loves this book. Dont get caught up in the hype. It Stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Chuck Palahniuk more accesable books","review":"Survivor is a good first book for someone who isn't sure if they are going to like Chuck Palahniuk or not. Not as in your face as Fight Club (a personal favorite) and certainly not as wacked as Invisable Monsters, Survivor is an excellent commentary on our society and the messed up role of religion and role models. In all a good read that is very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Funny, Fun, And Interesting Book","review":"I borrowed this book from the local library, unsure of whether I would like it or not. I didn't know anyone personally who had read it, so I thought I would give it a shot. The first thing that struck me was that the pages are numbered backwards--a countdown to 1, which immediately made want to read. It started off vaguely interesting, as I believe all of Palahniuk's novels do, but careens into something strikingly unique and creative. The plot is fairly simple, centering around a confused man who, in desperation, has taken an aircraft hostage. Without giving too much away, the title gets its name because the main character happens to be the only survivor of a death cult, and because of his strange situation, was launched into stardom as a religious superstar. Palahniuk doesn't fail though, and the clever but gut-wrenching climax is just as spectacular as the rest of the book. I highly recommend this novel, it's a fast read you can breeze through and really enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book was simply amazing, i could not put it down, i had read \\"choke\\" by Mr. palahniuk and found it very amusing. But by far this book was more entertaining and all around a better story. This book is well written and I loved every minute of it. You will too, read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars just for being creative....","review":"Survivor really kept my attention, starting backward and recreating the storyline through declining paragraphs to a climactic ending. Palahniuk's commentary on society and it's twisted grip on reality is probably less fiction than most would like to believe.The main character's personal sense of truth makes him all the more real, caught in a unbelievable situation. The latter half of the book, the mountains of confiscated pornography, while doesn't seem too far from the truth with our current administration, still lost me a bit. I thought it was too ridiculous. None the less, I found the book to be very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"This book is about Tender Branson who grew up in a Cult and tells his story aboard a plane that is going to crash. As the story went on, the more addicted to it I became. Palahniuk is the master of originality, and after reading this you will see why. To date, this is one of my favorite books by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant source for Vocabulary","review":"Many authors are hollywood but Palahniuk depicts life in a different and fun sort of way. This book is not too thick but the vocabulary and brilliant sentences puts this book in its own league."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Palahniuk novel","review":"Yea, Survivor is my favorite book by Chuck Palahniuk, but I'll try and give an unbias opinion. As with most of Chuck's fans, they all seem to identify with his books in their own unique ways. I found Survivor to be an entertaining romp. It always had me turning the pages, and it always had me guessing where it was leading. As with most of Chuck's writing style, it's quick and very action oriented. A greater use of verbs then adjectives. More plot points then expisition. Now, this is the neat thing that made me such a fan of this book. After a single reading, it doesn't appear that there is anything overtly special about it. It's entertaining, but Survivor will leave a lot of unanswered questions. Then visit the official website and read some message board comments on the \\"truth about Survivor,\\" then the fun starts. The book then reads out like a big puzzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Echo","review":"Similar to many other reviewers, this is my favorite Chuck Palahniuk novel (second favorite is \\"Haunted: A Novel\\" -- my first Chuck Palahniuk novel); so far, I have read all his books except for Fight Club! Anyway, I liked it so much I recommend it to all my friends and have started buying/sending it to others. It's THAT good. I love his darkly humorous satire of contemporary (American) life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Dark","review":"To say that Mr. Palahniuk's works are strange and dystopian is to admit that the Kalahari is a bit dry in summer. In other words, it is a drastic understatement. As with his other books, Survivor provides an interesting, and extremely disturbing protagonist. In this case the object of our occasional affection and frequent revulsion is one Tender Branson, former cult member, televangelist, speaker and currently the narrator of the book; undertaking that task alone from 30,000 feet in a jet set to crash in the Australian Outback.If that's not strange enough, the fact that he is the last, and least observant, of his suicide cult provide an interesting commentary on the nature of belief. The book also provides a dark, if not necessarily inaccurate portrayal of popular religion in America, and for that, it is well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Chuck Palahniuk's Best","review":"Learned about Palahniuk from a co-worker. I knew that he wrote fight club and I knew I had to read some of this other works. I read this after reading Lullaby and Diary. l I thought this showed how some people are willing to be anything as long as they are relevant. This is a typical Palahniuk work in regards to examining the dark side that makes up people. The book opened up right away and caught my attention. I feel as though he could have developed a link with the reader to the main character but it is often difficult to do when your characters are dark and have experienced as dark of a life as Branson. I would suggest this to anyone who is looking to examine the psyche of themselves and open up our minds to the struggles we are lucky to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Palahniuk I've read","review":"Short and sweet here. Pahlaniuk is a very inventive wrtiter. He has an incrdible sense of stewing a story together with intrigue, accessability, and raw humor. His stories are very inventive and extremely hard to easily summarize , as there are so many interwoven aspects to his characters that you can't take a snapshot of them and understand the the depth of their layers. Once again he has put together a tale that can't be put down very easily. I personally found this one to be his best of those I've read to date. Hard to explain it, just have to experience it for yourself. It came to me highly reccomended and I hand it to you highly reccomended"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Chuck...","review":"It is a close tie with \\"Fight Club,\\" but I found this book took me for an even bigger loop than Fight Club, and I didnt think that would've been possible. Ass-Backwards religious beliefs, stardom, murder, ESP, homewarming...what more could you ask for? EXCELLENT!!!! P.S. Dig the Countdown!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book from my favorite author.","review":"This is simply one of the best American novels written in the last 20 years. Savage, hilarious, sad, and challenging. Only this book could on one page point out the complacency of weathy society on one page and skewer the religious zelots on the next. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read the synopsis","review":"Fight Club is a fine film and my only previous exposure to Chuck Palahniuk but it hardly compares to this brilliant novel by the same author. Importantly, I'm glad I knew nothing about this book prior to reading it since it's so involving, unpredictable and immediately engaging that the less you know beforehand the better. A thought-provoking read that is a cohesive mix of depression, witty humour, hope and desperation that will appeal to people of any preference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survivor: A Novel","review":"Survivor by Chuck Palahniuk *****Survivor is the story of where it all went wrong. The point in our lives where we have all had choices to make. The choices that affect the rest of our lives. Survivor is the search for something far and something big, maybe something bigger than all of us, it is one mans search for something true.In this apocalyptic tale Tendor Branson relives his entire live in an attempt to find closure. As he retells his story of servitude, and his survival from the same things that constrict us all we realize the things that are actually important and the emphasis we put on somethings just isn't worth it.Survivor was UpChuck's second novel and possibly his best. Written with great literary prose and clever anecdotes it is both his most uplifting and insightful, as well as his most humoured and comical. Chuck Palahniuk did it again with Survivor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another strange and Interesting read","review":"The idea of a man telling a story as a plane is about to crash is definately a good reason to want to read more. Like most of Chuck's works, this book picks up more and more speed with each chapter. The unique way of telling the main character's story is definately surpassed by his unique tale. I enjoyed this book alot. It starts out one way then takes you on a ride leaving you thinking and happy with what you read. I think this book is for Chuck's fans and first time readers. Oh and the cover of this particular one can be made into a paper airplane...I mean thats a deal if I ever saw one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"Truly one of Palahniuk's best. It's dark, funny, quirky, and completely absorbing. An in your face plot makes for a read you won't forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chuck is amazing.","review":"All of chuck's books are amazing. His writing draws you in and takes you on a very unique journey. His books are remarkably quotable too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Satire on Fame and Religion","review":"This was a really interesting and enjoyable novel about the trials and tribulations of false Messiah-hood. It is darkly humorous and contains many moments and ideas that are simply too odd to describe faithfully here. I can't say anymore for fear that I will ruin to book for those who haven't read it. Palahniuk seems to be a damn good writer and I am awaiting his new books. Go ahead and read it, dammit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really for everyone","review":"I loved reading this book, but then I gave it to my friend and he could only get to about page 60. So I guess if get a laugh about a guy who's only trill in life is to talk to people who want to commit suicide, then this is the book for you. Oh and this is a satire, so don't take it seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong and down-to-earth... in a weird sort of way","review":"Much like as in Fight Club, Survivor provides characters and a plot that becomes more and more outrageous as the story unfolds, well past the point of outrageousness.I would like to think that this technique is much less rooted in gimmickry as it is in trying to beat the reader over the head with the point he is trying to make. I think Palahniuk is making a parallel to many of the techniques used by the mass media to attract the attention of the general populous. More importantly this is serving as criticism for both the media companies and the mindless that follow step.Long story short, I think if you read this book and can look through to the heart of what the author is trying to say, you will find that Survivor is a very, very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Anger a Crowd","review":"Chuck Palahniuk, I believe, is fostering a new literary age. Along with Kurt Vonnegut and David Foster Wallace, the old tricks of literature have been thrown out the door, replaced with novels which resemble a Maelstrom: turning in on themselves, repeatedly hitting hard, and raising a mental storm. I am eager for the future._Survivor_ is my preference of Palahniuk's works. It is much better than _Invisible Monsters_, and I enjoyed a tad more than _Fight Club_ (I can't say for sure; the wonderful film and book are intermixed forever in my mind).This novel is interesting from the beginning. The characters, especially Fertility, are consistently entertaining and persistently disturbing. I particularly enjoyed the singularity of Tender's superiors and Fertility in their obsession with the future. Tender, meanwhile, represents all forms of religious fervor: he creates it, elicits it, abuses it.The book begins, twists, and obsesses into self-destruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...","review":"This is a great book.. Everyone else's reviews pretty much sum it up. I just wanted to add something that just came to me...The next setting for the hit TV show SURVIVOR is going to take place in the Austrailian Outback... and in this book called SURVIVOR the plane Tender Branson is on crashes into the Austrailian outback. Chuck Palahniuk has now show me something beautiful on two levels. Hopefully people will order this Survivor thinking it's the book for the TV show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I truly enjoy this novel, almost finished. It is hilarious, smartly written, entertaining and at the same time it touches so many of our modern day problems, our modern psyche. It is about boredom of everyday life as well as the continued feeling of helplessness in dealing with what the world throws at us, our increased expectations from life and others. So I mean it as a great compliment when I say this book is NEVER boring and would recommend to everyone, everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"The book has a different narrative than I am used to, the construction of the history is very catchy, totally worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As good as I anticipated, but...","review":"Chuck is by far one of my favorite authors. I had previously read Fight Club, Invisible Monsters, and Choke so I decided to give this one a try. It wasn't my favorite (or even second favorite) but I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you're a Chuck fan, it's definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"Well...to start, I really liked the screen adaptation of \\"Fight Club\\". As I understand it, \\"Fight Club\\" was filmed very faithfully...very close to the novel. But where to begin about \\"Survivor\\"? For starters, you'll never develop any real feelings pertaining to the novel's characters...they're bland, annoying and totally devoid of any personality. You'll constantly be shouting at Tender Branson, the lead character, to shut up over and over in your private thoughts. I found myself wishing the characters would just stop talking. They drone on and on and on and on...endlessly. And they don't even do it in an interesting manner!!! It's kind of like they've all had their souls sucked out of them...and you will too if you read this novel. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"irritating characters, unfocused plot, a bit forced","review":"I picked up this book expecting a good solid satire, but was disappointed. Much of the book is nothing but a bunch of aimless rambling about everything from how to commit suicide to how to how to remove blood stains. One knows from the way the book is written that nothing is meant to be taken seriously however. The author seems overly concerned with making people laugh. His style got old very quick with me. After the first few chapters I started getting annoyed by the characters, their names (i.e. Fertility Hollis) and the overall lack of focus. The story doesn't seem to have any solid sense of direction, jumping from one thing to another. If anyone carries on a conversation like the characters do in this book, they would be considered insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick and entertaining read, but not much more than that.","review":"The characters seemed distant. I did not care for any of them. Some situations seemed very improbable. Most of the novel seemed very sketchy and lacking detail where much detail was needed. It was an entertaining read nonetheless.However, don't expect something more spectacular than Fight Club like I did, because it isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surviving Member of the so called CREEDISH DEATH CULT","review":"This book is genius. The ending leaves you begging for more. The whole way the book is designed is simply the best thing I've seen. It's so unexpected that the sense of underlying terror seeps in through the main characters stories. You always get a thick tension of sadness while he goes through the motions. I really liked it. I suggest to pick this book up, also pick up Chuck's Fight Club, because a whole lot better than the movie. You guys should also check out Dope written by Robert escandon and check out Sword of Berserk, it's an anime but it has alot of similar themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just finished reading it 5 minutes ago","review":"Great book. If you liked fight club you'll love this one, guaranteed. Hope the rumors I've heard about this becoming a movie turn out to be true. Buy and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Popular Nihilism","review":"Chuck Palahniuk writes in a very specific style, its just a shame that I find said style so irritating, his novels can be likened to Irvine Welsh, but none of his characters have the substance of the great Mark Renton, they are mere toys whom Palahniuk uses to make a point, and make it he does.His novels are filled with social commentary and interesting facts, but this lack of substance means you only read Palahniuk on the off chance he might have something interesting to say about sex or drugs, not for the characters nor the story.Frankly this is a book for teenage boys and Marilyn Manson fans, gimmicky and \\"nihilistic\\", another way to alienate your parents and look cool at the same. Want real writing? Want real characters and nihilism, go read Trainspotting"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remind Me to Sleep","review":"Chuck Palahniuk does it again with this brilliant novel. While Fight Club still tops my list as his best written novel, Survivor will not dissapoint you in the least bit. His satire and overwhelming attention to detail bring this story of a cult survivor to life. Simple characters with not-so-simple personalities that intertwine all the way to the end. The story will shock you and humor you - a very entertaining addition to Chuck Palahniuk's satirical collection. Just remind me to sleep nect time - I couldn't put the damn thing down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chuck Palahniuk is one of the best fiction writers working","review":"As with most of the disenchanted, I praise artists who are outsiders, who yell at or hold a mirror to our shallow bundt cake society. Palahniuk is a scathing critic of the status quo and writes with no fear. His second novel proves he's no fluke. Although, I would say this one is for people who really, really liked Fight Club. It's just as clever, strangely populated, and unforgiving. Buy this book so he'll write more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging read, an intriguing mystery","review":"This book is a fast and compelling read, dark and funny and satisfying. If you were pleased with FIGHT CLUB, I suspect you'll get a lot out of SURVIVOR. Palahniuk has a rich and distinct voice, and he has a knack for expressing his deeply disturbing view of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me join the 250 other reviewers","review":"By saying this book ROCKS!!!!!!! Highly recommend it. Probably one of Palahniuk's best books, and I've read every one of them except Snuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"nihlism only goes so far","review":"So you say you loved Fight Club, both the movie and the book? And you want more?Well, you think you want more.After reading this book, you'll realize that Chuck Palahniuk delivered exactly what he told you to expect: more nihlism and confusion leavened with a bit of cleverness (both in plot and dialogue)...but like the sixth or so childhood Haloween candy bar, you soon realize that you're not satisified, you're just feeling queasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre and warped","review":"Chuck revels in writing about the thoughts and actions of bizarre and perveted fringe sociopaths. This book follows that strange compulsion. If that sort of thing interests you then by all means read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read...","review":"So much of this story was ingenious...a little (lot) hard to believe, but I think believability is not the point. I think the author is making social commentary and created a character that is the culmination of our collective insanity. His lead character, Tender Branson, rises to the height of fame and fortune for all the wrong reasons, but it seems that we have worshiped at the altar of commercialism and he is the result. It's the same when he's taken down. The emperor has been found without clothes and we blame him for having believed it.This book is very funny. It's dark, but it's funny. If you liked Fight Club...and I know you did...then this is definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frenzied Pace","review":"I believe I read the first hundred pages of this book in a frenzy: First standing in line for food, then eating, then just sitting at the table digesting. It takes off at a rapid pace and you can rip through half of it before you realize hours have gone by. Awesome read, I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schism","review":"I'm not going to give you a 'review' of this book. What I'm doing is telling you, if you remotely liked Fight Club, the movie or the novel, the dialogue or the impact, the violence or the controversy, you must buy this book. Chuck Palahniuk, (if I may be a tad cliche here) is a brilliant writer. This guy gets inside your mind and really digs deep into your reality and shatters your everyday thoughts. If after reading this book, you still think the same, you're Chuck Palahniuk."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fight Club--Not Even CLose","review":"I have to disagree with the reviewers who applauded this book. Hey, I loved Fight Club. This, however, was a hugh let-down. It read like a book of Fight Club outtakes. The cutsie numbering of chapters and pages backwards was ultimately irritating--reminding me how many pages I still had to slug through. And what was the point? Religious cults are bad? Am I supposed to like the narrator? It's very hard--I don't feel I know him at all. Must the book turn on a character who can unrelentingly predict the future? Is that cool? Funny? Meaningful? Clever?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst \\"Modern American Lit. Novel\\" Ever","review":"This book, vulgar and pointless is the tribulations of a cult, lying, thieving character that is neither lovable, understandable, or realistic. Possibly the worst novel of all time because it doesn't ever focus on realism and doesn't hold a message that makes sense. It is perverse and disgusting, unfulfilling and cheap. The biggest failure of the chronicles of Tender Branson is that Palahniuk tried to write a 'great novel' with a realist style that only offended and lacked everything needed to produce a coherent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"read this book","review":"I wasn't sure what I was really getting into with this book. Shortly after it arrived, I couldn't put it down. As mythical as is seems at times, the story is completely believeable. Chuck enters into several different realms in the book, which make you question existence, religion, and the world in general. What is so shocking though to think about is that religon is made and sold to us everyday, this story could happen. There are times when you don't understand why Tender Branson puts himself through what he does in the book, and times when you can relate to him completely. He is a modern day hero. This is an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, BUT...","review":"The book is well written, it starts out good (lots of nice quotes), but the ending is sooo dumb. It ruins the whole book. The book is generally predictable and although I like this style, the style only works when an author has something significant to say. Some may disagree with me here, but I thought Chuck had something much more significant to say when he wrote Fight Club. Of course, I couldn't put Survivor down, but in the end I was REALLY dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated author","review":"Honestly, Survivor just makes you feel like you have just read an intelligent novel. At first, it started off okay but still a bit strange. But after going deeper into the book, I realized that this book made no absolute sense and kept \\"jumping\\" if you will. I started to get lost toward the middle of the novel. Now, this is the only novel I have read from Palahniuk for now and with all the positive things I have heard about him, I feel that he is overrated at best. This book is pretty pointless to be honest but I will give him (Chuck) the benefit of the doubt and I'll read Fight Club (his most famous book). But Palahniuk has not impressed me one bit so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so book.","review":"I am obviously vastly in the minority, but I thought this book was a waste of my precious reading time. It never made a point. It's humor was developed much too slowly and wasn't very funny to begin with. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic - Until the End","review":"Survivor: A Novel by Chuck Palahniuk was very different and unexpectedly enjoyable. It was a book of lists, but the use of the lists helped to put you inside the head of the narrator, which is a very bizarre place. Tender Branson was born and raised in a religious cult community. Being a lesser son, he had to leave the community and work in the city once he came of age. When his entire family and community commit suicide, Branson is left as the last of the cult. He finds unlooked for fame and is hailed as a messiah. You are never quite sure if Tender is sane, brainwashed, or a con man.The book is well written and keeps your attention, except for the ending. The ending was too unbelievable and seems forced. It was as if it was the ending to a different story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood Stains on the Piano","review":"If you've never read a Chuck Palahniuk book before let me warn you: This man is screwed up. He writes screwed up books with screwed up characters and screwed up plots. But he's very good at it.He builds these surreal settings with characters that do crazy and obscene things, and you can't stop reading about it. He pinpoints the things about people that drive us crazy, the things that we know but have never really given thought to.I'm not going to spoil the plot here, but read this book. A lot of people said it would be offensive to Christians, but I wasn't too offended. His books are raw and violent and often obscene, but they're true.A question: Did this book really go back to the beginning? that confused me a little, I must admit. I am not the smartest thing around. Did it really start in the plane or was that just a metaphor, like he SURVIVES the plane crash, and starts a new life? Someone with a thought, please share."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"\\"Survivor\\" has the smell of a delicious meal - its bold, frenzied opening carries the aroma of good meat cooking. But Palahniuk is a short order cook serving up thin, insufficient burgers whose only flavoring is a slathering of ketchup. You can salt bad food to save it, but that doesn't make it worth swallowing.This is less an act of literature than a smart-alecky rant. A rant that is neither new nor funny nor intriguing. It is insufferably trite - to the point of being numbing - and coarsely, cheaply repetitive. We're a culture hung up on looks, on money, on fame, on competition, on faith - repulsively so, farcically so. Yeah, so what? That is the ear-splitting sermon of this tiresome book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Start= Average, Middle= Bloody Boring, End= \\" Expected that...\\"","review":"Ok Chuck P. has been recommended by a lot of people, A LOT! And after reading this I wonder if half of the kids I know are really dumb-ass morons. The book started decent, but after that it dropped to crud. The story was bad, the writing was off, it just wasn't brilliant in anyway shape or form. The messages he is trying to deliver just isn't worth explaining or worth even taking into consideration. I will at least admit there was some parts that made me laugh but that was basically all the book could deliver. Ill give it two stars because it isn't absolute garbage, but it sure is rotting into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I thought the plot in this book fell a little short. There were some threads that Palahniuk started in the beginning of the book that were intriguing, but he didn't follow them through to the end. Not nearly as interesting as Fight Club."},{"rating":"2","title":"You should be jealous that I read this book and you haven't.","review":"What are you waiting for? There isn't a copy at your library? Buy...the...book. Neal Pollack, eat your heart out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survivor","review":"Kurt H.This book was about a man (Tender Branson) trying to live in the real world. Tender Branson was born on a farm that was part of a death cult. He starts a fake suicide hot line and hijacks a plane and plans to crash it into the ocean. He is telling the \\"black box\\" his life story and that's where it starts. This is one of my favorite books by him I read Lullaby and Fight Club and Survivor is my favorite out of the three. The one thing that I really like about this book was how he made it. From the ending to the beginning. I would recommend this book to people who like reading all of Chuck Palahniuk books. The age group for this book would be teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I don't get all the hype surrounding this novel, that is. The previous reviewer has it exactly right. This is mediocre writing passed off as insightful and witty satire. After all, what's easier to satirize than consumerism, religion, and popular culture? Throw in some sex and death, and you have \\"Forrest Gump\\" for hipsters.There was no suspense, nothing exciting ever happened, and the promised payoff never came. The backwards numbering didn't help, either, as it only increased my annoyance. Better to read some DeLillo or Pynchon or Vonnegut or Ballard, rather than this waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"here he comes again...","review":"The book is laid out in a most weird way... It reminded me of Memento (the movie) as the first page has the number 289 and then goes down to 1. But it ended up nothing of the sort...This is certainly one of the best books I have read in some time. The hero is a useless piece of [stuff] but throughout the book you find yourself agreeing with him, and worse, even empathizing with him! He has so much of us - full of useful housekeeping information that is useless in telling you how to live this life...A engrossing book from a writer really out there..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insight into insight","review":"A superb novel with an amazingly skewed view of our world. Armed with an astonishing repertoire of \\"How to do\\" knowledge and a knack of taking us into our sub-consious at the consious level Chuck Palahniuk (His first name is as simple as the ideas he presents and his last as weird as his characters) has created another classic for the times. The only thing that bothers me about his work is that after reading them, I can't seem to enjoy any other writing and am almost at the point of committing literary suicide!! Maybe he's one of the sole survivor's of the (OLT) original literary thought cult. I hope that Chuck is not writing all these great novels to become famous and then....:))PS: The Agent says that my review is not going to help him sell any more books...He argues that there is absolutely nothing in it that plugs the novel. I agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ IT","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. I can't think of much to say about it besides that. Just read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"I read Fight Club first and it was a decent book. This was the next book of Palahniuk's that I read and I then read the rest. I have to say by far this is the best book I have ever read and not just by Palahniuk but out of all books I have read. I recomend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard reading for all awesome people","review":"Survivor by Palahniuk is my number one book choice if I had to be stranded in Chucky Cheese for a day-or anywhere. It's about a cult member who is the only remaining survivor of a mass-suicide cult and America believes him to be some kind of guru after having survived something like that. The literature is dark, sardonic, and sarcastic, just the way I like it. The main character takes pleasure in small things such as starting a fake self-help hotline and when people call up he gives them useless advice leading them usually to suicide. He says he knows to pull the phone away from his ear when he hears the trigger mechanism click just before the gun fires. Towards the middle of the book he befriends a woman named Fertility and then gets an agent because he becomes famous. Chuck Palahniuk's a genius, and so are his parents for making him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! This is a must read.","review":"First off let me start by saying that I hate reading. Due to my current occupation, I have plenty of time that needs to be occupied.After seeing the movie Fight Club, I instantly developed a strong sense of interest for books and movies with that unique twist of psychological events. I found out who wrote the script and searched for his other writings.I can honestly say that the twist I saw in Fight Club was also present in this book (Survivor). Like I have stated earlier, I hate reading, but I finished this book in two sittings. Once I started I couldn't stop reading. I don't think I have ever read a book this fast in my entire life, and I can't wait to start reading Lullaby.Survivor was a book full of roller coaster like events, irony, and dark humor. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I can only hope there are other authors that can strike such interest in me once I finish reading the other 5 books written by Chuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some are just doing it more efficiently.","review":"This is the story of how it all went wrong. From the Creedish Death Cult to Media Messiah.An interesting and entertaining read. With all of the satire and humour the author has become known for. Perhaps not as sharp as Fight Club, but it has more edge than most of what you'll read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I gotta read Fight Club now","review":"I have to admit. It was Fight Club (the movie) that drew me into purchasing & reading this book. trust me, it's very good! now, reading Fight Club is a must. If only I could find a copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Twisted Social commentary.","review":"Once again Palahniuk manages to make a bizarre, convoluted story believable. A perfect commentary on what makes a 'star' in today's world and how what you see is definitely not always what you are really getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dark humour","review":"This novel is extremely well written, filled with dark humour and an enticing mystery. It is one of the few novels that had me turning the pages to finish in less than two days. The author does an excellent job creating a sympathetic anti-hero: while his fake suicide prevention hotline is reprehensible, his background, upbringing, and *surviving* in the face of an overwhelmingingly surreal environment make the story enjoyable. Everything about the book is unusual, from the page numbers counting downwards to the style of narration. Overall, this is highly recommended book if you like this genre of modern fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, dark read","review":"This is the first book by Palahniuk I have read. I've enjoyed his unique style so far. Reference elsewhere for details on his style. The dark tones make it difficult to return to consistently over a longer span of time. Reading it again, I would allot chunks of time to finish it quickly and stay within the mindset of the story since jumping from this book to a happy life and back again many times is a bit jarring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn, that was intense","review":"This novel is by far the most intense and well-written story I've read in a while. It surpasses the P-man's best previous effort, Fight Club, but just narrowly. The story is full of great ideas, one of which is the use of a character with no mental problems that is diagnosed with every mental disorder by his case worker. The romance in the story is off-beat because of the lack of romance in it. The story is well thought out and well portrayed, and the characters are extremely likable. Mr. Pcan'tspellhisname is one of the most fluent and well-learned writers working today. His story is full of things that could only be learned through reading. These obscure facts and passed down remedies to home problems are one of the main things that makes this book so appealing.In closing, let me say that Chuck continues to impress with every story and evry character. Also, the page numbers counting backwards from the end are a great little add-on that makes the realism of time terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy do I love suicide cults.","review":"This was the second book by Chuck Palahniuk that I read and it just added fuel to the fire. It's and interesting story with VERY interesting characters that you will not be able to relate to but it's ok.The way the book is set up is you're reading the book backwards. You're at the end of the book when you first open it, but it doesn't give important things away. It's a very unique way of telling a story and it worked for Chuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe to say, you haven't read anything like it","review":"I was reading this book and wondering how he was ever going to make an anit-hero out of this guy. The anti part I get, but the hero part I wasn't so sure about. How can anyone do anything that the main character does in this book end up comping out sympathetic in the end. That is the beauty of the book and why it is very readable. The book was very original and I enjoyed it completely in that it did not subscribe in any way to the ideals of what a hero should be or how a heroine should react. It is safe to say that you have never read anything quite like it, and as an avid reader that is a nice thing to find. I have rather strangely found myself to be a new fan of Chuck Palahniuk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly Funny","review":"This book is a great read. It can and should be read in one sitting (unfortunately I was not able to do this the first time...but I did the second time and it made all the difference!). Palahnik writes in such an interesting style, it is almost musical. In each chapter there is a refrain of sorts that is repeated with great effect, almost like the chorus to your favorite song.In the aftermath of the Branch Davidians in Waco, the Rub Ridge disaster, 9/11, and the renewed interest in spirituality, this is a must have. Notice I did not say a must read; you must read it, but more importantly you must own it, so that you can read it over and over again.The way in which the addictive personality is shown in Survivor is unforgettable, and the attack on simple-minded religion is much-needed. Read this book and read again and again. It will enlighten you in different ways each and every time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific","review":"Wonderful video of interviews and footage of many of the kali and escrima and arnis greats. I am an instructor in the Ted Lucaylucay lineage, trained by Chuck Gonzaga, Ted's senior student, but I have only been doing kali for 15 years and never had the chance to meet most of these great practitioners, and it was a real treat to get to see them on screen.

I looked all through the box and they were not in there. Had space for 3 connectors on the edge and another as a backup I guess. Anyway, two of the three active connectors were missing. The backup one was there and I had another collar that was worn out that I was able to use the connectors so wasn't worth the time to hassle with replacements.

I have attached my own photo so you can see that there is no reinforced edge on this cone. My 70 lb German shepherd managed to crack the outer edge of the cone on the first day when she banged it against a cabinet while turning around. In less than one week, she's managed to crack it in several places and is now held together by our \\"decorative\\" duct tape. The velcro closures (also not shown as they are in the photo-they really run the length of the cone in several spots for a variable fit) work quite well, so if Kong had just used a stronger material and a reinforced edge, this would be a much better product.Trust me, if you have a large / strong dog, keep looking. This cone is not for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dimensions incorrect","review":"My Bull-Boxer is having a toe on a front paw amputated tomorrow, and as her front legs are long I needed an E-Collar with a long measurement from the collar to the snout.The product description for this Kong XLarge shows 16.8 x 0.3 x 30.4inches, which logic would dictate the 16.8 as being the collar to snout measurement, the 0.3 being the thickness of the plastic, and the 30.4 being the unrolled length.That is exactly what I needed so I ordered it and had it 2nd day shipped to be ready for tomorrow.....and unfortunately the collar to snout measurement is only 9\\" which means that my pooch will easily be able to get to her paw around it.So i'm back to square one and have to try to get something figured out by tomorrow (the largest E-Collar that the vet has measures around 10\\" from collar to snout, and I need at least 15\\" which is why I chose this collar based on the published dimensions).Not good, PLEASE clear up the misleading dimensions!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"XL large is more like medium","review":"This E-collar is very cheaply made and the size is NOT extra large, it is a medium.

I have used the traditional E-collar on her for years. I decided to use a product where she could see through the sides, and would be softer than the traditional collar. The collar was so short from neck to snout that she could easily reach her hot spot. Actually, that would have happened if I could have put it on her! However, that did not happen. She has been trained for bird hunting and the sound of the snaps was intolerable to her. I tried to mail it back to the seller, but the cost of postage was greater than the cost of the item. There was no return guarantee with the product. I really do not recommend this product. When I use the traditional collar, it is secured with a regular leather dog collar. It slides on easily and she cannot remove it. It also stops her from pilfering slippers, shoes, tissues, etc. when she is wearing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kittty Collar","review":"Works well enough, The flaw(s)?

But, when I got them, they looked COMPLETELY different from the descriptive photo (the clear color with the black trim and 2 plastic snaps). What I got was a new-designed collar with 3 velcro closures instead of the secure snap closures. Also, the edges do not have the black trim that give it structure so it's easily bendable / crackable. You can see a photo of the product I actually received at Kong's website at: [...].Also, this seller, The Paws DOES NOT respond to any customer emails or returns. They turn a deaf ear. I had to contact Amazon to start their A-to-Z Guarantee policy on this seller.

He is much more tolerant of this that the one the vet sent him home with. I'm sure its not fun but he does not seem to mind having to put it on. It's seem a lot more comfortable and I think he appreciates having some of his peripheral vision restore. He's not banging his head into things as much. I'm happy with my purchase.Two cautions: You need to buy large. I bought the extra-large one for Labrador and it only fits at the largest setting. I also want to point out that this is a little shorter than some others. If you are trying to keep your dog from lick his front paws, this may not work. For other part of its body, its fine.Once complaint: This is true for all of these e-collars, not just this brand.. Why do they cost so much? This thing probably cost couple of buck to make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Know your sizes!","review":"The quality on this collar is very high.

Our poor Golden was running into everything. We finally decided to cut some of it off to give him more peripheral vision.

While plenty of details about her life are presented here, they're thrown together in a manner unworthy of this hardworking, detail-oriented woman.I was surprised and disappointed to find this book so poorly edited. Not only does the content lack cohesion, but there are actual typographical errors. For example, early in the text, the author makes a reference to the young Julia's twinkly, mischievous character: she calls this Julia's \\"twinkle\\" (with quotes), but the text reads \\"twinkle,\\" -- with quotes and a comma inside the quotes -- which any editor should have spotted.I'm not a writer, but I'm an avid reader and it's this kind of sloppiness which makes me lose faith in the author and turns me off to his/her book.I still have lots of faith in Julia Child, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book would be twice as good at half its length.","review":"A very long read.

An apparent story line is absent.Although the volume overflows, chockablock full of Julia facts, personally, I would have preferred a more edited, more cohesive biography.If you want to know everything about Julia Child and have the time to wade through the author's indulgence of time, then this book has met its objective. Perhaps, it's only me, but I perceived Julia Child as someone who edited her words, aimed for perfection and accomplished both with style & grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delicious Biography!","review":"A marvelous tribute to the ebullient and completely original dynamo that was Julia Child. Her personality almost springs off the pages in this long, juicy, honorific bio...celebrating not only her talents and triumphs, but the very special gifts she shared with the world. It also beautifully paints the portrait of her romantic love affair with husband Paul, as well as her close friendships. It's impossible not to enjoy this read and be charmed by its subject. I'd, of course, been aware of Julia Child as a celebrity but now I'm interested in going back and seeing more of her professional work as well...which she so dearly enjoyed as both a teacher, a student and an entertainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a life!

Ok, so the author did so much research she apparently couldn't bear to part with a single fact (and either there was no editor on the scene or that person was way too nice about the job), but if you keep moving (especially past the childhood), it's well worth the effort.

Both share the annoying capacity for blending guitars with cheesy 80's synths. The perfect example is the title track, which could've been used in a promo for \\"Joanie Loves Chachi.\\"Another similar trait is irritating, whiny vocals with no range. On \\"Eponine\\", and other tracks, there's a definite Queen influence, especially in the bombastic guitars.

Ozma sure does have some similarities in this album (though they're probably more comparable to a Christian band like Reliant K), but that doesn't make the album any good. The whole album is very boring. There's just nothing special to it.

I stopped reading after the narrator has a dream in which everyone in America turns into cockroaches the day after Ronald Reagan is elected. I've read and enjoyed many books where conservatives are cast as the villains, but this isn't a novel - it's a dehumanizing and contempt-filled screed. But that's just my reaction.

As someone who spent eight years working in my city's version of \\"Ponce\\", I can say without a doubt, there is nothing redeemable about this book or it's characters.I like to read books about people I would like to know.

Essentially card-board starts to bend if the board is laid-out on a slightly uneven surface (say carpet).2) The board should properly interlock. We sometimes have a hard time keeping the board intact (say if the dice accidentally rolls on the board, it messes it up).One way to fix it to have magnetic surface.3) I paid 150$ to get the entire pack. I wish they put all the bells/whistles into this pack. There are all sorts of variations available on the net. I think for 150$, it should be included.The game itself is AWESOME and FUN.

My only gripe is the new border pieces (instead of extra sea tiles) and a shortage of land tiles. Word of warning: do NOT throw away the blank \\"replacement\\" tiles.

The Jewish New Testament Commentary should be a required companion for this translation. David Stern takes care to explain why he translated the way he did for the New Testament. This Bible is not translated by a committee, such as other translations are done, you have the added advantage of understanding why he translated the way he did plus even alternate translations. He took care to do this effort in a systematic and consistant way. Without a doubt, by the aid of the Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit). Thank you LORD and thank you for your humble servant David Stern!

The New Testamanet (called Brit Chadashot in Hebrew) is not part of this work. It was written about a Jew, and in parts by Jews, but that does not make it Jewish. Judaism has never accepted Jesus as the Messiah/Moshiach. Just translating phrases into Hebrew (i.e., Pentecost into Shavuot) does not solve the problem. It is not with wording that we reject Christianity, but with ideas. This is a Christian bible, not a Jewish one.

The rest of the movie is a dark comedy with some laughs, but overall depressing. You really have to like the main actors to like this movie. Would not recommend for young audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark comedy I didn't expect","review":"I only got this movie because the fabulous Brittany Murphy is in it. Otherwise, I never heard of it. The movie has some very funny scenes with the added touch of some tender moments. The only problem is the movie kind of gets carried away with itself at times and tends to get a bit too crude. But, Brittany Murphy has such screen presence and she plays another character that draws you in and makes you care what happens to her. She is truly magical. The other actors do a good job, to.RKV"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent tool.","review":"As with everything Kevin Conner does, this book is exhaustive. It is directed towards those who wish to dig deep into the Word of God, comparing Scripture with Scripture, letting the Bible interpret itself. I highly recommend it for those that want to be trained to find out what the Bible really says. It also trains the reader to compare the Old and New Testaments, using the principles of the New Testament to unlock the truths of the Old. Every valid hermeneutical principle is looked at in depth with detailed examples. A truly valuable tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K.

What you can't tell from the photo is that this case has no depth to it whatsoever. It is a sleeve, essentially, with a front and back but no third dimension to allow anything to fit inside. Also, what looks in the photo like a flap, is actually stitched down and only open on the bottom edge. It works kind of like some pillow cases I've had, where the sides overlap. The problem is that the overlap is stitched down so tightly that you can't get a phone or camera inside. Even if you managed that, it would not be easy to remove. So then what's the point? This is not a case for something I want to use frequently. Don't buy it unless you need something to store very flat objects in that you will never need to remove from the case. I am out a few buck on this since I have to pay return shipping. An idiot must have designed this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"I bought this case for my Panasonic Lumix.

Next was the RADIO EDIT of Believe (16B mix)!!! WHAT???!!! The radio edit sucks. I much prefer the full version ( which you can find on the limited edition of Polydistortion, of which only 2000 were made), not some stupid radio edit. The Underdog remix of \\"Believe\\" is very nice, especially when it stops the beat in the middle and then slowly starts it again. \\"Polymovie\\" is well worth the price of the cd, even though it's yet another remix of \\"Polyesterday.\\" It works very well, and it's da bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"Not enough information for the subjects in ase L1 test. very disappointed in content!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gallic reggea","review":"Good friend of mine is a reggea DJ and told me that I had to get this while I was in Paris.

I didn't use it that often, about two dozen times over the period of a year and a half, and then one of the audio channels failed completely. The manufacturer's customer service dept. never responded to my emails even though I offered to pay for a repair. For the heck of it I opened the unit to see if I could diagnose the problem myself and found cheap no name IC chips that had absolutely no markings. In short, it's a piece of junk.

Originally I purchased the unit only, and used it with my own hypnosis cd's and mp3's. I don't really get the visual effects, or the vibrating sound waves. I found myself more distracted that listening to them alone. The premium headphone are moderate at best, and I used my earbuds for better sound. Per a suggestion in a previous review I thought buying the corresponding CD set might improve the experience, there is only one of the 5 CD's that doesn't make me want to turn it off before it's done. Maybe I need to give it more time....but the cost is way to high to try another system like this.

Through his career, he put together a great number of fantastic singles. But this album is his great masterpiece.There aren't any megahits. The most well known tracks: 'Ballade de Melody Nelson' and 'Ah, Melody' are first rate songs, but it's absolutely criminal to separate them from the rest of the album.Clocking in at just under 30 minutes, \\"Histoire de Melody Nelson\\" flows as one poignant tale of Melody Nelson. The music itself was far ahead of it's time; listen to these songs and then listen to Air and Beck. While the great orchestrations and melodies should be enough to sate the appetite of many non-francophone listeners, it is truly the lyrics that lift this album to timeless stature. Gainsborg was a poet to French song the way Dylan is to American song. This album is his finest hour, not to be missed by anyone interested in greatness in popular music."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet lord","review":"Man this is a lecherous record, but lechery never felt so good.

I would not normally have bought the set because of the small size of paint tubes.Turns out I can't paint like I used to... XDFor a beginner oil painter... I would recommend a set with larger paint tubes - buy your own solvent and brushes - the supplied ones are nothing special.Always buy Winsor Newton oil paint because it rocks.For a beginner painter... don't spend too much on oils when you haven't worked in acrylic.

I haven't tried running with them on yet but I would imagine that they would be fairly stable. The lenses are slanted upwards slightly and look very sporty.

AT first, I bought this book for my little brother, but I started reading it and I couldn't stop! I COULD NOT STOP! I was reading until late late at night, like until 3:00 am in the morning. It was so easy to deliver these jokes to my little brother that I had him up all night too. Sometimes, now when I'm sitting at my desk at work, I think of these jokes and just start cracking up. When I'm sad, all I have to do is pull it off my shelf. Thank you Genevieve Stamper for your wonderful book, it has certainly lightened my life considerably and I recommend it with my whole heart to all those out there who love to laugh, need to laugh, or are just fascinted by today's technology. Wit, intellegence, and goofiness all in one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product for DVD Studio Pro 3","review":"All of the motion menus in this product are very high quality and have a look and feel that will attract people's attention.

OK, bibs are for me. People use them when they eat lobster, not just old people. I ordered 3 and LOVE them. They're large, well constructed, with a velcro neck grip. The backing is water resistant so there is no leak through. They hang down to my lap to catch crumbs. I sent out an email to my kids saying \\"Mommy bought bibs\\" warning them that mommy is on the downward side of the hill. Much to my surprise, my daughter wants me to get some for her too. This is a good product for folks who are not ashamed to admit they spill and want to save on dry cleaning bills.....bg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea -- poor design","review":"This bib looks good in the picture but unfortunately the snaps that hold it in place will be too difficult for many elderly people to manipulate by themselves. An elderly adult with arthritis, tremors, other impaired small motor control, or dementia will likely need assistance to align the small metal snaps so that they close. A better design would have used velcro or some other method of securing the bib around the neck that would allow an impaired person to fasten the bib independently.

A nice idea, but not at 2am or 4am. It continues to beep until you get up and reset it. It is even worse when the temperature hovers between 37.2 and 37.4 degrees, since as soon as it returns to 37.4 it alarms again - a total of 4 times before 6am the other night.

It also prevents any kind of attempt at wall mounting. I had assumed I could hang it on a wall but it is not possible. The unit does work well, serves it purposes as a self setting clock and indoor/outdoor thermometer, and is visible by all when placed on top of our refrigerator.The low temperature alarm was annoying. I changed the channel and it went away.A second unit that I gifted found a great use when the sensor was placed near a water pipe that once froze.

They still have the same freezing issues that standard NiMH have but the other eight months of the year you won't have to use the pricey batteries. (not that any of this has to do with this thermometer specifically)Secondly, the screws on the back of the outdoor/radio unit are very small, and I'm not exactly sure why they felt the need to go that route but most any eyeglass repair kit that contains a Phillips head screwdriver should make short work of them.Other than that, if you follow the very simple, well illustrated instruction, you should have no problems.The range to the outdoor radio is listed at 100' if that matters.(your mileage may vary)"},{"rating":"1","title":"impossibly screwy","review":"is there a screw driver made which fits these screws on the sensor. by the time you get the cover off, you have stripped the screws, never to be used again. i guess i will use scotch tape from now on! forget this product and this manufacturer!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oregon Scientific Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer","review":"I am very displeased with this product.

This is a 99 Chrysler 300M, so maybe this works for other cars, but not this.Previously I've had lift supports with metal clips holding top and bottom... this design works!! Tougher to install, but worth it since it works. I DO NOT RECOMMEND LIFT SUPPORTS THAT USE A PLASTIC SLIDE TO SECURE TO THE CAR... WON'T LAST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"does the job","review":"This utensil set serves it's purpose well. I like that the utensils are sturdy, durable stainless steel. They pack up compactly in the cover making them perfect for travel. Now I always have cutlery for lunch on the go. One complaint I have is the cover itself has two small plastic snaps that are prone to breaking (the snap broke on my husband's set quite quickly). The spoon is also quite deep. This may be handy for chili or soup, but feels a little strange for my yoghurt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the lunchbox, but ditch the cover","review":"The only reason this product didn't get 5 stars from me is because the cheap-o plastic cover barely lasted a month. You don't need the cover for the flatware to work, obviously, but it would have been nice to have. My husband uses this set daily in his lunchbox and he raves about it, even without the cover. Very clever how the pieces all fit together.

The knife is awesome as often a plastic knife or fork would break when trying to cut up salads. This little set is quite sturdy thus, I highly recommend it.I agree with others, the clamshell cover could be sturdier however; the first one lasted about 6 months with almost daily use. I called the manufacturer and was able to order replacement covers so we're all set there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband uses it every day","review":"We LOVE this utensil set. My husband uses it every day in his lunch box. We had one set for about 4 years and never had a problem (until said husband accidentally threw away the spoon). So a replacement set was ordered and its just as good as the original.The cover case was quickly discarded. Its snaps are cumbersome. It seems like a a good idea to keep the unit together but honestly, they never slide apart. You'd also think it would be more sanitary, which it may be, until you use the silverware. Then the case is dirty either from covering used utensils or floating about in the wasteland of the lunch pail. It quickly becomes a big bother.

Epic has credited my account & I'm going to look for a totally different bag.I don't like to talk bad about a product, but this one is really terrible.

The truth is that this is a horible horible tribute album. All it really is singers that do not have the talent mark and tom do trying to sing like them over a musical track. I've seen many bands cover blink 182 tunes live and this is just [junk]. I've listened to blink 182 for a while now and i do believe this could be the worst posible tribute album.

Death, taxes, and lately, bad tribute albums. I don't even know who'd performing these songs, because I haven't bought the CD. That's also the only reason I'm being fair and giving it 2 stars instead of the 1 I'm sure it deserves. The first thing that struck me about this album is that it only has songs from Blink's last two CDs. Anybody seriously interested in doing a tribute to Blink should recognize Dude Ranch at the very least, and a good cover of Carousel wouldn't hurt, either. Instead, we have overly faithful covers with weak vocals and no energy. What's the point? Anyone who cares enough to buy this CD already has Blink's last two albums, so why do we need to hear them performed worse? Don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tribute??? More Like a Bashing If You Ask Me...","review":"Um... okay, what is this? Honestly, it sounds like N*Sync trying to mimic blink-182. The instrumental part is just fine and sounds like the real songs, but the vocals are fatal.

I listened to a clip from Anthem Part Two, it blowed!!

First off, these guys should have done more songs than just from the past 2 Blink albums, all of their albums have awesome songs on them, any true fans would recognize these songs. And on top of that, at least they should have 2 singers that somewhat resemble the voices of Mark and Tom. That guy sounds like some sorta weird al kinda guy. I hope that they actually played the instruments for the songs, cuz they sound digital. From the song clips I heard, this band makes Blink look bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace To Blink 182","review":"This album is a disgrace to one of the finest bands ever to perform. I don't even know who recorded these songs, and if I did, I would not support them by buying this album.

I have to agree with everyone else when I say that this cd shouldn't get any stars at all, not even one. I don't even know why this cd was even allowed to pass the recording studio and even stain blink182's collection of music... and did you notice that they only did songs from Enema of the State and Take off your Pants and Jacket?

But instead I get some lame guy singing like crap and not even doing any of the classic songs from cds BEFORE ENEMA. Come on people, making a Blink Tribute CD and not having Dammit, Josie, Pathetic, Carousel, or M&Ms is just ridiculous.

There are a few good tracks, but some tracks are very weak and don't seem to belong on this CD. One aspect of Tubular Bells 3 that was completely missing in Tubular Bells 2 is thematic unity. This one's just a collection of melodies - but TB3 had a definite introduction, development of theme and melodies, and a *spectacular* finale.

Unfortunately, after two subsequent decades of hits and misses, \\"Tubular Bells II\\" commits the cardinal sin his follow-up efforts avoided.

This is the first time that I listen to Ms. Bayo's voice and it is so refreshing. Placido Domingo sounds so great singing \\"Leandro's romanza\\". The zarzuela is considered bel canto because of the style and vocal exigencies that wonderful music has. Like opera, the stories can be very dramatic, fun and mysterious.

Clapton infuses a raw and honest soul into many of the songs, especially the live version of \\"Tears in Heaven\\" which was of course written for his son who tragically died. His unplugged version of \\"Layla\\" is also quite good, and many of the other tracks showcase a strong tradional blues sensibility that most Claption fans might not have always realized existed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest Clapton yet!","review":"This MTV Unplugged session is not only one of Clapton's greatest performances, but one of MTV Unplugged's greatest performances. \\"Layla\\", \\"Old Love\\", \\"Running on Faith\\", from start to finish it's one of my top 5 favorite CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lo How The Mighty Have Fallen","review":"Proof as if any were needed, that most live albums are no good.

Anyone familiar with the painful ubiquitous butchery of \`Layla' will know what I mean, the whole album is done at this speed.

There is a reason this album got 5 grammy's, it was pure and true, straight to the heart Eric Clapton singing and playing the blues music. He just touches ground on the roots of blues with Nobody Knows you... classic done by many but done best by Clapton. Layla, this version I would have to respect better than the original, I think he really poured his heart into this number this time. Running On Faith, awesome, Lonely Stranger has got to be my favorite on this album set, he really got into this number, as well as he did with the rest. This album is a keeper and a must, definitely for Clapton fans out there. Let your mind ease a little for some pure BLUES POWER."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Eric's Best Performances","review":"Plugged or unplugged, Eric always delivers. This CD shows a very relaxed Clapton, with a great band backing him. His selection of songs is great, with new material (Signe, Lonely Stranger), old blues (Alberta, Walkin' Blues, Hey Hey), and some favorites with a new spin. Layla in particular is great; even though the electric version, with its passionate playing and singing, is better, this slower take on the song is great, showing how powerful a song Layla is. Best cuts: Layla, his emotional version of Tears In Heaven, Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out, Rollin' And Tumblin' , Before You Accuse Me, and San Francisco Bay Blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD, best purchase I ever made!","review":"This is an excellent CD. I really enjoy listening to it. I must have played it close to a thousands times, but every time I swear I hear something new. The song Running On Faith is probably my favorite, it is similar to the original, but with a much higher level of emotion. In the song Old Love there is a part where Eric plays a portion of the song solo, then Chuck Leavell plays it back on the piano. This part just makes my spine tingle. The overall quality of the CD is also excellent. You would swear they were right in front of you. I plan to get this one on DVD soon. This is by far Eric Claptons best work ever!

Eric showed that he is much more than just another flashy \\"guitar hero\\". This album really highlights his maturity as a singer, and his guitar work as usual, is excellent. While his complete redo of \\"Layla\\" is my favorite track, this album is one of the few that I have that I can listen to from start to finish and enjoy every song. \\"Rollin' and Tumblin' \\" was a unrehearsed jam, and one of my highlitghts also. Eric's roots are in blues, and his covers of several blues standards was a preview of \\"From The Cradle\\" If I could name one \\"negative\\", it would be that \\"My Father's Eyes\\" , \\"The Circus Left Town\\" , and \\"Worried Life Blues\\" , which were part of the original show were left of the album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with the recording","review":"It's an understatement to say that this album is good, it's fantastic (even that is an understatement), but unfortunately I have to say that I had some problems with the recording.

I love film noir and older black and white movies of every variety. Therefore, I was looking forward to seeing this movie for years now! While the aerial scenes were fantastic, they were rather short. Especially given the name of the movie. Having seen \\"The Aviator\\"... and knowing how long it took to make this supposedly groundbreaking movie... I was interested to see it for myself. Which was why I was probably so disappointed in the thing! For it's time, this movie would've been incredible. Unfortunately, it is not those times anymore, and the movie is extremely dated (to say the least). So, unless your a film buff, or a film student, this movie would be a waste of time. As a Howard Hughes fanatic, I hate to give this movie such a bad review, but it deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AERIAL STUFF IS STUPENDOUS AND HARLOW IS HOT","review":"If you enjoyed Martin Scorsese's \\"Aviator,\\" check out Howard Hughes' World War I epic HELL'S ANGELS.This 1930's film about two Oxford brothers in the Royal Air Force includes tinted scenes and an early Technicolor sequence but the main highpoints -- besides a luminous teenage Jean Harlow -- are the incredible flying sequences.In the first half, there's an eerie and exciting showdown between a gigantic German Zeppelin and British biplanes and in the second half, there's an extended, stupendous, dog fight between the R.A.F in Sopwith Camels and Germans in Fokkers.There were three deaths in the eye-popping aerial action sequences that must be seen to be believed. When the story is grounded, things move slowly, but once in the air, the excitement is palpable as director Hughes conveys his passion for flying in the exquisitely composed, daring and extensive aerial combat recreations that have not been surpassed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet the Fokkers","review":"I was less impressed by Jean Harlow (sexy gown, though!) and the aerial dogfight (spectacular in spots!) than by the use of color and black and white photography in this film. The outstanding Zeppelin sequence, which unfolds in an ominously quiet sky of billowing clouds, is tinted blue, and this simple colorization technique is very effective in conveying the craft's stealth, and in heightening the suspense. The film alternates rather frequently between black and white, color tinting, and (almost) full color. The choice always seems appropriate, and gives the film a certain art house look. It also makes the film a lot of fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I miss this one ?","review":"I've always been an Military Aviation Buff and growing up in the 60s I've seen some great films. How I missed this one is beyond me maybe it was not shown on TV at the time. What I loved about this movie was a Pre-WWII Military insight lost later on during WWII. I was fascinated by the Zeppelin sequences in the Movie. It was almost Futuristic almost Buck Rogers like. The Flying scenes were awesome and dangerous something Hollywood can't get away with now. There is also the Human Drama of the Airman in War time the stress and the Woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"More historical treasure than good flick","review":"I purchased this movie because I saw some of the action sequences in a documentary. Most of the pilots in the movie were actual WW-I pilots and the planes were period accurate and so rare to see flying. This movie is a true glimpse into the time. The story is typical silent movie converted to \\"talkie\\". The elaborate physical acting during a dogfight scene is incredibly funny with sound.

One can appreciate the technical difficulities and how Mr. Hughes had to invent the technology to create the intensity the various WW1 air battles. I found the acting to be average, the story line to be somewhat disconnected, the indecision in creating a full \\"talking film\\" vs a \\"silent film,\\" and the shakey cutting process.It would be a tribute to Mr. Hughes to have a new director remake the film using modern techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend","review":"I recommend this book.

We plan on filling it with flowers and maybe a few gardening items. It will make an awesome gift. The front wheels turn with the handle, the bed dumps easily, and the tires look like they could go just about anywhere.This would be great around the yard. As for the size, it stands a little over knee high and I would say the bed is maybe 15-20 gallon capacity... probably 3-4 five gallon buckets worth of capacity. Not huge, but I don't think you'd really be hauling much more than that for the jobs this will do anyway.Best word to describe this cart is probably rugged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic","review":"The plastic used for the bed of cart is very thin and will start cracking and is so thin that a plastic welder cannot be used to repair. Too bad the manufacturer could not use thicker plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise! It's heavy & smells toxic!","review":"I bought this cart, and developed a headache assembling it inside. The plastic gives off a strong smell, which is not discernable outside (thank goodness). Everything about this cart is heavy, so if you have any hills or bumpy landscape to navigate, you'd better be strong. In addition, it holds very little for its weight. When you want to dump it, you will have to tip the whole cart to get everything out... because it doesn't quite get the last 15% of material. The handle won't stay up (reachable) if the cart is not on level ground, so I find myself having to grab the handle off the ground most of the time. As you might guess, I was disappointed.April, 2011 Addendum: I found another reviewer who recommended the Ursa cart - expensive, but awesome. I bought an Ursa and am considering buying another. It carries a large load, pulls easily, dumps completely, and seems to be made with non-toxic materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cart for the money. Also available at Lowe's preassembled.","review":"I purchased this at the local Lowe's building supply store, and bought one that was preassembled rather than one that was in the box. (If you do this, you might want to check that all the bolts are tight.) It is sold under the name \\"Duraworx\\" Dumping Garden Cart, rather than \\"Gorilla Carts,\\" but is manufactured by the same company, Tricam, and is essentially the same cart.I used the cart for planting several very large Arbor Vitae. It will hold 200-300 lbs. of soil without problems, but more than that is probably not advisable or manageable.My garage is also my woodworking shop and is crammed with equipment & tools, not to mention the car. So I like the fact that this cart is fairly compact, especially if you take the handle off, as I do, and hang the cart up on the garage wall. It is more stable than a wheelbarrow & uses less space when stored than a wheel barrow or 2-wheeled garden cart.I think it is good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorilla Cart","review":"I purchased the Gorilla Garden Cart for my mother, who is 83 and loves to work in the yard. I thought it would be easier for her maneuver since it had 4 wheels and there would be no lifting like you have with a wheel barrel. She has used it and it worked great for her. Dumping was not a problem. She is really enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely hate it - tiny, tiny, tiny.","review":"This wagon is actually smaller than a child's toy wagon. The box it arrived in was too flimsey to use to return it in. It holds about three qubic feet. It hangs up on 3\\" ledges and starts to tip over. When you want to dump it, you have to pick the whole thing up in the air and bang it around to get everything out of it. It is totally worthless. Don't make the same mistake I did and try to save money by getting this. Just go ahead and shell out the big bucks for an Ursa Cart. This little thing is so short you have to bend over just to pull it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Little Cart That Could","review":"While I'd never put 600 lbs into this cart, it's a wonderful cart for about 100 lbs. The four wheels maneuver easily, and pulling the cart around is a breeze.With the way that the handle is situated, you can easily pull it with both hands behind you. Or one hand, whichever you prefer. Unlike a standard wheelbarrow, the four wheels support a lot of the weight.I use my cart to clean horse stalls, so the plastic bin is perfect. It's been left out in the rain countless times and nothing is rusting.I've had this cart for a few months now and am extremely pleased with it. I would have liked flat-free tires, but for the price, it's a great little unit.Based on the daily use it gets, I think that this cart will easily last me a year--maybe two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuff Little Sucker!","review":"I first had a chance to use this cart when my neighbor offered his to move 10-yards of topsoil around my yard. After an hour of use, I was so impressed that I ordered my own.Assembly was relativity easy and I wasted no time in putting my own cart to work. I'm still digging away at the pile of topsoil and even loaded it down with patio blocks and firewood. Like other \\"Amazoners\\", I was somewhat hesitate to load the plastic tray with heavier materials. But I found this cart handles the increased loads without incident.To that end, I have no intent of exceeding the manufacturer's weight rating of a 600lb load or the 300lb max dumping. The last thing any of us need is personal injury or product damage.For my needs, the good price, and fast shipping from the vendor, this little Gorilla Cart is FREAKIN GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"still trying to assemble","review":"I bought this cart for my wife to haul mulch & dirt around the yard. The instructions are not that great AND there so far are parts I can not account for. Not really looking like I'm going to be able to use it for what we need if I ever get it put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cart","review":"The cart is just about perfect for what I needed. The capacity of the cart could be a little larger,(the frame could certainly support it), but it allows me to move materials around the yard easily. I especially like the convertible handle, allowing me to attach it to my riding mower. I think it was a great buy for the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little wagon","review":"This is a great little wagon! It comes with assembly required, but following the instructions, my 15 year old was able to put it together, so that speaks to how easy it is. The bin doesn't look huge when you first put it together, but once you load it up, it holds more than you expect. We use it to haul around our 15-month-old and groceries, and it does just fine. Even when our older kids get in with our son, we can pull them around okay. The bin does flex alot when legs are hanging over, but with most cargo it seems to hold up fine. All in all, we are very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gioacco","review":"I use this for light yardwork and raking leaves, etc., so it is perfect for my needs. The 4 wheel design is very stable over uneven ground and small rocks. With the \\"Dumping\\" feature, it is easier for me to use than a traditional 3-wheeled Wheelbarrow. About the 600 Lb. capacity... the plastic is a bit thinner than I had thought, and even if it was thicker, I seriously would not try to cart around more than 100 Lbs. in it; I think it would make the cart too unstable to move safely and would be difficult to dump out (the instructions state that for dumping use to limit cartloads to less than 250 Lbs.I am very pleased with it, and hope my review will help others in their decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat little wagon","review":"The last two posters were right on in their comments. Easy assembly, well constructed - even inner tubes in the tires. It does seem a bit small with an 18\\" X 36\\" tub. It was what I expected, tho an improvement on the tub would be nice. It dumps well. I could see the tub failing if you hauled bricks or sharp big rocks with it. But hey, maybe I'l nail on the old wheelbarrow tray when its handles finally break . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little Gorilla","review":"I was lucky--mine came already assembled. I played with it a bit before purchasing it, and knew it was the ticket for me. So far, it's done everything I've asked, including hauling long poles, boxes of books, sticks and dirt. It rolls smoothly, corners well and is sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my wagon!","review":"I have had this for about a year now and love, love, love it. It has been left out in the rain, full of yard debris, etc. and still in perfect condition. I use it primarily for yard work and it is perfect. I would definitely buy again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy not a Tool","review":"Not very impressed as I ordered thinking it would be great for yard work, but the tray is very flimsy and smaller than anticipated. My kids however are loving it as a toy in the backyard. If you are looking to do some yard work I do not recommend but if you want your kids to have some fun in the back yard dumping dirt, moving logs & toys, then it will be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget Support","review":"I purchased the 600 lb garden cart at SAMS Club. The box contained wrong parts. The two support brackets were supposed to have opposing angles and they were both the same. I called the company and they said they would ship the correct items. That was two weeks ago and I have yet to receive the correct parts and now they will not return my calls. With a blow tourch, a vise and a hammer I managed to fix the parts but would never buy anything from them again. I tried to exchange the item but SAMS has apparently pulled the item from their inventory. The only reason I took the time to fix it was because my wife really wanted it. I understand employees making mistakes but to lie to you regarding shipping the correct parts and then refuse to answer your messages thats inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain in the ASS to assembly, hardware is cheap","review":"The cart itself might be a sturdy cart, but shame on Gorilla for using bolts with flat head end so there is nothing to grab with when using socket set on the other end. The overall assembly is the worst I have even encountered. I have assembled a lot in my time and even the instructions could have been better. Since ordering online cannot return without paying horrendous shipping fees, so will keep an finish assembling. Would not recommend purchase until Gorilla gets it act together and puts Phillips screw head bolts in the assembly. Almost tempted to go to True Value and get the right bolts with a phillips head to grip with while assembling. This should take only an hour to assemble, but it will take longer due to the lack of making it assembly friendly. Overall the cart will probably be a good item to have around, but won't know until I can get past the assembly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Cart. Horrible Customer Support.","review":"The cart is a decent quality for the price, and assembly isn't too bad. Before starting, find the largest flat screwdriver that you own to assist assembly. The problem with my cart was that the handle was welded on 90 degrees off center making it hard to pull and impossible to mount to a hitch. I called and emailed the company and have gotten nowhere. If I had the correctly welded part, it would be a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spunkly little cart","review":"I gave the cart to my dad for xmas. He is going to use it to hall wood for the fire and yard waste to the curb. We have to wait until the snow melts to give it a test run but in the livingroom it looks pretty sturdy, tires are big and nubby, turns well and dumps! It was not easy to put together. Not impossible but it took a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold up","review":"I had this cart for mere 3 weeks before it fell apart. Don't belive the 600 pound limit.

I have hauled grass, rocks and trash all over my property. There are two things that other people have said that are true:1. The washers that come with wagon are too small they should really be bigger2. The handle could stand to be a bit longer it can be slightly awkward to pull at timesNeither of those two things would cause me to think any less of this wagon though. For the price this is a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Quick Fix, Poor Quality Materials","review":"These tents work fine for a little while, but when subjected to more than a slight breeze or a light sprinkle of rain, there are problems. For one, the loops which secure the tent into the ground with pegs pull on the edges and rip the binding from the plastic 'tent,' leaving large gaps that expose your plants to the elements. These are a very temporary solution, amd a waste of materials when you have to throw them in the trash after a few days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made of cheap material","review":"This is so not worth $19. It looks like a $3 item.I threw it away after a few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Mike Hammer","review":"The second set of the classic Mike Hammer stories. The books have been around for a while but seem to be maiking a comeback. The books are in the hard boiled PI genre, with significant violence but very little sexual content. This is macho man type writing. Mike Hammer is a hardfisted type who smokes, drinks, and has few second thoughts about blowing a hole in someone with a 45. They tend to be well written, quick reading type novels as Hammer becomes involved in various cases. On the side there is his beautiful assistant/girl Friday Velda. Mickey spillane's novels place women in subservient roles, i.e., they are not oriented to being politically correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"old timer does the trick","review":"When I was young, I loved Mike Hammer. It was nostalgia to re-read the yarns. It might give the new generation laughs as there were no computers, cell-phones or caller id's. The forensic department was a joke. The detective actually had to use the brain. Womanizing and boozing, eating bloody steaks and blowing low-lives away without going to jail was the thing to do. I still get a kick out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading","review":"Fine writing by a fine author. Pictures appeared in my mind with his use of words and always enjoyed each story.

A beautiful pair of earrings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Free, but possibly not worth it","review":"I can't complain too much about free content, however, the format makes it almost not worth the time trying to decipher the titles and actually get to the poems. The contents contains no links to individual poems so you have to page through the entire volume to get where you want to go. Additionally, none of the poem titles that are listed in the contents are separated by punctuation; they read as one long continuous line of text, which needless to say, is unacceptable. Very poor presentation overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"2393 pages and no table of contents? Really?!","review":"How are you expected to get to what you want without a table of contents?! It is tedious to find the poem or story you want. You can book mark it, but you have no way of naming what you bookmarked so you are left with whatever excerpt of the top of the page you marked. Meaning that if you bookmarked The Raven, the excerpt was whatever poem finished at the top of the page since The Raven starts in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible layout for an e-book","review":"Zero formatting for the poetry.

Some of the poems only show part of it, then when you turn the page, the rest of the poem isn't there. For instance, \\"The Bells\\" only shows the first two verses, but when you hit \\"Next Page,\\" it goes straight to the next poem, \\"Ulalume.\\" But when you go back, sometimes it does show the missing verses! So you can read \\"The Bells,\\" but not in the right order. Whoever created this e-book did an God-awful job of it. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Large a Body of Work to Navigate Page by Page","review":"I agree with all the other reviewers: beware \\"free\\" books with poor navigation, you will rue them.

No index, no effort to lay out the poems properly at all. For Heaven's sake, use a line break! You'll get a better experience reading these poems at Project Gutenberg.The biographical note is interesting, and may be worth reading if you're not familiar with the details of Poe's life, but it is writtennby a contemporary, and is, I gather, probably the Ur-document that most casual biographies draw upon.Disappointing, as Poe's poetry is really quite exception, and worthy of a decent Kindle edition.

Quite a few outstanding citizens seems to believe they have a right to base the review solely on 'how unreadable' the poetry is due to the format. While I can admit that I have seen better formats (see 4 stars) I do not believe it to be entirely just to poorly rate the work. Poe is a genius, and although the format leaves something to be desired, it would cause one to think ill of another who claims the book is 'unreadable.'

That 8-year span includes major changes in the chassis, interior, and available engines for this car. The result is a manual that often provides only general guidance and leaves a lot out.If you want to know how to change your brake pads, and basic maintenance jobs like that, this book will be helpful. It has good photographs and it's not very expensive.

If you have a good understanding of the Bible, and with the guidance of the Holy Spirit, you will certainly find this a most inspiring and helpful book. Its focus is the days we are living in- the last days, certainly the most dangerous and exciting days from all the history of humanity.

In the future there gonna have to put all three of them in one and that can easily be done if they just minimize the size of the font because the font in this book is HUGE.

Unfortunately, like a myriad of other \\"anti-conformist\\" resources, be they books, dvds or otherwise, Amazon has taken the high road and sought our best interests by not stocking the real deals. This cowardly self-censoring is yet another example of how the oversee-ers of the industrial complex aim towards hiding the truth by the process of omission. Good job Amazon!! In many other cases you may still procure copies of desired materials through the Amazon subsidiaries, but in this case, everyone appears to be fresh out.

THe envelope at the end of the story where you put all the cut out masks came out the first time we tried to slide the pictures in. The noses all came off of the masks too. IT's like the glue that held it all together was compromised in some way. Maybe it was left on the tar mac too long and suffered heat damage? Not sure...

Unless you have a child that is VERY careful with handling books, trying to play with the fold-out masks is more frustrating than a learning tool. He didn't want it on his face and it worried him that it was on mine.

First the book gets opened with the flap being lifted, read the text and try on the mask while pretending to have fun!This is a fun and imaginative book that can be utilized alone by a child to experiment with the faces or masks depending on what they want to call them.

X-ray glasses do not actually allow the user to see through objects. They are constructed of a plastic frame with lenses of heavy cardboard.

When looking through the hole, objects appear to have a transparent outline and a solid center.

As a new police officer, I had been getting numerous complaints and having a generally difficult time getting people to cooperate. Like all new officers, I didn't really know the problem was actually me. Dr.Thompson describes encounters from his past that could easily be my own. He learned the hard way, and so did I. Now older and wiser, I recommend this book to all my trainees. It is an effective way to train yourself before the complaints start rolling in. I had one trainee read this book and saw an immediate improvement. Naturally, this book won't solve all your problems, but it can place you on the path to assertive and effective communication with difficult people. Best of all, you can usually influence them into doing what you want without them even realizing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOOSHA!","review":"Although I watched the video series, rather than read his book, I'm sure you will be very happy with this book. Dr. Thompson teaches some very usefull techniques for dealing with potentially hostile people.

As a dispatcher, I find the techniques I learned from the Dr. indespensible. WOOSHA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for anyone working with the public","review":"I noticed the reviewers highly recommend this book for law enforcement personnel and I agree it is probably very useful for them, but I also think this book is helpful to a much wider audience.

The author cannot allow Scripture to speak as clearly as it does. He has done great harm to straightforward passages of Scripture in making them fit his grid--eternal security at all cost. The author cleverly argues against many unbiblical views. In a nutshell, his view is: Calvinists are wrong when they apply warning passages to nonChristians and when they expect works added to faith for assurance; Arminians are wrong because they believe true believers can lose their salvation; His own view focuses all the works and warnings to believers in regard to heavenly rewards and none to the area of justification.But this just ain't so."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT FALL FOR THIS CHEAP CLOCK!!!","review":"I ordered it last year, it turned out to be a mosaic sticker on the back of a piece of glass with a cheap plastic clock assembly you see usually on a $5.00 wall clock.

Eventhough I have that remix on a compilation cd I think its on the Valentine Soundtrack"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"\\"The Beginning Of All Things To End\\" is not a completely new album. The majority of the songs on the album is from their indy release, \\"Lill, I Oughtta\\". There are a few new tracks in though, and 2 re-mixes of \\"Dig\\".This is a very good album. It shows fans the earlier Mudvayne, and how they have evolved since then. A must buy for all Mud fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ryan made them a better band","review":"Only for the complete Mudvayne fan who wants Kill I Oughta, this CD is just average.

Its hardcore but not quite as much as some of their other albums. Since I'm a car audio enthusiast and listen to metal, this is right up my alley.

None of the songs besides \\"Idiot\\" really stood out, but this cd doesn't seem to be about songs so much as sound. It's not a sound one associates with today's Mudvayne, but Chad's vocals are recognizable if a little less refined (he obviously runs out of breath a few times). Didn't like the huge interlude track, but the Future Evolution mix of Dig wasn't bad, it's fun to play at a party. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes thrash metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw & Brutal...","review":"'The Beginning Of All...', the re-issue of Mudvayne's independant release 'Kill I Oughta', is a blend of heavy duty metal. However, this is not to say that it is in anyway in close comparison to 'L.D.50' - it's not. Unfortunately, 'The Beginning...' leaves a lot to be desired. 'Pooploser' is an anthem for angst-ridden teens. Grey's vocal projection is reminscent, again, of Johnathan Davis in the 'Follow The Leader' era. 'I.D.I.O.T.' and 'Fear' are the best tracks, but check out 'Cultivate' and the alternative versions of 'Dig'. A worthy purchase of any hardcore, die-hard Mudvayne fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"~Poop Loser~","review":"This is the remake of their old Kill I Oughta album, which is currently out of print, sadly enough.Pooploser- 2/5 Eeh.

I found the eloquence in the lives of the 8 patients, however, as opposed to Dr. Groopman's narrative. While obviously a great man, I found his ego distracting and reminiscent of \\"old school\\" physicians - patronizing, omniscient and infallible.

What the patients have to offer is priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed tales of a good clinician","review":"This book presents excellent accounts of a doctor who, above all else, is a good clinician. The accounts contain personal discussion, interesting patients, hard science, and lessons about both medicine and life. Admittedly, this last phrase, \\"lessons about both medicine and life\\" sounds cliche but as an obviously empathetic, observant and disciplined clinician, Groopman is well prepared to talk about the serious,universal issues that often arise in his specific line of work.Though he is a superspecialist, a nice aspect of this book is that Groopman is very objective about medicine overall. The technology he spends works on in lab is not at all treated as a panacea. Simultaneously, he does not shun or wholly embrace alternative medicine. It is simply another example of why he is a good clinician, qualifying the book further.An excellent, very fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring tales of truth and human dignity","review":"An excellent book of choice for anyone looking to find meaning in the field of health care, who feels swept away by torrents of robotic practices of academic medicine and scientific prejudices."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIsleading Title","review":"If youre looking for technical and detailed advice then do not buy this book.

Ok, maybe not that bouncy but pretty close. Lol Our personalities are very different, but we still click and we love each other. Over all I think the movie was real. At least to me.

Ichiko, the younger, is an emotional girl who loves books and people; Eri is an aspiring lawyer with a more serious temperament. The first half of the movie explores their families and friends, while the second half is about a rift that develops between the two and how they find each other again.Love My Life is not a perfect movie. There are a few over the top moments that are difficult to believe, and some acting is a little weak. But the movie is redeemed by its incredible energy. It reminds you of how good it can be to be alive, hence the title, and how enjoyable things can be. This movie, while not life-changing, is fun and watching it makes you want to have fun, something everyone needs to be prodded into doing now and then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross Debussy with Mahler.....","review":"Charles Tournemeire is just one more example of those twentieth-century composers who wrote wonderful music that today's stultified concert programmers ignore with damning persistence.

I think both are equally good. The performance of \\"Anarchy in the UK\\" is the loudest, fastest most growling version I've heard. Almost as entertaining is the bonus disc which features radio interviews done on the day of the last gig for the original Sex Pistols. Here, we hear Sid be at times brilliant, (\\"When there are no more blacks, whites, punks... ect.\\") sometimes trying to upstage Johnny (especially at the end of the interview, John sounds really [mad] about this.) and sometimes downright scary (\\"Him (Johnny) and I will probably dead in two years.\\") We also hear all the Pistols take the ... out of Americans, Pete Townshend, groupies and former band member Glen Matlock.

Many women over 50 keep themselves in great shape and don't need to camoflauge their figures. One older woman was shown in huge, tent-like clothes throughout the book.

It was mostly photos - on the left a frowning model, on the right a smiling one. If they had made them both smiling and left off the labels, I bet a lot of people would prefer the style on the left (the supposedly bad style).

Some of the changes are subtle, but visually they make a huge difference. There's always the exception to the rule, as one reviewer pointed out about the woman who looked great in pink. Admittedly, there are a couple of jewel tones and a shade or two of pink I really like and will probably continue to wear sparingly, but I would highly recommend this book. I like to shop at a local clothing boutique called \\"Her Closet.\\" This will make a great reference book to take with me next time I shop there.

Then the album moves into a brief but terrifying trip through hell with \\"The Pink Room\\" and \\"The Black Dog Runs at Night.\\" And finally the whole dizzying ride levels out with some of that good old Twin Peaks slowdance, music for sweet dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very relaxing!","review":"Love this music... so very relaxing. Shipped with no issues. One of my favorite CD's, especially if I need to unwind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very stylish...","review":"This is not another soundtrack. This album can be an enjoyable entity without the visual action. With this CD you are about to listen to the music rather than to re-capture pictures of the movie. Yes, in a town like Twin Peaks no one is innocent, but you are on the safe side even if you do not know what the movie is about.Great intimate compositions can serve for a late night session (but A Real Indication with composer Angelo Badalamenti's voice). This music is a good way to reflect your inner-state. The album is a mixture of jazz, easy listening, adult contemporary, and whatever you call it. You better develop your own definition of the miracle and well-stated under-statements, or avoid putting a tag on this CD at all. Just enjoy music made very professionally to please those who understand.Set your style up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy cool.","review":"Despite the fact that every other movie seems to have it's own soundtrack, few match the mood of the film as well as \\"Fire Walk With Me\\" does. The theme here may not be as recognizable as the one from the TV show, but it's just as enjoyable. Truth is, this soundtrack is even stranger and darker than the other, yet just as good. The majority of this music is prime stuff for old smokey clubs, the kind with pianos playing, horns blowing, and fingers snapping. The kind that rarely exist anymore. That's what the movies tell us anyway. One track is a bit jarring, \\"A Real Indication\\". The music is good, but it's spoken word with a few near screaming parts. However, afterwards comes \\"Questions In A World Of Blue\\", which should lull you back into a pleasant coma. Overall a very wonderful album, even if you haven't seen the movie. If you really love this, I also suggest the TV soundtrack, and anything from Julee Cruise."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS BOOK!!","review":"I have been doing applique for quite a while, but still find this book to be an invaluable tool.

The numbers appear to be dark or black, but the watch I received has gold numerals on a gold background and I found it hard to read. Otherwise, the watch is fine although the band quality is not up to other Bulova watches I've seen at this price.I just received it late Fri and will have to wait until Monday to call the company for return instructions.

The author does not engage in hagiography, but instead provides a concise view of this man's life in its historical context. Unfortunately, I was hoping for something more comprehensive, yet not as massive as Pogue's exhaustive (exhausting) work.Stoller does a good job of describing the footprint that Marshall left upon the world, but not enough about him as a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable history","review":"As others have noted, this is a very readable biography focusing the military and political accomplishments of on of America's greatest generals. The book is written in a very straightforward way and does not dwell on Marshall's early life to a great degree nor on his personal life in general. Given the figure's penchant for privacy and his destruction of his private papers, I am not sure if too much more information is really at hand, which is a shame.Definitely a good biography for anyone interested learning more about this less cited man or in the development of the military and its relations to the political system from World War I through to Korea."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CANDY EVER","review":"I tried these for the first time yesterday and they are amazing!

The reason why I read this book is because I was forced to in tutoring. I didn't want to but it turns out to be a really good book. Second Stringer is about a teenager named Kevin Taylor who is the second stringer QB for the Warren High lions offense. The first stringer Rob blows his knee out, and Kevin has to fill in for the rest of the season. My favorite part of the book is the end. It makes you want to cry. My dislikes of the second stringer is the way Rob treats Kevin in the beginning. I would reccommend a junior high school boy to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good quality choice in reading material.","review":"Second Drtringer is an excellent book. One reason is its about football. Another reason is that it tells a good story and has good detail. The final reason is that Second Stringer is good is because it has good detail.There is a lot of good parts in this book.

Johnson's story does get a bit slow at times, but it does tell one what kind of person became a fighter pilot and ace in WWII. Considering that they were really kids, it's impressive how technical and professional these pilots were, how they persevered even when it was boring, hopeless, or terrifying. The P47 itself fascinates me, and this book will tell one why. The later P51 is everyone's sweetheart, but the P47 (and a few others) did the dirty work and made it possible. Johnson's story when his plane got shot up beyond belief and he limped home is an incredible story about both P47's and Johnson. To me, this is a \\"must read\\" book by someone who was there, much like Adolf Galland's books. Future generations shouldn't forget any of this, but it's also good reading, fascinating stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying the Jug","review":"Republic's P-47 Thunderbolt was a WWII monster of a fighter. Fast, well armored, with heavy firepower, it was a nightmare for its lighter opponents. One of America's leading aces of the European theater, Robert Johnson, takes the reader on combat missions where the outcome is always tenuous. Through 1943 and into 1944, the P-47 was our frontline escort fighter until the P-51 arrived, with its longer range capability. But it was the \\"Jug\\" that chewed up Hitler's Luftwaffe and led the way to the air superiority that made the Normandy invasion possible.Major Johnson came out the victor over 28 opponents and his story as told here is one of valor and determination on both sides of this awesome conflict. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful insight","review":"This book provides wonderful insight into the mind of a top fighter pilot.

My thinking was that I would like to listen to various languages of the world and learn how they sound like. I had no intent on studying this program, because I knew better that any program with multi-languages only provide a brief introduction to each language.My guess was right. You get what you pay for. However, what you get is pretty cool. You get to listen to a lot of languages, and learn a few cool words here and there. Yes, it gets repeptitive and even boring. However, all you have to do is switch to the next language!Overall, a pretty good program. It could have been better, yes. But it does a good job on what it intends to do: give a very brief introdution to 51 world languages."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY (even though I only paid $9.99)","review":"This is awful. You don't learn any real sentences nor do you learn anything about grammmar. All you learn are some VERY basic vocabulary words (yes, no, hello, etc). Oh, and a bunch of differnt kinds of food. You wouldn't have a clue how to string any of them together into a phrase, though! It's too simple to be of any use. Also, in my opinion, the program's male & female speaker often pronounce things rather differently, which is confusing (especially for tonal languages where intonation is very important). I could go on but I'll end with one more major problem: In languages that require a different ending to be added onto words depending on the speaker's gender, the program doesn't indicate that, rendering it useless for those particular languages (e.g., Thai). You can learn way more for free on the internet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!!","review":"I had bought a program in the past that had 51 languages and it offered a rather basic beginner's level phrase book introduction, complete with full dialogues written and spoken.

Complete utter waste of money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but not useful.","review":"The interface is good and the concept is great, but you can't actually learn a language from this -- not even enough to get by if you're just visiting a country on vacation.

Spend a month or two studying one of those and you'll actually be able to get by in a foreign country while on vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"It seems like a good program to get you started; when I bought the copy it didn't even work and I took the CD back twice. The program doesn't even give you spelling of the objects you are looking at. Yes, we know it's a knife, we know it's an apple, but how do you spell that? At least with the more expensive ones like Rosetta Stone you get spelling. I think people should just go to Rosetta Stone's website, request a free demo CD and just start there. It practices IMMERSION, so you won't get any hints (unless you request it), but it's a trial and error, a figure it out method. I do admit that these immersion programs don't help with sentence structures or grammar, but they can build your vocabulary.After skewing off there, I wouldn't recommend this program to anyone; it may be cheap but not worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Much Uselss","review":"I clearly feel ripped off.

Nebra is still sadly neglected while being one the masters of the late baroque, just as good as a Rameau. In this disc, we can listen to one of his zarzuelas, in which Nebra, moving in a very european bel canto fashion, still serves a Spanish flavour in some of the numbers. The recording lacks the spoken parts which are proper of the zarzuela, but this makes the music still more striking. The vocal cast is chosen from some of the best Spanish female voices, and Christophe Coin in front of the Ensemble Baroque de Limoges makes full justice to this music. Just a regret: there are much more music by Nebra still waiting to be heard. Together with Corselli -another significantively forgotten master- José de Nebra stands as one of the greatest composers of his time."},{"rating":"1","title":"heavy & repeatedly got wrong color shipped to me","review":"The set was heavier than I thought it would feel.

I used this for a month before going to Germany with my wife and found I could get by fairly well. There should have been more on food, places, and travel than on family and work, but I guess Berlitz wanted to cover a broad base.

The quality and clarity is great, the entertainment is fantastic. This is back in time when there was quality entertainment on tv with people that are actually talented. The only complaint that I have is that these are not complete shows. For instance, in the openers, they used to have singing and/or dancing and that's not included in most of these shows. It's a real shame that they didn't release the entire show. Some of the programs do have some skits included which I think add to the show.

But this is truly MADONNA LOUISE VERONICA CICCONE, not Religious Madonna, not the 80's-popstar-material-girl Madonna, not Madonna the Goth or Madonna the Guru, not even Cowgirl Madonna. This is all her, one of the two albums where she is under no influence but her own(this one and Bedtime Stories). My favorite songs include Deeper and Deeper(an incredible dance song with great lyrics, which is rare even for Madonna), Fever(my ma says its raunchy but it's better than the 1954 version), In This Life(a solomn melody about AIDS), Rain(the best song in the world), Waiting(great beats), and Secret Garden(unusual, unique, creative-buy it to find out what it's like). But those are only a few. All the songs are masterpieces, and I have all of Madonna's non-compilation CDs. So believe me when I say this is her best album. Don't waste your time or money on buying just the singles!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I do not have a problem with Madonna's Erotica album","review":"At present, Madonna's Erotica cd can be purchased edited in stores.

Some really groovy tunes. Though, it's not very sexy, it definately has the beats and the dancefloor appeal to get you up and out of your seat, fast. \\"Secret Garden\\" is a perfect choice for a song to listen to if you want to calm down. Though, 4 of the songs copy each other's beats and bassline, this is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erotic sensousness","review":"Everyone thought Madonna committed career suicide with this album, but she didn't. As the most underrated Madonna album, Erotica contains a diverse range of musical influences. The first lead-off title track contains a sample of Kool And The Gang's Jungle Boogie and is fused into a hip-hop song with an Indian chant interlude. Take away the erotic visions of the video and the book SEX, Erotica is a sensous, sexy and lusty song. Other cool tracks include the remake of Peggy Lee's Fever into an updated 90s dance ditty; Rain, a stunningly written & produced ballad, the house number Deeper And Deeper and Words. The problem with detractors is that they link the album with too many of the imageries that came along with SEX. Put simply, the EROTICA album talks about sex, lust and human behavior towards the 2 issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but good... If I could, I would have put 3 1/2","review":"This album has, I think, more atmosphere than any of her other records. It has been called cold and insensitive, and while I somewhat agree, songs like Why's It So Hard and In This Life prove me wrong. This album IS cold, but it has style. It's a pretty sophisticated record, and is like a martini at a 4AM jazz club-- excellent for some, but not for everyone. But I like the coldness of it. Even a song like Secret Garden is not as happy-go-lucky as it sounds. It has atmosphere, which is where I think this one really succeeds. I would even say it has more atmosphere (and possibly more to say) than Ray of Light. Erotica is her least accessible record, but one of her most powerful. I can understand why some didn't like it. It's not very mainstream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Erotica was Madonna's cd where she was mad at the world. She really overdid it this time. Sure the cd has its clever tracks, but in my opinion it leaves something to be desired.Some of the tracks are very dull and boring, such as the dreadful remake of the hit \\"Fever\\", or the song \\"Where Life Begins\\", which I have to admit is one of the most creative songs on here.However, Erotica does have its good moments. Such as the title track, the ballad \\"Rain\\", \\"Waiting\\", \\"Words\\", \\"Whys It So Hard\\" and \\"In This Life\\".Pretty good cd, not her best, but pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANCE! RADIANT! AMAZING!","review":"This has got to be Madonna's most under-rated album ever made. It's fanastic. I cannot believe the critics dare bash this CDs. Her most influential music ever put out by an artist. I believe this is great music, especially during SEX. I love the book, the CD, and her movie (Body Of Evidence). All these elements, together, made a wonderful concept for her album! It's the best! If you ever wanted 2 hear real music, listen to EROTICA. I love how she intertwine blues and house music w/ pop.

Released in 1992 this album still sounds great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My name is Dieter. I'll be your reviewer tonight.","review":"This was Madonna's fifth studio album. It was released simulatenously with her bookSexand suffered some fallout from the negative reaction to the book. Erotica is a concept album about sexuality and relationships, although only a few of the songs are directly about the sex act itself. Most of the songs have a dance beat, usually with a hip hop or jazz flavor. In the US, four singles were released from the album: \\"Erotica\\" reached #3 on the charts, \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" peaked at #7, \\"Bad Girl\\" struggled to #36 and \\"Rain\\" peaked at #14. The songs on this album are quite good, with the exception of the wretched \\"Did You Do It?\\", which is not really performed by Madonna and isn't included on this version of the album anyway. An underrated Madonna album."},{"rating":"1","title":"laughable","review":"I remember hearing the song Erotica on the radio and laughing at it's stupidity. It almost kept me from buying the CD do to its cheese factor. I should have listened to my gut and not bought it. The only decent tracks are the Andre Betts collaborations. The rest is poorly written and executed. The exception is BADGIRL which is just poorly sung."},{"rating":"1","title":"exotic yet disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Madonna is a good artist but this has got to be her very worst album ever!!!!!Once at a cd store I must have seen atleast 6 used copies!Like her other album \\"American Life\\" this cd has no feeling what so ever.Even the photo shoot for this cd is disturbing.Unlike her other chart topping albums \\"Music\\" \\"Ray Of Light\\"& \\"Like A Virgin\\".I would hate it even if it didn't have an expicit lyrics lable on it.At first I was afraid to watch the music video.If your a Madonna fan who thinks music isin't the way to express sex or don't like a soppy thik voice then this isin't worth a breath of air!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame album","review":"This songwriting is pretty cheesy, plus Madonna can't sing. Bad songwriting and poor vocals equal lame album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex has never been so boring.","review":"Mostly what drags this CD down the toilet is Madonna's paper thin voice. Her singing, if you can it that, removes any life to these songs. Her butchering of Peggy Lee's classic FEVER is the worst remake in history. DEEPER AND DEEPER sounds like a half a**ed attempt by Madonna to hold on to her eighties audience. Erotica is just silly nonsense and not worth anyones time."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This is easily one of Madonna's best albums, interesting, provacative lyrics but still fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"Despite bad reviews, this is a great album. My favorites are Deeper and Deeper, Bad Girl, Rain, Secret Garden and Bye Bye Baby. But the best is Fever. \\"You give me fever - Feva!\\" I love it! I encourage all to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...Madonna's music at it's sexiest...\\"","review":"This CD graced the shelves of music stores all over the US on October 12, 1992, sending me straight out to buy it that night. Upon only hearing one song on that album, \\"Erotica,\\" I was quick to learn that much of this album was catchy and groovy, as well as suggestive (\\"Where All Life Begins\\"), as well as touching (\\"In This Life). As Madonna will continue to pour out new music over the air waves, I will never forget her best: Erotica. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this album a metaphor for sex?","review":"Most sexual encounters are so so or really disappointing, just like most tracks on this album: easily forgotten and totally boring after the second round. But some sexual encounters are mind-blowing and inspire you, like very few tracks on this album. Well actually only one track: Erotica. The only track that shines in originality. Her sex-period was interesting, but not musically.....I give it two stars, but only because Erotica is on is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Madonna hates it.","review":"Let's be honest here, this album is lackluster to the extreme. I have never heard such terrible club music in my life! Even Madonna is trying to forget this one was ever released. Check out her upcoming video collection which deletes several of the videos from this album. That should give you a clue to stay away from EROTICA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot and meaningful","review":"This CD is amazing, it's hot and meaningful. Aside from the music, Madonna makes such a statement here.I am openly gay and I hate conservatives, and Madonna is my best friend in this way - she is here to fight the Conservatives with us, and help make us equal in society. ....Madonna and Britney are my heroes =)."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET UP AND DANCE!","review":"There are only 2 Sex songs on this album, Erotica and Where Life Begins which both are worth skipping. Apart from that, the songs are great! I Love Fever, Bye Bye Baby, Deeper and Deeper, Bad Girl, Waiting, Theif Of Hearts, Words, Rain, Why's It So Hard, In This Life and Secret Garden! They are BRILLIANT! It is true that Madonna's singing AT TIMES can be a little to be desired, but her songs have such a beat you can't help but dance and buy more of her albums! The best Song on this album is DEEPER AND DEEPER! I am forever playing it. Just... GET UP AND DANCE! You know you want to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is one of Madonna's greatests cd's. One the first Madonna albumsI bought : absolutely no regrets at all ! It appeared together withthe \\"Sex\\"-book and \\"Body Of Evidence\\". . . On this one, Madonna leaves her mind and soul open, and starts to experiment. There is a surprising collaboration \\"Did You Do It ?\\". \\"Erotica\\" is a fantastic follow-up to the majestic \\"Justify My Love\\". If you like this track, then you should check out the remix by William Orbit. Fantastic ! And there are the little house-pop tunes like \\"Fever\\" and \\"Deeper And Deeper\\", and beautiful ballads like \\"Rain\\", \\"Bad Girl\\" and \\"Secret Garden\\". \\"Thief Of Hearts\\" is also great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erotica-Madonna","review":"This has to be the 2nd best Madonna album, the first being Ray of Light. I can't believe that so many people thought that this was just a terrible album. I think that this is a great album. My favorites are Erotica, Bye Bye Baby, Waiting, and Thief of Hearts. None of the songs are bad at all. Some may go a little far out than should be, but it's that big of a problem to you, buy the edited album. I would recommend this album for anyone would just like's enjoyable music. This album is fun to relax to because it's so soft. Buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super album","review":"There is an exploration of the existential in Madonna's work now that shows a definitive maturity. I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it. Two, Marianne Williamson talks about that people who become legends do so because they tap into the concept of what the human consciousness is available to, needing to develop and that rings within all of us. It is that work that interests the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erotica music done right...","review":"Hello...Madonna got it erotica music right with this cd...My fave 2 tracks are \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Fever\\"... Both different but very good... I also absolutely love \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" and \\"Bad Girl\\" is a fun song. \\"Rain\\" is a beautiful melancholic song that chills me out...Again, if you're a Madonna fan you'll love it......peace..."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF HER VERY BEST!!","review":"I bought this CD right after I bought I'm Breathless, so that alone made this Cd great. I hate reading so many reviews that say this is her worst album, its not, its her second best (first being Ray of Light). While I must agree that songs like Where Life Begins, Secret Garden, and Did you Do it go a little overboard, all the rest don't. Erotica has such an awesome beat that the lyrics just blank out sort of, if it wasn't for that beat the song would totally suck. Thief of Hearts reminds me of the Patrick Leonard/Madonna days, while Deeper and Deeper seems like a sequel to Vogue. Rain seems like it doesn't belong, as its message is about sex, but it doesn't come out that way at all. In This Life also seems like it doesn't fit, as sex and friends dieing are two completely different things. Words, Waiting, and Bye Bye Baby, oh plus Thief OF Hearts are mean and cruel, and sort of sexy, so they fit in perfectly, and complete the sexy and racy beat of \\"Erotica\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring&No Bite","review":"For all The Fuss About this Disc it didn't Match the Hype at all.Deeper&Deeper is the Only song worth Remembering here.very bad Club Music.This Album is Very Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna- Erotica","review":"Wow. This album displeased me. Usually, I would have an album's taste last for a week, but I couldn't give this one a try. This album was ridiculous, mostly. There are a couple of songs that have decent beats, but I'm a lyricist, and lyric-wise, I need to rebuke this Erotica album. I expected it to be pretty good. One song had good lyrics: \\"Why's It So Hard.\\" That's worth listening to because of its strong reasonableness and persuasive questioning about this phenomena we live in. \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" is for people who are breaking up, and who wants to go out with that heartache, especially if you're not under that condition of considering related departure from somebody? \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" had a good beat, but I need an album to stand out, and this one fleeted my attention despite what the majority rates it on Amazon. Don't buy Madonna's \\"Erotica.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype!","review":"Throw this album, along with her career, in the garbage! Madonna, your 15 minutes of fame are over with!!!! Good-bye!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maddy kicks ...with this album","review":"No matter of what Madonna herself thinks about this record now (obviously, she's kinda trying to deny the whole \\"Erotica period\\" since \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Deeper And Deeper\\" are not included on her latest video collection) in my opinion it's simply one of her best albums to date. She delivers very catchy yet mature music, \\"Where Life Begins\\" is one of her most haunting ballads ever. Erotica just screams \\"Live your live be free\\". It's a shame that it was so terribly underrated and overlooked back then. I have to admit that I like the Madonna from the mid-80s to the mid-90s more than the Madonna of now, although the new album \\"American Life\\" is also a real stunner. She just seems so out of this world with her new \\"know all & be all\\" attitude..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I bought this album after reading all these good reviews. What a waste. Erotica the song just sounds like a bad remake of Justify My Love. The rest of the songs aren't bad but hardly ground breaking like everyone here is saying. Bad Girl would be a great song if a better singer performed it, with Madonna it just sits there. Unless you're a die hard Madonna fan, this record isn't much to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Flowers of Evil Are In Bloom","review":"This is probably the best record I have ever heard - and I've heard a lot. Without getting to high brow, the most interesting thing about this album is the struggle between the Apollonian and Dionysian. In \\"Erotica,\\" Madonna puts on the costume of a dominatrix - ready to love you and destroy you with equal relish (much like the protagonist in Coleridge's poem \\"Christabel\\" ....\\"Secret Garden\\" incorporates a piano with dance beats to create a sparkling paradise ripe with fleurs du mal. Baudelaire would be proud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Album By Madonna","review":"Erotica has got to be Madonna's best album!! This album explores every aspect of sex while giving you great rhythm and awesome dance songs... Deeper and Deeper is a reflection of the club scene in the 70's with a twist of the 90's and a great beat... Madonna is one of the most influential artists and this is one of her most influential albums because it showed that women can be sexually provocative..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her BEST!","review":"This is one of the best Madonna albums out there. The songs \\"Erotica\\",\\"Deeper & Deeper\\" and \\"Fever\\" make you just want to get on your feet and dance. While tracks like \\"Rain\\" and \\"In this Life\\" really touch your heart.

This is a horrible piece of junk. You can not see bullet holes with this beyond 30-40 yards with much clarity.

If u want to use this with anything but a .50cal at 50 or more yard you can forget about it. Also don't get me started on the tripod... reference my second sentence.OK now if this was say a bird watching scope this would be great. Its compact, very light, easy to acquire your target, comes with a very nice carrying case etc...

My eyelid does touch the glass when I look through it in order to get ANY light whatsoeverFocus is on the eye piece itself. So in order for me to focus, I need to twist the eye piece which litterally twists my eye lids. Very uncomfortable.Because of this I rate it so low. It just doesn't get light in at all and if I use the glare shield it completely eliminates any light. It's only good for about 75 yards or less, too, due to magnification. IMO, it's better than nothing but I'd much rather spend my money on something with eye relief or that's longer range, or both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alpen 20 x 50 mini spotting scope","review":"Bottom Line: I have 20/20 vision and I had alot of trouble seeing target hits at 100 yards with this scope using .223 rifle.

It is compact and easy to use. I have used it on bright days and overcast days and still been able to see the holes on the target at 50 and 100 yards.

The Alpen spotting scope works great on my full size tripod also. I would not hesitate to purchase this product if you are looking for a decently price scope that performs well.

I had a pair of RayBans a few years ago until I lost them on a trip.... having them for about 2 1/2 years..I read all the reviews, so I gave these a try. I was very disappointed when I received them. It wasn't because the colors were much lighter & brown than in the picture. It was the feel and construction. The glasses felt much like a cheaper $20 pair. They were light, felt like hey would break without much of an effort. The lenses felt plasticky... to make a word.I decided to send them back the first day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart after three months! Stay away!","review":"The quality of these sunglasses is absolutely the WORST that I have ever experienced. After having them for only three months, the soft rubber on the earpieces and nose began to melt, yes, melt, and then completely fall off! My glasses had a tortoiseshell finish, and the finish also began to melt and slowly peel off. Incredible! I could see this happening with cheap sunglasses, but not with a pair costing $90. I ended up contacting the US distributor (Baush & Lomb), who promptly sent me a replacement pair, and guess what? The exact same thing happened to those too! At one time, the Bolle name meant quality. But now, it represents expensive garbage. I am frankly quite amazed that other customers who purchased these sunglasses have not experienced the same problems that I have. Bottom line: I would strongly suggest to anyone who is considering purchasing these sunglasses to NOT BUY THEM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't think they're authentic","review":"I checked the Bolle website as well as the Amazon picture and the emblem on the sides of these sunglasses do not match the authentic emblem of Bolle.

They sit too close to the eyes, and my lashes could rub against it, and they had bad tendencies to fog when you are outside. One of the plastic nosepieces fell off after about 2-3 weeks of wearing them. That was the last straw, so I returned them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bolle quality has gone down","review":"This is my second pair of these sunglasses. The first I bought about 4 years ago and was very happy with them. I lost them and immediately wanted to replace them so ordered these from Amazon. Have had them less than two months and already a lens has popped out and even tho I have snapped it back into the frame, it feels loose and like it will pop out again at any time.Unfortunately the return window for Amazon (30 days) has closed, and Bolle wants me to send them back to them at my cost and then they will take 3-4 weeks (their estimate) to evaluate them. A long time to be without sunglasses... I won't be buying Bolle again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last a year","review":"Inside of lenses are severely scratched within a year's use.

Light weight and used for fishing (polarized)."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 years and still intact, but they have some issues...","review":"Purchased in March 2008 for $63.73.The polarized lenses are excellent at reducing glare. They have kept my eyes safe from UV rays & flying objects over the years. These can take a beating, because I've dropped them quite a few times, but they also scratch easily.Case is nice, however, the way the glasses are designed, the end of the left arm scratched up the inside of the right lens while folded in the case. Another problem: one of the nose pieces fell off less than 6 months after I purchased them. A friend had the exact same problem with this model. Slightly overpriced since they are plastic and made in China, not France.Overall these were a great value considering the longevity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book and pocketful of patchwork pieces.","review":"After having read and enjoyed Mrs. noah's Patchwork Quilt by Janet Bolton, it was a pleasure to find this similar book, My Grandmother's Patchwork Quilt.The book tells an the story of a small girl living on a farm. The story is told in two ways though, in words, and also in the making of a patchwork quilt. Very charming. We are told the story through one girl, but the story is actually about her grandmother. She tells from her childhood and at the same time she pieces her life in patches. And the huge treat of all, in the book is a pocketful of patches so that you are able to make a story of your life quilt.A perfect way to do a favorite activity with a favorite child, while you tell your own life story.I can recommend this book for all booklovers and all quilters.Britt Arnhild Lindland"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Mix.","review":"This soundtrack has a nice mix of popular early 2000's late 90's hip hip on it.

It was reliable, updated and had much more information than was expected.My only criticism of the product is the tedious and cumbersome installation process and no way of really knowing if the install was successful until you actually arrived in-country. It was really a cross your fingers experience. Garmin really needs to improve this and the only reason why I did not give it a full 5-start rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"formulaic horror story","review":"This seems like a very formulaic Stephen King knock-off. Granted, I'm not finished, but still, of what I've read.And sloppily written or edited, can't decide which.For example, in the oral narrative in Chapter Two, given from a grandfather to his granddaughter, he says that he is 101. He says that \\"80 years ago\\" (when he would have been 21), he and his father went past a certain tavern. In the next paragraph, he says his father died WHEN HE WAS 16! How is this possible?It's hard to take seriously (in its own way) a book which contains such obvious errors.

I was not happy with the Graco made boosters. Compared to the Compass they appear to be cheaply made: flimsy plastic and fabric, frabric on the head rest and back rest never stayed in place and the seats needed to be completely put together (screws and everything).

I hope the next authors follow suit and we don't have anymore of that skinky garbage we got in the beginning. Tahiri, Wedge, Jaina, Jag were also super in this book. The action was fabulous, and so was the suspence at the end of the book. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebel Stand- Wow!","review":"Once again, Allston's blown me away by his ability to write, and write well. We see great humor, great action scenes, and great bad guys all rolled into one fantastic novel! Luke's mission to Coruscant takes up a good part of the book, and so does Han and Leia's sabotaging of an election. We see more Jaina/Jag interaction (yes!) and Kyp is starting to seem less cocky and arrogant. A great book, with gripping scenes that have you on the edge of your chair till the end.

However, I am a devoted Joy Division fan, and appreciate the obvious derivation of this work to that of JD. Yet I think that it is a two-way street. If you are a fan of New Order's later offerings, than this is a link to their past -- an introduction to the the dark beauty that is Joy Division. Yet, this album is more than just a new flavor of Joy Division. It is an example of a band in transition, recovering from the devastating suicide of JD vox Ian Curtis. It provides a continuum of effort from JD to what New Order was to become. This is an essential album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Although I can see the historical value of this album, as a bridge from Joy Division to New Order's seminal 80s stuff, it is simply not a very good album, particularly by today's standards. Essentially, because New Order was so influential, a lot of what they did has been picked up and bettered over the last two decades; the result is that a good part of Movement simply sounds amateurish. In fact, with the exception of 'Chosen Time,' Movement is fairly unlistenable, with a very Casio keyboard ethos throughout. Perhaps it is the production, as the \\"Ceremony\\" single that came out at the same time is very good. Anyway, if you are a big Joy Division fan and also like New Order, I would recommend this album, but then, of course, you already have it, don't you? Otherwise, pick up Republic, which is New Order's best and far superior to Movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a strange blue planet","review":"Now this stands the test of time. Do not heed the siren's call and get this instead. Teutonic and depersonalized, it was a bit of a shock after 'Closer'. The elastic twang of Joy Division is missing without the human windmill conducting proceedings, but kudos for sounding like a new band. The production is metalic meets stone masonary. My favourite song is Chosen Time due to its killer bass line. I walk around the house going \\"do do do do da da da doo\\". Actually, that's due to a medical condition, but the song is still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and one of their best","review":"When I first listened to this album, I was very surprised to find out that instead of the usual monotone they usually sing in later albums, this album seems to take on a lower and slightly darker tone in an emotional way.The album is quite simple, but quite impressive with songs such as Dreams Never End (quite trance like in a sense as if in travel) and Doubts Even Here. I also liked the song Truth as well. The songs are amazingly much slower than most of the ones I knew (I nearly fell asleep!).However, these are only my opinions on the album and I think this album is excellent in the way in which you can listen to their songs in the very early part of the 80s. I would not recommend this album to techno lovers as this one seems less synth-like than the others and also leans towards the rock side as well as being slower. It still is a great album and I would recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not for MWg Atom Life","review":"I buy this thinking on to replace my stylus pen for my MWg Atom Life, but doesn't fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice about buying this book...","review":"I checked out a copy of this self-published book (evidently the first, 1989 edition) via the public library, and I was disappointed that the text is all \\"Courier\\" font (i.e., it resembles \\"typewritten\\" text).

Moreover, much, if not all, of this book's textual content (which, so far as it goes, isn't bad) appears in the author's expanded, better-illustrated, 1991 book TEACH YOURSELF POOL (ISBN 1880135000).

If it lands right on the nose, the plane sort of bounces and lands without too much damage.

Having the ability to make our own discs just makes it that much more versatile.The good news is that you DO NOT need to cut down regular CD-R's as one reviewer suggested - the unit will burn standard \\"mini\\" CD's which are readily available in most electronics super-stores and online for next to nothing.

Quality in very fine mode is a bit grainy at 8x10 size. Still having fun with sharing the pics with family and friends. I did buy a recharger and rechargeable batteries so that has helped with the cost of batteries. I also aquired a 64 mb flash card and this will hold far more pics than I can take on any one outing and may be enough for a whole vacation (with enough batteries).

More often than not, the timing is awkward; and the results, disastrous. It is simply frustrating.Even though this camera is cheap and does offer a lot of useful function, however, in my opinion, it is not worth the risk of trying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find something else","review":"I got this camera for free, at a team event raffles. So I'm not complanining.The pictures are good enough for the web. But the camera is not good enough to be a primary-use camera.It is a power-guzzler. You'll need 4 rechargeable AA-size batteries.. 8 if you're going outdoors. And the charger too (a car-battery adapter, if you'll be on the move) !Takes ages to recover between photos, esp. while charging the flash. It actually takes a few seconds after I depress the shutter-release !! And by then, the whole world has moved ahead !!The LCD view-finder is useless for composing scenes. The picture is a blur if the camera moves even so slightly.The conventional view-finder is \\"biased\\". Leave a buffer above the subject.. otherwise, there'll be chopped heads in the photo.Bottomline... a scanner would be a better investment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recomended","review":"As noted by other reviews, the biggest problem this camera has is the battery consumption. I was really happy with it untill I had taken 30 pictures and had to replace the batteries. Then I tried without the LCD on and got maybe 35 pictures, not much different. I expected a fast power drain, but I've used other camera's and got far more out of a set of batteries. On top of that, not being able to use rechargeables .... If you own a battery company, or got a crate of batteries for X-mas, this might be a good starter camera for you, but I traded mine in for a HP 315 and love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"This was my first digital camera and I have to say I'm not impressed. First of all, the first camera I bought was defective. The memory card would not fit into the slot because the pins were bent. How that happened before I ever used it is a mystery. The viewfinder is way off, I've spent a fortune on batteries and have missed many good pictures because it takes too long for the camera to actually take the picture once you've pushed the button. About 10 months after I purchased the camera (and had the original replaced, remember) the LCD screen became very blurry so that I could not even see the picture that I'd just taken. It's also hard to take pictures with it because the image you see through the viewfinder is not even close to what ends up on the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"starter camera","review":"Very good camera for the price.This was are first digital.We have been very happy with it.Yes,it does eat batterys.Definatly need a 64 cf card.Just ordered a 318 more megapixels"},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries","review":"Just a note about battery usage. If you would read the user's manual you will discover that rechargeable batteries are NOT supported in this camera and any damage resulting from the use of rechargeable batteries voids the warranty. The power requirements of the camera are such that rechargeable batteries can be damaged or damage the camera and are therefore not supported in the camera. If you look on the rechargeable batteries you will notice that the power ratings are different from those of normal alkaline batteries. A better solution is to use the Photo Lithium batteries (NOT Lithium Ion batteries) with the camera, and avoid using the rear LCD as much as possible. Just a little FYI for those who post saying rechargeable batteries work great - RTFM (Read the freaking manual)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera for price","review":"... I must admit I was very happy with the results I got from the first set of batteries. The regular gripe is there, It eats batteries for snack. Don't ask what it would do for dinner... I am using niMh rechargeable batteries without any problem so far. But since the rechargeable batteries are 1.2 volt (instead of 1.5 for regular)the camera takes a bit of time before actually releasing the shutter. And I am pretty annoyed of the fact that the camera charges the flash each time it is turned on. Even when it is bright day light. Whats up with that? I wish the charging was dependent on the existing light.In summary great camera for the price. Quite happy with it.A lens cover would be great though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have been thru two of these!!","review":"This camera was nothing but trouble. I thought the first one would be just a lemon, but the second one I bought tore up to!! The picture wouldnt take half the time on one of the cameras, and the other one, the LCD screen broke! The manufacter wouldn't help me out at all, so I am looking for another one now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP camera and you get what you paid for","review":"The camera is pretty cheap if you are okay with putting up with constant frustration. The software has a bug in which the camera will not save pictures to the memory card. The only information you can get to solve this is to call into tech support which is NOT a toll free number. The camera is unreliable in picture quality and the on/off button sometimes does not function well. It's a good CHEAP camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMPORTANT FOR YOU LUCY FANS","review":"Ever since 1994 when I saw my first I love Lucy episode, I really have loved Lucy!

I then read the reviews and because I liked the design and the idea of an auto shut off, I decided to order this one from Amazon because they can't all be bad...well i am sad to say that this one is also defective and will not shut off after pumping all of the water out.

Anyway it seems like there is two things on Armond Whites mind, he wants to glorify black people and he sees the hardships black people experience in the US today as a result of white suppression and racism. The golden age for Armond White is the Black Panther activism of the 60's. In this book he tries to place Tupac's gangsta rap into the Black Panther tradition, but must acknowledge that it is impossible. It's quite suprising that Armond White seems to get pissed by the fact that Tupac scores a megahit with 'California Love' in the mid 90's, instead, one senses, Armond White is disappointed that Tupac doesn't take up the proud tradition of black activism, but rather indulges in violence and commercial success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing and bad","review":"This guy Armond White writes in the kind of pseudointellectual, exaggerated style that is really laughable.

I won't get into any detailed spoilers here other than to say that the ending was anti-climactic and left open for debate about just exactly what the hell happened. So it wasn't so much that I was left dissatisfied with the ending as much as there was just no satisfaction or sense of closure to it.There was, however, good suspense in several parts of the movie.

This camera disappoints on a number of levels. Image stabilization is non-existent. Nearly every shot has some blur to it. The delay from when you press the shutter button is unbelievably long, consequently, the picture you take inevitably is never the one you thought you took. The flash is useless outside of 3 feet.

My mistake was carrying this opinion over to the 315 model. There are improvements, such as a far superior LCD screen, and better battery consumption. However, the image quality is unacceptable. The images have a clear grain to them, even under professional lighting. This is evident both on screen and printed on photo quality paper.

It's very easy to use, and the pictures are decent at max res. Also, it uses the popular compact flash format, which makes getting extra memory cheaper in comparison to SM or Memory sticks.My major grudge against the camera is its lack of special features and agonizingly slow speeds. The lack of compatibility with XP has already been addressed by other reviewers, but I would recommend getting a flash reader regardless.If you have experience with digital photography, or want professional quality photo's, think about spending another [money].

The vocals are terrible, and the lead singer, who has no lower register, shouldn't attempt any track not in her range, which means all of the material here. Her vocals often get lost in the music. The CD sounds like a bad experience on karaoke night, and the singers display little or no talent. I gave the CD a full listen, thinking it couldn't be this bad throughout, but no such luck. I was expecting more, but got something akin to a vanity press. Like a vanity press, I wonder how much these people paid so they could brag that they've recorded a CD - that they've been published!!

The only drawbacks I see are; you have to take it all the way out of the case to charge the phone, so the earpiece hood gets streatched out of shape.

Ms. Thomas's story helps to draw our attention back to the continuing disaster that has affected thousands by focusing our attention on just a few: these seven children. Through their experience, captured by Ms. Thomas's unbiased and unpretentious writing, we are reminded of the horror and suffering visited on so many others. And we need reminding.A well-written, well-researched story, and one that cried out to be told. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special book..","review":"I was one of the volunteers that helped take care of the seven young children when they were brought to Baton Rouge after Hurricane Katrina, so this book brought back many memories to me. It told the story of how the seven children were separated from their parents in the days following Katrina, and showed the great extents that so many people went to in order to make sure that the families were reunited. Katie Thomas did a great job of relaying the feelings that everyone involved with the children felt. A great read about seven truly amazing children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Written Compelling Story","review":"Wow. That pretty much sums it up. The incredible story of this typical New Orleans family and what they went through during Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath is almost unbelievable. Although the tragedy of the disaster and the bureaucratic response got the headlines, this book tells the story of how individuals, sacrificing of themselves make all the difference in the world. If you have lost faith in the American government, this book will restore your faith in the American people.When I was reading this book, I couldn't help but be drawn in by Katie Thomas's writing. Straight forward, unbiased and compelling, the writing leaves nothing out, but isn't cluttered with overly descriptive narratives meant to show off the author's vocabulary rather than to entertain and inform the reader.This book should be mandatory reading for all people involved in disaster response and all people who need a little inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits like a glove!","review":"I'm glad I rejected the opinion of the reviewer who said it was too bulky and that it stuck out too far.

Best of all the detective is in the series again as well only this time he isnt trying to bust Frank. this would be a must see if you like Jason Statham."},{"rating":"2","title":"transporter 3","review":"i am very pleased with the cd, the cost and short time it took to arrive.kudos to amazon great job i will always think of you first.keep sending your action reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this installment of the transport disappointing. Mainly because of some of the editing techniques and the actress was annoying. I also felt as though jason was bored doing this one and tired of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"I really liked the first two, but this was awful. Most of the movie is horribly written dialog between the two leads that has no relevance, and the plot holes are too gaping to ignore. Consider that 1. Contracts signed under duress aren't valid and 2. There's no reason why the girl has to be transported in the first place. The occasional slip-up is tolerable in an action movie, but two reasons why the entire thing is pointless is too much. Even the above could be forgiven is there was some great action, but while (what little there was) was good, it was nothing like in the previous two movies.Oh -- one highlight was the Ukrainian textile industry. Apparently two of their cloth seat backs will stop bullets, and a dozen will protect you from an explosion powerful enough to send an ambulance ten feet in the air. I've got a high tolerance for silly action, but I couldn't take this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transporter 3","review":"I love Jason Statham in these movies!!!! I watched one after the other. The man definitely has swagger!!!!!! :) These movies are very unique and appeal to guys and gals a like!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the red head was more than annoying!!!!!! Transporter 1 & 2 are both 5 Star!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jason, Car, & Freckles","review":"Another Statham fight sceen with extra flare. Car chase with a good story, and a leading lady with long legs and freckles. What more could you ask for in an action movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stateham is great fun BUT...","review":"I've enjoyed and bought all that Jason has stared in. But his co-star Natalya Rudakova might be the most unattractive women toever star in a major motion picture. No acting skills and a look that can kill. It is hard just looking at her! Because of her I COULDN'T spend the $25.00 for the blu-ray instead I rented it and closed my eyes whenever she appeared on screen. No doubt this is her only film and hopefully her last! One only wonders who high on the food chain does she know in Hollywood to get that part?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just . . . lacking","review":"This was a misfire for me. I love a good action movie, but this one crossed dangerously into the ridiculous, almost self-parody, at times. The love interest, who was supposed to be free-spirited and adorable, was seriously irritating. Very few of the action sequences really played to Statham's strengths--he's most convincing as a brawler or doing work with guns, not as a guy who is really good at riding a bike. The action set-pieces all came off as over-choreographed. I was glad to see the return of the detective character, but little else about this movie clicked with me. A shame to end a fun series on this note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I wasn't sure how I felt about this Transporter movie at first but as the story unfolded I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. Great movie and definitely something I'll watch time and time again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale sequel","review":"This movie shows what a good (in this case, bad) director can do for a film. Transporter 2 was great. This is a pale echo of the series' past glories. The actress is horrible, the action is cut in a jarring \\"Borne\\" style and there's really nothing to care about. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, CD is bad...","review":"It Plays, however, sounds terrible in the drive and does not down load so I can not copy it to my Ipod. Movie was good....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Do It Again!","review":"I generally expect sequels to be weaker than the initial film, and am usually unsurprised. Transporter 3, however, was even weaker than it should have been. Why oh why to moviemakers forget about the script when they make these things? Good car chases and special effects -- but who cares? By the end of the movie you're hoping they all die, from sheer boredom. Great action movies make us CARE about the characters -- sometimes even the bad guys. Bad action movies just have action -- like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of the three, by far","review":"Not nearly as good as the previous two movies, which I had really enjoyed. The plot is getting tired, and the action is predictable. The ever-reliable Statham does a good job, but just can't carry the whole movie. And the girl in the movie is so obnoxious that I would have let the bad guys kill her, and walked away with a smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible disappointment.","review":"\\"You are the gay\\"? Come on, really? I was unaware, but apparently this question is fairly prevelent in Transporter discussion. I thought the lack of love interests was because it wasn't a necessary plot devise. After watching this film, not only is it not a necessity, but it destroys the film.Great action, great Statham, the best villain of the franchise, but I almost fell asleep watching the \\"love scene\\" between Frank and Freckles. I couldn't tell the difference between her bored, her excited, her high, her scared, and her horny because she sounded exactly the same, mono-toned throughout. Statham actually looked bored while she was \\"seducing\\" him. She was the only low point for the film, but she was in it way too much for it to still be enjoyable. I hope this doesn't ruin the series, and I really hope Robert Knepper's career isn't affected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Review","review":"Worst of the 3. Totally lame script. Natalya Rudakova is no actress. She is downright terrible and ruins the movie. Blu-Ray quality is good but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the first two better.","review":"If you like an action movie and you're not too critical of the story, or the acting, give this a shot. But buy it cheap (definitely under $10), or, better yet, rent it. You're not likely to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"ALMOST FELL ASLEEP IN THE THEATRE WATCHING THIS. COOL ACTION SCENES BUT OUR HERO JUST DRIVING ENVELOPES THE FILM. DON'T BUY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stunts, chases and fights","review":"I'm new to this series. Jason Statham is a new figure to me. He has only one schtick: neutral mug at all times, hoarse whisper of all of his lines, and periodic eruptions of violence in which we see his well formed six pack in action. None of the action is the slightest bit realistic. But that's not the point. We watch because we wish we could do the supernaturally muscular things we see done on screen. Never mind the boring details of plot or script. Whatever. Think James Bond, updated. The red head co-lead is all moistly sexy, and I liked her Ukrainian accent, despite myself. The bad guys lose in the end. Does that spoil it for you? Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie. Big disappointment.","review":"Boring, unimaginative, poorly constructed, badly written from start to finish. Was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"very BAD!!","review":"This was the worst movie ever and this is coming from a person that loved the first two movies. Terrible acting, boring as hell!!! See for yourself and you will understand, I will never watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-expected purchases","review":"I got two Movie CD's that were \\"Slipped \\" into my order.I don't know why I would have ordered either of them but they ended up on the order request and I was charged for them. Check your orders over very carefully to make sure what is listing is exactly what you want. I will probably never buy from Amazon again. I think they are sneaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie - BEWARE WRONG PRODUCT","review":"I love this movie like part 1 and 2. BUT! I ordered this movie on Blu-Ray, and got this one instead, they \\"replace\\" my order with no extra charge and send me the same format DVD, WTF! Amazon has gone retard."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cinema Hazard","review":"This movie was horrible. The relationship between the Transporter and the girl was so lame that it's hard to imagine a professional writer was on the payroll. The lack of overall effort for story imagination and credibility suggests a clear case of producer greed. I believe they just shot themselves in the foot with this installment, because anyone who liked the previous two films will gag and choke so horribly on this one, that their trust forever abandon them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"I am a big fan of Transporter 1 and 2 as well as 5th Element. I tried to like this movie, but the constant flashing and camera jumping (every 0.5 sec on average) made this movie unwatchable. I couldn't take it any more after 1 hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transport yourself AWAY from this movie","review":"I almost NEVER write reviews. But I love humankind enough to try to save a few people. I didn't even buy this one. I rented it from the Red Box for $1. I feel SO RIPPED OFF!This movie has NO PLOT at all. There is a 3 minute scene between the two leads talking about what they'd like to eat.And then there's the \\"action\\" if that's what you want to call it. Everything was choreographed worse than the Britney Spears performance at the VMA's.Why are there 30 bad guys against 1 good guy, and the bad guys always go 1 at a time?Do yourself a favor and DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"transporter 3","review":"it was great to watch again, I remember watching it years ago and it's still as great as ever. I would recommend it to anyone to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Statham!","review":"Fast cars, awesome fight scenes, funny one-liners, and close calls. It's an enjoyable flick if you're a Statham fan. It's interesting to see where they've taken the Transporter franchise -- and I'm hoping they do a fourth."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOXIC WASTE OF A MOVIE","review":"It looks like Jason is becoming the new Steven Segal. A new movie every 3 months good or bad!!! Glad this was a free rental or I would have been ticked. Since it was free I didn't expect a whole lot and I wasn't disappointed. There was barely an excuse to get Jason in the car a 3rd time{hopefully the last} and some very poorly filmed martial arts scenes. The film is speeded up so fast it's hard to see what's going on, and people complain about Hong Kong fights??? I like Jason in some movies but the last 2 Transporter movies were dumb to me . Blitz wasn't very good either. Jason is getting by on his early films for now but that won't go on much longer. Pretty soon it will be straight to cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"i loved the movie","review":"I liked the movie. always liked jason stathams movies. the action was great. i loved the car and the good looking suit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transporter 3 (Single-Disc Edition)","review":"The Transporter 3 DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition. I would definitely do business with this seller again. I gave this a rating of 4 because I wish that there was a way to combine shipping on Amazon when buying multiple items from one seller versus paying shipping on a per item basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the series","review":"TRANS 2 was the high-water mark for these things, so I hoped this one would be even better, but this is pretty bad. The biggest problem is there are only three hand to hand combat scenes and only one of them is a standout. I love watching Jason Statham dishing out beat-downs, so I will continue to watch the TRANS series as long as they make them, but the things we want from one of these films are simply not here: there is only ONE woman in the whole film, the car chase scenes and stunts are not that great and there should be more fighting! Simple. The plot is of the let's-start-writing-and-see-what-happens variety and too much time is wasted trying to \\"get inside the mind of Frank Martin\\". Next time: more hot Euro chicks and more fights!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Transport this to the waste basket","review":"This was one of those action movies that a typical teenage girl might like so they could ogle the actor on the screen but to a fan of action movies the scenes were predictable and overdone to almost imposable to say the least I just about fell asleep while watching this. The first two movies however were hard to outdo since they were done very well so the old saying is true to not put all your apples into one basket. I wouldn't be suprised in the least however if there was a fourth transporter in the future after all they are making a second crank movie just goes to show no matter how dumb the idea seems Hollywood will still produce it."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRANSPORTER 3","review":"AMAZON CONTINUES TO GET BETTER AND BETTER. LOW PRICES AND FAST SERVICE!Transporter 3 [Blu-ray]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"Will work for paycheck\\"? AWFUL","review":"So bad. So very bad. Part 2 was enough to stretch the limits of believability. Remember the car flying sequence? This one is poorly done, period. I couldn't make it past the first 30 minutes. The girl is HIDEOUS. Part 4 better be alot better. Sorry, my brain hurts thinking about it. Gonna' go check out Crank 2. Come on Jason, did you need the money that badly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"001","review":"This is one of those movies where it looks like the writer and director walked off the project half way through filiming and they flailingly brought in someone to cobble somehting together. I mean this thing is barely coherent. Get this: our hero is hired to deliver a woman who's been kidnapped and collect the ransom. So the big scene on the bridge is where he finally delivers his cargo and guess what? he's handing her over to the exact same people who hired him and had her in the first place!! (yeah that gets two exclamation marks). And if I missed something here maybe it's because the stunts became like this white noise, a din that actually made me start to tune out the movie. At least he gets to hook up with a hot babe in this one, but ...no really the plot makes no sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"REally Fast Moving","review":"This series is continuing to be a real grabber. The star is macho and keeps his cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed Movie !!!","review":"Action packed movie with very believable acting ! I would definately watch this movie again because of the fast paced action and car stunts."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Politics of Sport","review":"Some years ago EP Dutton published a series of \\"Best\\" sports stories. With bylines removed, entries were submitted to a distinguished jury. (Two most frequent winners:Roger Kahn and W. C. Heinz.) There is no jury for the Houghton Mifflin works, just Stout and a cohort abitrarily chosen.There is some good stuff here, but the selection is, to be charitable,quirky. When Halberstam suggests his chum Gay Talese's pretty good Joe DiMaggio piece changed sports writing, informed readers will shudder. After shuddering they will skip this odd mash and run down the fine Dutton books through an out of print service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good.","review":"This is a book that I have purchased at least four times, and given to friends and relatives to read. Anyone who has lived through some of these times, as depicted in this book, will have a love for the stories that are told here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Sports Stories","review":"This is an excellent book for several reasons--it is convenient in that you can quickly read one story and put the book aside without having to go back to get back into the story, it is full of excellent writing, and it gives beautiful glimpses into a very diverse group of sports. The book advertises itself as containing the \\"best\\" sports writing of the century and for the most past I would certainly agree, and disagreement has to be expected when you declare something the best, so it is great reading. It is fine journalism, telling captivating stories about people and games, but it is also does an excellent job of showing the importance of sports beyond the fields of play. I would highly recommend the book to sports loves, aspiring journalists, and I would also recommend many of the pieces for people who cannot understand why sports lovers really love sports."},{"rating":"2","title":"great magnet set for children!","review":"We're having so much fun with this set (and a great price!). Like the other reviewer, I note that instead of 5 smaller balls there are 2 ping-pong size balls, but this was a benefit as I feel they are less of a choking hazard (and less likely to get lost). It is fun placing the balls on spoons and turning the spoons upside-down and seeing how the balls remain on the spoon. The magnets are pretty strong! The horseshoe magnets are surprisingly light. They aren't magnetic all the way around (I don't think) -- just at the bottom, but that was good for me as I don't want my baby to clunk herself with them. :) At 19 months, my baby loves this - and I can imagine an older child would get even more out of it. I had a ton of fun playing with them myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toysmith Mighty Magnet Set","review":"Our 4 year old grandson enjoyed the activity which he did with his dad.

It has been only 6 months but no complaints.I did alot of web searches and TYC was rated very high. Unlike spectra premium witch I had many problems.I had to return 2 one leaked after 3 days the other lasted a week then started to leak both from the top of radiator.

A fine collection of actors, a great set, well-written episodes, characters with depth that evolved over the course of the series, humor and wit rolled into an outstanding show that CBS (in my opinion) never really fully appreciated.I'm glad to see it make the jump to DVD, and hope that folks who may not have seen the series will give it a try - you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 2!! Season 2!!","review":"C'mon MGM, hurry up and release Season 2! Preferably with some extras this time - commentary, bloopers, promos, whatever you've got.Loved this series - it was taken off the air way before its time.

Been there, done that. Yet, in spite of this, Goldberg manages to keep the reader's interest throughout. How? He writes crisp, no-nonsense dialogue. The action is fast-paced and the bodies pile up. Goldberg knows how to write a gripping thriller and the medical details add a needed touch of realism. \\"Deadly Care\\" is an entertaining medical whodunit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leonard Goldberg always keeps me riveted.","review":"I bought the book before it was being mass-marketed so I had to pay $35 for it.

What an incredible let down! The only correlation I can find between the two series is they focus on female heroines who are pathologists. Goldberg's characters are like cardboard cutouts compared to Cornwell's Scarpetta and crew, and both books I've read so far are virtually the same story, only slightly reworked. I would liken Goldberg to Robin Cook before I would compare him to Cornwell -- empty stories with almost equally empty characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This book is terrible--I couldn't wait to finish it.

The camera-work is consistent with what would be expected given that much is filmed from a first-person point-of-view.This film is very creepy... beware, the film's main characters are 2 kids. Let's just say that if I had kids of this age bracket, I would probably have slept with my bedroom door locked after watching this movie.The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.

The thing is, this book won't be easy to grasp if you still don't have the basic know how about this business.Tom explains a lot of indicators (how they are calculated and variations about the way you can use them) on this book, including his own - If you use Tradestation, you'll love using his indicators on a backtest of your favorite markets - but won't teach you how to build a trading plan. But there other books for that chapter!He also doesn't write in the most clearer of ways - sometimes you'll find yourself rereading several paragraphs back to completely understand some concepts. All in all I consider this to be a valuable book to add to your library with fresh and innovative ideas on some old concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written Book","review":"The indicators may or may not be useful (I haven't tried them), but DeMark needs to learn how to write. He has long, wordy descriptions of his indicators with almost no formulas or examples. I have to read the descriptions several times and even then I'm often not sure what he is trying to do. The book is full of run-on sentences with 5 or more clauses each; it has more commas than periods. He describes how many indicators work for both increasing and decreasing prices in one sentence, switching back and forth between the two in a very confusing manner.I think he has good ideas about indicator construction and if you can get through his horrible English the book is probably useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robina","review":"Did not receive this book.

Most dwell upon widely accepted, monotonous, regurgitated approaches. This book is singular as it pioneers new ground. If any negative exists, it's that the author attempts to cover too much territory. In his defense, however,I believe he accomplishes this goal successfully. If a student of the market wants to complete his education in as short a period of time as possible, I strongly recommend this book. Ultimately, he'll have to read it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional / amateur divide","review":"This is the first time I've commented on a book here on Amazon before reading it.What strikes me is that the reviews can be broken up into two camps:- trading professionals working in the industry, who have the indicators already programmed on their terminals, and who have the incentive to use them- trading amateurs, either complaining about the poor structure, layout or grammer used in the book, or who don't have the means or the ability to program the indicators for themselves.With this in mind I ordered the book, figuring that I would much rather trade on the same side as the professionals. I gave it four stars so as not to unduly influence the book's current rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. I am so dum. I am a sheep.

Since December '98 it generated 4 sell signals - each of them on the day of the high or indeed the day of the high itself before a major decline unfolded. The most recent signal was at Y124-27 on 19th May 1999. Yes, this stuff is complicated and there is a huge temptation to give up and dismiss these indicators as mindless nonsense from someone with an inflated ego - but like I said, take a look at the aforementioned charts and then ask yourself whether it's worth persevering !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable book for serious traders","review":"I am an experienced, successful investor who has always relied upon fundamenatal research and analysis to arrive at my investment decisions. My grad school teachers and fellow traders have been influential in my approach to selecting securities. The role of technical analysis was and currently is non-existent.

I've no glue why they didn't deliver the book with a CD included ? Partly DeMark is just explaining the settings of the software rather than the calculation and construction of the indicators. Since it's too expensive to return the book from Europe I can throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Dessapointed","review":"The first book of DeMark was good but this one is not a book, is like some manual for some software.

I suppose if Larryit had kept the Williams %R formula in the secret he would be one of the most popular traders known.The dumb trader: pays for a profits promise when buying something, and indicator, an expert, a system.The smart trader says: before pay, show me the profits an then we see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writting style","review":"I believe the whole algorithm this book to assert is not difficult to understand IF the author used a better writting style and gave good examples.I can not verify the algorithm is correct.

Many readers rated its content the best available, while a few criticized its complexity. My conclusion is that for a serious trader or want-to be trader this book is required reading. Each sentence in this book is important to the message of the author. It is a not a book that can be simply assimilated in one sitting. Obviously,many years of effort went into its writing and to presuppose its understanding in one quick reading is naive.

The scope of the subject matter is exhaustive and I don't think I will be able to address all topics in a short period of time.

Relying solely upon technical analysis is a mistake BUT, on the other hand, to ignore it would be financial suicide. I recommend if one is to use technical analysis at all then he apply the best information available. I believe the source of that information is Thomas Demark.

It is amazing that the Wm. Morrow Corporation would even publish such a revisionist history that is not supported by the facts such as the official autopsy. The first clue that the book is fiction comes with the admission that Sean Hannity asked the author to write this piece of trash.

Putting into print that Michael Shiavo is a first-rate jerk is something that was quite evident when Terri's case first became public knowledge.

They were reporting that everything he was doing was in line with Terri's wishes, but I couldn't imagine that allowing her parents only a few minutes at a time were part of Terri's wishes.

What may surprise you is where the book takes you through the case.Lastly, this is not a work of fiction, but a collection of facts whose synthesis is goverened by reason and experience.

His mattress has a pillow top and these bed rails still stand up far enough past the edge of the mattress to keep him in the bed. I have had no problems raising and lowering the sides to change sheets.

The product is extremely poorly made and when my 3 year old son leaned against the side the metal bent at the joint.The other thing that was very frustrating about this item was that when it was under the mattress it did not slide in or out easily. Even with the anchor straps the joints did not line up and you also struggled to pull out or put in the supporting holding pin into the supporting slot. When you did get the pin through the slot there was a gap between where the slot came out and where it met the supporting upright. Very unstable and scary to think that your child will be able to knock it out during the night.I would not recommend this item to anybody and it is just a waste of time and money. I would not be surprised if it was made in China.I have tried to include a few photographs of the problem areas as well, but Amazon does not offer that option.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if it is CHEAP it is NOT worth the trouble.","review":"Spare yourself the trouble and pay $10 more for the Summer double rails. I NEVER write reviews but want to warn you that the Regalo rails have TERRIBLE instructions, is difficult to assemble, with cheap mesh and is very short. There are TOO many components in assembling this item and when you pull the mesh to attach to the poles, the sides start to rip. When assembled and placed under the full mattress, there is only about six inches of safety and if you have an active baby they can easily fall off the sides.If you have a twin bed, then perhaps the rails will do a better job.I purchased this item wanting to save money but have learned my lesson. I am going to order the SUMMER rails which we purchased for my daughter but cost $10 more. The Summer rails assemble in 5 minutes with a handful of steps and is extremely safe and durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"The downfall for this item is that if you have a high mattress it isn't very high.

I would have paid extra to have them come put together. There is no reason for this to come in so many pieces. The directions have mistakes in them. Now that they are on the bed, I am worried about all the metal that is in between the mattress and box springs. I can't get them adjusted to where there is not metal sticking out when the rails are folded down. That worries me for times when my daughter or other children will be playing in her room.

In conclusion, the construction is cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"These were not worth the hours and frustration of putting them together. The fabric portion of the rails was not sturdy and the stitching ripped as I was sliding it onto the rails. The rails themselves were not as heavy as the replacements I bought a day later. After spending hours sweating and cursing putting them together, the guides bent and wouldn't even hide away between the mattress and boxspring. I returned these as fast as possible and bought two single rails at my local WalMart that were much better quality and much easier to assemble. I'm much happier with the new set I got. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Construction","review":"Very unhappy with this set of bed rails1) Pins are tough to get into place- have to wiggle around the rail to get them in2) Metal bent with normal everyday use - had to bend back with pliers and it doesn't work quite right anymore3) Short rails (height)- only have a standard mattress, no pillow top or anything, but the rails aren't very high above it4) Took a long time to put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance overall.","review":"Difficult to put together. This neither folds down or hides away.

Unfortunately, this product was not worth the time or effort spent to put it together. First of all, one of the clips that fastens the straps for the rail was broken when I opened the box. The hardware is very cheap and did not line up correctly, making what is supposed to be a safety product extremely unsafe and flimsy. Do more research and find a better product to buy than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible please do not buy.","review":"I bought this for my daughter's bed. Couldn't install it even after following the exact instructions. There were some parts issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good product","review":"I've had these rails for about 2 weeks now. We purchased them to use on my daughter's full size bed. The instructions were not good and some of the bars were numbered incorrectly. I figured out that once I tried to put it together on my own without looking at the instructions, it was easier to put together. The rails fit perfectly on our full sized mattress and boxspring. I believe only one side of the rails folds down and it folds like it's supposed to, but it's difficult to turn it so that it slides under the mattress. I would do this if I was having company and wanted it to look nice, but it's too much trouble to do every day. Plus, the pins that hold the side up do not look sturdy enough to continually put the rail up and down. I wish the pins went into the holes easier to hold the sliding rail in place. However, they are pretty strong. This morning I went into my daughter's room to find her laying right up against the rail with her full weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to use","review":"I am sorry to say that these were not as easy to put together or use once installed as I would have hoped. They do not hide away well without getting caught in the sheets. The levers that keep the rail up or down are very difficult to pull in or out. It takes a struggle to put these up or down. I will continue using them but get the plastic ones if you want to avoid some major frustration. Thanks !"},{"rating":"2","title":"If I can do it, so can you!","review":"I am terrible at putting stuff together, but I was able to follow the directions and I am proud to say that I did it!

Works really well. Easy to install. I put mine on a twin and they would have worked better on a full or double bed.

They worked out for my first daughter. She still uses them, and we just bought this second pair for my younger daughter just gettting out of a crib. They are a fair price. I paid 35 for the first and 40 for the second. They were much easier to put together the second time. Make sure they're clipped completely into place or somebody might fall out and also bend something. I hammered it back into place and everything's fine. Very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little difficult to use, but overall a good product","review":"We use this on our bed where we put our baby during the day for his naps. The product works as advertised and it really does slide between the mattress and box spring, and is not noticeable at all when we're sleeping on the bed. The negative is that the catches which lock the gates into place can be a bit of a pain to line up correctly and putting the gates up and down sometimes takes longer than it should, which is a pain for us since it goes up and down every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many pieces","review":"I thought my husband would have a heart attack when he saw how many pieces the product had.

I was very disappointed and wished I had purchased something different!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I love this product. It is worth the money I spent and the wait (it was on back order). In the past, I purchased a bed-rail from Summertime. It was not a hide-away. I had a hard time changing the bedding, and after awhile, my son kept hanging on it until it broke. So, when my daughter needed a bed-rail for her bed, there was nothing to pass down and I bought the same product. After researching alternatives, I found this product and I love it. I returned the other product and am looking forward to passing this bed-rail down to my second daughter. Also, the only reason I can not give 5 stars is that the knobs stick a little when hiding the rail, but this is nothing when you have the comfort of being able to change the bed without having to totally disassemble the bed-rail!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"My husband and I put this together in no time at all and our daughter used it last night for the first time.

The knobs you use to release the rails are not nice. They are very cheap, they are spring loaded and feel like they are going to break when you use them.

Right on to the reviewer to pointed out that Nic's incredible coldness was too played up. There was no logical reason for Rowland to fall in love. Her fall in love with him, yes, possible, but not he with her. She was too emotionally and physically unavailable for any man to find attractive. Also, it is impossible to imagine, in that time, that Rowland would actually not have slept with Nic in the marriage bed. So as far as the law was concerned, they were not legally married and if he had died in the battle when he first left, where would that have left everything? He was ordered to marry and in a way, he disobeyed the King. There was no love, no tenderness in this story.

When I got the book home, I kept waiting for it to take off, but it never did. My general rule of thumb is that if a romance does not really interest me after 50 or so pages, read the end and see if it is worth it. Even the end did not seem very good. I may be doing Ms Dain an injustice here, but I couldn't really get going on this book.

The author had created an unique and refreshing premise--too bad she failed to deliver an unique and refreshing story. The novel was slow and boring. I did however, think that the heroine was interesting and likable and deserved a much better hero. Furthermore, I felt uncomfortable and appalled with the hero's method of getting through the heroine's barriers and earning her trust. Forcing someone to have sex is not the best way to gain their trust.

This book was just awful. The plot has already been summed up. Having to wade through over 250 pages for some action was boring. I fail to understand Nicolaa. ... Nicolaa was just plain ridiculous in refusing to believe that men could not love..... Sure, as a reader, you might get some glimpse of why she was so cold, but how could he? He more than tried to please her, yet she was unaffected. Her coldness, her reckless disregard for the women in her \\"court\\" and not making marriages for them, made her unlikeable. ...Nicolla's not so very logical views were to distorted to be realistic.

The Mac starts up fast and runs relatively flawlessly while in use - no crashing, etc.But, what's the point of owning a laptop with a dead battery? I've owned this computer for just over 12 months and the battery is dead, kaput, sleeps with the fishes. Tethered to the wall with a power cord, it's now just a glorified desktop computer. This rapid battery failure is not unusual, either; go to the Apple store website and check the reviews for the battery that powers the Macbook. This battery is junk.So, the bottom line appears to be this: budget $130 every year to buy a new battery.Frankly, I'm inclined to slink back to a Windows machine with my next purchase.

Found a few scratches on the disc... and decided to try another disc and the same result.Finally took it to an Apple store to get a replacement but they instead offered repair service because it was 18 days instead of 14days. The store Rep's were rude and arrogant and very strict about their policies. Ofcourse, the problem existed all along because I found this during the first DVD use. They promised 5 days service... but its already 4 days and the website says \\"On Hold\\" because parts are on order.

After you've had it for a month or two (ie after the 15-day return window) it will start shutting itself off randomly more and more often until it becomes useless.

Pick it up if you are just looking for some entertaining stories written by a comic genius. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As disappointing as it is brief","review":"Seeing that most of the reviews here are disappointing ones, I'm forced to agree.

But I sure cracked a yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Carl Reiner, but . . .","review":"Saw a lot of Reiner on TV growing up in the 60s, and he was always entertaining and funny. Not so this book. At best, its a behind-the-scenes look at a creative genius' more mundane moments. At worst, its a mish-mash of random thoughts and name-dropping. If you imagine Reiner telling the stories out loud, you might get a kick out of some of them, but on the printed page, its boring and doesn't tell you anything you haven't heard about show business from a hundrred other sources. Carl is only 81 - better luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"If your have read Reiner's other books and watched some of the movies he has written then you expect more than this book has to offer. It is a real disappointment and it seems that Reiner is just in on it for the money. I've also never seen so many typos and misspelled words in a book. You don't find out very much about Reiner and his life and some of the stories are not even funny and you wonder why he is sharing them with you. I'm a huge Reiner fan and had ordered this book several month in advance and really looked forward to it. While reading some of the chapters I even found out that he was still writing the book at a time where you could already order it online. Perhaps he run out of time and ideas in the end. Hopefully, someone will some day write a real biography about Carl Reiner. The man has much more to tell and share than this books reveals.

Thankfully, Carl Reiner, one of our true comic geniuses, doesn't try to explain his gifts or the nature of humor in this pleasant memoir...he just tells a couple of dozen wonderful stories about his life, with his own unique brand of joy.If you've loved Reiner's work on movies, TV, records, you should find this to be an enjoyable read. Imagine you've somehow been given the opportunity to spend an evening one-on-one with him, while he recalls some of his memorable adventures. This is not a comprehensive, chronological autobiography; the anecdotes skip back and forth in time and place, much like our own memories. I've always had the feeling that Carl Reiner was a genuinely kind man, full of gratitude for the blessings of family and success; this warmhearted book helps to confirm that belief."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy is funny... wonderful and funny!","review":"Carl Reiner writes funny... very funny... and wonderful.

Incidentally, in the new series from the 1980s, I went through the instant people machine myself! Chopsley mixed up the sand. Morgus used a centrifuge to separate the four of us involved.

This was the situation repeatedly at various locations around town. The packaging for this item is such that it must be opened in a destructive manner (i.e., cannot be restored to original condition). It was necessary to open the item to find out about its serious functionality deficit; it was either of poor design or defective.

Even on open frequencies, I could still hear background static through the transmitter. The problem was apparently made worse because I have a Honda with the antenna in the back window. If I held the transmitter up in the air, the reception got a little better, probably because it had a clearer path to the antenna, but obviously you can't drive like that. I'm returning the product and trying a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plug doesn't fit in my car","review":"This is the strangest thing - but the cigarette lighter plug does not fit into the outlet of my 2006 Honda Accord. I tested my cell phone car charger and it fits perfectly. I had to return this and was never able to even test it. This is the 3rd product of this type I have tried and am unable to find something that works. I am really regretting buying a new car without a tape deck. It was a huge mistake as the tape converter worked pretty well, much better than these bad solutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I don't know what \\"T Leach...\\" is on about...can't have read the instructions. The key to this product is finding a (nearly) empty frequency.

Easily the best transmitter on the market and well worth the money....especially for those of us in the UK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"When I first got this, it was wonderful and worked great! I had this product in my car for about 3-5 months and it broke, with no hope or way to fix it. It would have been a better purchase elsewhere, more reliable place. Not worth the money! I'm not hard on my use of things, but this wore down fast and hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Glad I Didn't Pay Retail Price!","review":"I bought this thing for about 20 bucks, and probably would've killed myself if I had paid the 60 or 70 dollars that it usually retails for. You're gonna think this thing's great if you live somewhere that's got 3 radio stations, but for the rest of us who live in a society, you won't get a clear signal. It's just like listening to the car radio back in the day, when your friend in the passenger seat had to determinedly work the knobs for you. This retro aspect appeals to me and warms my heart, but it's 2010! I expect and demand clarity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An increadible waste of money","review":"I hate this thing. It is complete junk and does NOT work well at all. If you live anywhere with more than three or four radio stations, you will experience inteference using this. Save yourself the trouble and get something that wires directly into your radio via cable or cassette adapter.The fatal flaw is that you are using this in a car and moving through different transmission areas. There is no way you can stay on one station - any station - and not eventually have a problem.The only reason I gave this two stars is that it charges your ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crackle crackle whineeeee","review":"This Monster starts strong and fades away.The first month of use, no problems (other that it's hard as nails to find a \\"blank\\" radio station in Seattle).Second month, the crackling starts creeping in, as well as a high pitched whine that follows the rev of the engine.I put up with the whining and crackles for a few months as they got worse until the point came where I avoided listening to my iPod in the car! I'd rather listen to CD's than the piercing, crunching death of my music....

It allows tuning to just about any clear station on the frequency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to maximize use of your iPod!","review":"I bought this transmitter after driving cross-country with my brother. We used the same product in his car, and we were able to easily find and switch stations from Illinois to South Carolina with great reception.

These seem to work the best no matter where I go. I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with an iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use","review":"The Monster Cable iCarPlay works wonderfully.

THIS STINKS BECAUSE I CANNOT CHANGE THE PRE-SETS TO STATIONS THAT HAVE BETTER RECEPTION. I HEAR JUST AS MUCH STATIC (IF NOT MORE) AS I DO THE MUSIC. SINCE I LOVE HEARING CRYSTAL CLEAR MUSIC, I OPTED TO JUST CHANGE MY STEREOS IN BOTH MY CARS WITH IPOD READY RECIEVERS. LOOKING BACK, I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.

I have to put the iPod in the back seat to get it to work at all. To match a normal radio/CD volume you have to turn your radio all the way up. The transmitter is weak and I loose signal next to ANY power lines and I'm constantly switching between the three programmed stations to get a cleaner sound.

Buy the Kensington transmitter instead. It is far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peice of \\"Sh....\\" Junk","review":"I have tried this thing on 3 different radios and the sound quality sucks.

The OR's at the hospitals are buried in the middle of concrete and steel and get LOUSY radio reception. If ever you should be able to find a weak radio station it is there. In two seperate hospitals, one with a cheap boom-box and one with a BOSE CD/Radio, I got TERRIBLE sound. Another reviewers description of mono-AM with static is perfect!@#%%#%%&^&!

I originally ordered a replacement iTrip, but then cancelled it and got this because the reviews were better. Well, I tried several perfectly clear stations, but the best I could get was still like 10% static. Completely unlistenable. It seemed like if I held it up in the middle of the car, it would get decent, but as soon as I let go it was back to static. The iTrip worked way better for me so I'm going back to that.I gave it two stars because I have a friend who has the previous version and he loves it; I've heard his and the quality is perfect.

This Monster FM Transmitter is great. I get some static, but only if when I'm handling the device or if I'm changing radio zones. I've mounted the digital readout to my consule with smalle pieces of velcro and have purchased sticky pad for the iPod so that it stays in one place (I of course have a protective case around the iPod so that no glue gets on the actual iPod). Just great...I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, hard to detach from ipod","review":"The one thing keeping this from being a five-star product is the difficulty I'm having getting my ipod detached after use. I've figured out some tricks, but it's a daily struggle, so much that I've considered getting rid of this brand and getting another gadget to take its place. If you live in a rural area like I do, finding a station really isn't difficult, and the sound quality is great (not cd quality, but really very close). I do have to change stations when driving more than an hour or so, but I think that has to be expected.All in all, I'd suggest a different brand with easier to remove port for the ipod. The small buttons on the monster product really make detaching a bear. I sometimes have to unplug it from my cigarette lighter and take the whole contraption with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Blast","review":"I am so happy to not have to bring any more cd's into the car. My Monster Cable iCarplay transmitter is a good thing. Sometimes I experience static in my travels, no biggie I just find a new station. Where I am it's not a problem.

I didn't expect the sound quality to be as good as playing a CD, but I did expect it to be as good as radio reception. It was a no-brainer setting it up, and it worked, but I was completely disappointed in the sound quality. I tried several stations on the radio, and it was like I was listening to a poorly tuned station. The background static on the best channel was distracting and the sound quality so poor that I immediately returned it.If you are concerned with sound quality, this is not a viable way of getting iPod music through your car stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought the monster cable directly from an Apple store. After only using it a few times, I now only get sound from speakers on the passenger side of my car. I have to wave my iPod around with the cable attached to find the right spot that will play music on all the speakers...not a safe move when you're driving. I paid $80 for this and am extremely disappointed in the performance. Another peeve is that the cable is difficult to detach from the iPod. I have to squeeze the latches really hard before it dislodges from the unit. The only thing the cable is good for is charging up the iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"I have an Acura MDX this equipment makes my Ipod sound like a 1970's transistor radio. No channel works well. I have since bought the Griffin Road Trip that has the grey plastic platform and sticks out of the cigarette lighter socket. It is less attractive but at least it holds the music steady on 88.1 FM. There is an annoying whine underneath the music but the music comes through loud and clear and if you play it loud you don't hear the whine. Blue Tooth, Apple are you listening? We needa better system to connect the Ipods to car stereos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I don't write a ton of reviews but thought I had to share my thoughts about this product. I really feel this is a lousy device. The sound quality is not anywhere near FM quality, let alone CD (which I knew it would not be). There is a ton of static that is very noticable in the background. I don't like changing the EQ (which really needs to be done to use this product) each time I use it.So - better off using a direct input like the tape interface or better yet look at products from dension and such.Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad..Bad..Bad","review":"This has to be one of the worst FM Transmitter out on the market. If you have your car antenna that is located at the back of your car, this product will produce the worst kind of static. Can you say AM radio? No AM radio sounds better than this product.

I have yet to find a channel that remains static-free for any length of time, no matter where I am. I don't know how the few other reviewers that didn't have problems managed it, but my experience is like the majority of reviewers here who mostly have static. I guess I will try the casette adapter, or pay the bigger bucks to get a hard-wired connection put in, but I can't take the static!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work For Me","review":"I live in the Washington Metropolitan area and I had high hopes after reading the reviews of this product. I even preset all possible channels on my car stereo. The only one that works at all is the very first channel and even that one almost always has a lot of static. This is strange to me because it even works better on this setting when you can hear the original channel is coming in pretty clear and another channel is not. Sometimes if I move my ipod around I get a bit of a better reception but when your driving this is not very practical. If I had not already thrown away the package I would definitely return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I paid $80 for my iCarPlay and I have to say that the reception is LOUSY...lots of static.

I used 3 others from different companies before giving in and spending the extra money to get the monster. We have one in every car now, a hefty investment. They work infinitely better than anything else i've personally tried or seen my friends use.PROBLEM: I gave in an got the iPod touch Generation 2. I plug in the monster and the iPod says that the device is incompatible and will not charge the ipod. I have to acknowledge the warning and move on. Music will still play through the iCar BUT it doesnt charge the iPod. THis defeats the purpose of having a powered FM transmitter. This worked fine on my first generation iPod touch, but not on the 2nd gen. Be careful, I don't think anyone has anything out yet that will charge the iPod Touch Gen 2 AND play music from it at the same time yet.If that problem doesn't effect you, I'd say give in, spend the money and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NANO compatibility","review":"Would have rated this product absolutely perfect (5 stars) if Monster had included a single additional phrase in the direction booklet: \\"If using a nano, reset your i-Pod while the FM/Charger is attached.\\"I spent two frustrating hours trying to get this thing to work, then I finally got fed up and called Monster's Customer Service division. The Monster representative then told me that when using this product with an i-Pod Nano, the user must reset the i-Pod.

If you are listening to music with an in-dash single speaker in your 74 Ford Pinto, maybe the sound is ok.

I tried a number of stations and the signal came through fine, but the sound quality is about a 3 on a scale of 10.

In both cases it worked great! Considering the fact that both of these metropolitan areas are heavily populated and thus host countless radio stations I was happy to find that the transmitter is so effective.Once in a while you will hear a little bit of static but switching to one of the other presets quickly does the trick. The only significant drawback is major interference when my cellphone rings.The value of my IPOD has skyrocketed with this product and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"After reading some of the other reviews available for this product I admit I was nervous about the purchase but have been very happy with it since it's arrival. It shares the same problems as any other FM transmitter for an MP3 player and if you want your music to sound the same as if you had your earphones on then you need to invest in a wired hookup to your existing stereo. This unit does its job, keeping my Ipod charged and broadcasting to my car stereo, without alot of crawling behind the dashboard. Worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as advertised","review":"I'm not one to usually be sucked into spontaneous buying of products, but this little gizmo caught my eye. Since Monster has had a reputation of creating really great products in the past I reasoned this one must be great too. Unfortunately it wasn't. It transmits a weak (IMHO too weak) FM signal that you tune into on your car radio to play through your car stereo at the same time charging your iPod. The problem is that every station you attempt to pair the unit with is full of static and noise, and just moving the cord slightly will squelch static horribly. At first I thought it might be a problem with the antenna in my 2003 Ford Expedition so I tried to use it in my 2002 Nissan Altima. The static problems were the same in both cars. It is my recommendation that you spend $80.00 elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work well in the Atlanta Georgia area","review":"Too much static on any of its very limited choices (for some reason Monster does not start at the bottom of the FM band).

When I arrived at workplace 15 minutes later I started to smell something. I picked up the transmitter which was now red hot and showing signs of the plastic melting, so I immediately unplugged it.

I have not had to program a preset yet, as one of the defaults worked well for me in the Seattle area. I adjust my stereo's tone controls to increase treble when using this iPod Monster Cable FM transmitter, and the sound quality is good in most of my driving range. Like any FM transmitter, this does NOT sound as good as plugging your iPod into Apple's new $350 hifi boom box. Instead it is mobile, inexpensive, shared with your passengers, and quite listenable. iPod charging is an essential feature.

My iPod container is an iPod armor case (by Matias), which works well for me as I tote it around. However, the iCarPlay connector is too large to attach to the iPod when it is in its armor.After making sure that I was satisfied with the iCarPlay, an x-acto knife was found and the iCarPlay connector was carefully trimmed down to size (**DON'T DO THIS if you think you are going to return the iCarPlay**). Now the three gadgets work together.So, two stars to iCarPlay for its connectability with the iPod armor. Putting everything into perspective, I rate it 4 overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work in Volvo S-60","review":"The iCarPlay works in my 2001 Volvo S-60 just great...until I crank the engine! I tried it out in my garage the night it came and was super-pleased. Of course, I had only turned the car on, not the engine. Come to find out, it won't transmit when the engine is running (although it does continue to charge). I couldn't find anything about similar problems on the internet, in the manual, or Monster's website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept shorting out","review":"Worked great in about 10 minute intervals, then would short out and turn back to the radio. It could have just been my car, but I'd heard this product had done the same thing to other people after I'd already bought the iCarPlay. Maybe it will work great if it doesn't short out on you; maybe it won't & you'll be frustrated"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star is 1 Too Many","review":"Evidently I have to select 1 star out of 5 to rate this item. 1 star is one too many. This transmits terribly and is staticky even in the middle of the desert where there are no other stations.On the clearest of the 8 settings, I have to jack my car stereo volume almost to the max to hear it and loop the transmitter cable so it hangs in front of the stereo.Monster tried to pass the blame to my car stereo, saying it has a cheap receiver (it's a pretty expensive Bose), but to humor them, I tried it in many cars with different stereos; of course, it works about the same in all of them. Moreover, it plugs into the bottom of the unit, leaving you to operate your iPod upside-down or hold it while driving.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Use with 5G iPod","review":"This product does not work with the video iPod. I used it one time with my new iPod and then the iPod would not turn off unless it was connected to the Monster cable. I had to send my iPod in for replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"belkin has a better product","review":"I used this for an 8 hour drive from Illinois to Kentucky and I was constantly either trying to move the transmitor for better reception or having to change the channel on the transmitor and then the radio to match. The main benefit is that it charges the ipod. I have a belkin product that runs on aaa batteries and doesnot charge. I use it in a manufacturing facility on the midnight shift and almost the whole shop floor can tune in and we will have several radios rocking to the ipod all night long. With the Belkin I get about three 8 hour shifts worth of play. I got this monster product because of the name and I have formed the opinion that all the added cost of a monster product does not mean better quality. buy at your own risk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - cable movement causes noisy speaker feedback","review":"After buying one of these and plugging it into my new iPod 30G with Video, I at once began to notice terribly annoying feedback coming from my truck's speakers. I soon found that it was coming from the cable section of this device that ran from the Ipod connector to the FM selector device. ANY movement in this length of cable OR the iPod connected to the cable resulted in amplified feedback over my speakers (like dragging a microphone over sandpaper). Maybe it was a short circuit, but it sure sounded awful so I returned it ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"works good at the beginning...but...","review":"It worked great at the beginning, but after using it for nearly a month, the device will shut itself off for no reason after playing for 5 minutes. The light went off and not even unplug it and plug it back in works. And if I waited long enough to plug it back, it'll work for another 5 minutes and repeats history. I had to return it (lucky that it broke within 30 days.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Travelling with Ipod","review":"I have used this on an almost daily basis to keep my Ipod charged and have the music/recorded word available to me during my commute as well as on trips. While it's not super easy to initially set up due to the need to find an 'open' station, once I've found one, it holds that station for my personal broadcast. Periodically cumbersome during a long trip that goes through cities that are 'covered up' with radio stations, it is well worth the expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much static","review":"There's a constant, faint static behind my music when I use this transmitter. I have to turn the radio up pretty loud to be able to hear the music on my ipod at the volume I like. Sometimes the radio station comes in and starts playing over my music. I gave it 2 stars because it works ok *sometimes*. I just don't like it. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs just like it should","review":"Just barely ordered this to help me deal with the cross country trip I am going to take in a month or so.So far I am very impessed by this product. Going into this purchase I was fully aware that the audio quality of my music would be degraded because of it being broadcast on an empty radio station. Although the audio quality does suffer, I still feel the reception and clarity is quite good. The convenience of driving in the car and having thousands of songs to choose from far outweights a slight degradation in audio quality. The unit is compact and does not take up too much space. I would recommend this to those who are seeking a quality product that will allow them to listen to the music on their ipods while at the same time having it charged up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work!","review":"This product does not work. I have tried using it with multiple different ipods(ipod, nano, mini), and have tried multiple different vehicles(crysler, honda, jeep, nissan, mazda, toyota), and i have tried using it in multiple different locations(mountains, hills, city, suburbs, valley, beach).nothing works. it charges the ipod fine, but will not transmitt an fm signal to a car radio. i have even parked my car outside my bedroom window and tried to pick up the signal with my home stereo system. it does not work.how can they advertise that it does something that it does not?i am very upset with my purchase,."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware static/channel selection","review":"Mega-static with this thing here in San Francisco; maybe it will work better out in the country.One unusual result I would like to share with everybody is that \\"reception\\" may actually be better on an occupied frequency than on an empty one. At least that was my experience. I would highly recommend trying all 8 frequencies, regardless of the quality of the broadcast signal they receive.I'm gonna look for a cassette-to-iPod connector, I'll sacrifice top quality sound to get rid of the static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to your IPOD in your car","review":"Finding a free frequency that works is dificult. When travelling, you get all kinds of static and interference. Going from Ipod to radio is a chore laoded with lots of loud static due to having to increase volume to hear your IPOD and then turning it down to keep from blowing your car speakers. The car charger does work OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster in the car","review":"It is neat, and convenient but prone to interference and random fuzz.

It's cool that I no longer have to worry about the batery dying though."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product but could be better","review":"I bought this product about a month ago and use it almost everyday. Using this with your ipod you never need a CD in your car ever again. However, if you are someone that plays a lot of live recorded music from the 60s,70s,&80s, virtually all live music, you may experience volume issues in your car. For me, the volume and signal strength are poor. That is to say, I wish the signal could improve the sound and volume. For about 70$ you never have to bring a book of 100cds with you on road trips or daily activites. Hey Monster!!!!Improve the volume!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhhhh","review":"Well, at first I bought a X Brand FM Transmitter really cheap , the Seller sent me a non working one and 4 weeks later I got my money back.Then I did a lot of research and this looks to me like the best option given the reviews and I went for it. I live in Miami and in my Rover it did not work that great. I still have a LOT and I mean A LOT of interference. So probably in your car could work in mine definitely do not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but poor quality","review":"I was given an iCar as a gift. I couldn't make it work,so returned it. It was faulty and replaced. Now after 3 weeks, the digital read out on my replacement has quit! I hope I can get it replaced.I took this on a road trip and found it necessary to retune 4 times in 400 miles due to interference, which became impossible when you can't read the frequency.I like the small size and the fact that the ipod is not ridgedly mounted, but it seems quality needs improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take IPOD in Car NO PROBLEM","review":"Love taking my IPOD with me in my car or in other places where an input jack is not available. This allows me to listen to my music and audiotapes wherever I please. Signal pretty strong so overcomes most radio interference from intruding stations, but can change to another FM frequency with touch of a button. Three presets are available for one-touch. IF that doesn't get you a clear frequency for the IPOD to play over, then you tune in manually a new one, kind of like tuning your FM radio in the car. It is quick and easy. I love having it! I give it only 4 because of only 3 presets, in busy city area you may have to manually tune in another frequency. More presets would be luxury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Mistaken","review":"Either LOVE it or HATE it. I hated it.

The cassette adapter wins hands-down for sound quality. The pro's to having the Monster Cable iCarPlay are that 1) it charges the iPod 2) newer cars do not have a cassette deck, so when in a new car or renting a car or what have you, iCarPlay does the trick. For the sound quality though, it rates very low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great accesory for your iPod if you don't have a tape deck","review":"I had doubts about purchsing this because of some of the bad reviews based on the signal quality. Took a risk, and it works better than I could have hoped. In most areas, all 8 presets receive a strong signal, and I am driving around the SJ/SF bay area (HW 101/880). The only thing i can think of is maybe it depends on your car's head unit, and how/where it receives RF signals.Would rate 4.5 stars if i could because of one design flaw: the connector that plugs into the bottom of the ipod is slightly larger and wider than the standard ipod connector, so this may not fit with all the ipod cases out there. It is too big for my inCase leather ipod case, so i have to take it out each time i use it. I would definitely like to see Monster Cable take this into consideration in the future. small nuisance for a great product. extremely satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static","review":"I live in St. Louis and have a Honda Civic. The Monster ipod adapter did not work very well at all. There was a lot of static no matter which radio station I used. I ended up returning the product. I have been told that the quality of sound that you get depends on where your car antenna is and where you are. Considering the price of the adapter and charger, I expected great sound quality. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget it if you live in the SF/Bay Area","review":"Disappointing that this is a worthless product if you live in the San Francisco Bay Area where Monster themselves are located. We just have too many stations here. On a basic test drive up/down the peninsula or across the bay I was unable to find any way of using in a \\"static free\\" manner. Even with their three memory buttons it doesn't matter... there are no frequencies that don't have a legitimate station right next to them. This device simply doesn't put out a strong enough signal to overcome the interference.I'll be returning this as soon as possible and either trying another FM device or switching to a cassette adapter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"I bought two - one for me, and one for my wife.

I spent the time and money on returning it to Monster. I was once of the opinion that this company made high quality equipment. The replacement unit changed all that. On my first trip to work with it, I could smell a burning odor. It was dark out and I turned on the dome light to see smoke coming out of it! By this time the music had stopped and I quickly unplugged it. This thing could have set fire to my vehicle. When I emailed Monster about this, there was no response."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH STATIC","review":"If you live in a big city, like Chicago, it's impossible to find a station that's not being used.

Again.","review":"This FM transmitter worked fantastic for about two weeks, then, it just decided it wanted to stop. Oh, by all means, it still charges her iPod wonderfully! It's just that the actual transmitter stopped displaying the FM frequency, and it quit broadcasting. Unfortunately, she lost the receipt so we couldn't return it. So now it's basically a $60 car iPod charger. I know personal anecdotes don't usually mean squat, but upon further investigations online, it turns out I'm not alone. Seems these things have a working life of less than a month for a lot of people. Not to mention, they are quite difficult to plug into car outlet. My suggestion?

My other backup was a one-touch Seagate. Oops. It gives me errors when I try to copy files off it:\\"Error. File xxx.xxx was changed since copy operation started. Cannot continue\\" or some annoying thing like that. A huge hunk of my data is now in limbo with a SECOND backup. Egads.Worse yet, when I plug in the USB, it hangs my computer. The screen goes black and that's it. Hard reboot required. Okay, so you say put the drive in another enclosure and save your data. Wrong!

Yes they do, well enough that I can continue to use voice dialing with no problem. I was concerned it would change the voice signal enough to make me have to re-record. Nope.

Give it a chance; it's not the kind of record that's all hooks and grabs. No, you need to give it prolonged time on the stereo before it really worms its way into your heart. Hitchcock's lyrics can be whimsical, odd, grotesque, darkly threatening or heartbreakingly simple, often all in the same song. High points: a gorgeous take on the traditional Polly On The Shore; the cheerfully morbid Fiend Before The Shrine; and Birdshead, an overlooked masterpiece, which features R.E.M. guitarist (and Hitchcock fan) Peter Buck. Listen a few times and you'll pick out the gems from the chaff; give it a few more spins and you'll start loving the chaff too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"The sound is lousy.

Illustrator Paul Galdone gives the royal treatment to this classic story of a teeny-tiny woman out on a teeny-tiny walk who finds herself a teeny-tiny bone and thinks of making a teeny-tiny pot of soup for herself. Humour and suspense in generous amounts follow the events that spiral out from her one simple act of bringing the bone home. The silly surprise ending is classic slumber-party fare...eek! This is a good story for around Halloween time due to its bedtime suspense and ghostly plot. Be sure to share this one with a new generation of kids. It's sure to be loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great ghost story!","review":"My son absolutely loves this story.

There are other versions of the Teeny Tiny Woman out there, but Galdone's has, to me, the best pacing and rhythm. Like so many of his versions of basic fairy tales, he gets the job done simply and well. I often read this book early in October as an introduction to the \\"scary stories\\" that will follow later in month. When I read this book aloud I use the \\"voices\\" as the kids say, with a teeny tiny squeaky voice for the woman and a moaning spooky voice for the ghost, so that by the time the last page comes the students are enthralled. Then, at the end,when the teeny tiny woman says in her biggest teeny tiny voice--scream the words \\"TAKE IT!!!! They'll jump out of their seats. And then they will laugh and laugh. This book is always a hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible Tim Mahoney produces disappointing CD","review":"Maybe I'm being over critical because I want Tim to succeed, but I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD.

The employee swore to me that there was no way that a dog could chew through this, so I figured I would give it a try. Sure enough, I bring the toy home, and within 10 MINUTES (no exaggeration) the entire top portion of the toy was completely chewed up and in bits all over the floor.

I wonder if I didn't put the food in the hole if he would have ripped it appart like he did (althought I took out the treat myself and gave it to him so he wouldn't eat the toy).

I still recommend this toy because my dog loves when I fill it with peanut butter and treats, and the price on Amazon is much better than you will find in the pet supply stores.

So I figured it was time to get her a black one and see how she did with it. For a chewer like her - one who is primarily interested in the food, and not in demolishing the Kong itself - it worked very well. She's still able to get dents into it, but it doesn't chip off the way the red ones do. I'm sure if she spent a lot of energy trying to break the toy itself apart she would, and for dogs like that it probably won't last. Ours didn't smell to terribly.

We first got him the red kong for average chewers and he chewed right through it and started eating the pieces so we had to throw it away. Then we got the black kong for extreme chewers and we had the same problem. The only difference between them was that he chewed up the black one in only a slightly longer amount of time. They both were chewed up within around a day and we ended up having to throw them both away. This is at least not for my powerful chewer. I would recommend getting a nyla bone instead because he loves those and they are hard for him to chew through."},{"rating":"1","title":"i messed up","review":"love kongs thougt i was ordering a giant one little one was useless to me did not know how to return"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily destroyed","review":"My dog destroyed this \\"extreme\\" toy in less than a day--I caught him tearing off pieces of rubber and eating them.

Even as I type this our Pit is still desperately trying to destroy her Kong. We were worried about the smell from other reviews here but when we got the toys they just smelled faintly of processed rubber. After the dogs had them for about 10 seconds they smelled like dog saliva and that was that. Another great feature is the ability to just run these through the dishwasher if they get too gross. Make sure you get the right size for your dog though because I believe most of the stability of this toy comes from the fact that she can't get a good grip on it. I hope you enjoy this product if you purchase it because they have been great in our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifesaver for a large breed puppy in training","review":"Pros: The Extreme Kong is incredibly durable. It's large enough that I don't have to worry about her swallowing it. I usually fill it with peanut butter. You can put it in the freezer if you want the PB to last longer.

It's probably easiest to clean using a tooth brush and some dish soap.Bottom Line: Worth the money if your dog is a big chewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dog toy for dental chews","review":"The extreme Kong combined with the dental chews we get at Costco are the only thing that satisfies our crazy dog.

Over the past year I have noticed occasional black tar like stains on dog beds or blankets. I had thought that the dogs had gotten into something odd in the backyardbut I just saw where the black Kong had stained a cardboard container it had been stored by with black streaks.

All in all it's a great toy and seems so stand up to all the playing and chewing that will certainly happen eventually.

(the last one is about in half)Our German Shepherd is 110 lbs and has very powerful jaws. He chews and chews on this thing and it stays together. He doesnt chew it to destoy it, he chews it for fun and for comfort. Mainly he carries it around in his mouth all the time and chomps it. He seems to like the fact it is squishy. The only downfall is when he cant find it he searches and runs thru the house looking for it. haha.No toy is indestructable but these kongs last us approx 6mths until the constant chomping weakens the seams and they start falling apart.

But this large black one finally was indestructable. Only problem is that his lower jaw got stuck in the toy. This happened in an instant during supervised play. It was jammed so bad that he had to be put under fully by a vet so that the toy could be drilled off. His gums were shredded from him yelping and flailing around trying to get it off. KONG assumes no responsibility for their unsafe toy. They have a tedious claim process that is designed to make you give up. I'm not trying to sue them or anything...just a little compensation for the vet bills....maybe just a refund for the toy?? I've read blogs stating that this same incident has happened to many others.

I wouldn't say never for a different dog, but one would really have to watch them closely because the piece that was broken off could have easily been swallowed.

It might be possible to attach a shoulder strap to it if you prefer that method of playing, although i'd leave that job to someone who knows what he's doing.This Kantele can be strummed and to a degree you can play some really catchy songs with it, although you might have to retune it slightly if you want different chords than the traditional one. Plucking this Kantele is dead easy and rewarding even if you have little or no skill to begin with.All in all i really recommend it. Got for it - it rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lyrics are Correct, Music is There, Voice is Shot","review":"With great excitement, I unwrapped the CD and skipped down the list to play Heaven...only to be, er...shocked. David Butlers voice is fine until he tries to hold a note. The word \\"heaven\\" as it comes out of his mouth sounds like he is trying to move a large boulder in his back yard (or perhaps a small stone from his kidney). Having lost my complete music selection twice to theft/stupidity, the P-Furs somehow never made it back onto my \\"music-to-replace\\" list. Finding this new release with their greatest hits seemed like a quick fix for getting all the good tunes (you know...Heaven, Pretty in Pink, Love my Way...) on one album. Live, extended versions....even better. What I did not realize was that these recordings were made in 2001. If you are Psychedelic furs fan with nostalgia on your mind when looking at replacing your cassettes of old, plunk down your hard earned money on the original releases. If this album was stolen, I wouldn't replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"san francisco days","review":"Chris Isaak is very talented and so cute! He has his own unique style and his band is great. His voice has a good range and is just beautiful. If you are a Chris Isaak fan you should have this CD in your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one good song (but it's a real good one)","review":"I had never heard of Chris Isaak. I bought this album after hearing the haunting and unforgettable \\"Can't do a Thing to Stop Me\\" on the radio. This song was a total anomaly, and the rest of the album might as well be from another performer. The other songs are like country western, and I would rather listen to cats screeching than that. Maybe it's good if you like that kind of music. If you don't, however, consider that you're paying album prices for a single. It sure is a good single, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Stop Chris Isaak","review":"After the belated surprise success of Heart Shaped World, Chris Isaak let four years go by before following that album up. The wait was worth it as San Francisco Days is a magnificent collection of retro-rockers from the king of brood. The title track opens the album with a country flavor, while \\"Beautiful Homes\\" explores envy and heartache. \\"Two Hearts\\" is a pretty little number and \\"Can't Do A Thing (To Stop Me)\\" has a languid, dreamy sound with Mr. Isaak finding the higher end of the vocal scale. \\"Except The New Girl\\" has a nice steel guitar passage and \\"Waiting\\" is a mournful moaner. \\"5:15\\" chugs along with a pulsating guitar and Neil Diamond didn't write \\"Solitary Man\\" for Mr. Isaak, but no one has covered a song that was more appropriate for them than this. \\"Solitary Man\\" is classic Isaak and he sings it with the verve and it closes this great album on a perfect note."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his better ones.","review":"I didn't get this album until years after it's release, but I'm glad I have it now. I wouldn't say it's better than \\"Forever Blue\\", but I like it as much as \\"Heart Shaped World\\". \\"San Francisco Days\\" and \\"Beautiful Homes\\" are both great songs, and I like his cover of \\"Solitary Man\\" too. But the gems of this disc are \\"Two Hearts\\", which was also on the \\"True Romance\\" soundtrack, and the ultra-smooth \\"Can't Do A Thing (To Stop Me)\\". Overall this is definitely a must for the fan, at least until he has a \\"Best Of\\" anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris doesn't get any better!","review":"Someone said it best when they said, \\"Chris Isaak sings as if it is 3am and nothing else can work but pure unrelenting honesty...\\" San Francisco Days (title tune) has such a great light sound. And Beautiful Homes brings you there with him as he looks into his estranged lovers home as she carries on her life inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Terrific Album","review":"If you are trying to get away from the thematic approach that Chris Isaak seems to take in \\"Forever Blue\\" and \\"Baja Sessions\\", then this album is for you. This album has no real common theme; but that is certainly not a bad thing. Outside of the ill-tempered and somewhat annoying \\"Round and Round\\", this album is full of pretty tunes, the best of the best being, the Title Track, \\"Can't Do a Thing(to stop me)\\", \\"Except the New Girl\\", and \\"Waiting\\". Isaak's cover of Neil Diamond's \\"Solitary Man\\" is a gorgeous one, and rounds out a near-perfect Chris Isaak experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful!","review":"This album is simply beautiful!

It is so cheap and tacky looking that I was curious how much someone spent on what I could have picked up at the Dollar Store for under 10 bucks. The lotions and bath salts, etcetera are disgustingly low quality, I would never even consider using them. The wire basket that it's all packed in is laughable unless of course you like chicken wire shaped as a sleigh, but I think it's suppose to be a tub. Absolutely the worst gift I have ever received. Funny though. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow and Evil","review":"I bought this on record a few days ago because I saw it had members from Pelican involved and was not sorry. Far from fast this album takes it's time and builds on slow evil dissonant guitars. There is alot of strange background noise that adds alot of texture and mood. The best way I thought to describe the vocals is to combine the witch from the movie Legend screaming in a metal band, and the vocals from Immortal (wicked evil sounding). From first listen you might not know members from pelican were involved but if you pay close attention you can pick up a few parts here and there. If you like Pelican and some evil deep metal you should pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experimentation gone horribly right...","review":"This is like some hellish mix of Pelican(I guess theres a member or two of theirs in Tusk),Mayhem,Khanate and Human Remains...that's all I can really come up with at the moment. This album can turn on a dime from being slower, more atmosphere and mood oriented to grinding blackened noise experimentation...Theres nothing else to do but listen and let this take over you like the black plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cables To Go 4 port KVM fares poorly","review":"The Cables To Go 4 port USB PS@ unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on. But I have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the KVM is not switched to that device. The video card goes into some blacked out video mode. The pc has to be shutdown. The box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error. The box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc. You must bo the port and watch the reboot. Then card is OK until next reboot unattended. Frustrating. The keyboard and mouse are OK. But with wireless keyboard/mouse combo, the box can not be on auto scan mode. Too many drawbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory VGA Image","review":"I bought the Cables To Go USB KBM Switch to replace a D-Link KVM that had failed. This Port Authority KVM has neat features (auto-switching, switchable USB hub, auto-conversion of USB on all connected PCs to work with PS2 keyboard and mouse), but it delivers a poor image on my VGA monitor. My HP f2105 plasma display's image is fuzzy and has ghost images.I've not yet determined whether the poor image results from the KVM switch, itself or from the KVM-to-PC cables that accompanied the unit.Either way, I wouldn't purchase this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 2 years","review":"I used this KVM for switching a Keyboard, mouse and USB printer between 2 Intel Macs and a PC for the first year, and then just between the 2 macs the 2nd year. I never used it for video switching. It was sometimes problematic, and had to be reset - but worked OK for 2 years. Then it just stopped switching, and resetting it did not fix the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst KVM I Have Ever Used","review":"I have this switch in my office to switch between a Windows laptop and a Linux workstation. When switched to my workstation, my laptop does not recognize that it is connected to keyboard/monitor. When I want to switch back, I have to force the laptop to use the external monitor. A KVM switch should be designed to simulate that connection. There are better, cheaper switches on the market. The KVM switch I have at home does not exhibit this problem and in other ways works much better than this one does.Avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading!","review":"I can't wait for the movie to come out!!!

The arrangements are full of infectious hooks, the performances of each is dramatic and intoxicating and on top of all of that you begin to feel yourself bopping and jumping in an explosion of musical joy. I could listen to \\"A Little Respect\\" five billion times in a row without ever tiring of it; but that is one of 20 terrific songs on this CD. I have never been to an Erasure concert, but if you love commercial pop with undeniably broad appeal, you will love this record too."},{"rating":"2","title":"POP! - 20 Hits ~ Erasure","review":"I love the way Vince Clark uses synth sounds and the beat and are great. The lyrics are not all that great though and Andy Bell seems happy to sing about nothing important or to write inane lyrics that just do not make sense. There is something annoying about Bells vocals and he sounds like he is trying way to hard and it just comes out as forced and not natural. I like the fact that one can see what equipment Vince Clarke uses to make his music. The problem that I have with the lyrics is that they are all to melodramatic and filled with absolutely nothing and they could just about be talking about the weather and the song would sound as well. However, I still give in 4 stars and that is because Clarke saves these inane lyrics with awesome synth programming and execution. Now if he had only pick a better lyricist or just written the lyrics like he did for Depeche Mode then the songs would not sound as campy and right down stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vince Clarke has the Midas touch","review":"From Depeche Mode to Yaz to Erasure, everything Vince Clarke touches turns to gold. This compilation provides all the evidence necessary to bestow upon Clarke the title \\"synth god\\".The biggest hits are \\"Little Respect\\" and \\"Who Needs Love (Like That)\\", but each song stands on its own as a great New Wave composition, based on the powerful and unique vocals of Andy Bell and the fantastic synthesizer soundscapes (all 100% analog!) of Clarke.\\"Victim of Love\\" (my fave), \\"Oh L'Amour\\", and \\"Stop!\\" are other highlights on this CD, which is well worth the money for any fan of 80s music.One other note: Erasure has had several albums after the release of this compilation (most notably the masterpiece \\"I Say, I Say, I Say\\", in 1994), so \\"Pop! 20 Hits\\" cannot be said to be representative of their career as a whole. Still, it's worth owning for its summary of the band's first decade of production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This was a great Late 80s band. It is unfortunate that they never hada top ten hit because they surely had the talent. \\"Chains Of Love\\" was an excellent song but it only managed 15. I think Erasure is a great band and I recommend this CD fully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if you like the older stuff","review":"I like Erasure and this cd definitely has 20 hits. I prefer Erasure's newer cds: Cowboy and Loveboat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please send them to Eurovision","review":"We actually liked Erasure during the 1980's. Their albums, which constantly spewed forth singles. Vince Clarke, who had formed three bands. Or were they four? Andy Bell, who tried to sound like Alison Moyet, and who was obviously gay. Did I mention the constant single releases?In reality, Erasure was crap. What on earth were we thinking?Yazoo were innovative. Even the Assembly was innovative. But Erasure? They sound like some wayward British entry to the Eurovision Song Contest! Indeed, I'm surprised they never represented \\"the United Kingdom\\". I'm sure they could have won it, forcing the BBC to organize the contest somewhere in Brighton.No, we are not amused..."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE essential album everyone must own!","review":"THE essential album, not only for Erasure fans, but for anyone who enjoys POP music.

I have three other thermometers, but they are meat thermometers that only go up to about 200 F. I urgently needed one for bread since I had people who wanted my bread. Bread temperatures are 205 to 210 F.Even though I recalibrated the temperature for accuracy, the temp was at least 5 F lower than actual temperature. It takes at least an entire minute to register the temperature and even then I really don't know how much the reading is off the actual temp of the bread. So I have to take the bread out of the oven to test the temp, something I would not have to do if it registered in a few seconds.Being let down with this thermometer, I stopped by a Bed, Bath, and Beyond and picked up a cheap Polder thermometer for less than $9.00. It was so much more accurate and faster than this one.Don't waste your money if you want accuracy and a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"quick & readable","review":"Everything about the ProAccurate thermometer is great to use & in the face of it...well, its just so readable.
