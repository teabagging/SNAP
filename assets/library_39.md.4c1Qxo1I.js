If anything, I came away with a negative attitude. I found the book overly preachy, and the positions not fully explained. I did enjoy the entertaining stories about various author visits. And the descriptions of the authors that Burton likes were enlightening. I do admire her devotion to the business - the unfathomable amounts of money she must have sunk into it over the years, and the determination she has to keep it going. But much of the book rubbed me the wrong way, culminating with the Harry Potter book release story: Buying up the chains' stock to sell at their own store sounds like an unseemly business practice to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is an extremely fun and informative book.

This DVD is so bad that it sits on my shelf collecting so much dust that I'd be better off putting in the trash! Yes, Maxim Mironov is truly a wonderful singer, but the soprano is really hard to watch. Her singing and gesturing are too strained and overstated. The stage is over crowded and cluttered with much too much nonsense. It's looks like a kid show run \\"amok.\\" I'm only sorry that I waited too long or otherwise it would have been returned.

A good song for me is one that can hold my attention, that provides a nice soundtrack to life. This album does that."},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit on the entire CD","review":"Like most of the CD's that record companies release, there's only really one good song on there: Superman - the well known theme song used in 'Scrubs'. Other than that, the rest of the songs pretty much suck. It's like when iTunes came out and the record industry resisted the idea of selling tracks individually, since people would just buy one good track and skip the fillers. That was way back in 2001, which is around when this album came out, so maybe artists and record labels have changed their ways since then, and are filling the whole disc with good songs?"},{"rating":"1","title":"why buy here when you can pay half the price","review":"I was going to order the magazine through this site and thought perhaps they were offering a 2 year subscription for $24.

Or a serving of Kung Pao chicken? This is the newsletter that broke those stories. Published by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, this small newsletter (10-20 pages) is packed with info and *no ads*. Each issue has a cover story (for example Cancer, Does Fat make you Fat?, Nutrion and Aging, Which Vitamins are right for you, etc.) which gives high level statics and attempts to divide myth from fact based on interviews with respected experts. Most articles are accompanied by a table of comparisons with nutritional information with their recommendations marked as \\"Best Bites\\" (recent reviews include ice cream, peanut butter, vegetables, etc.). There is a regular column with recipes and the back page features two new products, one healthy, one not. Well written unbiased timely reporting on nutrition.

Readers who care deeply about proper nutrition won't mind reading a lengthy feature article rich with information and the latest findings.Also included in the newsletter are snippets of recent studies and information about specific brands and food items.I like the comparative charts, often a full page in length, comparing breads, cookies, snacks, yogurts, fries, or whatever food is featured that month.The price for this publication is not exorbitant, and one who subscribes is also supporting the the watchdog pursuits of the CSPI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent NewsLetter","review":"I renew a dozen subscriptions a year (at Christmas, half price) for the whole family. Their advice is backed by science, not anecdotal evidence (Aunt Mae said I should ...).

When I listen to this recording, I hear Serkin laboriously attempting technically perfect fingering and mathematical precision of tempo. To me, the trilling within the third movement of Moonlight is hopelessly awkward -- similar to that of a 2nd year pianist -- and the performance lacking in emotional highs and lows. I greatly prefer Rubenstein's interpretations, finding them to be much more fluid, graceful and intensely emotional."},{"rating":"2","title":"R. Serkin less a place to start than one of many to end up","review":"Rudolph Serkin's Beethoven sonatas are different and interesting, but there are many, many versions of the popular Beethoven sonatas that are different and interesting. Better (more mainstream?) performers to start with might include Wilhelm Kempff, Emil Gilels, or possibly Schnabel. Richard Goode and Stephen Kovacevich have performed well in more modern recordings (though Kovacevich's cycle has a clinker or two as well.) Solomon's versions of the late Sonatas should not be missed if you acquire \\"the bug\\", and one could (and should) also dip into individual sonatas by Arrau, Brendel and others. (Certain of Svatislav Richter's performances available on Praga and Revalation should also not be missed.) In short, Rudolph Serkin's vision of these works may make his Beethoven less a place to start than one of many places to end up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uninspired, but cast is energetic and film is lots of fun","review":"Crackerjack action/comedy about goofy gangland troublemaker as he is hired to protect an actress from her megalomaniacal brother, who is holding a city hostage with numerous bombings.

Those of us who wish to reach a closer personal relationship with Jesus Christ through our consumption of caffeinated beverages now have a real option to turn to. I had given up espresso, since most cafes are hotbeds of secular humanism (poetry readings, \\"alternative\\" newspapers, weird music) and even home espresso makers are theologically suspect. Did you know the octagonal base of the typical Italian espresso pot is a Satanic symbol? By contrast, the I Wish You Jesus espresso maker has a very lovely cross shape. My favorite touch is the steam that squirts out of Our Lord's five wounds when the coffee is ready. And the espresso is superb! A couple of cups gave me the stamina for an all-night Bible reading.

Faith took a lot of OLD classics that most R&B artists won't touch and I think that is great. Her version of 'This Christmas' was done very well, but my favorite is 'The Day That Love Began'.

For a minute, I had to actually remember that these were Christmas songs. Faith's voice will easily put you into that soul mood. I don't need anything else for Christmas, Faith did it with this album. Not sure if anybody out right now (with the exception of Kelly Price and Yolanda Adams) can match or outdo her voice.

As events unfold they become reluctant allies, struggling to balance their mutual attraction against a system which forces them to be enemies. And in the end, Raven and Val must learn to trust each other, if they are to survive and defeat the forces that threaten to destroy them both.I first read the e-book edition of this story, and am delighted to see it finally available in paperback.

The special effects are not the best, butthat is understandable considering the year of production. Basicallythe story is so good that you forget a little in paying too much attention to the details of the effects. The ending is a little rough,but truly emotional.

While trying to rewatch old taped programs I have realized that the old charisma is simply no longer there.Subject matter seems lame and irrelevant and even boring though i enjoy the antics of some of the characters.This is a different age for a different audience.

These are not greasy by any means and you can keep them in your pocket or a treat bag quite easily.They are solid treats that aren't brittle so there's no real fear of them falling apart in your pocket or treat bag. They aren't totally solid, but their baked quality gives them a harder consistency that provides a great crunch for dogs. The closes thing I can compare them to are small croutons, (these are slightly smaller) like you'd put on a salad for instance.I make sure I've got a good supply of them around the house.

It's all about the music of Gershwin and when you hear Sarah's voice bending notes up and down, becoming the human horn she was, you will gasp. Adding a jazz approach to Gershwin's music was nothing new, but having it played by the Philharmonic pushes this one to five stars. This is Sarah in her later years and the voice was never better. This would have made a fine DVD to see the full orchestra, the crowd reactions and Sarah having fun. This gem gets more than a couple martini's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"I love Sarah V., the depth and range of her voice are truly amazing. I adore Gershwin, esp his lyrics. This production is terrible. Sarah talks, doesn't sing, does a lot of do-be-do-be-wah stuff, ignores the melodies, races through exquisite lyrics, making them unrecognizable and the orchestra is ignoring them both (Sarah and Gershwin). I can only imagine that the applause, (its a live performance) is coming from people who know nothing about either. Save your money if you like these artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Divine Sarah","review":"This is likely the best recording of Sarah particularly in her later years. For those of us that love those lower tones and brilliant mature interpretations, it is sheer bliss.That bombastic voice with wonderful full orchestra is a genius blend of two musical schools.I don't think I'll ever hear anyones elses voice again when I here I loves ya Porgy. Like another reviewer I am at a complete loss as to the comment about Sarah chatting too much. They must have a different recording than the one I have. Also the Amazon suggestion to buy this with Crazy and Mixed Up was a great idea. That same wonderful voice in a small intimate setting was almost like being there.Two great and different sides of Sarah, sheer ambrosia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too sweet","review":"I was looking for real flavour of the wild strawberry.

The performance is beautiful-you would be hard pressed to find better; however my download was riddled with not only digital but also very distracting background noise. At times it seems as if the recording was made from someone in the audience. The moving climactic crescendos are marred by slight distortion and at times you can hear what sounds like humming. I've owned a copy of this recording in the past and don't remember all these imperfections. You might be better served buying a hard copy of this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality not up to par","review":"I too found the sound quality distracting, which is a shame. There are pops and general noises in some of the quiet parts. Then, there are also weird sounds that I assume are coming from the bass fiddles when they really bow with force.

These absolutely feel as closely as possible to the 'real thing' - you really, really cannot feel them (and this is based on both my and my spouse's feedback). Needless to say, these are for committed, monogamous relationships only, because they only protect against pregnancy. They are very expensive, no doubt, but when you are in a committed relationship, this comes with its perks - among other things, you also don't have to invest as much in dinners, movies, dates, etc - all of which are anyway with an unpredictable return on the investment, so from that standpoint- you have saved enough to be able to afford an investment in these condoms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference","review":"This book has really helped me to implement a good strategy at my company for improving our cost of poor quality as well as information on providing relavent information to key people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Cost for Quality Efficient","review":"This book is a great resume for a Quality cost improvement and an excellent guide for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Little Book","review":"My children loved this book when they were young, so much so that it is now rather worn around the edges.I will definately buy a new edition for my great niece.Lovely book with charming characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad for the money","review":"the book a very thin 47 page paper back which has very little to do with Panama.

Edward G Robinson takes the acting honours by miles with a mesmerising performance as Rico.The film is is clearly influenced by the life of Al Capone, and Chicago in general in the 1920's. For 1931, only a year or so into talkies the script is remarkably good. Flaherty, who is the Cop who wants to put the cuffs on Rico has some great dry witty and sarcastic lines. Rico has many classic lines including \\"You can dish it out but you're getting so you just can't take it anymore!\\" and his final words \\"Mother of mercy.. is this the end of Rico?\\".Watch carefully and you will spot scenes by the director Mervyn LeRoy that influenced Martin Scorcese amongst others. Well worth getting and if there was a better crime film made in the early 30's I haven't seen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow","review":"The Amazon movie player was very, very slow.

Rico, together with his friend, kills himself up to one of the most powerful gangster bosses in Chicago. His fall his as heroic as his raise. If you love \\"The Godfather\\", you will fall in love with this early talking movie, which has its weaknesses, but is nevertheless worth seeing.Starring the unforgetable actors Edward G. Robinson and Douglas Fairbanks jr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Story","review":"This is a fairly decent performance by Edward G. Robinson and the rest the cast but the story is not that compelling and the sets, music, and direction don't stand out. I recommend \\"Key Largo\\" over this one. Both Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart put in great performances. Not only that you have a better story, music, and direction. Besides you can get \\"Key Largo\\" on DVD for less than this movie.Even fans of this movie should consider the fact it is expensive for VHS. I wouldn't buy \\"Little Caesar\\" on VHS anyway, I would wait for it on DVD if you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Lighthearted to Angstfest in 12 episodes flat","review":"I love this series.

The dynamic between Gawl, Ryo and Koji is fabulous. The English dub is VERY GOOD. One of only about three anime I watch in English. Only down side to Generator Gawl is that it isn't longer.

Serkin is my gold-standard, because he is what I cut my teeth on. His style is of the grand, but later more enlightened, Romantic era. The performances are fluid and 'effortless' (in my humble, but honest, opinion) and give the impression that all the nuances of the works were settled long ago by the performers who love playing them with a telepathic power.

My main complaint is the deceit of the advertisement. The seller is not amazon.com. They advertise by showing what appears to be an HP package of both ink cartridges, and nowhere in the ad does it say these are remanufactured. So I would think people assume these to be new. I know I did. What arrived were refurbished cartridges. The color one was leaking right off the bat and had to be discarded. The company would not replace it.Personally, I would avoid these and for a few dollars more, you can buy genuine HP, brand new products. If you like remanufactured cartridges, that's fine. Many people use them.

It is more about his dad than Andre and the book is written, not from information gleamed from personal interviews, but mostly from other already published sources.

This is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andre Agassi","review":"Paul Bauman wrote a wonderful book about Andre Agassi called Agassi and Ecstacy.

I would recommend this book to tennis players and fans of Andre Agassi. I also recommend this book for all ages of people who are interested in tennis and who like Andre Agassi.

Rather, it is a collection by a little-known gospel artist who is also named James Brown. This JB usually uses his middle initial to differentiate himself from the Godfather of Soul. But for some reason he neglected to do so on this release, causing much confusion and many returned CDs.

Shannon was the runner-up in the first season of Australian Idol and now he's back and better than ever! Shannon once said he wanted to record an album where nobody would ever be tempted to hit the skip button, and that's exactly what he did!! Every song is excellent! They are mainly a mix of rock and pop with a bit of a country feel to some of them. Shannon shows that he can rock out with the song \\"Drive\\", written by Bryan Adams, and that he can also pull at the old heartstrings with songs like \\"New Beginning\\" and \\"The Way She Loved Me\\". I totally recommend this album to anybody who has good taste!NOW DAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' 'BOUT!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought he was good","review":"Many said he was really good. I was tempted to buy his CD but lucky enough to borrow mate's copy. Found a couple songs good, but overall, it's not really that good.

Maybe his voice doesn't suit me, though I like rock and country music a lot.Sorry, can't give more than 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too much","review":"Having read many good reviews on this album, I decided to buy it. Upon listening to it the first time I couldn't believe how bad Shannon is. Being under the impression that he was a runner-up, I thought he must be good. How wrong I was! This album is a joke and I can't help wondering how bad the rest of the idols could be! There's just nothing to enjoy in Shannon's voice.For those who wish to buy Shannon's album, try to listen a few songs first before you buy and see if you really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really excellent album","review":"There are so many beautiful and very emotional tracks on this album that would make excellent singles: Burn, Wise, New Beginnings, Tune In and Learn to Fly, not to mention The Way She Loved Me and The Way That I Feel. He has chosen beautiful tunes to include in his album.And his voice has tiny touches of Richard Marx and Bryan Adams and Australia's own giant, John Farnham, but is quite different from all of those and distinctive in his own right.I really recommend That's What I'm Talking About. This album is very addictive and once you start listening you just don't want to play anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"First of all, comparing Shannon with John Farnham and Jimmy Barnes is wrong. Shannon is a disgrace to many great Australian artists as he could only beg and complain.As far as singing and talent, Shannon has neither. I still don't understand how he could become runner-up, a position he does not deserver. I think it's the judges' fault that he was in the competition in the first place.\\"What About Me\\", while it is a good song, Shannon's version has been overplayed. The more you listen to it, the more you'll realise how bad he sounds. As the rest of the songs (Drive, Burn, etc), they are simply bad. They may sound good if sung by other singers, but definitely not by Shannon.Save your money and more importantly, save your ears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Rubbish","review":"This album is simply a waste of money. Many don't dare to say it is rubbish just because they are afraid to be called un-Australian.Shannon Noll can only perform one song well, and we all know what it is (What About Me). Other than that, he could do nothing but butchering others songs.Those who claim to have good sense of music must be either deaf or related to Shannon and probably sharing his part of royalty for this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype over substance","review":"A real victory for hype over substance. It shows how far Australia has gone in following the American path to the mediocre.If you want to listen to \\"What About Me?\\", then go no further than the original by Moving Pictures on their album \\"Days of Innocence\\". Don't bother with the insipid far less inspiring version on this album. Fortunately, I only heard this dross once and it was once too often.Leave alone or listen at your peril. Just truly awful. How about something original, Shannon?I'm just wondering if Steve from Melbourne who wrote a glowing review actually works for BMG? That one is a tad suss to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I'm not gonna waste my time writing comment on this Shannon Noll guy. He's simply terrible.

If this is the case, it should be considered a crime against nature. The video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. I've seen better subtitling on bargain-basement bootleg Chinese DVDs. If your only chance to see the film is in the Biswas DVD release, wait until you can catch a revival somewhere. This is terrible in the extreme, and hopefully, someday, someone will do something about it. The movie gets four stars; the DVD release, one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-see film!","review":"If any person should ever desire to see \\"a good foreign film\\", \\"Pather Panchali\\" is the one I would recommend. Though it was filmed in the '50's, it is ageless. As an English-speaking American who does not enjoy period films, I must say that this film completely transported me to the world of Durga and Apu, and I had no desire to come back..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Films ever made","review":"Pather Panchali stays with you forever. The film envelops you with every frame, and you find yourself responding viscerally to every display of emotion on the screen. The end leaves you breathless, aching, distraught - you want to cry but you're left with a strange sense of incomrehensible loss. In a world where tawdry emotions concerning love, life, and loss are on constant display by the numbingly bubble-gum media and hollywood, this film remains a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony DVD of Poor Quality","review":"This cinematic masterpiece has been brought out on DVD by \\"Sony Pictures Classics\\" and is, unfortunately, of poor quality. While I've not seen the \\"Criterion Collection\\" version being offered here, I certainly hope it's better than the Sony. What it looks like the latter has done is merely transfer the VHS version onto DVD without any digital enhancements. What a pity to do this to so fine a film. Yes, one can still get a feel for the work's quality, but it certainly doesn't help viewing a diffuse, aged print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea - Poor Quality","review":"I bought this in hopes of replacing one almost identical I bought from Walmart. The rabbit did not do what it was described to do. It was not able to jump. It tried to, but it didn't have enought power to lift itself. It was NOT the batteries, I replaced them numerous times in attempt to get it to work.It is pretty sad when a Walmart product held up and worked better than this. I was able to use the Walmart rabbit for 2 years and only because my daughter threw it down (she's 2), did it break."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE","review":"Many complain that this album was not what they expected. I for one have grown passed the stage where I expect the same thing from an artist every time. Having said that, know that this album is different from anything before it, just as \\"Empires\\" was different from \\"Praise the Fallen\\", and so forth. This album has VNV Nation's most inredible music ever. The lyrics are beautiful, haunting, and spiritual (in a good way). The sound will make you drool. From the harder-hitting tracks of \\"Epicentre\\" and \\"Genesis\\" to the incredibly beautiful \\"Airships\\" (a true masterpiece), this album never disappoints. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lyrics are very beautiful, they stand on their own-","review":"and Ronan sings them with verity.\\" The abyss becomes me, I wear this Chaos well Though none should save me, desperation keeps me here, my need for innocence, the place where I began.\\"I feel as though I am listening to a true friend sing in search for the beloved.Altho the lyrics are somewhat sombre, they are laid over an upbeat foundation..I recommend this CD along with Empires. (I havent heard Praise for the Fallen , yet)"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as \\"Empires\\"......another VNV smash","review":"I have to say that toping \\"Empires\\" has to be a big challenge for VNV but it seems like they have matched it. Many worried that this would be a dissapointing album (including myself), compared to the greatness of \\"Empires\\" but VNV proved some of us wrong. There are a few tracks on this album that are more dancable than the ones on \\"Empires\\" such as \\"Epicentre\\",\\"Genesis\\", \\"Fearless\\", and \\"Beloved\\". Those songs are the highlights of the album and will make you sweat on the dance floor. Wonderfully orchestrated electronic symphony with powerfull beats along with the emotionaly mezmorizong vocals hunts us throughout this album. Dont let me forget the mezmorizong sounds and vocals in \\"Holding on\\" and \\"Airships\\" that will leave us breathless.VNV Nation is EBM music at its finnest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have album","review":"This album displays the maturation in both style and technique that these brilliant artists are capable of. Unique, compelling beats laced with synthy melodies and a slightly dark edge help make this album one of my favorite synth-industrial albums of all time. But where this album truely stands apart from the crowd is the deep, mature lyrics of songs like Epicentre, Holding On, and especially Beloved. Ronin Harris' poetry is beautiful and poignant, and a pleasant change from talentless lyricists like Covenant (Dead stars still burn. WTF?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker","review":"Some people are fans and fair enough, but this is boring droll , uninspired........... as uninspired as this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most German goth","review":"I'm pretty new to these guys, figured I'd take some time to dig into German goth since goth is pretty well dead here in the US, by which I mean all the pioneers from the 70's or 80's are either gone, changed tracks, or sold out to that crappy early 90's House Tekno sound.These guys have a little of that crappy House sound that you would expect from about 99% of the so called German Goth bands now a days (and sadly now Skinny Puppy as well), but it also offers a lot of new an original beats which I can really sink my teeth into, also some of it does kind of tug at the ol' psych a bit, which is a good thing, but it is no where near as amazing as Skinny Puppy was in its glory days......everything pre-process, though the process was still \\"pretty good\\" for the most part."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's over.","review":"Before I violently bash this album, I will say that there are some slight similarities with Futureperfect to earlier music. A few tracks did manage to hold the intensity in the rhythm and harsh drumloops VNV once had when they did Praise The Fallen and parts of Empires. But saying that much is extreamly generous. The positive points of this album are scarce. My main beef with this album is what happened Ronan's vocals. I could have sworn I was listening to a rivet Rod Stewart. And some songs, particularly track 5, sound like a missing song from the Lost Boys soundtrack. I really don't like to say bad things about a band with as much potential as VNV, but I could have gotten a better sound urinating on a vinyl chair.For existing VNV fans don't even bother buying it used. For people new to VNV don't waste your money, this album will just give them a bad name. Get your moneys worth with Praise The Fallen and hear what this band really sounds like."},{"rating":"2","title":"VNV again delivers, but in a much differnt way","review":"Touted by many as a far more mainstreamed VNV Nation album, I was afraid of what I would find. I had fallen in love with their previous deliveries, and I couldn't imagine something more conventional coming from the VNV mouthpiece. Still, remembering that people call any artist's attempt to expand and explore \\"a step into the mainstream,\\" I went out and purchased the album. Happily, I was impressed by this latest attempt.Besides the sometimes redundant club mixes that seem to saturate the modern market, VNV also delivered a slower, more haunting side to themselves that seemed to be missing before. This seemed to expand the already expansive scope of VNV talent, highlighting the poetic lyrics and driven sounds as well. I would have to highly recommend this album, and would also have to advise people not to put too much stock in name-calling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!","review":"I bought this album on whim after I had heard one of the tracks in a cd store playing it on the stereo system. From the moment I heard his voice and the beats I had to have it. I think Ronan's voice is hauntingly beautiful and very captivating. I own music from all corners of the globe and this I have to say is one of my favorite albums, even my father likes this album and he is a classical guy .From start to finish the album is fantastic.So not only did I go out and buy the other albums from them I now await eagerly for their new album to be released this spring."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great album!","review":"The whole album is stellar, but my favorite hs to be Electronaut.

I seriously can't see it at all on my skin! It goes on velvety smooth and isn't greasy at all, and after a minute or two, it feels totally natural, with a soft matte finish. I don't even have to use powder on it to set it. My only complaint is that is very light and sheer, so it doesn't really cover up a lot of flaws (I have freckles around my mouth that it doesn't cover), but it works fine with a little concealer. I haven't noticed much in the way of line reduction at all,either, I'm sorry to say.

They either had too much orange or too much red. I had swore them off. So, when I tried my mom's Beyond Color Mousse foundation in Ivory I was amazed! Perfect blending and flawless looking skin was the effect I was left with!This is even better than Estee Lauder's Ideal Matte foundation, which I used to like for my summer foundation. I have combination skin which is oily in the T-zone and tends to get dry around my lower cheeks, chin and forehead; this foundation works great for my skin type. I hope that Avon in all its infinite wisdom doesn't discontinue this foundation. I am going to stock up on it. Finally, a hit for Avon in the foundation market!NOTE: I've found that for this foundation to work as well as it can, you need to have smooth moisturized skin. If you have any dry patches it will highlight them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this foundation","review":"I purchased this makeup based on the rave review of my avon sales rep, who was also using it, however, I was dissapointed was everything about this makeup. The consistency is very thick, but, once applied, it is very sheer. I have oily skin with some breakouts and redness, and I found that I had to really pile it on to get the coverage I needed. Once applied, it was very hard to blend, and after about 10 minutes of blending, it still looked cakey and uneven. I purchased the color \\"cream\\", which appeared to be the right shade, however, on my face it went orange, with a greyish cast, and looked awful. All things considered, I think that this foundation is better suited to someone who doesn't have any type of issue or concern with their skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wondering?","review":"This addition has some good information but not very many worked problems.

The Billy Preston number is still a favorite as is the specially written Harrison song \\"Bangla Desh\\" where Klaus Voorman tears it up on that electric bass. Dylan's set is compelling throughout, and the extra track (\\"Love Minus Zero\\") is another treat. Also thought Harrison's \\"Wah Wah\\" and \\"My Sweet Lord\\" sounded better than before.

Stick with French and Sanders, A League of Gentlemen, and AbFaf, but skip this one. But how can you? You have to see it to believe how bad it is, it's not even \\"it's so bad, it's good.\\" They should have been more original and they should stop stooping low for the laughs. A disappoitment. Hope the series gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Friends\\" . . . .","review":"As a admitted fan of \\"Seinfeld\\" and (sometimes) \\"Sex and the City,\\" I was a little apprehensive about this series when I first saw it on my local PBS station. I initially felt that this was a bootleg attempt at what many times we as an American audience have borne witness to . . . a trans-Atlantic version of a successful sitcom from the home country.But over a period of watching the show, I was pleased with the wittiness of the dialogue and the chemsitry between the characters. So yes, this may borrow some elements from successful American shows (like the ones I mentioned above), but it has a uniqueness all its own.P.S. I read that they will attempt to make an American version of \\"Coupling\\" in 2003. My advice: leave it alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is just not funny!","review":"It was a long time since I have watched British sitcom. I heard about this show and decided to give it a try. I couldn't finish it: I switch it off in the middle of the fourth episode. There are a few laughs there but to get to those laughs you have to sit through totally boring stuff. Plus the acting is so bad, so wooden... I give it two stars just for those very few laughs I mentioned"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I discovered \\"Coupling\\" on BBC America and was immediately hooked! It's smart, quick and funny! And there's an occasional dose of mild nudity to spice things up. What more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The original is still the best.","review":"Right down to the theme song, the U.S. version is a carbon copy of the UK version of this show. The only real difference being that the original is far superior.It would be easy to call NBC's version a rip-off, but the scripts are the same and the producers are the same. It's just that NBC doesn't think you'll \\"get it\\" if it has a British accent. Oh, and you'd have to substitute the occasional \\"President\\" for \\"Prime Minister.\\"Unfortunately, they've been a bit short-sighted here. Our seasons are longer (22-24 episodes). The British first season is all of six episodes. NBC is going to run out of scripts to recycle very soon.Save yourself the trouble on Thursday nights. Turn the TV off after \\"Scrubs\\" and pop-in this DVD for some fun comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Friends","review":"I read someone's review that said \\"Friends\\" was superior to \\"Coupling\\". That person obviously does not know good television when they see it. Either that, or they're just brain-dead. Besides, the only way to know when to laugh when watching \\"Friends\\" is when the laugh-track comes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Friends - not even close....","review":"How could anyone compare this show to such a lame formulaic American sitcom as Friends? Every episode I have seen has had me laughing so hard I've wet myself more than once. There is a reason why British comedies are usually limited to 6 episodes a season - they do not try to stretch out their good material over 22 or more episodes - they are pure undiluted brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny - if only there were more like this","review":"We had been taping this show since the beginning and are very happy that it is now on DVD.All I can say, as an addition to the reviews already posted by others, is:GET THIS. You'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very smart AND very funny!","review":"While many people view this series as sort of a \\"Friends\\" knockoff, it really isn't. There are similarities, but the humor isn't as forced, and it is also more sophisticated on one hand, but more low-brow on the other hand. The result is a wonderful British comedy, that hits any 30-something who's been single or dating quite close to home. The characters don't get more fully fleshed out until the second and third seasons (which probably won't be out on DVD for another few years), but the writing is top-notch and the humor will not only cause giggles of amusement, but also full-out belly laughs. This is one of the smartest and funniest shows on TV today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Laughing after the third episode","review":"If you've missed this series, you've missed a gem indeed. Never mind the awkward US 'equivalents' of this baby. 'Sex in the City,\\" \\"Friends,\\" forget them. This is real, irreverant, truly funny stuff. I love the ease and subtlety that this series really addresses potentially horrific material with such style. I'm still giggling after watching the third episode in this series. Totally irreverant and tasteless in such a tasteful way. Think \\"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex\\" as narrated by Mr. Rogers after a stiff drink. Twisted, clever, and dirty in the same fell swoop. Easily 5 stars, 6 if it went that high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Show - Beware Though!","review":"Easily one of my favourite shows of all time. The only reason it did not get five stars is that Amazon for some dumb reason decided to only alter it as full screen instead of the wide screen it was filmed in. BOO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BBC does it best!","review":"\\"Coupling\\" is the UK's answer to \\"Friends\\" -- and, as usually is the case with BBC productions, it's far and away a better act. The ensemble is hilarious. \\"Friends\\" had its funniest season in its debut season, in my opinion, and \\"Coupling\\" well surpassed all \\"Friends\\" humor in this debut DVD.Sure, \\"Coupling\\" suffers from the same problem that \\"Friends\\" does: How come none of these people seem to have friends who are not white? (At least \\"Coupling\\" contains an openly bisexual woman, whereas Ross' lesbian ex-wife completely vanished from \\"Friends\\"). While that complaint is valid, the show remains bust-a-gut funny.The \\"Giggle Loop\\" has to become Seinfeld-esque reference to anyone whose ever found the urge to break out laughing at markedly inopportune moments. And I'd love to see what else is in the Cupboard of Patrick's Love!It's shows like this that make me want to move to the UK, or at least pony up the extra money to get BBC America on my cable system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funnier than \\"Friends\\"","review":"This comedy blows \\"Friends\\" out of the water. I don't even like to refer to it as the \\"British Friends\\" because this show is in a class by itself.

No musician credits are given, only the producers; John Darnall and V. Keith Mason. A good indication that studio musicians were used, rather than an established ensemble. Nothing here to make you jump up and say WOW!, but all pieces are handled well and there are several songs you won't find on every other Christmas album in your collection. Worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"this is a lousy compilation of symptoms and sorry directions to assist with explaining what drugs work in treating what illness.

Stainless steel is of poor quality and rusts very quickly when exposed to residue from wet soapy implements such as sponges, dish scrubbers, etc. It can be cleaned with a brillo pad and scouring powder but is a pain and rust returns quickly in a short time of use. I would not recommend this item because it becomes very unsightly quickly. Additionally, its dimensions do not lend themselves to an unobtrusive mounting on many sinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functional at best","review":"Purchased this to match the stainless steel sink in out kitchen. It has a rubberized bottom to prevent it from sliding around and it does match well. However, that is where the praise ends.

We both read it indiviually and both had the same reaction: It is written in a very biased way. The authors portray the Christian religion as superficial. Case studies are used throughout to make their point- you must choose Judaism if your children are to grow up with a firm sense of self and belonging. (Christianity as the chosen religion does not seem to be an option with the authors). I do not recommend this book and neither would my husband. We threw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good if you agree with it","review":"While this book does a good job of pointing out the conflicts/issues/problems that interfaith couples will face when raising children, I found it definitely biased toward choosing one religion in the home, and making that religion Judaism.

The versions of B.T.S and M.T.K on the greatest hits (from Atco) sound 100x's better, but it was remastered at a latter date, I think. This sounds terrible. There is too much reverb, the vocals are fuzzy, the band is too loud, and it just overall sounds like a cheap bootleg...Having said that, until the record industry supports great music over profit, this is what we'll have to deal with. Still, pick this up...This is REAL MUSIC, folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some nice selections","review":"As some other reviewers have mentioned, the sound quality is not always the best, but there are some fine selections on this disc.

The big band back-up arrangements are tasty, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Touch This CD!","review":"I suppose I should have known better! You only get what you pay for, so what can you expect for $1.99. Obviously produced from vinyl, there is a major glitch in \\"Mack The Knife\\", with vinyl crackles throughout the rest of the album, even though some form of noise reduction has been utilised. The Pickwick company has been churning out poor quality re-issues for donkeys' years, and if I'd known it was one of theirs I wouldn't have touched it with a barge pole! BE WARNED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thats NOT ALL","review":"A fantastic selection of songs on this one.

I first heard their music when watching the anime series \\"Bleach\\". The hardest J-pop music I've heard so far, they have vocals similar to Evanescence with music similar to Stabbing Westward and other rock bands. If you like \\"Ichirin no Hanna\\" (one of the theme songs from Bleach) you'll love this cd. A little rap can't even mar this solid hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I wanna love you forever is one of the best songs that has been out this season. It has deep emotions and reality to it. I don't understand why anyone would not like this song. It is also very relaxing to listen to it, it makes you really think. If you have someone in your life who you love or really care about then you would definately love this song. And yes the other individual does have a say to whether she can love him forever or not. Of course he does. When you love a person, you love them because of who he/she is and how they treat you and how they make you feel. Now if they stop making you feel this way then the love fades but if this person wants you to love him/her forever believe me they will make you feel this way forever so that you will love him/her forever.

This is excessive even for her.\\" I think that kind of sums it up. Jessica Simpson has a decent voice, but she sounds like Mariah Carey's apprentice (even the lyrics are Carey-esque) instead of developing her own style. While the beginning of the song isn't bad (and the only reason this got 2 stars), when the song reaches it's climax, a point at which she's obviously trying to show off her vocal prowess, she sounds more like she's shouting at her lover than praising him. It's reminiscent of campy 80's love songs. She's aiming for the new age \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\", but ended up with an overdone song that could have been decent if she'd just relax and didn't try so hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah Carey Wanna-Be!","review":"Yuck!

As if the boy she is talking to has any say in whether or not she's allowed to love him forever. She can love anyone forever if she wants to. But why anyone would love her back is beyond me. I'm thinking of suing the label for producing what they call \\"music.\\" I call it pure garbage. Put it in the garbage disposal. Buy Eiffel 65's \\"Europop\\" instead. Oh. I lied.

I know that Spice Girls were bad, but at least they don't what to make you chop your ears off. They must have paid Jessica millions to sing this horrible song, and then embarass herself by letting everyone know that she sung it. And I thought that Lenny Craviz' American Woman was bad.

I have the \\"LP\\" that my folks used to have and haven't listened to it for a while but could listen to it over and over and over. I have never gotten tired of it.

I have a two-and-a-half year old daughter who I have been trying to potty-train since 2 yrs, and it has been tough going, until recently. I found this book in my local library and it has been well worth my reading time.It is written in an easy to read manner, there are plenty of real-life experiences that readers can relate to, and covers the essentials of potty training - how to gauge whether your child is ready, comparison between past practices and present, beginning training, what steps can be taken if the going gets difficult or doesn't take off as expected, overcoming power struggles, night training, bed wetting, and other tips that help parents in making the potty training experience more tolerable, and even a great learning experience. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Although there were parts of this book that I found useful, I found the overall tone to be a bit too hardline. My son has just turned 2 and is showing a lot of interest in potty training (he spends part of the week with a trained 3 yr old) but I don't think he's ready to go into underpants which is the only way forward in this book. I much prefer Keys to Toilet Training by Meg Zweiback - it takes a slower, more relaxed approach while still dealing with all the possible issues. It's based on the work of T. Berry Brazelton so if anyone really liked his book Touchpoints, which I found incredibly useful the first year, then they'll probably prefer Ms Zeiback's approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look no further ...","review":"I read a couple of other potty training books that were sort of chirpy and didn't address the nitty gritty of it. I've got twin girls to train and after two really frustrating earlier attempts, wanted just one last go at it. Author writes in a chatty but concise manner. Sort of like sitting down over coffee with an old friend from Brooklyn. Blunt, to the point and productive. Because she keeps it brief, it was great to give to DH and say \\"here, dear, read this please, it isn't the same as paper training the poodle.\\" He actually got a few chapters ahead of me and has referenced the book a few times.Summary: don't piffle around with all the other books out there.

Instead, it was flooded with stories of parents who had horrible parenting practices, (such as scolding, shaming, and spanking their children into submitting to potty training.) One story even depicted a family that physically tied their child to the toilet!!! Granted, these examples were given to show what NOT to do, but I personally would never think of treating my child like that, anyway. Although it did emphasize the importance of social rewards, (\\"good job\\"), it could have left out the detailed section showing me how some parents give toys or lolipops when their child poops in the toilet! I was searching for a potty training book that had more concrete information, and one that assumed that I was already treating my child with utmost love and respect. Anyone have any suggestions???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - ponderous performance, dull sound.","review":"I must caution readers against the previous misleading review. Only the scherzo is brisk in the Furtw?ngler tempo. The 3 big movements are all slower than Jochum's later recordings (except the final 1986 Concergebouw) and slower still than Furtw?ngler, with which it scarcely bears comparison. In this '35 version Jochum whips up the last 1 minutes of the first movement in the way Furtw?ngler did, but the previous twenty are comparatively stodgy. The sound doesn't help matters as the dull, slightly muffled quality robs the music of much textural detail.The best representatives of Jochum in this work are the 1958 DG Bavarian RO and the 1964 Philips Concertgebouw recordings. This issue is for \\"completists\\" and Jochum fans only !"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"My daughter and I love this swimsuit set.

A lot of the rock compilations come off really well, even from people I hate(Jenkins, Durst).

At one time Run DMC had a sound that nobody could replicate, now they are selling out to mainstream with poorly written lyrics, recycled rock/rap beats, and AWFUL guest appearences. Once, Run DMC revived burn out rock acts like Aerosmith. Now instead of doing what they do best, they are getting Kid Rock, Fred Durst, etc. in hopes to revive their music. Also, DMC didn't show up to the studio. I grew up with this band and can probably recite every lyric on each album, but this album is weak.

Run without D.M.C. is kind of like Jordan without Pippen, they need each other to reach their fullest potential. You can throw in as many guest artists as you want, but none of them will ever be equal to D.M.C.Overall, I think this is a good album, probably equal to their 1993 release \\"Down with the King.\\" The presence of Kid Rock (who I think basically fills in for D.M.C. in \\"The School of Old\\") and Everlast add to the album.

To call this a RUN-DMC album with DMC barely being on it at all is ludicrous. I always preferred DMC anyway.

If you saw the halftime show at the NFL AFC Title game you also would have noticed that DMC was not there. It would have made it a better album if he had joined in.Not much Classic Jam Master Jay. Too many looped tracks and not enough fresh scratchin'. Interesting take of Steve Millers Take the Money and Run. Title Track Rocks. Fred Durst, Kid Rock and Sugar Ray seem a bit out of place.The Jams are fresh and true to todays Hip-Hop.

Rather than make the songs sound like rapping over rock (see Shame by Wu-Tang and System of a Down off of Loud Rocks!) or rocking to a rap (Puff Daddy's rock remix of The Benjamins), you get a rapping over a mush of rock-like sounds (see also, Puff Daddy's rock remix of PE 2000).

The key track here would have to be Ice Cube & Oakenfold's 'Right Here, Right Now' which is the finest track on the album, flowing perfectly. Other standouts include the Mos Def & Massive Attack fused 'I Against I' and 'PHDream' by Bubba Sparxxx & The Crystal Method. The few tracks I spoke of that fall flat are Eve & Fatboy Slim's version of 'Cowboy' which is much worse than Eve's album version, and even that version is mediocre at best...and there's Redman & Gorillaz song 'Gorillaz on my Mind' which is just plain annoying.

I will say, though, that this is wonderful, rythmic swing, just like the music he made with his boss for so many years, Duke Ellington. Don't hesitate to buy this disk.Most of the music is Cootie using his trademark plunger mute; you'll swear he's actually talking with it. Great large band support from the usual late fifties Ellingtonians, except Duke; he sits out on this set.This is one of a series of cd reissues of the RCA Victor jazz catalog. Although a fairly minor catalog, I'd say these recordings (Paul Gonsalves, Joe Williams, Johnny Hodges, Al Cohn, etc.) by RCA are some of the finest swinging jazz from the fifties and sixties you'll find, as well as being some of the best sounding I've heard. Remastered with 24 bit technology, the sonics and sense of space is near perfect. Why can't new recordings sound this golden?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to be trusted","review":"All I have to say is that any film, or product for that matter, that uses the Coultergeist (Ann Coulter) as on of their sources cannot be trusted.

Those who have not even taken the time to view Fahrenheit 9/11 have no rights to comment upon it. The words out of Dubbya's own mouth are the most telling parts of Fahrenheit 9/11, and personal attacks upon Michael Moore can do nothing to discount Dubbya's own words. Dubbya quote (video footage from Fahrenheit 9/11): \\"here we have in this room the have and the have mores - most people call you the elite - I call you my base.\\" This was Dubbya speaking in a room among the wealthiest people in America. By the way, he is one of them (in case you weren't aware because he plays up the down home country appeal).

It argues that Moore's film takes great liberty with truth or otherwise, completely mistates the truth. Regardless of your belief, the movie certainly counters the most significant points of Moore's film. In the end, i concluded that Moore's film is a well crafted hit piece on Bush and this is a decent(but could be better) reply.

At least Michael Moore brings some evidence to his arguments. Here Fahrenhype brings opinions supported by... other opinions... It is disorganized propaganda at best, unconvincing because they do not support their arguments with facts. Pressed about the lack of WMD in Iraq, former Mayor Ed Koch claims that he would have supported the war even if he had known that there was no WMD, but why is not clear. Because Sadam Hussein was a bad boy? In which case we should be waging war in 30 countries just now! The most compelling arguments in this movie are from individuals who were portrayed in a light contrary to their wishes in Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. Granted.

It's for good reason that the filmmakers carefully steered clear of the whole WMD fiasco to site one example.Like Fox News it relies heavily on doublespeak and opinion rather than facts and solid journalism to make its case. This is the modus operandi of the conservative media in dealing with unpopular truths. Questioning one's patriotism always seems a good way to gain support for something or other. In FahrenHYPE 9/11 everyone from Ed Koch to ex-Clinton mucky-muck Dick Morris try their hardest to paint Moore as a big, fat, wealthy opportunist who also happens to be an anti-American in defacto"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"I must admit that there is going to be propaganda generated by the left as well as the right.

Whether or not you are a fan of Moore, you should see this expose on how he operates, and know one thing for sure: 'Farenheit 911' is not journalism.'FarenHYPE 911' is a much better film with a much better set of experts, such as Dick Morris, Ed Koch, and others, and much better arguments. Every issue is put into context and every trick used in 'Farenheit 911' is exposed to the light of day and logically examined.

It mostly talked about the film techniques Moore used, such as changing the relative size of newspaper headlines and showing parts of interviews (and as I have studied documentaries a lot, it is a simple truth that both sides of the aisle use these techniques. all documentaries are biased in some way). They don't really go after his argument at all, which would have been the only common-sense thing to do.

I've now watched both Moore's video and this response to it. I came to the conclusion that Michael Moore is a big dumb animal! He seems to hate America. This video clearly shows how deceitful he really is. The most moving part was watching the wounded soldier discuss how upset he was that Moore exploited his injury to make Bush look bad. Everyone should see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"I just saw this movie, which I received as a gift. It was a decent attempt at countering the claims made by Moore in Fahrenheit 9/11. Unfortunately, many arguments were presented using the same tactics Moore is attacked for using; juxtaposition, stating facts without source, etc. In fact, at times I did not know what was being argued because the scene was busy interviewing a grieving mother or soldier (appeal to emotion). This movie is basically the same movie as Fahrenheit without the big budget and expressing polar opposite views. A good watch for viewers interested in politics and/or modern propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please.....","review":"I was surprised at how grating and boring this DVD is.

It's lasted a long time. The hard case has enough room for extra mantels and a box of matches.Cons: The instastart is useless, but it still has match holes so keep a book in the hard case. The threads connecting to the propane tank aren't very good. It's easy to get cross threaded and they are soft so if you aren't careful you can ruin them. When it starts to thread, you have to stop and double check everything to make sure it's going on strait.Conclusion: It has some issues forcing you to be careful with it and pack matches with you.

Fortunately, my son showed up with one in the trunk of his car that was same as this model. He saved the day! We were able to cook at night, and function in our campsite, all because of this light. Anything with less brightness just doesn't cut it when you are camping. Of course, upon arriving home, I place my Amazon order for one! Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Lantern...EVER!","review":"After almost three years use, I LOVE this lantern. I've been camping my entire life and have never had a better one. In fact, I purchased many extra mantles because I know how often they need replacing and I always like to be prepared. To my surprise, the tube mantle is so durable I've only replaced it once in 3 yrs! It starts right up with a twist and click of the knob, and I love how you can adjust the brightness as well. It is super-bright when it is wide open. You can't go wrong with this lantern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Long Term Owner","review":"I've had one of these for about ten years. It always lights on the first strike and is very bright, enough so that it will hold even the peskiest of racoons at bay. I've found it to be very frugal on the propane gas as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design and quality control","review":"The quality control on this lantern is extremely poor. The piezoelectric starter produces a usable spark perhaps one out of seven pushes, making lighting this an exercise in frustration. I ended up lighting it with a match the first time and getting a sore thumb on subsequent attempts to start it with the push button. The threaded coupling is cocked at an angle, leaving the lantern leaning on an otherwise perfectly straight propane cylinder. The regulator knob has a very sloppy feel and a finite number of poorly placed levels rather than the smooth, continuous settings on my 10 year old Coleman dual mantle lantern. Last but not least, the regulation of the gas flow is very poor at the higher settings, producing a sputtering sound and an annoying, flickering light. This lantern uses a single, accordion shaped mantle that will require you to stock spares specific to that lantern. Avoid this product and stick with the older design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lantern, Could Be Better","review":"I know lanterns and this is a good lantern, though it could be better. Light is great and there is plenty of it. Single mantle is an improvement. Gas attachment needs to be something other than aluminum as you can cross thread it easily.

Shipping was reasonable but a damaged item despite a hard case is unacceptable!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and very dangerous","review":"Based on the other \\"glowing\\" reviews of this product, maybe I got a bad one. Three major problems:- The Instastart ignition works only about 1 in 20 times. By the time it decides to work, the globe is full of propane, and the lantern explodes when it ignites.- The lantern makes an *extremely* loud humming noise when on low, like a musical instrument. When turned up, the humming stops, and the (expected) hissing sound can be heard.- The knob to control the propane flow is far too flimsy and loose for a product that uses an inflammable substance. It spins around freely like a roulette wheel. This is a serious design flaw.The way I received it, this product is *extremely dangerous*. I expect more from Coleman. I returned for a refund.YMMV."},{"rating":"2","title":"First NorthStar lantern I've owned","review":"First, I like the NorthStar type lantern better than the old style bowl mantles. There is a larger surface area to burn and hence more light. This lantern works great and the self ignitor worked through a weekend camping trip without a hiccup. The only reason I only gave 4 stars vs. 5 is that the mantle seems like it is burning through faster than I would have liked after only a weekend worth of use. It's not ready to be replaced yet but the holes I'm seeing are more than I would have thought. Maybe this is a trade-off for the better lighting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the headache!!","review":"I purchased this lantern and promptly returned it. The \\"instastart\\" never started it and the mantle failed immediately. I would stick with the lantern type that has a hanging mantle rather than one that connects at top and bottom.

For suposedly being one of Colemans better lanterns the quality is poor. The top cover was marred badly and rusty. Instant start is a joke.

Even though the production is good, 'Zones' simply just doesn't make the grade. As for the tunes, I thought \\"Running Through The Back Brain\\", \\"Utopia 84\\" and the remake of \\"Sonic Attack\\" were the only cuts that make this CD even worth keeping.

This is one of their more obscure albums, basically for Hawkwind fanatics only, but worth it if you're already a fan.

If they kept it as the original in the Japanese with English subtitles and put in the episodes they take out for the north american series they would probably make more money.

I'll start with a gratuitous scene in which Holmes takes cocaine while cogitating on a case - a nauseating scene which completely violates the Holmes canon. Holmes never used cocaine while working on a case (he only resorted to it from boredom), and the original Baskervilles story does not contain the word \\"cocaine\\" anywhere in it (check Project Gutenberg's electronic text files). The scene was utterly unnecessary and jarring.The snide, sneering Holmes portrayal completely misses the mark. Holmes could be contemptuous, it's true, but he could also be a genuine gentleman, which this characterization completely overlooks.I can't go on.... I don't want to think about this travesty any longer. If you liked the book, get the Granada version with Jeremy Brett instead of this ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"I gave this one star not because it was bad, but because it was not viewable.

It would not run on our DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I watched it","review":"This is an unsatifying version of Hound. First, Richard Roxburgh is a fine actor but he's no Sherlock Holmes. His version of the great detective is a cold man who doesn't really care about Sir Henry at all. He's only in it for the thrill of the chase and almost gets the baronet killed. Watson's portrayal wasn't bad. The \\"real\\" Dr. Watson of the books was no fool but the chemistry between the actors just wasn't there. The Watson of this movie found Holmes to be a maddening companion.The villain was quite good but the hound was a terrible mistake. They should've used a real animal. This computer animated creature looked like it cost five dollars to create it.Bottom line: rent this movie or catch on PBS. Don't waste your money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Jeremy Britt when you need him?","review":"It's probably unfair for me to review this \\"mess\\" since I'm an avid Sherlock Holmes fan. Any resemblence to this production and the story is purely accidental.Aside from a \\"strawberry blonde\\" Sherlock Holmes and a chinless Watson, the screenwriter took so many liberties with the original story that I was beginning to wonder if I had tuned in to the correct program. Seldon being chased across the moor by two cops who were then dragged under by quicksand, and Holmes injecting cocaine were not in the story. And these events occurred during the first 15 minutes! The production went downhill from there.If you want to see the best film or tv version of Holmes ever made, pick up a copy of any of the Jeremy Britt episodes. And if you want to see how \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" should really be filmed, the Jeremy Britt version is the very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"Being a devoted Jeremy Brett fan I was prepared to dislike this version of the famous story; imagine my surprise when I found myself enjoying the movie and finding it held my interest.This was the first time I had watched this version so I had no basis for comparison with the original BBC production. The fact of the matter was this version as presented here did a grand job of involving me and holding my attention all the way to the end.Both Richard Roxburgh as Holmes and Ian Hart as Watson bring conviction to their roles and provide characters with depth and interest. Richard Grant is suitably evil to successfully negotiate the role of Jack Stapleton so the three key roles are properly anchored.This one is definitely worth seeing; we found it to be worth our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Fortunately I saw this on PBS before buying the DVD. I would only consider this DVD if you are NOT a Holmes fan. It is such a departure from the book that really only the hound makes it recognizable. Gone is the opening deductions about the walking stick...Dr Mortimer now has a wife who holds a seance to talk to the dead Sir Charles...gone is the telegram to Barrymore. Mr Franklin is gone and Laura Lyons (which leaves unexplained why Sir Charles was in the Yew Alley that night). Added are fight scenes between Holmes and the cabby as well as one with Selden. This production clearly takes great liberties in its quest to put some sensation and action into the story. For me it is too great a departure. I'll wait for the Brett DVD due out later this month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Above all keep away from the moor.......and this DVD","review":"I admit I am only an average Sherlock Holmes fan, even though I am in the process of replacing the entire Jeremy Brett Granada/PBS series on DVD. However, I watched this on Masterpiece Theatre last night, and going to sleep I was EXTREMELY grateful I had a paid day off from work today. I would not have been well enough to go in. I have never seen a such a poor relationship between Holmes and Watson, or such an UGLY hound (the 12 minute follow up tells us it was computer generated, not a real dog). Granted if you read the book, or see other tv or big screen version of this, you learn this is more than just a mystery. But to me this version was nothing more than an intense horror film. Also where was Laura Lyons in this version of the story? If your PBS or BBC station reruns it before my message is posted, IGNORE IT, don't tape it, don't by the disc.

They did play in my Macintosh computer. This is the only DVD out of several hundred that refuses to play on the Onkyo.This version of the story can best be described as \\"drive in movie.\\" There are numerous graphic scenes of gore, violence, and slow deaths. The original detective story has been transformed into a horror story with the usual tricks to frighten the viewer.

This isn't the worst but it's certainly the sleaziest, since it takes Ernest Pascal's screenplay for the 1939 version and merely \\"updates\\" it with dreadful dialogue. Fresh? Thrilling? Fuhgeddaboutit. Richard Roxburgh is a dull, unconvincing Holmes, and Ian Hart is a laughably bad Dr. Watson -- he plays him \\"tough,\\" but like George W.

By the time the Hound, a CGI relative of Scooby Doo, shows up, you'll be lunging for the remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting new version of familiar story","review":"I quite liked it, actually.

However, the BBC Video (company) version I purchased which is 100 minutes in length had been edited so much that there were entire scenes missing right from the begining!

The acting is perfect: what a pleasure tosee a different\\"take\\" on the characters of Holmes and Watson. Splendid job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I've been a die-hard Sherlock Holmes fan for a long time, and I have to admit when I first heard about this version I was quite skeptical. However, upon actually watching this movie, I was thrilled! Richard Roxburgh gave an excellent performance as Holmes, and Ian Hart was equally wonderful as Watson. Granted, the story did vary slightly from Doyle's original, but even if you all ready know the original story it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of watching it. I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfaithful and miscast version.","review":"This is quite the worst \\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" I have seen. It is nothing new to deviate from the Conan-Doyle story and although this doesn't do so often, it does it in pointless and unnecessary ways. The worst feature, however, is the miscasting of Holmes, who is so wooden he hardly registers at all, and Watson who is completely alien to Conan-Doyle's creation and dominates throughout as if he was the main character.If this is an attempt to de-construct the Holmes story you can keep it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing new approach to the tale","review":"I found this version of 'Hound' to be superior to any other I have seen. My wife, an avid reader of Holmes stories, agrees it's the best screen adaptation she's seen, presenting Holmes and Watson more as Doyle wrote them rather than emulating the way they are usually portrayed on film. Watch with an open mind, and try to forget the deerstalker hat & magnifing glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of the Baskervilles","review":"That Roxburgh is unsuited to portray Holmes is uncomfortably obvious. He adds none of Holmes's charming eccentricities, struggles to voice the part, and hardly looks it either, especially when next to Grant, who himself would've been better at it. Hart and Nettles are physically unsuited for their roles as well. Add to a poorly cast lot a script that goes too far afield from the novel. Holmes's use of cocaine is overstated here, and his relationship with Watson is made to be one of the barest tolerance, rather than the one of enduring friendship and admiration Doyle created. The scenes that didn't appear in the novel at all border on silliness, contributing nothing. I can't see this film being of any value to an avid Sherlockian. Grant's performance is its only commendable feature, earning it two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I got this after watching the movie, which contained some beautiful songs.

Sniffing is a big part of the pleasure of this gentle tea. This is great for folks who want the pleasurable experience of teabags--they are beautiful, pyramidal mesh bags, no string, but feel \\"high class\\"--rather than using loose leaves.If you hate strong tasting or overly complex tea flavor combos, this is a great one to try.

When I went home, I went straight down stairs and played it. It was like I was visualizing the entire movie again. Some of the tracks sound the same, but if you notice closely, you'll see that they are different. The ending song that has lyrics in it was dubbed in English, but I was surprised that the Tatara Work Women song was in the original Japanese. When I saw the movie again, I noticed that the song they sand was in English. Oh well. The dubbed song didnt dissapoint me anyway. And the second track on the CD is my personal favorite which feature tension, chase music. So is this music easy-listening or tense. Lets just say its for people who like hearing orcestral music.

Just a few weeks ago I bought the soundtrack proper, and I'm still impressed. I am a bit disappointed that they left out track 20, the longer vocal of the theme song, and that they felt the need to translate the ending theme, but even that doesn't take away from the soundtrack as a whole.

My conclusion is that the magic that went into making this movie - and its soundtrack - resulted from an astonishing chemistry of creative people influencing each other in amazing ways. Alone, Hisaishi is a tunesmith of pleasing pop and not much more. Here, he is a tried-and-true composer. This is his great masterpiece.

It seems that the Princess Mononoke theme song was dubbed in English - by a woman? The original Japanese song is very beautiful and I doubt anyone else could do it justice.

At first i thought it was a battery problem, so i bought several different packs of rechargable batteries, as well as a slew of lithium ones. The problem was annoying at first, but after awhile it came to the point where it would no longer turn on.Frustrated, i exchanged the camera for a new one. Yet again, after only a month of use, the same problem occurred.

After 2 years, other than just an increase in MP, overall image quality has not gotten any better! We went to Japan and my wife bought a Ricoh R4 for nearly $450 and after comparing photos, my 7530 was still better.After doing more research and comparing photos of the new Canons (SD600, 700, 800), Casios and other Kodaks, there aren't any new compact models that is convincing me. I don't want a Sony or Fuji due to their proprietary memory cards, and the Nikon compacts are not rated very well.For now, I've decided to keep my 7530 with the cracked LCD and all because in the end, image quality beats all those bells and whistles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't like cold weather!","review":"I bought this, my first digital camera, to document the building of my new house.

For a while after that it still worked okay indoors, but eventually I had the problem regardless of the temperature. Occasionally if I kept turning it on I won the battle and it would stay on and take a reasonably good picture, but the next time I wanted to use it I would have to go through the same hassle.

This is his story, written painstakingly by blinking on the appropriate letter as the alphabet was presented to him The author portrays the mental toughness to cope with his condition on his \\"down\\" days, The diving bell is the symbol when his condition weighed heavily upon him, such as when his kids visit him and he is unable to give the slightest response, save his left eye. The butterfly is the symbol of his mind as it is free to escape. The author is generally upbeat, his mind trying to overcome his condition. His virtual trips, virtual gourmet Christmas dinners that he visualizes, ignoring the feeding tube thst is actually feeding him. A total thought provoking book. 132 pages that cannot leave a reader untouched.

They remove tons of tar from the smoke and are good for 5 to 10 cigarettes each before disposal. They are longer than the little cheap clear things you find at flea markets. Those little ones just fall off and get lost rolling around on the floor or in my purse. These are attractive, I leave them lying all around in my car and my home to remind me to use them. I also tuck them into my cigarette case. Because they are longer, they are easier to get out of the pack without smashing the smokes in the process. Also, for those that roll their own or smoke Camel Wides, it is a good snug fit (takes a tiny bit of effort to get it on)unlike the little cheapie ones that do NOT fit the wider filters, they just smash them and are too hard to use so they sit there untouched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"My husband and I haven't used them for long but so far we like them. I really like how I can see the tar that is caught, the first thing I said when I seen it was that it makes you want to quit smoking. I smoke different brands of menthols, right now I'm smoking Camel Crush (crushed) and that's all I've used in the Filters so far. The fact that Camel Crush is already a light cigarette makes it where I need to smoke some of the cigarette without the disposable filter or I'm going back for another one too quickly. I'm sure the other menthols I smoke won't be like that but I won't know until I try it. My Cigarette fits perfectly into the filter, not too tight or too loose.

Professor Gordon had wide experience in many fields and this shows... even people with no mathematical knowledge can read with profit... especially interesting is the section on how accidents happen, sometimes when a person with insufficient technical knowledge tries to \\"strengthen\\" a structure and ends up by weakening it.

It wasn't until I received it that I found out it was unauthorized (although whoever made it couldn't even spell \\"unauthorized\\" correctly on the cover!!) I couldn't even make it through the whole thing because it mainly focused on 1 wanna be blow hard who acted like he knew Dave and could speak for him when he was probably just a Dave stalker when he lived in DC.

Poppa is his usuall bombastic self throughout. The song selection is different here. Quite a change from the Ohne Filter DVD by him. Popa Chubby is a very acomplished Blues Rocker. He really has a lot of attitude in his playing and singing. I could do without the political anti Bush screed he goes into in the other section of the DVD,but that's me.

The music section of the DVD I really enjoyed the bonus extra I could do without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ormandy commands this Carmina Burana","review":"I have listened to so many versions of Carmina Burana and I have two different ones that I now own. I've come to the assumption that you can not find a definitve version of Carmina Burana. If only you could combine elements from all of your favorite versions of this most infamous piece. Oh well, with Ormandy's version I can say that you'll have an accurate version of Carmina Burana. Actually, this is perhaps as accurate a version of Orff's masterpiece as you're likely to find. Down to every note it shines in accuracy. Please forgive the fact that this recording of Carmina Burana is a 1960 one as it still has a great sound even with the slight hissing you're likely to notice from time to time. Get this if you're simply looking for accuracy. However, if you're looking for the big bang to impress your friends with then perhaps you'll want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ormandy Performing Carmina Burana","review":"Philadelphia Orchestra is truly one of my favarite orchestras, while Stoki (the only conductor who shook hands with Mickey Mouse) and Ormandy were around. And I love this recording of Orff's Carmina Burana. Although it doesn't really give much excitement on rather exciting music, the performance is truly delicate, pure, and very skilled. The strings and the woodwinds are excellent and tends to show off more, exact opposite to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which has really good brass. The soloists and the choir did an excellent job. The brass are fair enough. If you want Ormandy, you should buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musically excellent - disjointed download","review":"Recorded in 1960, this is an enthusiastic rendering of Orff's work. The Philadelphia orchestra is perfect as one would expect. Janice Harsanyi (soprano) Harve Presnel (baritone) and Rudolf Petrack (tenor) offer reasonable competence in the performance of solo passages. The Rutgers University Choir under the direction of F. Austin Walter gives a marvelous effort. Considering that the Rutgers group were non-professionals (or semi-professionals) they provided an excellent (if imprecise) performance. The youngest of the performers on this recording is today nearing seventy.No, it's not digital - but it's still one of the best out there.On a negative note (likely an Amazon issue): after downloading the piece would not retain movements in the correct order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sound Quality!","review":"I'm seriously beginning to doubt that any good version of \\"Carmina Burana\\" exists on disc today.

With a previous EP a couple of years earlier on the same label, Hendrik foreshadows his debut with a super tight mid range kick which guides you through a four-to-the-floor giddy rhythmic skip and synth hop. One can not help but flashback to Berlin's semi-underground clubs, like Tresor (which I was lucky to hit up one night) towards the early [or just super late] hours, when the pounding strobe light induced techno subdues down to the ambient fog enveloped lighter beats. Favorite tracks: Brother Mole and Rain or Shine."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for struggling readers!","review":"What a shame that this book is out of print (as are the others in this series)!

A helpful chapter called \\"The Cross Centered Day\\" lists several practical ways to keep one's focus constantly on the Cross. There is also a helpful, but simple, discussion of the differences between justification and sanctification. While this is not a comprehensive book, it is worth reading, especially for those new in the faith.

In the restaurant scene early in the movie, the \\"waiters\\" are typing food orders onto a computer screen that is totally black. The computer isn't even turned on.

But when two performers as talented as Zuckerman and Stern make not a single concession to the stylistic necessities of early music, it becomes a painful listening experience. They slog through these pieces with wide, impassioned vibrato and huge sound, and it simply doesn't work. The tempi are slow, the orchestra is a bit sloppy, and the overall effect is like watching a hippo in a mud bath. Absolutely no stylistic integrity.

It is well designed and turns easily at the handle making it move very nicely. The Rope itself is just a tad heavier than I'd like it to be, but not such a big deal.For the price, it is a wonderful simple addition to any fitness program. I use it daily. The only complaint I have is that no instructions came with how to 'adjust' the rope... so I improvised and just tied 2 knots at the end. It works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps twisting up","review":"I used this rope for over two weeks hoping that the fact that it keeps twisting up on itself was just because it was new and needed to be broken in. After two weeks I gave up. It kept twisting up on itself and I would have to stop in the middle of jumping to unwind it. A few jumps later it would be all twisty again. I ended up buying a better quality jumprope that works beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"I'm really surprised at how highly rated this jump rope is. First of all, I think the claim that this rope is adjustable is a little misleading. To adjust it, you have to remove the caps and tie the ends in the appropriate spot. It would be nice if it came with clamps of some sort that you could clamp on in the right spot to adjust. My other complaint is that it gets far too twisted up! I store mine by hanging it up to reduce tangling, but the rope tends to twist up in the middle as I'm jumping, forcing me to stop jumping and fix the rope."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so rope","review":"I saw this at the Vitamin Shoppe and since I'm always willing to try new jump ropes, I picked it up. I like these type of speed ropes, the ones with ball bearing and a rubber encasing over the rope. I find that it spins smoothly and fast and its easier to do tricks that a lightweight speed rope (although not as easy as the beaded ropes for trick but overall, I like the speed rope better). This rope is adequate if you just want to skip, do some crossovers and some double unders etc. But the rubber is too stiff thus it doesn't unkink all that well and turning action isn't that great even though it has bearings. I've also bought an Altus speed rope similar to this which was marginally better. Believe it or not, the Sports Authority brand of \\"professional\\" speed rope is far superior than either. The rubber is much softer and it turns a lot faster and smoother. Still, this is a servicable rope, I'm sure you can get a very good workout and if that's all you want, then I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Plastic junk. Tried it once. Wont try again. Just get a piece of rope and cut it to size. This thing is suppose to be adjustable. Only with difficulty of yanking it through the handle. The plastic rope does not turn properly so therefore it twists and kinks, leading you to trip over it. Just get a piece of rope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect rope for its money","review":"After a month of use the rope snapped like you say, but do you seriously expext from a $10 rope to last 1-2-3 years? You work for this rope an hour, but in my country I had to work around 12 hours to buy it, as it costs ~$17 here. Then why you scream more than I do?I will tell you what I did when the rope snapped. I kept the handles as they have nice bearings. I bought 3 meters of 3mm thick steel rope covered with 1mm PVC (5mm in diameter overall). It costs $1.50 per meter. I cut the excess rope and attached it to the handles using cable ties. Now that rope is indestructible! It is a little lighter than the original rope, but it is not a problem. Nothing has happened after a month of use. I guess it's more likely the handles to give up than the rope to snap.Take care of yourself, guys, and use your brain :)P.S. Excuse me for my bad English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumper Roper","review":"What do you say about a jump rope?Well idk.It has good length and mine hasn't broke yet and I've had it for quite some time.

Every song on the album flows into each other through backard sounds, strange sounds chior sounds, etc. then you'll get surprised by huge drums and stadium sounds, great production.. stereo accoustic guitars, pianos.

Much like Bruce Springsteens \\"Independence Day\\" and Cat Stevens \\"Father and Son\\" but more hopeful. Dan Fogelberg is a major talent with minor recognition, but when singer/songwriters/storytellers are discussed, in my humble opinion he can sit with Bob Dylan, Gordon Lightfoot, Bruce Springsteen even country music legend Tom T.

To add to the frustration, the stupid beeper went off every time I pressed it to lower or raise the toast. I had to use a wooden spoon to wiggle it up and down. It broke after about another 3mths of this. Why hasn't Rowenta tried to fix the problem? Its been, over 3yrs?, since this came out.

I paid to mail this $150 toaster in to the service center only to find out it will now cost $83 to fix it. I'm furious with Rowenta. After it completely failed, I did research online, and found out that the problem I was experiencing is very common. Rowenta didn't disclose this, and let the warranty period expire.

The biggest problem is that the toaster keeps rejecting the bread I put in - is has to go in just right and if not it pops back up or gets jammed and stays down till you figure out how to get it back up.

Our stairs are about 4 or 5 feet wide at the top and it was close to impossible to find a gate that would keep our loft area safe for my daughter to play in. My dad mounted the gate to metal railings and it has held up beautifully over the years. It is easy to latch and unlatch, can be removed easily (with the exception of the mounting hardware) and swings out of the way when children are not playing. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is that it feels a little flimsy when it is latched because it gives a little either way. The gate has never failed on me and actually is very secure despite the shaky feel. This gate can't be beat for the price and security it offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but a pain at the same time","review":"This gate takes time and effort to install ... a lot of screws but unlike how some have said you dont have to make a pilot hole, just makes it easier. The gate is very sturdy and I think very nice looking, however it is a tricky one to open and close. The first couple times I couldnt do it at all but once you get the \\"feel\\" of it its simple. Only problem is when other people are over they can never figure it out. It is also tall so basically impossible to step over. I can however open this gate with one hand ... like I said before you just have to get the \\"feel\\" of it.Overall I am very happy with this gate because I needed it for a larger opening. I wouldnt recommend it if you want to use it for a regular size opening though. Since it is a little more complex I would only buy it if you need the wider gate. It is very durable and nice though.Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good at all","review":"We looked at the box and the picture is deceiving.

The only other drawback is the height of the gate, it could be a little taller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate It!!","review":"This gate is awful. It's a good price but not at all easy to open and close. My older children have trouble opening it and closing it.

I really like being able to slide the gates down and out of the way in minutes. I read these reviews just before I purchased the gates and had the impression that it was difficult to install and open/shut. This is not true. If you read the directions, it is very simple to install and operate. There are 16 screws total, which may be a problem for some people, but I think it makes this gate more reliable than those with 4 screws. All in all, I am very happy with this gate. The cost is amazing compared to the iron gate that I was considering as an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parent Proof Too???","review":"I really am not happy with this gate.

The best song on the album and huge MTV hit (very deservedly) is the now classic \\"Burnin' For You\\", but there are several other quality songs worthy of mention.The lively yet dark title track kicks off the set with great synth/guitar fusion. \\"Veteran of the Psychic Wars\\" features both solid music and meaningful lyrics, while drives you right into the psychological desolation of \\"Sole Survivor\\". Two of my personal favorites include \\"Vengeance (The Pact)\\", and \\"Heavy Metal:The Black and Silver\\", both strongly reminiscent of their great 70s material.While definitely an album of its time (the 80s), Cult fans will find a lot to enjoy on \\"Fire of Unknown Origin\\", and it's a strong cut above most harder rock music of that era.

Thus, many of us shoplifted this album because of this radio hit. Why oh why do people only listen to it's one radio hit. \\"Burning for You\\" is lightweight compared to the rest of the recording.

For me, it doesn't, it's benign and doesn't groove at all like the songs I mentioned.I tend to like the 'Death Valley Nights', 'Don't Fear the Reaper', 'Godzilla' type stuff. You should listen to the little samples on here first to check (I didn't so the cd goes in my B-class collection ie 1 or 2 good songs on the album, as opposed to A-class masterpieces like Mountain's \\"Climbing\\", The Beatles' \\"Revolver\\", George Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\", The Stooges' \\"Raw Power\\", Wings' \\"Band on the Run\\", Lennon's \\"Imagine\\", Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Skynyrd's First and...

Die-hard fans might opt for Imaginos instead, but Fire Of Unknown Origin is also great and has a wider appeal. I especially love Burnin For You, which seems to have a relaxing and carefree rhythm like those old radio hits from the 60s, but with more \\"oomph\\" to it. Meanwhile, Veteran Of The Psychic Wars carries on the grand BOC tradition of a heavy and mysterious sound. And the rest.... Well, there's not a bad track on it. The weakest is Heavy Metal: Black & Silver, and even that is tolerable. For a newcomer who wants to delve into BOC's catalog, this should be one of the first purchases -- with only the Cult Classic compilation possibly coming before it."},{"rating":"1","title":"stick with a greatest hits cd","review":"I just got this & don't like it at all.

In this case, Michael Moorcock, one of the more mystical fantasy sci-fi writers today. The album pulsates with a sound that is distinguishably BOC, but with an almost MTV mentality (well, it was the eighties, so...) that not only makes it appealing to a newer audience, but gives it a sense of vitality that proves the band had no intention of slowing down. The other great songs on this album are the title track, \\"Burnin' for You,\\" \\"After Dark,\\" and \\"Sole Survivor.\\" One of BOC's best albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album should be very well known!","review":"Ok, this will be a very short review because I just want to get to the point straight away.

It has a lot of great riffs and it's very catchy! EVERY song is great! I REALLY don't get why some people gave it less than 4 stars.Buy it! Don't bother with the crappy new bands and buy this. It's one of the many proofs that music was MUCH better in the 70's/80's.Seriously, Blue Oyster Cult should be in the top 50 of the best rock bands ever.

Our poor little Casanova (Netherland Dwarf Rabbit) had to be rushed to the emergency room when he quit eating entirely after excitedly eating one of these treats daily. The doctor confirmed a case of Gastric Stasis, a common and sometimes fatal condition caused many times by diets too high in digestable fiber, proteins, and sugar (all of which Vita-Kraft foods are rich in). We ended up saving our poor bunny after 4 weeks of critical care and an all-hay diet, but one more treat could have killed him.

Harold Bloom, in fact, considers it to be Ozick's best work.

I got hooked by Anson Mount (ahhhh!) and the many shifting relationships of the characters and their devious schemes and hopes for the future.

The star has the rare \\"presence\\" and talent of Clint Eastwood.

One of my favorite characters is the woman who plays Eva. How much can one woman take??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great weatern","review":"This is a great show. Makes you think you have never seen a realistic western before. The tension of the Civil War is so fresh and raw motivating many of the characters. The wide open spaces just for the taking, if we can just move those pesky Indians out of the way. Blood spurts just when it should and sometimes in surprising places as well. In the end it all comes down to the money, maybe not for the many, but for the lucky few the payout will be huge. Even for the hangers on this is a second chance, this time they win or die trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Deadwood, but well done, anyway","review":"AMC has created an intrinsically interesting premise peopled with powerfully drawn characters. The money AMC spent is obvious on the screen, showing the American West, which is unmistakable for any other scenery. The screenplay does justice to all the different points of view, avoiding most stereotypical points of view. Worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show","review":"I love westerns-i'm a gun and railroad buff-everyone is seedy and covered in mud-very realistic-all the actors look a little worse for wear but the horses are beautiful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"There's nothing not to like here.

I watched the 1st season on Netflix, and was addicted to it. I had to have the second season as soon as I could, so I looked at Amazon.

I LOVED season one but was disappointed with this one. However...I will watch season three just to see if it gets back on track!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as Season 1.","review":"Season 1 is strong and dense. Season two is flabby and padded with longing looks. I would give season two a pass, but check out the first season. It's very well done -- but still not as good as Deadwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this one...","review":"I didn't like this book very well. It gave too much history and not enough current events. I have read the history of polygamy over & over & over and would like to read current events. There wasn't too much to read about current events in this book. If you want the history, this book's for you. She's a good writer but I've had their history crammed down by throat enough.

First one lasted years and the birds love it, so we looked and found the same one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"nonfunctional","review":"I bought two of these \\"bird feeders\\" to replace 12 year old ones of the same style. Although the pictures shown on line were identical to the feeders I was replacing, the items delivered were a new version which included a bar down the middle of the feeding port so birds can't get the seeds (sunflower). I hung them in the same place as the old ones which provided heavy feeding traffic and after two weeks of trying to get seeds the birds have moved on.I guess these units are really just yard art as they sure don't serve any other purpose.I Emailed customer service but after 1 1/2 weeks I still have no reply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I was somewhat put out with this product. Looking at the picture, and the description, one would think this to be one sturdy bird feeder. Oh, but not so. The tubs are supported by the top, which when removed, allows the tubs to come undone from the little niches that hold them in place. Not particularly good when one is fighting a bag of birdseed. Plus, the bird would have nothing to do with it. Okay, I'm just saying...when I had a gold one, the birds were all over it. This one sat in my backyard for two weeks and I only recall seeing maybe two or three birds on it. Perhaps I have picky birds."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful earful of the early recordings","review":"The selections here were recorded in 1937, and some still include Roy Rogers. There are some very nice harmonies here, along with great songs like Song of the Bandit, When the Golden Train Comes Down, and Cowby Night Herd Song. Cajon Stomp is a nice duet between the Fahr brothers, and must have been similar to the \\"spontaneous\\" fillers they used to do on live radio spots. Send Him Home to Me is a good showcase of their close harmonies. There is a really handy fold-up liner notes with a lineup-chronology, pictures, and history. The only bad thing is it is just 10 songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album for fans of the early Sons of the Pioneers","review":"Only 10 songs, but still worth the price. These early selections are good music and lots of fun. The Farr brothers stand out nicely, and Roy Rogers' wonderful yodeling is well used. Song of the Bandit is one of my favorites; listen to Karl Farr having a great time on his guitar. Cajon Stomp is just grand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ride a Happy Trail with this CD","review":"For collectors of recordings by the Sons of the Pioneers and/or Roy Rogers this is a must. This CD spotlights the early work of this talented group of singers and is a great starting point to building a collection of their music. Due to the age of some of thesongs recorded here the musical stylings and sound are somewhat dated. However, for fans this will add to teh disc's appeal.Columbias did an excellent job of selection and production.

Never could get a GPS lock after several attempts. Put in date/time/location manually. mySky was way off on identifying objects.

Was able to finally speak to Carlos Fernandez, the supervised, after leaving two voicemails only after threatening a lawsuit. He was of no help and offered the same deal. Don't buy this item. I will not buy any other Meade items based on my experience with the mysky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse then useless","review":"Like others, mine didn't work out of the box. It never got a GPS fix. Even trying to enter location manually it would just lock up. They came out with the MySky \\"Plus\\", which should actually be called the MySky Minus, because they simply removed the troublesome GPS and require you to enter a manual location. Meade was quick to send out a replacement \\"Plus\\" unit. At least this didn't crash, but it didn't work either. It can't locate anything.A word about entering your location manually. You have to select from a list of cities and if your city isn't on the list you're screwed. There is no way to enter geographical coordinates in the Plus like I was originally told you could.I say these are worse then useless because not only do they do nothing but I've spent hours trying to get them to work (the original and the replacment). And now it's too late to return so I'm stuck with a $300 piece of junk.

It freezes in the midst of the effort to communicate with GPS satellites and establish time and location. Tried it about 20 times all of the ways that the documentation specified.

Horrible execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ****???","review":"I bought my mySky a couple of years ago, and it worked fine except for a month ago when it erred out completely. The screen pop-up advised that I contact Meade for an RMA#.I just called Meade and wad told sorry, but they do not support the mySky any longer. They will not repair or replace. I'm steamed, as I paid $400 to Amazon for it.I asked the Meade support guy Well, if you don't repair or replace am I stuck with it with no recourse.\\" He did not answer me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa! what a HUGE Bummer","review":"Unfortunately, we were ones who paid the 400 bucks for this POS from Meade. Meade seems to be hit or completely miss on their products... and usually a big miss on service. This thing sort of wanted to work out of the box, then decided it didn't want to. It won't find jack in the sky. I own 4 telescopes, and a couple are Meade. So, I'm not going to put them down completely. This device however shouldn't have ever hit the floor.

Either don't buy this junk or wait a year or two for Meade to get their act together.The mySKY aims like a pistol with traditional pistol-like sights (2 in the rear, 1 in the front). I sent my first mySKY unit back because the factory never installed the front sight post for aiming (their customer rep tried to tell me the front should have 2 posts! He clearly wasn't knowledgable about the product!). Also, the unit failed to start up properly about half the time.Today I got my second unit, with a green laser pointer thrown in as a bonus. The volume control button doesn't work right out of the box! Also, the laser pointer won't turn on 80% of the time. Now I have to send it back AGAIN, and Meade will not reimburse for shipping despite being under warranty.Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - VERY poorly executed.","review":"My first MySky had to be returned - it was literally falling apart in the box. When I finally received the second - it actually worked, but I had terrible problems trying to upgrade the software - SO... Meade replaced the entire unit. I recently attempted to upgrade my replacement unit with the latest software - and wound up with a calibration error. So - Meade replaced my MySky with a MySky Plus - what they fail to tell you is THEY SUBTRACT OUT THE GPS - and the only way to set the location is by scrolling through a long list of choices. There's no way to set your own longitude and latitude - so you have to use a nearby city.The new unit works - but it is terribly inaccurate.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - I know I regret doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"greatly disappointing","review":"I thought I had carefully compared the MySky and the celestron product, and made the right choice. BIG MISTAKE. This product took quite a while to set up as far as getting the GPS to work. The pointing is not accurate--it identified Jupiter as a star on the first attempt, but then it worked out. The videos and audio are minimal, not very informative at all. This is WAY overpriced for what you get, and it doesnt seem well made. I plan on returning it and trying the Sky Scout. Hopefully, it works better. Meade promotes its product as having a larging database of celestial objects to find, but does it matter if it doesnt work?

Very difficult to aim given natural shake in one's arms and poor focusing mechanism. GPS takes (when it worked) over 5 minutes to get a take. I found it not as helpful as one of the cheap sky charts. Then Meade came out with a software upgrade - and that made mine completely unworkable. Meade refused to even take it back and look at it. They told me \\"sorry\\" and that was it. The store (large scope company) where I bought it told me Meade has worst customer care of any one and I should look elsewhere. While I still like my 15 year old Meade scope; I find the company's attitude, and this product a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work, can't get repaired","review":"I bought a MySky in February. When it arrived, from the first time, it woudld not work: It would lock up whether you had it look for birds or you entered data manually. I sent it back. Waited weeks. Got replacement. It worked once. Next time, buttons failed to work and parts falling out of battery door. I sent it back again, had to pay this time because I had it more than 2 months (never really got to use it, it was cloudy during the midwest floods!) still have not heard or seen any sign of a replacement after a long wait.Do the magazine reviewers get special units? Checking online I see that nearly everyone here as well as on other forums has been unable to get a reliably working unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead and gone","review":"It worked a few times, but now it's dead. The electronics don't work, so all you get for paying the hefty price of $399 is a piece of inoperative plastic--might as well point a wood stick at the sky. I'm trying to see if Meade will take the inert product back and ship one that works.I got a replacement in May, Meade came through well--no customer hassles! Put batteries in carefully, in an hour two of the battery casings split cuz of an internal short that started to fry them--never had this on any other electronic instrument. Using top-notch batteries, not some off-brand. I sensed this issue because the battery cage got to be very warm, and I opened it up and here were these two (of four) split batteries. Perhaps the battery contacts aren't very robust so they can get moved around and either (a) not make contact, perhaps my original issue, or (b) short out so as to burn out the batteries and maybe set fire to wherever you store this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Mead listening? Are they still solvent?","review":"My story is much like the others here. Filled with enthusiasm, andout $400, I sadly returned my first MySky after a few days due to general malfunction.Mead's service was slow and showed lack of caring for the customer.I returned the second unit after a one week, and got a refund.Good points: The MySky screen is in color and easy to point and shoot.The problem is that this product is half baked. It's a toy. They usedcheap materials combined with poor quality control.A little research gave me the impression of a company in trouble with weak management and no vision.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.PS I bought the CelestronIt works, but its boring, and no way cool like the MySky should have been.I wouldn't purchase either product if I could do it over.What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice attempt at a biogrpahy without the actual writings of the emperior","review":"A hnonorable attempt at writing a biography by using secondary resources to support his writings.

Let me preface this point by noting that I regularly read history books, so I do not expect perfect prose and/or excitement at each turn. The writing quality was what many would stereotypically expect of a historian, especially an Asian Studies historian. Specifically, the author spent a great deal of time exploring tangents and nuances, and frankly, the vast array of Japanese names required me to keep a list of dramatis personae while reading. While all of the tangents were (eventually) tied together to make a point, it made for a difficult read. I have no doubt the author did a substantial amount of research, but the finished product was difficult to absorb - it left me feeling as though I was missing something or that I had walked into a lecture halfway before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another Marixst Nut","review":"My wife is Chinese, to this day there still exists a great deal of hate in China for Japan and her actions during the war.

Instead what I got from this book was a foaming at the mouth rabid attack Hirohito all in the first few pages.

First of all, the title is misleading. Modern Japan was created during the Meiji Emperor and Hirohito inherited it.Also, the book does not really talk about how Japan is becoming \\"modern\\", but just tells the life story - in a very boring way - of Hirohito."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of questionable value.","review":"The central hypothesis offered by Bix relies on the tenuous application of modern political thought to a country mired in over 1,000 years of xenophobic isolation. There is no doubt that Showa was a deeply complex man who often was in conflict with those around him, but this indictment reads more like a piece of historical revisionist trash best left to line birdcages, cat litter pans and wrapping for fish.This absurdity does little to elucidate the Japanese emperor's culpability during the war years, and is as serious a piece of scholarly work as the nearest supermarket tabloid. Don't waste your time with this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely readable","review":"I took the Pulitzer jury's word for this one, which was a big mistake. Another reviewer said this book was 'superbly written' and I am wondering if we read the same book. I found it barely readable. Awkward sentence structure, repetition ad nauseum, at least one contradiction (was Hirohito intelligent or not?), and no sense of flow in the material presented. It appears to have had no editor. It's the kind of stuff that one sees in academic journals where unintelligibility is a mark of genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tour de force","review":"An excellent book that explains that Hirohito was centrally involved in WW2 and culpable...that he was protected by McArthur at the end of WW2 for political and realpolitik reasons.

The Velcro closure is barely long enough to fit a small neck so will never be suitable for most necks.The instructions are printed with errors and grammatically incorrect making them very tricky to understand, if at all.The controls are difficult to adjust having to press and/or hold this button and that for the proper \\"mode\\" and adjustment. Call me crazy but I just want a heating pad I can easily flip on and use. In addition, the lightweight control is placed upside-down in the very heavy cord making adjusting it a bit of a challenge; however, the cord is long enough to accommodate this ridiculous blunder should the outlet be near.I give it one star for the fact that it is versatile and one for the soft cover.

Same product but probably made in China and so the quality is very poor.But then it is still better than some of the other low end brands for comperable $$. And it doesn't cost $600. I suppose you could capture that in a year if you bought all your previous coffees at Starbucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great","review":"After reading all the reviews, I bought this Espresso machine. The truth is that if you want true espresso don't buy a steam machine. The shots that this machine makes are not at all coffee house quality. Very disappointed and very misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy with Purchase","review":"This frother is excellent and all that I hoped that it would be. I would highly recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it.","review":"This is my 3rd espresso maker and after one month (and maybe 6 uses) the steamer does not work anymore. I had a $30 coffeemate cappuccino maker at one time that was not only the easiest to use, but it lasted a whole year making mochas everyday. The Krups steamer is too close to the body of the machine and it is difficult to move your steamer cup; You will burn yourself until you get it down pat. Also, the machine only allows 8 oz of water at one time, which makes it hard to brew and steam for two coffee drinks without refilling the water. (Assuming you are making two espresso shots for each drink) and when you have to unscrew the top to add more water, you have to open it and quickly move your hand or you will get burned by the pressured steam coming out. A big pain in the rear is what this machine is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks Badly","review":"We had a Krups that we used for 12 years before it finally gave out--solid as a rock.This cheap, low-quality plastic machine is like nothing I've ever seen from Krups before. It immediately leaked all over the place. It's obvious the seal on the thing isn't strong enough, so that when the pressure gets high enough, it fails. At first I looked at the basket and saw coffee around the top of the rim, and thought maybe it was my fault. But after meticulously cleaning everything, and using less that half a basket of coffee, it still leaked, and I realized the coffee around the rim was because the seal had failed.I also note in the instructions that it says not to tamp the coffee down! What does this suggest? It can't handle the pressure.It goes back--don't buy this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups FND111 no 871","review":"Just been using this FND111 as a replacement for a Krups 871 I've had for the last three years and I can't say I'm impressed.The main issue with this machine is the pressure. It's insufficient to the task. I like a fine grind and usually make 2 espressos at a time; one for me and one for the my SO.The 871 would spit out a full caraffe in about 3 minutes. The FND111 spits out about half a caraffe then seems to not be able to do the rest lending a burnt flavor to what does dribble out over the course of 5 - 8 minutes. Way, way to long.The second issue is the on switch. It's integral to brewing or foaming meaning there's no way to release the steam without also having the boiler on. No walking away from the machine for you!Given these two objections I'm hunting down another 871 to use for the next few years. Hope this is helpful and don't waste your cash. If I'd gotten one of these initially when I wanted to make espresso at home I'd still be going to the cafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrbile","review":"This machine leaked all over my countertop.

So for the money's worth, it is a great item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst espresso machine we've ever had","review":"We bought this espresso machine because we had owned the previous Krups model and it was great - served us well for over 5 years, being used daily. So it was a no-brainer to get another Krups when the time came. But this one doesn't compare! It leaks from every seam, sprays steam all over the place, the indicator light has already burned out (after 2 months), and because of the intense leakage it sits in its own pool of water. That seems dangerous to me. We are getting ready to chuck this and go to a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I have been unhappy with this machine since I bought it from Amazon in October. I wasn't willing to pay for a pump machine and my old Krups, which I'd had for 15 (yes, really!) years made pretty decent espresso. On my old machine, I could even get crema if I used the right grind of coffee and tamped it well.This machine is nothing like my old one. A few times it's made absolutely stone cold espresso. A few times the machine spurted steam from every crevice. When it's working, it only works passably well -- no crema on my espresso and not quite enough power to ensure the milk (if I'm making a cappucino) is hot and frothy.I'm looking for an affordable pump machine now -- I've realized my mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 6 Months of use....it died on its own....","review":"I have had espresso machines before, the cheap models, and I got rid of them because I can't get into the boilng capsule to clean them, so I only got rid of them for higiene purposes, otherwise they where working well.

Well you know the saying \\"you get what you pay for\\". And indeed I did. It is a plastic piece of junk. I have a friend who has the older model that has a coffee maker and espresso machine in one. It works great. I thought this would be identicle minus the coffee maker. WRONG! It makes weak drip coffee not espresso, you have to wait and froth milk once your coffee is finished or vise versa thus making your coffee cold. The steam doesn't even froth the milk. It has been a complete disaster so save your time and money. I bought the Krups Burr grinder to go along with it and that isn't even great. So long Krups...........I think it's time to spend the money and get the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Luck","review":"I ordered this machine a while ago and it simply did not work -- at all. There was a leak in one of the hoses. Returning it was not a breeze, especially since the company insisted it could not be broken. In the end they grudgingly gave me a return label. After they tested it, they agreed and sent a replacement machine.

I burned out my older Krups from 2 years of daily use (this is the replacement model), however, the plastic frothing attachment on the steamer arm (which kept the noise down) broke on Day 3 and the steamer takes much longer to froth the milk. Next time I'll spend more money on a higher quality espresso machine. I notice one improvement from the older model, though -- the espresso actually stops pouring when you switch to steaming (the old model continued to dribble down espresso during steaming)."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for a week","review":"after the first week of use, the seal started to leak preventing it from working. don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little machine-saves me a bundle on mochas","review":"I have to concur with the previous commenter. You have to try what works for you. If you follow the instructions, you get burnt, horrid coffee. Also, because it is new, you will have to contend with that \\"new\\" taste for a bit while it gets seasoned. It does get better soon. Also, for frothing, I let the espresso brew first, then while that is happening, I pre-warm the milk in my mocha mug in the microwave for a minute. When the brewing is done, I transfer the milk to the frothing pitcher, and add my dark chocolate back in my mug. Then, I switch to frothing and the milk comes out perfect and much faster than doing that first. Lots of nice packed, dense foam over hot milk. A quick cleanup on the unit (release pressure with the steamer to clean the filter) and the nozzle and you are good to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"One minor problem","review":"I have owned two similar Krups Espresso machines (Model 871). They make great espresso and are easy to use. Both died a premature death due to the same design flaw. The plastic standoffs which attach the steam boiler to the case tend to become brital and self-destruct, rendering the machine useless. Unfortunately replacement parts are not available. If replacement parts were available these machines would be a five star product. I have complained to Krups US customer service representatives about this problem and they apparently don't care enough about their company's reputation for quality to forward the complaint to the responsible quality control department."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this if you want to burn your coffee (or cash)","review":"This espresso machine burns coffee grind because it takes too long for pressurized water to flow through the grind. I am not sure if my particular machine is defective but it takes about 2-3 minutes for 50ml of water to flow through. The result - just one pure shot of burnt espresso! This is not even the case of what you get is what you paid for. I don't think anyone would pay $[...] something bucks for making burnt espresso. Don't waste your cash. Try something a little bit more expensive, and hopefully it will be better than this one. To be fair, the frother did seem to work fine.Needless to say, I am planning to return it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get hot","review":"I had this machine for about a week before returning it - it was easy to use, and made ok tasting lattes, but nothing got hot.

I'm upgrading to a better model."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING - poor quality, only lasted 3 months","review":"This is our 2nd Krups espresso machine. The first one lasted a reasonable 3 years. This replacement was much cheaper, Krups is a good brand name, what could go wrong? Well, we've used it 3 months and I'm ready to throw it away. It barely steams anymore, won't get hot enough, and leaks all over the counter.I'm searching for a different brand today."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"I have had my Krups espresso maker for a couple years now and have enjoyed it. It makes decent espresso and I have had no problems with it at all. You have to remember to clean the frothing wand regualrly, or it won't work as well.Does a great job actually for the low price! Will save you lots of money over going to Starbucks if you can get your technique down using this machine! I reccomend if you are thinking about getting an entry level model. I just got a gift certificate for a graduation present, so time for me to upgrade!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Termperamental and a bit violent","review":"I had high hopes for this machine, as my last Krups model lasted nearly 10 years of daily use. Wow, what a downgrade. Not only the longest brew time I've ever encountered, but the process stutters - stopping up to 2 minutes before continuing - several times before it's done. The engineering is flawed, and steam leaks from everywhere. It's also prone to explosive outbursts, spewing water and sometimes grinds 2-3 feet. This machine has scared the hell out of me more than once. I'm already looking into a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China, out of plastic. Need I say more?","review":"Well, I will, just because I'm so pissed off about this piece of KRAP. I got this as a Xmas present, and I was SO excited! That is, until I tried to use it! The first time we used it the gasket on the percolation head failed and the machine blew high pressure boiling water and coffee all over me and my husband and made a huge mess of our kitchen. If you are brave enough to try this machine anyway, be sure you always stand away from it or you may get burned!! Also-be sure that you don't turn up the pressure too high on the steam wand because you will get so much froth it will also go all over you and your kitchen. In all, the lesson learned here is, the machine makes decent espresso, but you will pay DEARLY for it! And be sure you buy it from a place that will allow you to return it if it breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"No on/off switch?","review":"It works, but the lack of an on/off switch to make the water hot is annoying and makes the machine awkward to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latte Lover","review":"I had a very expensive espresso maker that sprung a leak in less than a year, so I went the cheap route.I am extremely impressed with this little machine. It's a little more labor intensive (you have to be right there throughout the brewing and frothing process) but the froth beats my old machine, and, although the crema is not as rich, the espresso is wonderful.I drink at least three lattes a day, and after 2 months, it paid for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and not worth it","review":"Pros: Cheap. I cannot find anything else since when it works you get coffee, nothing outstanding about it.Cons: milk steam is too high so you have to keep the cup up while it steams milk, unless you are using a big jar with a lot of milk in it. It brings hot water instead of steam when it starts warming up, it should have an open/close valve you can use when the machine is ready to bring out some steam instead of hot water. It can get messy. You can not regulate the amount of water that goes to the coffee or the steam that goes to the milk, it seems that the valve is just an open/close valve.Bottom line: I wish I bought something else no matter if it is a few bucks expensier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, nice styling","review":"A fan of Krups line, I had to return another model due to its tiny basket, but this particular java factory holds plenty of the organic brown motivation powder. It also gets that go-juice in the crafe very quickly compared to other models. However that time saving function is offset somewhat. Getting the sturdy basket and handle into position can be a little daunting, sometimes necessitating tilting the unit to see the groove for insertion. That aside, the black and silver Allegro looks great and makes a great cup a Jose! (espresso isn't really Joe I guess)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups Espresso Maker - newest model","review":"I was disappointed in this product and returned it. This new model of an old standby seemed not to be as well made as earlier models. The coffee bowl did not fit tightly in the maker and steam leaked out. Also the maker recommended that the coffee not be tamped down (as I have been doing for years), and indeed when I tried to tamp the coffee down in the bowl the steam made the coffee spurt up into the coffee maker and made a big mess. When not tamped down, the espresso was weak and not as tasteful. Finally, I did not like the split between the steam function and the espresso making function. All in all, I like the older models better."},{"rating":"2","title":"MMMMM Espresso","review":"I fell in love with this little machine when my brother turned me on to his. I couldn't make enough coffee that weekend, I was hooked! I came home and started shopping for my own, I found it on Amazon for $20 less than what he paid for his. It is of course not as fast as a traditional coffee maker but defintiely worth the weight. Fresh beans are key for sure. The lid on the caraffe could be a little better designed, falls into my cup sometimes. Have not used the milk frother yet, I prefer my coffee black, but I have turned it on and it works. It is a simple to use, basic machine that produces an awesome cup of coffee. I highly recommend it for first time espresso machine users. And this is the best price you will find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups Allegro Espresso Maker","review":"It's a great value for the price. It is simple, straightforward, and fairly easy to use. I own one which I bought over a year ago, and just bought another one for a friend. There have been a couple of changes in the design since I bought my first one. I find the new one slighly more demanding - you have to pay more attention to what you are doing - but it's great for making espresso and cappuccino at home. I make my own almond milk which steams/frothes perfectly.

He only uses it when we sleep in and turn the lights on late. Then we always find him warming himself on his rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"BURN YOUR ANIMALS","review":"Hey i have had these before and my reptiles have actually been Burned on there bellies.

In 7th grade, I happened upon this book in a local library and was thrilled to see the lyrics to the song by the same name, and that there were funny, witty stories in the book.Even in 7th grade I enjoyed it and kept it for quite some time.Now a mother, i wanted to remember those stories and order the book for my own children...

It appeared to be the best buy for the money. Well, we were wrong. The screws that come with the product to mount it are not long enough to go through the sheetrock into the stud. Position the gate on the brackets, and the weight of the gate pulls the screws out of the wall.In addition to that, the swing hardware is designed wrong. The part that makes the gate swing is longer than the bracket in the wall, so just swinging the gate open PUSHES the brackets (with their puny little screws) out of the wall. I don't know how it works as a pressure gate, because we only have need for a gate at the stairs, so it went back to the store, but DO NOT buy this gate for stairway use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to open and close","review":"While the gate is sturdy one it is up, it is hard to put up and take down. There is a ratchet mechanism that turns and then locks into place. I originally bought two of these gates when we first got a puppy and tried to use them when we had twin boys. It worked well for the puppy but so well for the twins. By the time you get it up or down your kids are already where you don't want them to be. Not the point of a gate! There are much easier gates to open and close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a gate for the stairs","review":"I thought this gate was a wonderful deal for the price and the fact you could use it on the stairs.

I just toss a few of her favorite toys into it, she is satisfied and my sanity is saved! I am also impressed with the size. It is adequate space for her now, and with the extention kit I purchased it will still be great as she gets more mobile. It was fairly easy to assemble, as I did it by myself.

The gate is of strong construction and our 5 and 7 yr. olds were able to climb in and out without compromising its integrity.They are now just 12 months old and weigh about 40 pounds together and we MUST unfortunately retire this yard much earlier then we planned because together the two of them are able to push the yard across a berber carpeted floor and together they are not far from being able to have one push on one end while the other crawls out from the other side.This is a very safe and well constructed gated yard and served our needs well!

We have it on carpet and she doesn't seem to move it too far yet. She hasn't tried using the holes to pull herself up yet, so the holes may become a problem in the future. So far though, it keeps the cat and dog out, keeps her in a safe zone so I don't have to watch her every second while preparing dinner. She really seems to like being able to have enough space to crawl around in. Our pack and play is too small for that. It's really a portable crib. The Superyard is kind of ugly, but it works the way I'd hoped it would when I bought it, so I would recommend it - at least for little tykes ... so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to put your little one in a small play yard","review":"I take care of my granddaughter at least 3 days a week.

I use it to block off one large playroom and she loves the freedom that she can have up there. I love the peace of mind that it offers.

I was a bit skeptical, because I read many that said parts break off, and its really hard to fold and unfold, but so far I am extremely pleased with the superyard. (It's not difficult to position if you're strong enough to lift a baby up and down, up and down, a thousand times a day.)Like a few people have said, if you just use common sense this product is great.I have an extremely bouncy, lightning fast 8 month old, and even without the extension the superyard is big enough that he can move around without getting antsy, and strong enough for him to pull up on and cruise around.The only thing I can say that's negative about it is that it is big and clunky (its meant to give them more space than a pack and play type play yard)and it is fairly unattractive.For the price, it's a great find. Use some common sense, and it will serve you well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very DANGEROUS product","review":"Hi all,I just wanted to warn people about the PlayYard XT by Northstar. It is basically a big playard that measures around 35 square feet with an extention. We had the play yard in our family room next to the kitchen. Anyway, my twins, who were 18 months, were playing inside it. They leaned on one of the panels. They along with the front panel went crashing to the ground. The entire back of the play yard was then lifted off the ground and landed on top of them sandwiching them. One of my sons, landed head first onto the tile floor that is a little beyond the family room. Luckily, except for bruises on his forehead, nose, and chin, he is okay. The other landed mostly on the carpet so he was okay.The only way that I would use this product is if it were securely tied down at the base. This is not in their instructions or recommendations.This incident was reported to the Consumer Safety Comission."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous","review":"On arrival my Superyard had a huge crack in it that was hard to notice at first glance.

So I decided to purchase the so called \\"super gate\\" for my 8 month old son. The first one I had bought was broken so I returned it and recieved a new gate eager to use it. It was nothing but a hassale. First of all it is heavy. To heavy to carry with you on vacation or a day out. Second it is such a hassale to fold it up. Plus there are little gaps between the gate pieces that my son keeps sticking his fingers through. So since the gate is not steady in place a move in the gate can be dangerous to little fingers. WHen folding it away expect to brake a nail or two! It feels like very cheap plastic, so I can't imagine how it can be durable. I used it twice before I myself broke it trying to put it away. It is definatley in my opinion not worth the money. Buy something more durable!It seems dangerous to me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"I bought this play yard for my grandson on Nov. 7. It arrived with one section chipped. It's also very large and leaves no room in our family room for people to walk. It was on sale two weeks later at another location for $30 less.

I would not recommend this play yard nor the company that sells it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son Loves it!","review":"I was initially against playpens because I thought he'd feel like he was in jail... but he loves this fence thing!

We have wood floors, stairs and a dog so this is the best way to creat a safe play environment. Love the idea of making it larger or smaller. Hook toys on it, shape it according to the room. Great product however not sure how long it'll last once they are able to push it. So far it's a life saver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Really like the product.

I can't turn my back for a minute without him crawling away or pulling himself up on everything. I feel safe leaving him in this while I put a load of laundry in or if I need to help my 2 year old with something. I bought the 2 panel extension as well but haven't used it yet. They came in two separate shipments so I would get the yard first then determine if you have the room or need for the extension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Mobile Twins","review":"I have 10 month old twins and the Superyard is great because it keeps them in safe place where they can crawl and play. If the twins choose to go in different directions, their range is limited. It is even sturdy enough that they both stand and lean on the fencing and it does not tip over. They are confined to a set area and I don't have to worry about them getting into something I may have forgotten to baby proof in the house. Plus their toys are in one place in the room, not all over.This is great product if you want your child to have some independence and be safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver","review":"I have one year old twins (a boy and a girl) and they are very active. This has been a lifesaver. We call it their \\"corral\\". If I need to get a shower or cook or do anything that I can't keep a constant watch over the twins, I put them in the \\"corral\\". We take it with us camping, to the beach, to Meme and Granddaddy's house and to family reunions. We bought the extension set also so it would be big enough for two. I can't rave about it enough. We attach fun toys to the sides of it and the babies really like it. In case you are wondering about older kids, it contains my very active two year old neice when she visits as well. This is something I couldn't live without."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice, but cannot leave room, he climbs sides","review":"I bought this yesterday for my 10 month old.

I still think this is a great help. It was hard to open.And it was hard to get the extension in, (a tight fit). It was quite a fight to get the pieces together. I think I'll be climbing over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money!","review":"Not worth the effort unless you're just looking for a very difficult playpen. It is extremely difficult to open, close, and position. It is next to worthless unless the ends are attached to one another. Using in any of the open positions is downright dangerous! My kids are nine months old today and are pushing this thing all over, including lifting it. It is too flimsey for support when they try to pull themselves up and most often end up falling when it moves (and my kids are only 19 lbs.!) Don't waste your money, I would recommend getting a portable playpen instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Stressful!","review":"I bought the superyard a couple of weeks ago for my 9 month old. She is a very busy little girl. The concept of the product was great! HOWEVER...this is by far the most frustrating baby product I have bought. It is extremly hard to put up and take down. We have a smaller space and can not leave the superyard up all the time. Every day its seem to get harder to snap together. Today I actually wanting to throw the gate across the room (But I didn't). ALso the first time we put up the gate I found many little peices of plastic on the floor. If you live in a big house and have room to keep up your superyard all the time, this gate might work...If you are like me and have a smaller house, forget messing with it everyday!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superyard XT...not so super after all.","review":"After researching various play areas, I thought this would be perfect for my son. The advertising claimed it opened to 18 ft of play area..it's not that much bigger than a play pen and is no where near enough room for my son to play in and crawl around or even have toys in there. This was a vast disappointment and I would NOT recommend this to another parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"This is so wonderful because it allows us to get things done around the house and we know our baby is safe. All his toys are also contained in one spot so it keeps the living room neat. EASY TO STORE! just fold and fits under the crib, closet or bed. Good quality!! fits our son and us when we go in it with him with plenty of room! WE LOVE IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Money!","review":"We just bought this because we were unable to find gates wide enough for our entranceways that did not mar the walls. I was apprehensive at first, as I did not want to \\"cage\\" my 11 month old son in one of these things. That concept, however, went out the window when we saw how much fun he has playing in it. Yes, the plastic is flexible, and there is nothing that really grips the floor, so it does shift a bit, but nothing that jeopardizes the safety of the child. We put it on top of a playmat, since we have hardwood floors, and we've been very happy with it. We'll likely purchase the extension, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"I like this yard, because it is sturdy enough to keep my one year old inside and safe. It is also large enough, with the extension, that she does not feel confined--which means she won't cry when she's inside! That's a good thing! The only thing that is kind of a pain at first, is opening the panels, but once you get the hang of it, it's really easy! Anyway, I would definitely recommend this for a mobile baby--with the extension, or in my case, another yard in addition to the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Christmas trees with toddlers","review":"I bought this item to put around our Christmas tree so our toddlers cannot reach the ornaments. It works great for that purpose. My plan for it when my new baby arrives is to place it around the bassinet or play area for the baby so the other 2 can't reach him while they are running amok. Since I've only used it as the manufacturer directs (in the hexigon shape) it has worked just fine. I'm very pleased.I am adding to this review a year later, and must say how helpful this gate has been at our house. Not only for the Christmas tree once again, but around the desk area that shares a room with the kids' toys, as a gated \\"play yard\\" for the baby when we have company (other people's kids forget there is a baby on the floor and run him over), etc. I had no trouble with it's sturdiness. It's easy to reshape and fold up for moving. I don't know what we'd do without it. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy and dangerous","review":"I think many of the positive reviews are coming from parents with calm, docile babies, or parents who have not used this play yard system more than 2 months.My son is only 8 months, but very mobile. He pulls to stand and regardless of the shape or orientation of the play yard he can easily tip it over. Square, hexagon, rectangle, he can flip it. Plus, it is VERY difficult to open. It's barely possible to open with just one person let alone one handed. No one-handed option. Today, I tried to reconfigure it into yet another shape to see if that would minimize flipping and CRACK, I broke off a piece of the connecting hinges. And yes, they are sharp. This product is poorly designed, and frankly a stupid item. It's a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for crawling babies.","review":"My nine month old son was able to make the Superyard slide across the tile floor simply by crawling over and pulling up on the sides. He began to treat it like a walker...a VERY dangerous walker that allowed him to manuever his way to things that were meant to be out of bounds... carpet didn't slow him down much, although it took more effort on his part to make the play yard move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank GOD!","review":"We raise Guide Dogs for the blind so we are getting a brand new, 8 week old puppy every year. Now you think a baby is hard.. try chasing a crazy pup around who can run jump bark and nip. haha. Anyways. Before the \\"superyard\\" we were getting very creative with the gates and were trying to set up some kind of yard so the pups dont have to stay cooped up in a kennel all day. When we saw the play yard we HAD to have it. It has been so great! We can take it anywhere and it folds so nicely once our puppy gets too big and learns to jump over. The only problem we have with it is its inablility to open... like a door. The pups get heavy as they grow and as I'm sure it is with babies... our backs get sore lifting them in and out all day. If only they created some type of door extension to go with it... we'd be very happy. But overall... it is well worth the money seeing as we finally don't have to watch them 24-7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"We bought this to help contain our 8 month old son! He hates to be confined in a play yard and loves to crawl and explore EVERYTHING!! It is big enough to fit his toys inside, but doesn't take up much room in our living room.

This is a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stay at home mom's dream","review":"What an amazing product! My son is 14 months old and we're still using the super yard (plus one attachment). I find it provides just enough space for him to play freely while giving me the ability to do other tasks around the house. I keep one super yard (w/attachment) at my house & one at my parent's house for visits. My in-laws also have one. I find that it folds up very compact and I've even traveled with it a few times.Here are a few tips that worked for me:-invest in a set of foam playmats to help cushion the baby if he falls (toys r us has a nice set for $19.99)-Secure the super yard to a piece of furniture if the baby starts moving it or you have hardwood floors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Measurement info","review":"While I was considering whether to buy this product, I couldn't find this information anywhere. So, fellow shoppers, here are some measurements that you might find useful.The shape of this pen is a regular hexagon. Each section (side) of the hexagon is about 32\\" long. From edge to edge, it's about 57\\" across (so if you have one side flat up against a wall, the other side will be about 57\\" from the wall)."},{"rating":"2","title":"SuperyardXT","review":"My son is 7 months old, and has just started crawling and rolling all over the house.

I havent brought it outdoors yet but I know this product is waterproof. Knowing that I can extend it and make it bigger is also very good.The only thing that concerns me is him trying to climb over it, and the gate falling BUT I've tested it many times, it looks sturdy and big enough it probably isn't possible.The price is a plus too, I've seen many other yards like this, this one is more economical."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful product that you should consider!","review":"My 8-month old loves to crawl to the fire place and this yard has been a life saver!

I could take a nap in there without worrying a bit knowing that my daughter is playing next to be me safely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superyard DANGER!!","review":"Be very careful when setting up and breaking down this product because pieces of it can snap off.

Unfortunately, after setting it up (yes, properly!), he could easily shake and knock it over. Giving up on that idea, I decided to use it as a play yard. It was too large for our living room set up in this fashion, but he could also push on it and it would come up off the ground about an inch on the opposite side. Although it didn't fit our needs, I tried to look at the product objectively and I'm not too impressed. I guess for smaller babies it's a really large playpen, but you better have the room!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't pen me in, Mom!","review":"Nice concept, and I'm sure it works wonders for some babies. Unfortunately, my 9 month old wouldn't have anything to do with the Superyard. He recognized it as a containment system and refused to play in it for even a few minutes. If your baby is mellow and content to play in one place, this may be your product. I suspect that more active babies like mine will not like the Superyard. As a side note, this product is rather ugly and industrial looking..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definite Safey Hazard!","review":"We've had this for less than a year. We were OK with it for a few months, until our daughter got more active. It never seemed all that sturdy. The carpet grips don't work well - at about 11 months, she was able to push the whole thing around. We had been using it for our pets, but recently we were folding it up (never had trouble with that part before) and it broke at all of the hinge areas, leaving many small, very sharp pieces of plastic in the carpet. Beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gate and play yard","review":"I was initially given this product as a gift for my 9 pound chihuahua. It's great in the sense that it contains him very well. He is very active and likes to jump very high, but he can not jump over the gate. He tries to push the gate in attempt to escape but the gate does not move. The gate is high enough so that he can not jump over. It contains his crate, wee-wee pad and food bowl with plenty of room for him to play around in. I bought a second one to use as a gate to keep him from going up our stairs. Very sturdy product and we plan on using this also when we have kids. One drawback is the gate is a little difficult to open at times in case you want to just walk in. But I guess that is the good thing also so who ever you have inside can't get out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life saver!","review":"When our son started rolling into chairs, we knew we needed something to keep him safe. This play yard fits great in our living room, yet there's plenty of room for him to roll around in all directions. Also, I like that it's see-thru. You can see your baby (and he can see you) from across the room. I don't care that it's not the most attractive thing. It was affordable and it does the job. And when our son starts crawling, we can completely close it and know that he won't be able to sneak off. One suggestion I would make to the manufacturer though would be to pad or provide padding around the bottom, about six inches high. My son falls asleep with his head on the edge all the time (NOT very comfortable), and when I move him away from it, he wakes up. It'd be nice to not have to move him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps baby or puppy safe with ample room to play!","review":"This product is a godsend! I use it on a carpeted area for our 7 month old infant, so she can crawl around to her hearts content and be safe from wall outlets, small objects, etc. I am also planning on getting an extension, to make her play area even bigger. The 'Superyard XT' is also great for puppies, and more humane than crating them for hours. My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the gate that opens (so you can get in the 'Superyard') is awkward and somewhat difficult to work. There should be an easier swing open type gate on this thing, so that mommy or daddy can quickly enter and leave the play area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with Performance","review":"We purchased this gate to put around our Christmas Tree so that our 3 year old and 10 month old wouldn't hurt themselves on the glass ornaments. The gate was easy to set-up and has proven to be a sturdy solution for keeping the children away from potential danger(s) during the holiday season. We already have plans to use the gate in other areas of our home after the holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Saver","review":"My daughter is very active. We got this gate when she was about 6 months old, and have been using it ever since (she's 2 now). I haven't seen any plastic falling off of it as other reviews complained. I haven't been using it as a stand alone gate, though. We use it run between 2 objects to block off whole sections. It works wonderfully this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF MONEY!","review":"If you have a determined climbing toddler like my son, don't waste your time or money on this. The height is too low once the child gets to be 18 months or so and it is so lightweight that my son could easily push the whole thing around while inside it. We had the maximum 2 extension panels on it and he could move the whole thing around, which is not the type of safety and security you would expect a play yard such as this to provide. Unfortunately (and surprisingly), there are not too many other options out there! Someone please let me know if you find any!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak","review":"It is a great concept, but it is very unsturdy. When my child pulls herself up on it, it wobbles all over the place. She is only 9 months old and only 20 lbs, and it cannot bear the weight. True that it is not bolted to the ground as some reviews have suggested, but if it is for babies, it should be strong enough to hold a baby that pulls herself up on the fence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for us!","review":"We used the gate plus 1 piece from the extension kit to build a pen around our son's play area. My husband fastened the ends to the walls and it holds up well against our 11 month old! As far as being portable, it is not easy to break apart or angle the pieces, but when it's being used as a permanent fixture, it works great! It is strongest when the pieces are angled, not straight. Helpful hint: purchase online from that giant retailer everyone knows, MUCH cheaper there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extend or not to Extend","review":"I bought this for my home and office, since my 10 month old grandson visits 2x a week. It is wonderful, the only caution is that when you add additional extensions (we joined 1.5 superyards together)(and you will most likely need to, as it is not bigger enough without them) it is not as sturdy, so something to support it is necessary (put up against a wall or an ottoman on the outside to brace). Also, the only criticism I have is that it is difficult to disconnect when entering or exiting the play area. Overall, however, I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST play yard And Xmas tree Protector Ever!!","review":"I can't say enough great things about this item!! We love it so much we have 2 and will be getting a 3rd!! So versatile with oodles of uses. We used one last christmas to keep our 10 month old from pulling it over or eating ornaments! We then bought another set and put the two together for a super large play area in the basement (we used step 2, 3/4 inch 2x2 foam interlocking mats underneath it for safety) And now mom and dad can use the exercise room and our now 21 month old can play safely. We are planning to buy a third set to put around the fireplace (with some manipulation)and hauling the sets from the basements upstairs to go around this years christmas tree. We have had these for quite sometime and i have not found any real negatives to speak of. It is a great product at a great price with a tremendous resale value on ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Review","review":"This gate certainly comes in handy. It's versatile and light-weight. I like that you can remove sections to scale for different needs. I think my favorite part is the height. It's a little lower than most safety gates, making it easy to hop over.However, I always struggle when adjusting the position of the sections. My husband eventually broke one piece trying to fold it. It really resists popping into place at times. So I'm not sure I could recommend it if you plan to open and close it often. It's best when set up and left alone.Having said that, we'd be lost without it to keep our son away from the TV. I'd love to find an easier (and prettier) solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for use with toddlers, especially more than one!!!","review":"We have three toddlers, ages 4,3,and 14 months. We bought this for our living room and also outside for our 14 month old, as he refuses to stay in his tot block playpen! We bought this superyard yesterday and set it up in the living room. It was virtually impossible to get into the \\"hexagon\\" position. everytime we would adjust one angle, another would pop out of place. Once we finally got it in something vaguely resembling the picture on the box, we put our son in. All was well until he stood up. Even on the carpet he was able to push the whole yard around at will. When our 3 and 4 year olds joined him it was like demolition derby! They moved it all over the place, knocking over whichever sibling was not holding on to the same side!! It is currently collapsed and sitting on our porch! We will try it outside this evening, but based on the other reviews I have read, I don't expect that it will perform much better outdoors..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe for very active babies","review":"my son never liked to be held very much. He was walking well at 9 months..pretty much skiped crawling....climbed out of his playpen at 10 months...by 12 months he could push this play yard around and 13 months could pick it up and crawl under...we have an old house so my husband used some boards and nailed it to the floor within a month he could climb out of it...now he's 15 months and can climb in and out of it at will...he thinks it is a game...the holes in this are prefect for little toes to use for climbing and if my son didn't have more ballance he could have busted his head falling from this...if you have a quiet child this might work for a while... but don't spend the money if your child shows early signs of being very active. Maybe you can find something that has up and down bars only more like a safety gate that little feet can't use for climbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for younger infants only...","review":"I bought this product the day my son first threw himself head-first out of his exersaucer. It seemed sturdy and large enough to keep him confined for those moments when you need to make a bed, take a shower, etc. Anyway, my little 13-month immediately started walking with it -- pushing it all over the place. He also warped the one side, thus preventing it from forming a circle. To make matters even worse, he flipped the entire thing over this morning and got out (guess who climbed the stairs and met me in the bathroom?)Not a good product for older infants. Strongly suggest for use by 6-9 month olds. For older infants, maybe a good old-fashioned playpen (if you can find one!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Money!","review":"This thing was horrible! I wish I never bought it. It is extremely heavy and not meant to be opened and collapsed regularly. I wanted something that I could use during the day for my rapidly mobile 1-yr-old. Then, after he went to bed we could collapse the gates. Not so! It took me almost 30 minutes of grunting and sweating before I could arrange the gates in the proper shape. By then, I had no interest in collapsing it again. Maybe the joints get less stiff with extended use. I don't know. All I know is that this thing is collecting dust in my house since I had no time to drag it to the post office to return it! Don't waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"came filthy right out of the box","review":"we got this as a shower gift for our twins...it is fine except that it came filthy in the box and it is very difficult to wipe down because of all the little indents and patterns in the plastic. it seems insane that a child's product would come so filthy straight out of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER superyard!","review":"This is a great product! We bought this when my son was 5 1/2 months old. He was rolling everywhere and he learned how to stand and was getting into everything! Whats great about this is that you can get in there with him. It has more than enough room to play. My son is so curious and at least now I know when he is in there he cant get into to much trouble :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is ok","review":"I recently purchased this gate, its okay, but its not as sturdy as it looks, its moves around and can be moved by my child. I'd think twice before I purchased this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"This is the best product of its type, and it is ver easy to use.I have a 16 months daughter and she needed this gate because she is walking now and it is impossible to try and control her all the time, so whenever I put her into this playard, she can walk and do the things she love. So far I have no complaints and I am happy I spent the money in such great product.I can use it also as a wall (I mean, I do not close it) when I don't want my daughter to walk to the kitchen or other room in the house, it has worked great because she hasn't fiigured out yet how to push and pass through the gate (the gate is not easy to push though; it is very sturdy and firm,) but in the meantime is a great alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good piece of gear","review":"We bought this to protect the Christmas tree from little hands.

From encouraging cigar smoking for new dads (yuck!) to relieving your child's colic fit by dumping them off with a babysitter for a few hours (sorry, but I would stay with our baby and comfort him rather than drive off to a restaurant with my wife and worry about whether or not the babysitter is calming him down yet), this text is a not-helpful guide for new dads.

The lineup is great, especially \\"She Don't Care About Time\\", but the sound is atrocious, even for Columbia Records, who were notably careless with their early cd releases. The songs are in mono, which is fine for a singles collection, but the sound is reminiscent of a worn-out cassette. Also... the liner notes ramble on about how much better the single version of \\"Why\\" is, but the version here is the album one, from Younger Than Yesterday. Sony really needs to clean this mess up, or get it off the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mono rules!","review":"Just to add to what others have said: if there are problems with this CD it is because of the digital transfer---it is not because of the original mono analogue tapes. I have the vinyl of this album and it is brilliant. The bass intro on Eight Miles High is full and deep, almost as deep as the original single---which I also have. Moreover that song does not have the treble on McGuinn's guitar dialled up to the max so that it completely dominates, as so many other recent issues of this song do. (I find this an annoying rewriting of history, making McGuinn disproportionately important in that song---as though Gene Clark and David Crosby were just there for the ride!)And on the subject of Crosby: Everybody's Been Burned has to be one of his finest moments. Just a beautiful song!What we really need is for CBS to do another transfer of this album and keep the whole thing as it was originally conceived---in glorious mono---but this time with the bass intact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play a song for me","review":"This CD features the a-sides and b-sides of The Byrds first eight singles. This is great stuff. Even the b-sides are good. The songs are in the original mono, but the sound quality is not the best, since this was released in the early days of CD technology. But it is listenable, so if you aren't that hung up on sound quality, it is a good buy. Oh, by the way, don't bother looking for \\"Volume 2\\", because they never released it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Bad Sound!!!!!","review":"First off, this cd may have been released in several versions, or also in a remastered edition. My version is Columbia CK 37335. The sound is simply dreadful. The music has been subjected to massive treble cuts in order to hide faulty source material on nearly all the tracks. The highs waver in and out on many of these tracks! The sound is unimaginably lifeless!! Too bad they didn't use better tape sources, or even the original vinyl on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound could be better, but the album rocks","review":"I relistened after reading the comments about the mastering of this, and I have to admit the complaints are reasonable. I had gotten past it by just cranking the bass a little in the equalizer, and accepted that the voices were a little, just a little, muddy, but not enough to keep me from enjoying the album tremendously. Someone suggested having CBS reissue using the original mono and just leave it at that. I probably would buy the album on CD again if they would do that. So much good music here.

Her magnificent pianissimo's building into crescendos the to decrescendos is really something to experience.Supported by Franco Corelli, Giulietta Simionato, and the magnificent voiced Ettore Bastianini - ALL in superb voice and all performing at the same highest level of Olivero. The conducting is fast paced, and like Olivero, makes the most out of the score.Oddly enough, audiences and great artists have always taken great pleasure from this opera despite he music snobs and opera house managements who have always considered Adriana Lecouvreur to be something of a \\"trash\\" opera.

However, if you have significant experience and are looking for a new career path, this book offers very little in practical advice. Additionally, for something that is addressed to lawyers (or law students) this book borders on overly simplistic reading that would not be much different than any other \\"how-to\\" guide about getting your first job. As mine arrived from Amazon damaged, it was returned the same day it came."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-legal careers","review":"If you need to organize your thinking about why practicing law may be so disappointing for you and how the career path in which you have so much invested may not give you the meaning you want in your work, this is a good place to start. The book also helps to identify which skills that you possess as an attorney are applicable to other jobs and how to describe and packsge those skills on a resume. If you have no idea of what alternatives exist to lawyering, there is a good basic list of suggestions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic and general","review":"I was very disappointed after reading this book. All the information contained in this book was something that anyone could gather if they had the ability to think a little, and I think if the book was targeted to law students/lawyers, it's safe to assume that they all can.The first part of the book mainly defined what a lawyer is and provided general guidance about how to find a job, which doesn't differ from any other job book. The second part of the book listed alternate careers, and they are just that: a list of careers with a short description. I found the little personal stories included in the book very unrealistic and atypical, hence offer no inspiration. I did not relate to any one of them, personally.In sum, if you can think of where you've worked at and what type of work experience you have had, try to find a position in that field/industry, and use your law degree to your advantage. That's pretty much the usefulness of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I could have written this book.

Most of the selections are not very long but some, like my favorite Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring, is long enough to play for a solo. I play harp at the bedside of the sick, so having these themes available in fake-book form allows me to easily create a scrapbook of selections. The chord format shortens the space that the music takes up. It also eliminates page turns. The music provided is advanced-beginner /intermediate: depending on your level of proficiency you can make the music as complex as you desire. Using the book, I can get to the heart of the themes of each piece without having to play lengthy movements."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful and versatile book... and fun!","review":"Our staff and I accompany ballet and modern dance classes for a university dance program and area ballet schools.

Never before have I felt so moved by characters and truly felt their love and need for each other.

The guy pulls a gun on her and makes her kiss him. But because she likes it it's romantic. Had she any self-resptect she would have thrown him out, wounded or not!

However, I really found the themes distasteful. Being verbally abused and being forced to kiss someone at gun point is not foreplay. I couldn't continue after that scene. If a man ever treated me this way, I would run far, far away, and never look back. The myth that bad boys are bad only because of past bad experiences but become good because of the love of a good woman tells women to tolerate rude, offensive, and even abusive behavior.

Inspiration for Spinal Tap??","review":"Surely this band was one of the models for Spinal Tap. They sound like they're making a joke of themselves on their 70s glam-rock tunes, and like tired old geezers on their 50s retro songs. Truly awful stuff, folks. This recording will have no interest to anyone other than those who grew up with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Perhaps they do things differently in New York state than they do in Arizonia, but this book's activities and ideas are [useless for me.]Problem Number One: Yes, sometimes a substitute teacher will go in with virtually no plans, but generally the teacher's planbook is open and available and anyone can figure out how to proceed with the daily tasks. Rapport builders, and your own activities are not needed, there is work to be done.Problem Number Two: The discipline section was the main reason that I purchased this book. Yet, the very few pages about it recommended ridiculous advice. It is NOT a good idea to give attention to a troublemaker and let HIS good behavior earn the rest of the class \\"free time\\". Also, this whole \\"free time\\" concept is outlandish. The children when not assigned a task or activity go wild. Letting them \\"talk quietly\\" is a complete joke....I was really disappointed with it and have returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works surprisingly well","review":"I was skeptical when I first opened the package, but this sensor works great! Initially, to program it to my dialer, I just dipped it in a sink full of water. Once that was done, I installed it in my basement with the sensor just touching the floor. I then took a small glass of water and sloshed it so that there would be a thin film of water under the sensor and by golly, she triggered and sent the RF signal upstairs to the dialer! Very satisfied with this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffalo Jerky","review":"We have tried different types of jerky and my husband and really like the flavor of this brand.

It is a little pricy so we only eat it occasionally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar in Beef Jerky","review":"Short and Sweet: this beef jerky is quite sweet, compared to commercial jerky. In a one ounce portion, there are seven (7) grams of carbohydrates. For those on a low-carb diet, that is a significant amount.I notice that in the more \\"natural\\" jerkies, they tend to use more sugar. Perhaps it helps the texture and make the jerky a little less likely to dry out.It does show this on the label, which Amazon makes available, so don't make the same mistake I did and buy impulsively.If you are trying to find a beef jerky without preservatives, and from animals raised without antibiotics, etc, then this product is acceptable, if a little sweet. But if you are on a high protein diet, avoiding carbohydrates, then beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste but some portions were a bit dry","review":"I've always thought buffalo jerky is much better tasting that beef jerky, as well as being leaner, and hence better for you. This buffalo jerky doesn't disappoint in the flavor department. It is slightly sweet, and has a very nice texture. However, some of the portions were a little dry and hard for my taste. There are also the occasional pieces of fat that I found in one bag. That is the disadvantage of buying 8 bags at a time online; you can't visually inspect what you're getting and not select bags that contain too much fat. You can contact Golden Valley and they will replace any bag that has too much fat for your taste, but expect 2-3 weeks before they'll deliver the replacement bag. Still, better customer service than most companies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"This buffalo jerky is incredible! It's really tasty, and not too chewy, and not too hard. Probably some of the best I've ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sweet and poor quality","review":"I opened a package of this and the first bite was overpoweringly sweet.

He is a loser who lies to her, can't keep a job, is married, and blames everyone else for his problems. He takes his anger out on Zora and basically turns her well-ordered life into hell. It's as though she thinks she doesn't deserve any better. This is a depressing novel throughout (although lots of housecleaning takes place), and I can't find anything to recommend it, except perhaps some woman will read it and learn from Zora's mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Reading 1","review":"Purchased several good books to read over the summer. Did not to watch a bunch of reruns on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I thought \\"Diappearing Acts\\" was one of the best books I have ever read. It was thought provoking, entertaining, and most of all:real. I think McMillan did an superb job of capturing the chemistry, power and passion of the Black man and woman's relationship. I believe this book represented many different Black couples relationships......I felt Zora... The only thing is that I wish she had gave the the ending more closure more of a wrap-up.....But overall I think the book is the best McMillan has written and this wonderful piece of work should be developed into a film project."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this book.","review":"Disappearing Acts, is a touching journey to what happens when you let someone in your heart. Zora, was looking for order and stability, but she stumbled across Franklin. What do you do when someone rocks your world? Logic and common sense fight a tough fight. When you're in control of your feelings it's so easy to do the proper thing, but when your heart leads look out. McMillan describes emotions like few others can. Franklin was quite a character but he knew it and he was struggling to right himself. This book was real no matter how much it angered you, Zora reacted the way most women in love do. We see what we want to see, and we're nuturers, that's just the way it is. Of all Terry's books,I liked this one best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book makes me mad!","review":"As a self-respecting woman I say don't take that from anyone. McMillan seems to find romance where most people would find disillusionment. The main character is pathetic. I just wanted her to kick the man to the curb and get on with her life. Then the book might have been redeemed."},{"rating":"1","title":"review of Terry McMillan's Waiting to Exhale","review":"I thought the ending of this book was so disappointing that it really affected the entire story which was a really good read until then. I am disappointed and surprised that the author chose to keep together a man who had actually raped his girlfriend. It also surprises me that so many people are so in love with this book. People do change but there was no realistic explanation of how Franklin was now worthy of trusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry McMillan has done it again!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Disappering Acts by Terry McMillan is a great tale of how two strangers became lovers.Zora is a single independent woman who is trying to get her music carrer up and jumping.So she moves to manhatten in search of a new life.Where she meets franklina a man who is seperated with two kids. He is the mandingo man who is working on her new manhatten apartment.Zora and franklin get together in make turns for the bad and worst but also the better .You'll only find out if you read Dissapering Acts by Terry Mcmillian .A 5 star book.

However, I brought this book with me on an extended vacation to fill some of the lulls. Well, I was bored one evening in a hotel room in Rome. I picked it up to read a few pages. Then I read a few more. I could not put the book down! At three o'clock in the morning I finished the book in a huff. I wanted more!! This is one of the best books I ever read.The protagonist seems like a composite of many man. I recognized so many that I know personally in his character. Very well done, Ms. McMillan."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I am a big fan of Terry McMillan, but I left this book disappointed, and perhaps even annoyed and insulted. I love the strength and self-reliance that Terry allows her female characters. However, I found the main character, Zora, to be unassured, too pleasing, too forgiving, and overall weak. This character was very disappointing coming from Mrs. McMillan. Not to mention that I ended up LOATHING Franklin, who was never truely justified in any of his awful actions towards Zora, his 'love'.I left this book very annoyed and disgusted with the end result. I'm hoping for more strength in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid and superficial","review":"This book unfairly represents women (and men) as shallow, weak, and souless characters. An overwhelming emphasis on the appearances of everything and every person didn't do much to disguise that the book is weak.

Let the black writers who are really good writers get published instead of these who fill the troughs of romance novel readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Terry's Best...","review":"work to date. I first read this book in 1994, and in the year 2007, I still consider it to be her BEST stuff!!!I loved both Franklin and Zora.

I particulary loved having a front row seat to their individual thoughts as their relationship progressed.Their story is a true testament of how easy it is to lose yourself in another when in love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and a waste of time and money","review":"Definitely geared towards a specific audience. The only reason I finished the book was because I didn't want to waste my money not reading it. 90% of the time I wanted to throw the book down due to disgust at the undeveloped characters.I would not recommend this book to anyone who hasn't been in a really rough relationship who can't see clearly because of \\"love\\".A much better Terry McMillan book is A Day Late and a Dollar Short."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappearing acts","review":"Enjoyed this novel to a certain extent. Disappearing Acts was good but wasn't as great as A Day Late and a Dollar Short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searching and finding","review":"Terry Mcmillan wrote an excellent book chronicling the love and life of two extraordinary people. In searching and finding love, it's easy to accept and reject those that do and do not fit our \\"ideal\\". However the union of two people as different as Zora and Franklin shows that the union of hearts and minds knows no reason, they just follow their hearts. Yes, Zora is the quintessential woman but Franklin is a diamond in the rough. Yeah, the brother is intelligent yet uneducated, he is artisitic yet lethargic and yes, he's got his share of flaws. However, he is so human, a product of his environment and surroundings, his negative attributes stems from a less than idylic family but he has heart, a great heart that wants to love and be loved. That is what connects Zora and Franklin."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Author really has knowledge for detail","review":"This was a great book, she depicted a true romantic story between people of color. The movie was on cable network recently and it was excellent. I could relate to it, some parts of the movie hit home. On the second time around (watched it a few times) my husband watched it with me. At first he kind of pretended he really didn't get into it by reading his newspaper, but he put the paper down and really showed interest. After the movie was over he asked if I still had the book. Unfortunately, I passed the book on to a relative, who also passed it on, and on. I have to give it to the Author she knows her stuff.

Perhaps if you're in a certain sort of mood, I don't know. But it does perfectly capture a chilly winter atmosphere.What I love are the circles in each illustration that draw your attention to some random item in the picture or to something relating to what you're seeing. There's no strict story here but it's possible to imagine some sort of bigger picture to the ominous and vague situations.There's one bit where a person in a fur coat is standing near a winding stream with rays of sunshine breaking through bits of the grey sky, and the insert zooms in on a big ghostly hand in a sunbeam pointing to a spot in the stream with the accompanying text, \\"A fugitive and lurid gleam/Obliquely gild the gliding stream.\\" Rich in symbolism? Nah, probably just nonsense.

There is only one practice test in this book, not two as the other reviewer said. The explained answers in the other book were a big help on the test, but this book has no explained answers.

My long-haired Springer loves to ride shotgun in my convertible, and this seat cover is great for protecting my beige leather seats from both dirty paws and dog hair. It goes on quickly (15 seconds) and stays put. And it comes off just as quickly if a 2-legged friend needs a ride. I just pull it off, roll it up and toss it in the trunk, and my human passengers don't get dog hair on their clothes. The seat cover is a very similar color to my seats so it isn't that noticeable. I highly recommend it for any pet owners who let their 4-legged friends ride in the front seat. Don't forget to get the seat harness, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"waterproof????","review":"I ordered these particuler seatcovers because they claimed that they were waterproof.

He can get into things & I wanted to be prepared for any spills, etc. To make a long story short, he tipped over my almost finished latte onto me & the drivers seat. I immediately pulled over & cleaned up the mess(about 1/4 cup total)! It blotted right up, but when I checked under the seatcover, it had leaked through in that short amount of time. The covers appear to be made of a strong material & they were easy to install, BUT they are not waterproof!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect solution for beast and man.","review":"We bought the rear seat cover for our dog and thought why not try this for our human passengers.

This was the perfect solution:- Inexpensive- Waterproof (at least for this application)- Easy to install/remove (takes less than 15 seconds)though i did make s slight MOD (explained below)MOD I made was to cut the inexpensive elastic installation straps in half and sewed in velcro to each side of the strap that I cut.

Butit does fit way better then the picture shows and is better quality then I thought it would be.So I went and ordered the second seat cover for the second bucket seat.

The investigators are not police detectives, but administrators in charge of security for the artistic genius Bruno Van Tysch, whose human \\"paintings\\" have been targeted by a killer.The story moves between the politics behind the investigation (not the police procedures but behind-the-scenes power struggles among different branches of Van Tysch's organization, and lots of talk about the money at stake if his priceless works are damaged or lost) and the experience of one human \\"canvas\\" as she is stretched, primed, sketched, and otherwise prepared to become a master work.Much of the novel is taken up with that process, and with the controversies surrounding humans-as-art. The investigators cannot even agree as to whether the torture and murder of one of Van Tysch's paintings was \\"sadistic\\"-- was she, after all, human, or only a canvas?Absorbing, complex, a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Do Not Waste Your Money!","review":"I do not write many reviews but you must be warned that this book is simply bad!

I hate that kind of subtle injection of material that really didn't apply to Kyle. Other than that, the videos are great. One more thing wrong, there was no final episode like they said there was.

It wasn't the concept that bothered me...I am in love with a show that sounds terrible when summarized (Battlestar Galactica). I think that anything can be made good through good production, directing, scripting and acting. I really didn't see anything in this show but cringe-worthy cheesy moments. I do have some guilty pleasures that are pure entertainment while not being very high quality (Dark Angel, Tru Calling) but I couldn't even be entertained by this.

On the metel sections of this album, you can hear his adapt chord blocks, and he has the magic fingers to play fast leads.But running in place on the upper neck does not make a great soloist, and that is what Buckethead does for most of his solos. There is no real archatecture at work, and there is nothing that seperates him from freeze dried 80s metel wackers. Yes, Verenon Ried employs some of the same techniques, but as part of a bigger, blues based whole.The concept of the album seems to be serial murder, and when Bucket is not scampering in the upper register, he rambles like a demented baby about playing with bodies all night. All this has a midly adolesent appeal, but it sure does not make a great free jazz album.This is flashy at first, then it just gets boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Shoes","review":"Item arrived quickly and I pleasantly surprised that the color was exactly as pictured and the size was perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, and More Wow!","review":"I picked up a DVD of this production in Berlin last year, and have watched it several times, and it has become one of my favorites. This DVD records an outdoor Summer 2005 production of DIE LUSTIGE WITWE (The Merry Widow) to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of its premiere in December of 1905. The text is complete, and the little nonstop joys of the libretto remain intact, unlike any other performance available on home video. That alone would make this DVD worthwhile, but in addition the staging is absolutely superb. A cast of hundreds enact an entire universe of precisely staged tableaux, while the spirit of Lehar energizes the musical team. At the same time, at the heart of all this, the feelings of the principal characters find real mutual chemistry. The sun goes down as the performance begins, and the fireworks at the end perfectly punctuate a great ensemble performance. Wow, and more wow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"An operetta is a musical production in which the songs are crucially important. If the sound is so poor that you hardly hear the singer, how can you possibly enjoy this? A typical Morbisch prodution has pathetic sound, and this Merry Widow is no exception. It is filmed on an outdoor stage with tiny microphones on each performer and it does not work. Act III at Maxim's does not feel Parisian at all. Choreography is poor or non-existent, dances do not flow. This Maxim's feels like an amateur 3-ring circus. There is no feeling between the performers and they are supposed to be in love! This version has tried to add some humor to the dialogue and it fails miserably. This is the very worst performance I have seen of the Merry Widow, either on stage in Europe or on tape.

I had this verified by comparing it to the Sirius One and my friend who has had Sirius since it began a couple years ago has ample experience with the fm presets and all.

I can read it fine at night. It was a very inexpensive unit (maybe free?), but absolutely not worth getting! I would gladly pay the $99 for the back-lit unit, just so I can tell what song is playing.

It's smart, sophisticated, fun, with a nearly-impossible blend of styles. It manipulates the listener trying to figure out the music's direction. It's not \\"sweaty\\" like GU 12 Buenos Aires, it's not like Renaissance Awakening, it's not even like This is Audiotherapy, it's... something like you've never heard before, and that you have to listen to many times before you can \\"get\\".Dave used to follow the trends and brillantly nail them as amazing mixes.

This book does not present any credible evidence to back up its claims, selectively quoting (or misquoting) testimony at the appeal while ignoring both the majority of the witness testimony at the latter trial and glossing over or excusing the well-documented illegalities of the original trial.There have been many other books which give a more substantive and accurate accounting of the Condemnation trial, including previous translations such as those by Scott and Barrett."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan of Arc","review":"Book is in perfect condition even though it is used.

It ground the first batch of beans, enough for 4 cups of coffee, with no problem. When I went to grind the 2nd batch this morning, the motor would not turn on. I had to tap the side of the grinder to get the motor to kick on. It has also managed to make a huge mess of ground coffee around the grinder, as the catch cup is alive with static electricity and is spews grind all over when you open the small container top. My wife hates the mess.This piece of junk, made in China, is being returned. Save yourself the aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"total disappointment","review":"Produces statically charged fine grounds that get everywhere. We've tried everything; it messes up the inside of my coffee maker and my counters. After a couple of weeks it started clogging up regularly.

Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing","review":"I owned this grinder for about a year. The grinder never adequately provided a coarse enough grind for my french press and I constantly had to shake it to coax the beans down into the grinder. It was a lot of work. I had been planning on buying a replacement when I pushed the ON button recently and it receded into the unit. It is now up-operational. I hate to flame a product but this is definitely the biggest piece of junk small appliance I have owned. Time for a Capresso or something else, for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last that long","review":"This grinder was OK in producing an even grind. Unfortunately it often jammed and ocassionally stopped working, even though I would not run it for more than a minute. (Maybe it overheated?) Half the time it would not start at all. Finally it refused to work at all when you pushed the button.The last time my husband tried to make coffee he pushed the button hard to get it to go and the button fell into the grinder. I think a 4 year-old grinder that wasn't used more than twice a month shouldn't have fallen apart like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets expectations","review":"We only grind and needed a second grinder for regular coffee. The krupps is quieter and very stylish. Holds a 1/4 pound of coffee. I was hoping it would hold more. Also the clinging of coffee to the side of the canister due to moisture or static is no better or worse than others. Overall a great purchase and would purchase another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time","review":"Not even slightly consistant. No matter how you set it the amount it grinds changes like the weather.Not to mention that the coarseness is virtually the same on any setting.That is, monday it's coarse, tuesday it's fine, wednesday it's like powder. Unless it's raining, snowing or sunny. Then all bets are off. I expected much more from the Krups name.Besides the power button breaking after about a year (just hit the switch with a pen or knife or whatever to make it work if yours is broken) the settings buttons are horrible.Once you grind 3000 pots you get an idea of where you want them set. But... seems no matter what you do there's a different amount of coffee ground each time you use it. No matter where you set it.And it's very easy to bump the settings if you move it and you'll never notice it. Thumbs down for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it at any price","review":"This is my second try at a burr grinder and I guess I'm going to have to pony up and buy a really expensive one now. This grinder is noisy, constantly jams, doesn't really produce different grinds of coffee (and if it doesn't do that what's the point?) and is unbelievably messy. Set at the coarsest grind still gives a really fine grind of coffee.

This early-morning coffee drinker needs a grinder thats a little more reliable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good for my purposes","review":"I received the grinder as a gift from my wife. It's primary use is to grind beans to use in my espresso maker. It doesn't grind the beans fine enough even on the finest setting. I have tried cleaning, taking it apart and putting it back together to no avail. I ultimately resort to grinding the beans twice or more which the instructions tell you NOT to do. But what else can I do, it doesn't make a fine enough grind. For now, I grind the beans where I buy them which sort of defeats the purpose of owning your own grinder. I'm going back to the drawing board to find a higher quality grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"It only looks cool!","review":"I have had this coffee grinder for going on 4 years now. This grinder has a trendy look to it, and doesn't take up a lot of countertop space. However, I spent $85 on this machine and it has not been worth the trouble. I haven't had a lot of trouble with the grinder it self, I like the different grinding settings and about every 6 months I have to take it apart and clean the grinding components. The mess it makes every time I remove the the grounded coffee is irritating, I end up with coffee grinds everywhere when removing the collection compartment. Frankly, I have tolerated it for all these years simply because I paid such a large amount, but I hate the mess it makes. Would I purchase it for the $30 it is now being sold for? NO, it simply makes to much of a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 months of experience","review":"I saw some very negative reviews for this grinder which caused me to comment - as my experience has been good. The product has 2 issues: 1) it will mysteriously not grind if the plastic container is not inserted fully. The light does not go on, and that's the clue. Once you figure this out and push the thing in fully, it works reliably. 2) it is not whisper-quiet. It's quieter than my prior Bodum, and I'm not standing around the kitchen listening to it, so that's not a big issue for me. Other than those issues, the product is a good value, holds a lot of beans and keeps them fresh for a few days (by which time, I've consumed them), and I get no spillage nor mess. I use Cafe Filtre and am able to get the exact coarseness I need. There may be better products out there, but I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go cheap-it's awful","review":"My son and I were about to put this in our cart a few weeks back, when upon further scrutiny we decided against it because the the bean hopper was much smaller than the model we were replacing, and we just had a general feeling we would not be happy with it. Well the next week my husband and I passed it again in Costco, and decided to give it a try. It is going back today and here's why.1) we could not get a course grind from it--It states 17 grind settings but, the course grind looked closer to an espresso grind, nowhere near what we are use to for french press and drip.2) we could not keep it grinding without holding the lid down.3) the lid over the hopper is stuck and we can't open it fearing that it will snap and break. Don't let the Costco and Amazon low price entice you . . . you'll be sorry.If the lid wouldn't have stuck, I would have rated it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"We've had this grinder for a couple of weeks and are very disappointed given the Krups brand.1) Nowhere in the instructions does it state that the hopper lid must be held down to begin and during the grinding process.2) For no apparent reason, grinding stops before the desired amount of coffee is ground. This requires starting another grinding cycle.Trouble is, one can't be sure if the proper amount has been ground since bean measurement isn't necessary. Lots of guessing.3) Grinder apparently jams as the burr has a whirring sound, but no coffee is distributed. I can only assume that there is a bean jammedsomewhere within as other reviewers have stated. However, I'm not going to the trouble of disassembling as this grinder is going back.Glad the 20% or so of happy reviewers have had a positive experience but given the statistics, they got lucky. I wouldn't risk it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and short lived.","review":"Had originally given a positive review, but then it burned up after 6 months of once daily use.It would 'grind' to a halt on harder beans like robusta. Finally it actually started melting.grind consistency was uniform. The bean hopper may have been antistatic, but the grounds collector certainly was not. Grounds would literally fly all over the place as you poured them out.VERY noisy, especially at 4 a.m.would not buy again, even on sale. Spend the extra money and get something a little beefier (I did)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups Grinder--","review":"Bought the Krups GVX212 grinder about 3 months ago.

The motor is a loud high pitch whine at a very high speed--the heat can't be doing the coffee any good. The coffee grinds exit the grinder thru a Chute into the side of the half-round receptacle, which do to the poor seal, gets ground coffee everywhere. The materials are all plastic and suffer from static cling that requires washing after each use. I also have a Kitchen Aid PRO (at summer place) that performs much better but at a much higher price--but worth every dime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for with this machine.... maybe....","review":"I've been using mine for a few weeks. The unit is a bit tempermental in that the top has to be on \\"just right\\" or the grinder won't come on. Probably a safety feature gone vigilant. No matter how many cups (measurement) I set to grind it always grinds the same amount, so I have several tablespoons of coffee left over leaving me with three options - drink way more coffee than I want, throw away the extra, or make the next batch with \\"old\\" grind....hmmm. But the thing that makes me the most crazy about this little creature is the mess it leaves on the counter every time I pull the receptacle out after grinding. Haven't figured out how to keep all the dust from landing on my white counters - I guess I could unplug it and carry it over to the sink. Too much work for me first thing in the morming... I've owned a cuisinart grinder and this one has a much more uniform grind and is a bit quieter. But I'm thinking to return it and try another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going in the Trash","review":"Ok, it does grind beans - and it does that part well. But in the process, it generates so much static electricity that the grinds are everywhere - all over the grinder, the counter, and you.It might work well in a humid climate - I don't know - but it sure makes a mess in a dry climate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have had innexpensive grinders that have lasted a long time. This grinder was purchased in January thru Amazon - A2Z Home Center.I had to leave a message and have not been called back. The grinder just stopped cold and will not start again. I am the sole user, I take good care of it, so it has not had heavy use. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky beans","review":"In addition to grinding too much coffee for a given cup setting, I had a significant issue with beans getting stuck in the hopper and not continuing to feed into the grinder. I had to repeatedly shake or smack the machine to get the beans to flow again. It went back to the store 2 days later ;-/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor build quality","review":"I got this grinder because it seemed ridiculous to pay three or four times the price for the nice industrial-strength Kitchen Aid grinder that I saw sitting next to it on the shelf. After a few months of using it, I know why it's cheaper -- it continually fails, even on fresh, oily Peet's beans. As another reviewer noted, when it jams, you have to unload the whole thing into a bowl, disassemble it, note disconcertingly that the insides are made of plastic, and put it all back together.And in actual use, this grinder leaves the largest countertop coffee-ground piles of any grinder I've used.It's extremely frustrating and I wish I'd bought the Kitchen Aid to start with. Poor build quality, short lifespan, and poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for fine grind coffee","review":"The uneven coarse grind is OK for a French press, where the water will stay on the grind for a while. It is not acceptable for a drip coffee maker (especially the MoccaMaster), where the grind needs to be uniformly fine. The company was unable to offer any useful suggestions. Mine goes into the trash this week, after a year of trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this one","review":"Used it four times before it permanently quit on me; each time grinding about half a pound of coffee. Unlike other reviewers who claim that the grind was too coarse, my Burr was too fine in the high setting, and just like talcum powder in the fine setting. Save your money and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent grind, annoying safety features","review":"Received as a wedding gift and honestly liked it at first. Gave a good consistent grind for daily coffee and occasional espresso. Then the annoyance and frustration began...The hopper is way too small and requires you to fill it every couple of days. In doing so you must make sure the cover engages with two sensors that make sure it is closed. Overfill the hopper and you're hosed. Get some wayward grinds or dust into the sensors, no coffee for you!The outflow container suffers from the same problem - two little sensors to tell the machine no coffee will fly everywhere. I don't know how many times I cleaned it out just to get a day's coffee only to need to clean it out a few days later. Don't even try to clean the grinding elements, unless you want more frustration.We have since switched to the Cuisinart DBM-8 - loud as a jet, but over 18 months of problem-free grinding (and cheaper too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"good grind but doesn't last too long","review":"this is tne second burr coffee grinder I bought, neither one lasted too long.

I do like the flavor from the burr coffee grinders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has it's moments","review":"The first time we used this grinder we were not impressed. Then we realized that to tighten the grinding apparatus you must turn it counter-clockwise. O.K. we now have that problem solved, but there are other problems with this grinder. First of all, the coarsest level is still pretty fine. I would have preferred a grind not as fine. This is not a problem for some people, just my personal preference. The biggest problem is that the darn thing quits grinding for some reason. I don't know if it's jammed or it gets too hot, but it just stops. Then I have shake it, or change the coarseness of the grind or just wait until it cools down. It becomes very frustrating especially when you're in a hurry. On the plus side, every ground is a uniform size. There are no large chunks of coffee mixed in with dust. Personally, I'm disappointed that I used a large chunk of a gift certificate on this item. It's definitely not worth more than about $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, mine broke too.","review":"Got this as a gift and it worked well for about two dozen uses over the course of two years (we're sporadic about our coffee drinking...). Then, as many others have noted, the power button ceased working. It just would not turn on. There were no jams, no grounds build-up and everything was secured in the correct closed position - just no go.Krups responded with a form email about packaging and sending it insured at my expense to one of their service centers with proof of purchase. Since it was a gift, and a year out of warranty, I'm out of luck. I'd have to spend $50 shipping it both ways anyway.Rather than spending the bucks for a quality burr grinder, I'll probably go back to a cheapie. Skip the Krups."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not great, and then it failed","review":"I owned this for about 1 year before it ultimately failed. I would rate it, when working, as 3 star--it did produce a grind of coffee that you could tailor to your needs. Fine was very fine, near powdery, coarse was definitely coarse. But it was not a real even grind. For example on the coarser grinds you'd still get some powdery stuff (makes a notable difference when you're using a press pot). Cleaning was a pain. You had to do it pretty frequently and it was a messy bother. It is distinctly cheaper than some of the competition, though, and I would have been content if not totally happy with it except that it broke. Just gave up the ghost one day. Stopped grinding. That send me out to buy a comparably priced Capresso, which I'll not review here except to say that it did not hold up, either. That brought me to the higher priced Capresso (the \\"Infinity\\" Conical Burr Grinder), which has been an absolutely FABULOUS grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"One grind grinder","review":"This coffee grinder ground coffee the same consistency despite the setting.

Once they break, you may as well throw the grinder in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Bought this and brought it home looking forward to trying a burr grinder and shelving my blade grinder. Assembled it per directions, loaded the hopper with beans, set the grind at medium, set for 12 cups, turned on, motor spun, got about 1 tsp very fine powder. Emptied bean hopper, disassembled, cleared jam, carefully reassembled, reloaded hopper, set for coarse grind and 12 cups, turned on and it ground every bean in the hopper into extra fine unusable powder, made a real mess all over everywhere. Cleaned up, disassembled and carefully reassembled again, loaded hopper, another whole hoppers worth of beans ground into ultra fine dust, static cling and another big mess. Disassemble, clean up, rebox, and return. Ordered the Breville for 40 dollars more from Amazon and couldn't be more pleased. My recommendation is don't waste your time with this Krups."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ground about one teaspoon's worth, then quit feeding the beans","review":"Given that Krups does a good job on coffee makers, we expected this burr grinder to be good. Unfortunately, it was terrible. It ground a small amount of beans, then just quit feeding them down into the grinder. It would keep spinning until the timer ran its course, but would not grind any more beans. I spoke at some length with a Krups customer service representative, and all he could conclude was that the grinder must be defective. We returned it and bought another, this time from a local store. The second grinder had exactly the same problem. So we gave up on it and will not try a third Krups grinder. We've had a Braun burr grinder for years. It's noisy as the dickens and a bit of a nuisance to empty, but at least it does the job. Unfortunately, Braun no longer seems to have a burr grinder on the market. So we'll upgrade to a better model, as soon as we can find one under $200 that does not seem to have serious reported drawbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of JUNK","review":"This grinder is a piece of JUNK. My unit broke one month and one day after I bought it. The beans often get stuck in the hopper and won't fall into the grinder area - then the machine just runs at full speed.

Yeah, it may be quieter than others, yeah it may have a plenty of space to hold the beans,but what a mess. The plastic container inside the machine leaves coffee powder on the counter when it's removed from the machine. The lid of that container spreads coffee dust all over when it's removed from the plastic container and then you have to pour the container into the coffee machine or your coffee ground canister. This is a poor design. The best grinders have a simple container that does not leave ground coffee dust all over the counter. Keep shopping..............

On either the second or third bag of coffee the motor burned up while grinding. Now we had to send it off to a service center. They called and said that we would get a new one from Krups. After more than two weeks we are still waiting. We always ground 2 pounds at a time with the old grinder but I guess with the new components this machine is just not up to it.

I use locally roasted custom blend coffee and I like it to be consistent. I started using this grinder in place of a cheap $15 blade grinder. This unit works very well for my application. roughly 4 cups/day. It only took a couple of tries to get the grind like I need it for my single cup brewer. Cleaning is really no big deal, takes only a couple of minutes. The only thing I would change would be the volume, it is a bit loud when I am up at 4:30am making coffee and trying not to wake the kids. However, for the price, I don't really have much to complain about in that area I guess. This unit does as advertises - it grinds coffee consistently and the auto-shut off part is cool too so I don't have to hold the button in the whole time it is grinding. For <$40, I recommend it for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read all the reviews","review":"I purchased this grinder about four years ago, and it finally died this week. It would have a hard time on the fine grind settings, so by default I had to set it almost fully coarse in order for it to work. Other reviewers noted that it makes a mess when you remove the ground coffee container - true; and that it tends to get stuck at time - also true. It is also a pain to clean. Save your money on this unit and either get one of the blade grinders, or bite the bullet and get your beans ground at the store.

I bought this coffee grinder after reading online about the benefits of burr ground coffee. We managed to get one batch of decaf out of it but that batch was a little lite because some of the beans got stuck in the hopper and caused the motor to run for a while without beans in it. After about 5 seconds they vibrated loose and started to grind again. The coffee was good. The next morning the beans continued to jam up grind, jam up, gind, etc... Then it shut off. Most of the beans were still in the hopper so I pushed the button for it to run again and nothing happened. I read the manual and found out that if the motor stops running then the motor fuse has tripped and the unit must be taken to a service center. In my opinion this unit is a piece of junk and shoud be avoided!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"This is the first review I've written for anything.

First of all, the SECOND time i used it, the grinder was running, yet the beans wouldn't go down into the grinder and it just whizzed away (which by the way, will throw off your cups measured if it thinks it's grinding and it's not). I had to knock on it just to get the beans to grind. THEN, the even on the coarsest setting, the ground coffee was WAY too fine. Just like baby powder. It made horrible coffee that was very bitter.

I have to clean up the area after each use.2) the fineness selector is perpetually stuck on FINE or VERY FINE. It always seems to make a fine powder that gets everywhere around the coffee-making area.3) the No. of cups selector always gives a lot more coffee than you need, so you'll end up measuring anyway,I previously used a $15 grinder which only had an on/off button, gave me big chunks mixed with fine grind, didn't measure the coffee for me, but it WAS NOT messy at all.

It tends to grind on the finer side so just dial back a bit. I use this with a bialetta and a drip machine. Both require different grind size and always come out as desired. Drawbacks- cup selector is way to generous with grind amount, again dial it back...other wise this economic grinder outperforms my blade machine in performance and taste. I'm a grad student and typically grind twice daily. I have recently been using it to make Cafe de olla (trad. mex. coffee) on the stovetop and the results are amazing.

It's an electrical motor with a grinder attached in a housing with two separate compartments for before and after, not exactly complex. That shouldn't be a $100 item in today's market. I have had this for a about a month. I wish I had taken it back the first week when I still had the receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"Have almost always had Krups coffee makers and based on past use with them bought this burr grinder. Absolutely hate it - I don't know why they bother to put number of cups because this thing just grinds until it is empty - on the days it is willing to even start. It also grinds the beans all the same - want coarse, want fine, want a medium grind -- just use any setting because they all come out the same. And the mess is unreal. I really don't want to start my day cleaning out the sink or the counter or the floor because this stuff flys everywhere. If I could give it less than 1 star I would. If you are still considering this grinder buy it on Amazon as the price is the best. Unfortunately we purchased at a regular retail store and paid $[...] for this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on how fine you want your grounds","review":"Qualifying Statement - I only used it once.If you goal is espresso grounds, then it's a perfect grinder for you. If your goal is anything other than espresso grounds, this is not the grinder for you.At the coarsest setting, the grinder did not make grounds appropriate for drip machines. I did use them for that, but they were really too small, even bordering on grounds that are slightly larger than what should go in an espresso machine.We like to make a variety of coffee grounds, but this machine can not produce grounds big enough for drip machines and certainly not big enough for the french press. Espresso grind was fine.Everything else about the grinder was desireable. What a shame they didn't product test it before selling to consumers. With a small engineering adjustment to the width of grind space between the burrs, this could have been a great grinder. As it stands now, I sent it back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Grinder","review":"Many of the reviews complained about it not working properly, but my has functioned flawlessly. But if you do not have the bean resevoir lid down tight or the grind collector inserted correctly, the grinder's safety will not let it turn on. For the price this is a great deal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable and reasonably quiet","review":"I've used this coffee grinder for about a year with no problem. It grinds enough for 12 cups quickly without totally ruining one's hearing first thing in the morning.

Of course, being half asleep in the morning may account for that. . . .!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked properly","review":"Out of the box the product never ground the proper amount of beans.

After about a year (during which it has been cleaned regularly), it stopped taking beans into the grind mechanism - resulting in an uneven amount of ground coffee. In addition, it is also very messy - grounds get all over the place around the grinder while it is working, worse than other grinders I've used. Very frustrating... definitely not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for the price","review":"I had to return it. It does not grind well (as in coarse) enough for french press, makes a lot of dust instead. Receptacle container is made of cheap plastic that causes coffee grounds and dust cling to it.If you're looking for a garden variety grinder for medium fineness (for drip), $15 blade-type models would do the job for a fraction of price."},{"rating":"1","title":"grind select failed, then timer","review":"I bought this item about 18 months ago. After about a year of use, the grind selection failed, and it always produces a rather coarse grind. Then more recently the timer has stopped working, so I count to fifteen and turn it off by hand. This was a very inexpensive burr grinder, and while surely I was unlucky, it was too good to be true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked -- for a while","review":"I bought this grinder a little over a year ago when my previous grinder which I had used for over 15 years started acting funny. What a disappointment! I had always thought of Krups as a good brand overall. First it stopped grinding fine enough and it was on the finest setting and then about a month later it just stopped. So I worked on the old one some and got it back working for now. This was a bad choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Frustrating Than It's Worth","review":"As mentioned in other reviews, this machine has frequent hopper jams which is a fundamental design flaw.

Though \\"more than 10 different levels of fineness\\" claim is there, you only get unevenly coarse coffee/spice all the time. The container-plastic also somehow got ruined and is not transparent anymore. And if you want to grind very small quantities, it does not grind at all!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great grinding, Horrible static","review":"I bought this grinder because I wanted the ability to control the grind of my coffee better since I brew drip coffee during the week and french press on the weekends. I also thought having a bean hopper would be useful. I like the design and construction of this grinder and I have no complaints about the way it grinds coffee (although I wish the bean hopper were bigger), BUT I'm going to get rid of it as soon as I can because the static electricity is such a problem. I can't open the container where the grounds go without the static immediately throwing grounds all over my counter. I'm tired of my counters being constantly covered in a thin film of ground coffee. I'm done with it and this is going to the thrift store as soon as I find a suitable replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good for espresso","review":"I have this krupps burr grinder..

I am a little disappointed in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Grinder","review":"The First Krups grinder that I bought was dead out of the box.

This one takes up as little space as possible, and looks good, so I don't have to resent its existence every day. As noted by others, coffee beans have to be full to the max in the hopper or it makes a funny whirring sound (in short, there always has to be lots of beans in there).My gripe is that even at the coarsest setting, I find the coffee grinds to be too fine for the french press - makes super silty, muddy coffee (feels like it's cancer causing). I wonder if the more expensive grinders would be able to grind coarser than this, but oh well, I was too cheap.I bought the belgian filter / filtre belgique just to be able to get value out of this grinder, and that's been working well, although I miss the french press coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"KRUPS Burr Grinder GVX1-14 stopped working","review":"I bought my KRUPS Burr grinder through Amazon on April 26, 2005.It stopped working on August 31, 2005.

The first worked ok for a while. Most of the time, the beans jammed and stopped falling into the burr. Which was alright, just can't walk away. This also means that the cup measuring feature is useless. Then, the machine would work without the lid on it - with no apparent blockage on the lid saftety sensor. Then after 6 months, it died altoghether. Krups said they would possibly fix it if I sent it back at my cost. And then I am out of a grinder for a while. I regretfully opted to then try another one. Same problems with the second one, but luckily within the 30 day Amazon return policy. Back it went!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"After having a grind and brew that failed my husband and I decided it was best to go back to a seperate grinder. We found this one and gave it a go. First, the auto-shut off never worked properly. I had to manually shut it off each time I used it. The design of this grinder is terrible. The grounds go into the holder via a small opening in the back, which means that when you remove the container grounds spill onto the counter. The lid removes completely and makes another mess scattering grounds as static has built up along the plastic container. I could not leave this out next to my coffee maker and use it, I had to bring it over to the sink, remove the grounds container, empty it into another container, and then clean the mess up every time. After about 3 weeks, the on/off button stopped working. My husband asked me if I wanted to exchange it for a new one - no way! This design is terrible. I would never purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not produce a grind for a French press!","review":"As the title suggest if your buying this to grind for a french press you will be disappointed.

It plain old stopped working. It was three months out of warranty and I was told that we could send it in for repair, $35 minimum charge plus shipping.

In 2 years you may not be pleased.I purchased the Krups GVX2 coffee grinder a little less than 2 years ago. The grinder often did not completely grind my beans even if the settings were correct. I would need to shake the contents to complete grinding. A few days ago the motor slowed and then stopped working altogether. I am out $60 after a mere two years of use. I purchased the reliable and simply designed Krups 203 model which is less expensive and will last me many years.The coffee produced by the GVX2 is fine but not better than the more basic grinders. It is very disappointing when an appliance breaks after 2 years of normal use."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!! Bad Grinder.","review":"Krups does a great job with coffee makers. They should have stuck to what they do well. This is the worst coffee grinder I have ever had. After a few moments of grinding, this grinder will stop feeding beans into the grinding mechanism. You can shake it (which usually causes it to stop), you can remove and clean the grinding mechanism (as I just did)....Nothing helps. It grinds beans when it wants too and doesn't when it doesn't want to. Today it took 5 to 10 mins to grind the beans. Beating them between rocks would have been quicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but not for long","review":"I purchased this grinder on May 7 and by mid June, I'm having problems with it. The dial that regulates the amount of beans to grind does not work. It just keeps grinding until all of the beans are gone which totally defeats the purpose of having your own grinder. So I called Krups warranty center, and they happen to have a service center locally. They will get around to looking at it 7-10 days after they receive it. In respect to what others have said about static. I agree and LOTS of it. I purchased this machine for coffee grind but I can only imagine how it would be with a fine espresso grind. It's a very messy machine, if you don't mind having to clean the unit and the counter after each use then this won't be an issue for you. I can live with cleaning up after it but I'm really irritated that it has stopped working properly with light use as we only use it 3-4 times per week. In my opinion, a cheap rip-off, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many miss fires","review":"The grinder miss fires too often ( spins but is not catching the beans) I would not buy this again.

Coffee grind leaks and mess up my counter. I thought I didn't close the collection bin tight enough but seems like there is nothing I can do to fix it. I don't think I will keep the product and keep cleaning counter every time I use it. Fine grind is not fine enough so I guess it is only good for french press. Also, the upper cover is very hard to open. Lastly, the front panel around the power button produce heat when it is not in use. I believe the electric circuit is not properly engineered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed design","review":"This could have been a nice little grinder but it suffers from serious mood disorders. The power switch is inoperative for no reason that I can see.

Day three, I gave up after about 20 min. checking everything, I cleaned the despenser, both burs, and messed with the holding contaner and lid, nothing helped.

To begin, if there is a difference in the many coarseness settings, we can't see it. The coarseness seems to come out the same with every setting. Next, the plastic is extremely cheap and breakable. The plastic lid is already cracking and the drawer has chipped in several places. But the part that frustrates me EVERY day is when you pull out the drawer after grinding, coffee grounds fall all over the counter so you have to wipe up grounds every time you pull the drawer out. My last coffee grinder was a cheap $10 grinder and it worked great for years without any of the above complaints. Whomever at Krups designed this machine should be fired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor durability","review":"I've been through 2 of these in 2 years (the 2nd was on sale).

I'm sending this unit to the service center, hoping that the problem is fixed, or a replacement is sent. My opinion is that the \\"thermal fuse\\" has blown and it requires service at the Krups svc. center to fix it.

Even taking the lid off slowly and holding it over the coffee pot makes quite a mess. I have to put paper towels down all over the counter and still end up amazed at the mess.I called KRUPS customer service and was told that they have heard of this happening and that cleaning up after is a normal part of grinding coffee.

More irritating is the constant whirring with no beans grinding. I've taken it apart and cleaned it to no avail. The machine seems to want to be shaken to drop the bean in place, and even then, it frequently peters out before it finishes grinding, though it continues to whir.What a pain.

It doesn't work all the time right away (about 20% of the time). A few times I put the drawer back in and it started to grind by itself. I think the problem has to do with cutoff switch actuated by the drawer. However, just just taking out the drawer and re-inserting it doesn't always get the on/off to work.

As you know, you need a coarse grind for french press to prevent from getting a mug full of sludge - that's exactly what you get when you try to use beans ground with this piece.Other issues,The beans get stuck in the hopper. You need to pick it up and shake it to let them drop.The container that catches your grounds gets an electrostatic charge that make the grounds stick to it like crazy I realize this sounds like a non-issue, but it really makes it a pain to empty.It's not cheap.

I also found the grind lacked any uniformity, so I would end up with both medium grounds and fine powder in the same batch.

The curved trajectory of the particles reminds me of illustrations of magnetic fields - or thousands of tiny fleas jumping onto your hand and wrist en masse.If you have no choice and must make espresso with this toy, just1. grind it two clicks away from finest setting2. run it through again*, but this time on the finest setting3. rationalize liberally*Carefully shake the grinder with a rocking motion, or else ground coffee will not run through."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK...but not great","review":"I have owned this grinder for less than 3 years. I use it 4-5 times a week on average. I grind only for myself.Last week I pushed the grind button and it disappeared inside the grinder.I sent it to a certified Krups repair and was notified that the parts necessary to repair were no longer available (remember it is less than 3 years old and this model is still for sale).I would urge potential buyers to shop around and spend a little more for another manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails To Automatically Grind Coffee","review":"Two requirements for consistently brewing coffee are consistently grinding the coffee and using the same amount of ground coffee each time.The coarseness of the ground coffee is consistent but the amount of ground coffee produced varies widely from batch to batch. The quantity setting adjusts the time the grinder runs. The beans often stop feeding into the burrs. Shaking the grinder clears the jam, but unless you hover over the grinder you are often left with as little as half the desired amount of ground coffee.Hardly the automatic process desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and easy coffee grinding","review":"This grinder is great. So far I have used it to grind coffee for espresso, drip machine, and French Press. Works well for all three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst on/off switch design I've ever seen","review":"The on/off switch is the poorest design I have ever seen, it started to fail within months and totally failed within a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems fine","review":"I just bought this grinder from Costco. Being a one time item at Costco, I was nervous about it, but for the price couldn't pass it up.I just used it for the first time. After washing it out and drying it, I filled the hopper, set the grind size to the middle setting and ground about 10 cups worth of beans. After reading the reviews here, I expected a mess, so I put the unit on a kitchen towel first. I have to say, not a single ground escaped the unit during grinding.I have owned a number of grinders over the years, and this is the quietest grinder I have ever owned. That's good for us, because I usually get up much earlier than the rest of the family and make coffee then.I'll have to play with the grind size setting. I think even set at medium, the grind was too fine. But, I just chose that as a starting place."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice little grinder","review":"Have had this grinder for about 2 years, and after reading some of these reviews, felt compelled to write one myself. It works very well if you prefer a finer grind which I do. I agree, Krups quality has suffered since leaving its manufacturing to the Chinese, but this little grinder is decent for the price. Most people dont read instructions (me also I admit) but when the grinder gets messy, you find out that occasionaly cleaning the unit as recommended, its not a problem. They even supply a brush to do this with. A burr grinder does a much better job than the blade kind, and for the daily morning pot, this is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"I just got this grinder (well, it is an all black version) from Costco for $30! It works well (though the capacity is a bit low for beans, but I am not complaining one bit)! I am going to save money on coffee because it seems to produce twice the coffee through a finer grind than what is possible with a blade grinder. So, I expect to consume the same number of cups per day while my raw coffee purchases will go down, thus paying for this grinder in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems Starting","review":"When it grinds, it's great. But shortly after we got it, we started having problems getting it to start grinding. The problem is apparently that pieces of coffee beans easily get stuck near the switch mechanism. We are constantly having to dig them out with the brush supplied with the unit. Currently, there's something that's stuck in there that we're having trouble getting out and, in order to get the grinder to start, it's necessary to apply massitve pressure to push the cover down and activate the switch. I can't push down hard enough to get it to run; my husband has to do it.But when it grinds, it does a really good job....."},{"rating":"1","title":"better off with a coffee grinder","review":"I didn't like this product at all. It wasn't grinding according to the setting. We like French press coffee that requires coarse grind but this machine certainly did not do that. Even though it has a dial to select the type of ground it failed to do that. It only gave us a fine ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiple Problems with this machine","review":"The first thing I noticed about this machine is that it grinds way too much coffee per cup - nearly twice the standard amount of 15cc (1Tbl)/cup (it ground nearly 30cc or 2Tbl/cup). You can get around this flaw by just setting the grinder to half the number of cups that you want, although that becomes challenging when you want to grind small amounts (< 4 cups). The second problem is that it often jams - probably 20-25% of the time. When this happens, the amounts are all thrown off. The third issue I encountered is that this unit just plain died when it was less than 6 months old. As far as I am concerned it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets the job done","review":"This grinder gets the job done but has a number of flaws. Were I to do it over I would probably go ahead and shell out the cash for a better model. The major issue with this product are that it randomly stops grinding sometimes, owing to the safety mechanism that requires the top to be on for the machine to run is very sensitive. As a result you have to stay by the machine and put constant downward pressure on the top for it to run. The machine also requires the occasional shake when the beans in the hopper get jammed. I also find the grind setting to be quite off. The most coarse setting available is appropriate for drip coffee but there is no way to grind coffee appropriate for french press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinds too fine","review":"I read and followed the instructions to the letter, and made very sure to install the top burr correctly, but the Krups GVX2 grinds coffee too fine. The grind coarseness control has no effect either way. The coffee is too powdery to use in a French Press. Disappointing... it's going back and I will look for a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk away","review":"I bought this grinder and a few days later it died. Before that however it delivered some substandard espresso grinds so at least I wouldn't miss it much. I suppose I should be grateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not work with Espresso machines","review":"I wanted to like this unit. It is small, solid, quiet, and simple to use. Unfortunately, I own a Gaggia, espresso machine and so I need a fine, espresso grind. Even though Krups claims that this unit makes an espresso grind, the unit I purchased failed to do so. On the finest setting, the grind is still too coarse, thus giving an unacceptable espresso cup. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great, Poorly Constructed and Very Disappointed","review":"First machine purchased was returned when all setting gave talcum powder grind coffee. The second machine broke three months out of warranty when the cool looking blue button you push to turn on the machine just flat out collasped into the inside of the machine. On closer inspection, the button is held in place by a weak piece of plastic that broke off. No, I will not buy another one. They look good but are failure prone. There are better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable, finally just quit working altogether","review":"We have had ours for about a year or so. A few months after we started using it, it would stop grinding inexplicably, half way through a batch. You'd have to fiddle with it, bang it, and plead with it to get it working again. Finally this morning, it just quit completely, and won't grind at all. Substandard design/workmanship.Avoid this one, it has the feel of something that the manufacturer intended to be disposable / obsolescent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair grinder, but didn't last.","review":"I received this grinder as a free promotion when I bought a Krups coffee maker. On the plus-side, it lasted longer than the coffee maker, but only by a few months. Both were dead after 18-months. The grinder worked well before it died, although the static-related discharge of coffee grinds gets old after awhile. I am looking at buying the all glass and steel Kitchen Aide in an attempt to get away from the static issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pain to use","review":"The coffee beans jam up over and over again during use and the machine winds up grinding air.

After reading the reviews, chose this KRUPS. Have been using it for a little over a month and can say that it produces consistent grounds and will produce a very fine grind for espresso and med grind for drip. Probably not a good choice for a French press. Relatively quiet, small footprint and nice looking. The biggest drawback is the very limited quantity of beans it will hold; you can't call it a \\"hopper\\" at all. Have had no difficulties with feeding the beans or clogging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee the way you like it...","review":"Having used a blade grinder for years, I was missing out. The coarse-to-fine selector makes a huge difference in how smooth or bitter my coffee brews. The hopper and grounds compartment holds plenty. I haven't experienced any problems so far. Grab this and some fresh beans, and after some experimentation with the settings you're bound to be impressed. Make the kind of coffee *you* want by buying this sweet buzzer.UPDATE 12/5/2010: Five years later, this thing is still grinding awesome. I dropped the clear plastic hopper lid once, and chipped a tiny edge piece off it. It's barely noticable, and hasn't impacted the functionality at all. This thing is DURABLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for French Press","review":"I bought this to use with my Bodum French Press, but even using the coarsest setting it leaves a significant amount of sludge in the coffee.

It gets stuck, whirring without grinding, sometimes it won't shut off until I unplug it, and other times it doesn't grind the correct amount (will grind enough for two cups, then shut off, when the knob was set on 8).The counter-top mess is annoying. There is a lid that has to be removed before dumping the grinds, and coffee just goes everywhere.The only real plus is the presentation. I get a lot of compliments on this grinder, as in \\"ooh, you have a Krups.\\" Little do they know, I guess.Honestly, the $15 Mr. Coffee grinder I got in college works at least twice as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing...","review":"This grinder has been a very large disappointment. It does not seem to work correctly, the power button only works part of the time. The grind is not consistent at all and does not change with changing the setting. If you like to use a coffee pot, this may be ok for you. But if you want to use for French Press or any other method of brewing, look elsewhere! Not professional grade, and certainly not worth the money spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"KRUPS fail","review":"My KRUPS GVX1 coffee grinder failed after about six months of use. The problem seemed to be with the electronics as it would try to turn itself on at anytime day or night. You could hear this little urr, urr, sound even when nobody was near it. Eventually it wouldn't start at all. Six months of use after paying about $60. is not good value. I saw another one in another major department store today, listed for $99.99 - and it had coffee grounds in the hopper - so somebody bought that one, didn't like it, and returned it. I have gone to another brand and when I compare the grinding mechanism of the new one compared to the KRUPS - well simply, there is no comparison. Krups design of that part too is very inadequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor design and build","review":"THIS UNIT DESERVES A ZERO RATINGnot only do i agree with the other reviewers complaints about this machine being noisy, messy and hard to to keep running..............bit it also is built poorly. i am on my second unit after a warranty replacement and it has now broken in exactly the same way: the start button is broken. the button has fallen into the unit because it is connected by one very thin piece of plastic that cannot take even moderate use.krups says i am out of warranty this time and will not replaceDO NOT BUY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it until it died after three months of once a day uses","review":"I absolutely loved this grinder.

Worked great until this morning, when I pressed the power button and and like other reviews have noted, it broke off and slid into the housing. Did some googling and apparently this has happened to a lot of people - the button is held in place by a cheap plastic tab, apparently. I use the grinder once a day, and like others have said, seems like a coffee grinder should last longer than this. I could follow the instructions I found on various repair forums to take the thing apart and superglue the tab back on, but how long will that last? Will not buy another Krups appliance.

However, the first one (a Christmas gift) was dead out of the box. The replacement works fine, but I think the coarse grind is a little finer than it should be. I don't think there is a plastic collection bin out there that doesn't have static associated with it.

I agree with other reviewers that it is noisy, but I expect that from a coffee grinder. I agree that the self-feeding mechanism is poor, and I have to keep gently shaking the grinder to get the beans to feed through. The receptacle for the ground coffee is a bit hard to get in and out, and usually results in some spilt grounds when it suddenly pulls out. However, I considered all these as minor inconveniences, because it does make a very fine grind and gave all the appearances of lasting forever. Yesterday I would have given it 4 stars.Today, the light comes on, but the grinder doesn't work at all. I am mechanically minded, but see no obvious fix.$60 for a six month life is not a worthwhile investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I truly hate this thing","review":"I've had this grinder for almost two years -- from the other reviews here, I see that I am not alone in my pain.First and foremost, it's messy. There is no way to remove the drawer of ground beans without leaving a little pile of grounds on your counter, and then no good way to get the rest of the grind from the drawer into the coffee maker without getting a bunch more on your hands (and coffee maker, and in the water reservoir, ...). It's maddening.Second, it doesn't feed the beans into the grinder consistently. I have to babysit the thing or give it a gentle shake for the whole time it's grinding, otherwise it will stop feeding beans and issue a loud angry whirring sound instead.Third, it doesn't have the decency to just break so that I have a good excuse to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooks your beans . . . then dies","review":"Two major cons:1)This machine heats itself when left plugged in.

When that one stopped grinding to our satisfaction, we searched and found the Krups GVX1-14. In addition to great styling, its one of the quieter grinders we've seen. Its easy to use, holds a good quantity of beans (ground and unground) and the adjustments for both courseness of grind, and volume (time) are easy to make. We've been using for over a month, and find this burr grinder to be a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, yet 1 design flaw","review":"This grinder is a good buy with flexibility to choose both grind fineness and quantity (of cups). The one issue is that the lid has an automatic shutoff if it is not closed--and unfortunately I have to apply a little pressure to the top throughout the grinding cycle to keep it running--if I let go the safety switch loses contact and the appliance stops. This switch may become less sensitive with age (hopefully)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Grinder","review":"After receiving two \\"repackaged\\" products that were either missing parts or didn't work, Amazon made good within a day or two.

Because most of the grinder is PLASTIC there is a severe static problem and the only grind coffee that you get sticks in the container for the ground coffee as well as the in the machine itself. The end result is you get a mess every time that you grind coffee. If you don't mind the mess and if you want only super fine (powdery) coffee then this machine is OK. Krups was not helpful and am returning this machine to where I purchased it at. They have a design problem and don't care as they are hitting a price point with an inferior product.I have been using this machine daily for about 1 month.

You'll see a little black pin protruding.2) another interlock pin is located in the narrow groove channel where the top sits.

As others have noted, the ground coffee sticks badly to the hopper. Static, apparently. When I try to get it out into the coffee maker basket, the grounds fly off in every direction and I end up with coffee everywhere. At least they include a little brush to help get the grounds out of the hopper, otherwise it would be impossible.3. The third time I used it, the upper burr came loose and I had a heck of a time getting it back on with half-ground coffee all over the insides.Bottom line, it's a cheaply made device that does a good job if the stars are aligned properly.

We owned it for a little over a year. One day it just quit. While it worked, as others have said, it got the job done but required a lot of fussing around to find the right settings. Sometimes the beans would get stuck in the hopper and the motor would race. Static cling was often a problem (this seems to be weather-related). It was difficult to remove the top half of the burr wheel for cleaning. The grinder surfaces were small, and the whole thing just didn't seem very durable.

Bed Bath and Beyond no longer carries this grinder...I wonder why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Grinder","review":"This is a terrible grinder, or at least the one they shipped to me is. From day one I noticed that it would not grind the beans in a continuous manner; the beans wouldn't fall down into the grinding area so it would be grinding air even though there were plenty of beans in there. You can get around that by shaking the grinder gently while it is grinding. But then it stopped working altogether, then it worked one more time and now it comes on sometimes when you push the button but does not grind. The grinding mechanism is 100% plastic, I expected it to be metal.I also have a coffee maker from Krups that has a broken LED display so you cannot set the automatic timer, and the water meter was broken on that from day one. The grinder was a gift but I would NEVER purchase another Krups product.It is not worth spending the money on something you have to send to the landfill after 25 uses.Shop another brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this grinder!","review":"Two of these grinders have failed for us, and Krups has refused to give us a refund. The first grinder worked OK for less than 6 months, then failed completely under very light and responsible use. The replacement machine would never grind a fine grind. We returned it and asked for a refund. It was refused. This company will not stand behind its product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justice League Just-In-Time","review":"For kids and collectors alike, this is a worthy set. For starters, you get Darkseid - who is extremely hard to find separately on the store shelves. Then, you also get a Wonder Woman figure (also hard to find), alongside Superman and Green Lantern.The paint schemes are definitely acceptable. The biggest surprises are Superman and Wonder Woman. Although the figures are the same models currently released, I can see The Man of Steel and the Amazon Princess wearing these costumes in the comics. All-in-all, a great set. Hey, if you are a fan of the Justice League, you can't beat the price. For approximately $19.99 (plus shipping and handling), you get another Superman and Green Lantern, plus Wonder Woman and Darkseid. Several e-tailers are selling WW and Darkseid online for no less than $14.99. The bargain alone makes the set worthy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book, Must Read","review":"This book turns the study of suburbanization and \\"new urbanism\\" on its head.

She suggests that the Seder plate emphasizes the transformation of nature (e.g. wheat) into culture (e.g. matzoh), just as relevation turned Jews from ordinary homo sapiens into a holy people. But there was far too little discussion of the Seder and too much discussion of Judaism generally. Also, the author's discussion of Seder customs (and indeed of Judaism generally) focuses on the most traditional Jews, and thus fails to adequately describe the Seder as performed by the overwhelming majority of American Jews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working in 6 months","review":"Basic machine, functioned satisfactorily for 6 months, but then stopped playing or recording.

The primary problem I have is that it celebrates themes like \\"us\\" versus \\"them\\" and violence as a tool for problem solving. These themes may accurately reflect the historical circumstances leading to the Hanukkah story, but don't reflect why Hanukkah is celebrated. There was fighting between the Jews and Syrians, but what we celebrate is freedom - not the glory of violence or \\"you\\" versus \\"me\\" mentality. I'll be looking for another book that accurately portrays the story of Hanukkah and celebrates freedom, but without glorifying the \\"how.\\"Illustrations, by the way, we're very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Family's Favorite","review":"It's the first night of Hanukkah and I just got through reading this book aloud to my kids -- ages 6, 9 and 13.

For anyone else this book is a mess. several times in the book the author seems to jump to ideas that are misplaced with the original idea.

This isn't the typical tribute album. I mean if they were going to sing the songs exactly the way they were written then why bother resinging them. These artists wanted to create a new sound with the songs of Phil Collins. Can you get that through your thick skull. And the artists have succeeded in making these songs their own.

Ray Bradbury is a master of unveiling events in such a way as to hold the readers interest and keep them guessing. Even until the the end the reader sure isn't quite sure just what is going on and how it will end. His endings are full of ironies that not even the most clarvoyant person can expect. Unfortunately most of these stories lack these tallents. Most of these stories are uneventfull, uninspiring, anticlimactic and contain little or no irony.

The reality doesn't match the concept: you get a limited selection of oddball software that is pretty much useless for most people. Then you get two drives installing on any computer on which you use the flash drive. You can't even erase the U3 crap off the flash drive since it's read-only. PNY has really screwed up on this one.

So, since it would be a hassle to return it, I decided to take it apart and see what had caused the aluminum to melt. Well, the electrical wires were melted right past where they go in the bottom of the outside base. I cut out the melted wires and reconnected them, now whether that will fix the problem or not, remains to be seen.

My wife bought this because it looked nice with our other stainless steel kitchen equipment but this was a mistake.

They all seem to really have a blast, both on the set and while doing the commentaries.Don't forget to look for Easter Eggs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not the same any more","review":"If you just started watch scrubs you may like the most resent seasons. People that have been watching since it started may find that season five is a continuation of the downhill slide that started in season four. The show is no longer amusing stories about things that happen to doctors in medicen. It instead has become a soap opera about just the characters lives. So everyone so to add drama almost everyone is pregnant or having children.In addition the humor is no longer the creative unpredictable.

This season seems to be all flashback \\"gags\\" that take up almost half of each episode.

Although it takes place with the primary beloved creatures being older, we could have been spared the details of them getting sick and eventually dying. This does not keep with the original youth and magic of the first stories. There was NO NEED to show us the end of our favorite creatures lives. I think any future attempts at this series should be directed towards giving us MORE TIMELESS ADVENTURES of this group of best friends while in their prime.

She is equally charmed by William Horwood's books as they continue the adventures of Mr Toad and his stalwart woodland friends. Horwood writes in a style that seamlessly complements Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows. Patrick Benson's illustrations are lovely and they add details and charm to the story as it moves along. All in all, we were both very happy with The Willows and Beyond as well as the other Horwood/Benson \\"Willows\\" books.

This book had my attention from the very first word.I couldn't put it down.I loved the fact that every person and each incident seemed so real.I felt like I was the characters.Their feelings and hardships were so familiar to me.I could tell that the author deffinately had alot of experience from life.She was so in touch with people's feelings.She knew what it was like to be emotionally abused,physically abused, and sexually abused.She also Knew what the lasting effects of the abuse was if not dealt with properly.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever felt alone,afraid, or hurt in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"Love Erica Spindler books. Great book at a great price. If you like reding books by her, you'll love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forbidden read","review":"My overall impression of this book was that it was good. Not great, not terrible, just plain good. As an avid reader of Spindler's I must say that this long anticipated book should have been anything but. The storyline was very unreal as well as the characters. Gloria seemed to be a too annoyingly perfect: The beautiful, spoiled, rich daddy's girl who always gets what she wants. The plot was very predictable, (gee, I wonder if Gloria will get the man that she's been pining over? Hmmmm, well since she gets everything else......) and at times, the storyline grew dull and quite boring. If you want to read the book just to see what all the fuss is about, all the power to you. But don't say that I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner by Erica Spindler!","review":"This is the fourth book I've read by Ms. Spindler and it's as good as her other books. This story is about the legacies of the Pierron and St. Germaine women. It's ironic that the women who commit the sins of passion are considered good-hearted and compassionate, yet the woman who goes to church and preaches cleanliness and good is the most evil of all. This book has a lot of passion without being sleazy and carries with it a tremendous amount of emotion, guilt, and regret. Ms. Spindler did a terrific job with this book and that is why she is one of my favorite authors! I look forward to her next novel to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Read It Slowly To Make It Last!","review":"I so much fun with this book!

He adds Jewish tradition to the story that provides a deeper level to St Paul's personality and his strong conversion to Christianity. In addition, the history of the places visited by Paul is discussed. Even though I am a seminarian who has read thicker books, I enjoyed reading this one. The reason I give it four stars is that the author uses his own reflections and rationale in explaining some of the incidents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring for words - pun intended!","review":"If you can get past the first twenty-or-so pages (I couldn't!) you might like this book.

Mr. Pollock gives an accurate assessment of Paul's life and Although my thoughts differ on some points he has given quite a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life with a Purpose","review":"The Apostle: The Life of Paul was very informative and in my humble opinion remained factually true to all that is currently know of Paul, his conversion, his mission, and most importantly his passion for sharing Christ with a world that had little time or use for the information. Paul could have easily given up on many occasions but as this book shows us he remained true to love of Christ and accepted all persecution for his faith. I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn more about this man and his mission to carry Christ's message to the gentiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable companion book to go with your Bible study","review":"This author does exhaustive research to be sure that the biographies he writes are factually accurate, so you will gain understanding of the culture Paul lived in as well as an appreciation for what he gave up in order to further the gospel of Christ. If you think that being a Christian entitles you to a life of ease, you will discover that such thinking is in error. I don't remember who said it, but \\"he is no fool who gives up what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.\\" Paul is an excellent example of the truth of that statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"I do recommend this book... it is an easy read, but does require you to pay attention to what you are reading.

And most end up pretty dry, even if you find the topic interesting. In this book John Pollock does a remarkable job of bringing Paul alive to the reader. You do learn Paul's theology and gain an understanding of his trials and travels, but more importantly, you meet the man. Once you have read this book, you will feel as if you know Paul personally. One of the finest biographies I have read. I have recommended this book to many friends and I recommend it highly to you as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Apostle: The life of Paul","review":"I loved this book!

Conclusion: Mark Z. Danielewski is the best writer going today."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Whalestoe Letters","review":"The Whalestoe Letters by Mark Z. Danielewski is an extension of his premier novel, House of Leaves. Initially appearing as an appendix to the novel, The Whalestoe Letters (which includes ten additional letters) are those written by Johnny Truant's mother Pelafina H. Lievre during her residence at the insane asylum. Like House of Leaves as a whole, The Whalestoe Letters is to fiction and literature what thought experiments are to physics; Danielewski seems to write and publish to push boundaries and test waters for no other reasons than curiosity. While I would argue that the experiment of House of Leaves is very interesting, his subsequent publications are less successful. The (limited) success of The Whalestoe Letters is that it makes me want to go back and read House of Leaves once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whalestoe Letters","review":"I love this.

But do not buy this book. Buy House of Leaves (which is amazing), and consider the 11 lost letters here as insignificant, because they are. Hell, the original letters in House of Leaves aren't even that good. They provide a couple of additional clues about what is going on, but that's all. They're certainly not literature.

The booklet that comes with the CD was written by Paul Gilbert from RECORD COLLECTOR in April 1996 giving some nice background information on the LPS as well as comments from Mr. McCallum. Though, a bit pricey for a one CD, it is one of the better celebrity CDs on the market and shows another side of David McCallum - his musical background.

This is solo McDowell on electric. Any of Fred's previous recordings are better than this endeavor. True to marketings glory, the hype far surpasses the reality.

We could really see the craters very well. I particularly like the two different powered eyepieces that come with it. You can use the lower power to find and focus, then switch over to the high power to get a better view. The only thing I didn't really like about this telescope is the ability to fine tune the aiming.

I personally enjoy his novels, because not many people are able to capture true human essence in it's raw state and not lose it's potency on paper. He also teaches life lessons in very discreet, but practical ways. However, I was disappointed with the characters in this book. After reading A Summer's Place, I was left with the impression his other novels would blatantly express the consequences and woes of man, but I didn't expect their actions to be so detailed in this novel. What I'm saying is that if you are married and live a morally clean life and expect fairly \\"clean\\" reading then beware of the promiscousness in this book (not much but it can be unnerving). I would like to note that his characters always pay or are punished in some form for their course and decisions in life.

Tamar meets at least five people in the whole story. He finds out the King lost his iron ring at Tamar's house. Tamar goes back home and wonders how the ring was left there when it was on the king's finger.I did not like the story and I do not usually like adventure stories. The genre was adventure and fiction. I did not relate to the story or the character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"Ok, I'm sorry if anything I write makes anyone mad, but I'm just sharing my opinion. First of all, the charactors were a little, well, mentally slow. I mean, they figured things out, but not as fast as people normally do. Second, that stupid umbrella REALLY annoyed me. And I think the plot is a little strange. But, you know, maybe it's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzz....","review":"I read this book three years ago, and it still inspires an intense desire to throw it out a window. I found most of the characters to be extremely boring and/or too strange to be likable, such as the umbrella issue. Tamar's mentor spent what seemed to me to be a ridiculous amount of time talking about his umbrella. I did not care about his umbrella. I cared about the plot and the characters, and the amount of trivial dialouge included in the book bored me beyond compare. I suggest sticking to Lloyd Alexander's other books and skipping 'The Iron Ring.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Alexander's best but still worth the read","review":"Granted, I am an adult reading books written primarily for children, but I believe a well written story can and should attract readers of all ages. The Iron Ring suffers a bit from too much going on. There are too many characters with little depth and the ending did not quite satisfy me the way say The Remarkable Journey of Prince Jen did. All in all it's a good read and worth your time. I guess I was just expecting more from a writer of Alexander's caliber"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Iron Ring: A Tale of Adventure","review":"This is a book that I liked very much for many reasons.

Tamar sets off on a long journey along side his trusted adviser Rajaswami, to find king Jaya. This book is filled with adventure, magic, romance and often trouble.

All in all I thought that The Iron Ring was a really good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second worst book ever","review":"The Iron Ring is the second worst book I have ever read.

My conclusion is: don't read this book of your own free choosing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexander fans will not be disappointed","review":"Some people like to complain that Lloyd Alexander writes the same story over and over again under different guises. My response: so does the rest of the world. At least Mr. Alexander does a great job of it.Known for exploring worldwide folklore, Alexander takes to the world of India for this. He explores mystical gods and makes a wonderful and powerful social commentary on the caste system.It's the usual journey of growth and discovery, but that is always a great journey. I cry every time I read this, it touches me so.Excellent piece from the awesome Lloyd Alexander."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hero epic set in India","review":"The threads of this story are spun so neatly, and they weave together (some sooner, some later) to produce a well-crafted coming-of-age myth. Lloyd Alexander put so much care into this work of art, I was stunned to see that he had written so many other books. This seems like the life-labor of a dedicated storytelle. Reading the book is so satisfying, as the young king travels from prideful impetuous behavior into reasoned risk-taking into peaceful acceptance and maturity.Excellent, memorable characters and scenes, great use of foreshadowing throughout. The setting in India allows for some wonderful animal companions, all of whom have their own heroic characters to develop.Great, great book for boys. This is a coming of age novel they will never forget.Too bad about the cheesy new cover -- I read this with an older, more interesting cover with an India-looking illustration that shows all the animals in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"CUTE STORY !","review":"Any child who has ever had the hiccups can relate to this very cute story about a hippo with a stubborn case of the hiccups.

I am painfully shy, however, I have never thought that I am better than someone else/more interesting than someone else and so won't speak to them. The reality is, rather, the opposite. I know I don't have a thing to say. When I try to have a conversation with someone, my mind goes blank. On page 45, the author says, \\" I have found for the most part, they (shy people) don't believe they are unworthy of being talked to, but they do complain that others don't realize how interesting and wonderful they are. \\" Save yourself the trouble of reading this book, written from the perspective of someone who looks at shy people like we are a science experiment. Read Goodbye to Shy by Leila Lowndes, instead, who has experience being shy, herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all helpful...","review":"I had to stop reading this after the first chapter or two. It has a real \\"blame the victim\\" tone to it, and basically asserts that shy people are selfish, and think themselves all-important. On the contrary, most shy people have huge problems with self-confidence around others, and yet are some of the most generous people around. Don't buy this book if you're shy and are tired of being talked-down to and patronized by somebody who DOES NOT understand shy people and what they experience in life. I'm very shy, and have enough self-respect to put this book back on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent compilation of research","review":"This is a well-written and comprehensive overview of research on shyness at all stages of human development and how it can be applied. However, if one is looking for a very structured and systematic therapeutic approach to alleviating the pain of shyness, s/he will not find it here. Instead, Carducci offers his clinical suggestions in a more casual fashion, incorporating them into the exposition. He covers areas which are significant for shy people, such as work, dating, and parenthood. It is an interesting and useful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book if you're just getting started","review":"This is the first book I've read on shyness and it's written very well. It seems that books like this are either written for an audience of Ph.D's who perform social research for a living, or for an audience with an 8th grade education. This book is neither - it delivers straight forward content in an articulate fashion that is both easy to grasp and enjoyable to read.

They are the same quality Samsonite chairs I've had in the past. They color and fabric is quite attractive. One thing I don't like is that a card stock label is attached under the seat; in order to get rid of the label completely, you would have to actually remove the cushion from the seat. As it is, the edge of the card stock peeps out between the cushion and the metal seat edge. Probably nobody will notice but me, but it BUGS me.

At first I was worried because it is tiny and not as exciting as the bigger one we had, but it turned out to be great for her age. The hair is straight and doesn't tangle like some of the larger ones with curls. This is great for the frustration level. It's easy for my daughter to get the hair clips in and out.I think if my daughter were much older she would not like this as much but for a child 3-5 I can see this as a great alternative to the larger, fancier ones that a small child's fingers just can't manipulate as well.One down side - it comes with colored hair extensions that fall apart and end up all over the place. Strands of purple or orange come loose because they are not connected to anything. I'm also not nuts about the colored extensions.

My initial indication that something was wrong came the first day when the file bent. Hardened files should not bend, ever. They should break first. By the time I had used up my first chain, the file teeth were completely gone. This file set is fine if you need a guide and plan on replacing the file, or if you rarely ever use it, but if you intend to actually sharpen your saw from time to time, you'll use more time trying to get the file to cut than you will spend actually cutting wood.It gets 2 stars because it is a decent price for the guide and handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good chainsaw file","review":"This 5/32\\" chainsaw file works great on my Poulan 18\\" electric chainsaw.

The big man's songwriting was peaking, introspective and personal as usual, but with good humor, wit, and class at the same time. Hag's infatuation with western swing was also growing, and was used to great effect here, highlighting and illustrating the lyrics without sounding intrusive. The production is minimal and clean, and really sounds great. The title track, his raucous song about ridin' the rails (\\"Good Old American Guest\\"), and many others make this a superior collection that stands the test of time.

Her words suggest an old Soul with experinces spanning more than one lifetime put on paper. I even bought a second copy to present to my niece who devoured it whole. That in itself speaks volumes. That a 14 year old also found it riveting say much towards the Author's appeal to several generations. I have simple tastes and know what I love and this tops the list.

They must be much harder metal than other files I have used, because they cut faster. When I can though I use my chain grinder to sharpen chains much more quickly. Hand filing a bunch of chains for a 27\\" bar takes too long for me! Nevertheless, it is always a good idea to have a file or two in your box just in case. Every once in a while a saw will find a piece of nail or fencing in the wood, and without a way to sharpen your chain, you are done. When that happens, or I just want to \\"touch up\\" a chain, I have used these files with great success.Oregon makes some of the best chainsaw components and accessories so it is no surprise to me how well they work.

Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sundry Aglomeration of Images","review":"What passes for poetry today is taxing to the true spirit of the tradition. Deer Table Legs and the poems therein are the perfect example of what Harold Bloom warns us about in his essay in The Best of the Best American Poetry: \\"the barbarians are about us and we must retain the heights.\\" No music in the lines, inattention to traditional meters, lack of vision, and ill-afforded ennui are the faults found in this book.

It is pre-set to 500F temp and 30 minute cooktime as the DEFAULT settings for bake, broil AND convection modes. The timer defaults back to 30 minutes. The digital display isn't labeled for easy reading. The temperature is not easy to adjust. The toaster setting automatically goes to Medium, is pre-set for timing and it is not intuitive or easy to set intermediate degrees for doneness or toasting. The wire rack is set in one position only, close to the base heating element, so toast will always be darker on one side than the other. Not worth the money, even though I got the unit for FREE - am returning it to Krups. Does not meet the standards for easy or safe operation that I associate with the Krups brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - Great Experience!","review":"This item was less expensive than the local auto parts store's price.

This interactive guide not only eliminates the need for a psychic or a shrink but also enables you to compile a complete portrait of yourself and/or your guests. It's sure better than discussing politics and religion.Using one system of typology in each chapter (213 highly readable pages including entertaining quizzes and worksheets to determine how you match up with those important people in your life) these major tools range from Birth order to Western astrology to Numerology, to Chinese astrology and more.

This was not the case with this light. During my time using it, it worked great albeit not as bright as I would have liked. It shines brightest straight and radially, which is a great combination. However, the light bulb had died later in the day, rendering it unusable. I noticed another retailer sells replacements for the bulb assembly. In summary, I wish I had purchased the LED version which takes 3 AAA's over this light and costs approx 25% more.

Most of these tracks still get played on AOR stations. If you're looking for definitive '80's rock, this is it. It's simply one of the best albums of the early '80's. (If you're wondering what I meant by the bandana question, Mike Reno, the lead singer, always wore one as a headband; it started a fashion trend during that era!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool album!","review":"Canada's Loverboy put out their second album in 1981,contractually,after the success of their self-titled debut the previous year. There are some hard-rockers on this album such as WORKING FOR THE WEEKEND and WHEN IT'S OVER. These guys are one of the best new wave bands of all-time. Loverboy fans are also fans of Blondie and The Cars. The other songs are good. These guys love having Billy Joel,Bruce Springsteen and Barbra Streisand as their Columbia Records labelmates.

As you the consumer deserves to know that unless you like reading fluffy jargon set out to impress those who knew Serge personally, this is not the bio for you. Here is an example:\\"Spontaneous salvos of applause would be provoked by specific couplets emoted either w/out embroidery-so as not to jar their elegance-or extemporised like a jazz vocalist after he got the knack of slipping comfortably from suppressed lust through lazy insinuation to intimate anguish, sometimes mingling humor and gloom in the same line.\\" If this is how you enjoy reading and LEARNING about someone then buy, buy, buy, but if not beware because this example is tame!

I'm pretty lax about my litter standards - it just needs to keep the poo/pee smell in for 48 - 72 hours, not stink up my house, and not coat my house in a layer of dust. After a week there was litter everywhere, my cat smelled like the litter, and I couldn't get over the combined smell of cat waste + the scent of this litter.It took me a week to de-funk my LR.

The transfer, while enhanced for 16x9, looks like a straight videotape or laserdisc transfer and not a remastering from original sources. The sound is a complete disaster. I suspect a lot of people will be buying this for the Mike Oldfield soundtrack, which contains some music not available anywhere else. It is pitifully reproduced here in low-fi sound quality that does justice to neither the film nor the composer.For a real \\"out of this world\\" film experience of the US Space Program, I heartily recommend Al Reinert's \\"For All Mankind\\".

I bought them to wear under a very short cocktail dress, as I prefer not to have my almost bare backside/thighs stuck to whatever seating I'm provided. The rise was perfect for the length of the dress while still covering enough of my thighs for \\"modesty\\" and roll-up prevention. I would never consider wearing them alone, uncovered as work out or yoga gear (but that may be due more to my 39 year old thighs than the function of the shorts) but as an undergarment that (trust me on this...) passes completely unobtrusively, they are great. Added plus: the waist band does not pinch or create a muffin top effect and they provide some smoothing control without flattening your derriere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable!","review":"I bought these short for workouts and for hot summer days when I just want to lay around all day. I was surprised by how comfortable the fabric was, and how breathable it is. Yes, they do ride up occasionaly, but I wouldn't expect anything else from workout shorts. Be careful to order the correct size for you - a size larger and I could see them slipping right off, and a size smaller would be trying to fit an elephant into a toothpaste bottle.

Their advice on self-sufficiency is valid, but I feel their attitude on safety equipment is irresponsible. In particular their suggestion to do without an EPIRB. With their experience they may get away with it but most of the readers will be relatively inexperienced.There should be no compromise on safety equipment. It is no use saying you don't want anyone to come looking for you if you get into trouble, because the SAR orhanisations have both a moral and legal obligation to do so. In addition there is the feelings of loved ones to consider.Some countries are sensible enough to insist on minimal standards of safety equipment.

Ellenbogen is a remarkably clear expositor of Wittgenstein's thought. Her analysis of the secondary literature on the debate and her recasting of criteria, truth conditions and practices is a welcomed addition to the literature. While Ellenbogen does discuss some secondary literature, there is no discussion of the excellent work of Meredith Williams on a social conception of mind in Wittgenstein, and I would highly recommend Williams' book (Wittgenstein, Mind and Meaning) for anyone with an interest in these issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice guide to erotic cinema","review":"the most seen book by my friends at my house.the reasearch is really good, i already made a list of the movies i want to see"},{"rating":"2","title":"mouth dropping sounds","review":"estos chicos of zurdok are amazing! their cd is great.

Good thing too because not long after one of the two disks in the array (stripped not mirrored) completely died with no chance at recovery (would not even register with Maxtor's disk utilities).

Ultimately I didn't feel overly in love with the book despite the fact that it didn't have anything necessarily wrong with it, but as mentioned, it's more of a staging point, a new take off for Tim, rather than anything necessarily intricate or breath-taking.

Before this, Bob had never sounded so worked up. Dylan rips through his back catalogue with a vengeance, spitting out classic renditions of \\"Rolling Stone,\\" \\"It's Ain't Me Babe\\" and \\"Heaven's Door.\\" Every single song on this disc hits home, though. The Band's backing accompaniment is brilliant. These guys are great musicians, perhaps the best that Dylan ever performed with. Their set isn't too bad either. All in all, you cannot call yourself a Dylan fan unless your own this album. It is an essential record documenting Dylan's returning confidence in 1974. That confidence and assuredness would result in Blood On The Tracks one year later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Live Dylan","review":"This is probably one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) live albums Bob Dylan ever released. It is pure magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have to know Dylan","review":"Ever since the mid 60s, when Dylan went electric at The Newport Folk Festival, Dylan fans have debated whether he should do it or not. Personally, I like the live versions in addition to the recorded, generally acoustic, versions of these songs. For me, the advantage is that you are not limited to one or the other. Now, I have heard him a few times live, when he was just plain awful. A lot of people would not admit that, after all, he's Bob Dylan! In this case, though, I felt most tracks were good to excellent, thus the four stars. For anyone new to Dylan, just keep in mind, that his live music is nothing like his studio music, in general. Never hurts to listen to some of the samples, if provided here on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Band and Bob Dylan Rockin","review":"Bob dylan is great in this alblum with songs like Rainy Day Women 12 and 35 and Knockin on Heavens Door but dont let Bob Dylan overshadow The Band who are great with songs like The Night They Drove Ole Dixie Down one of my favorites"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a good cd what a joke","review":"This cd is lame no matter what the quality of the remastering sound.

I for one am not enamored with Dylan on this album. His performances are energetic but he often spits out each song with little hint of the original melody. Infact he makes each song sound exactly the same barking out the end of phrases with the same growl and pitch. Songs are shortened and rushed through with a tone that doesn't sound like earlier Dylan, mid Dylan or later Dylan. I also grew tired of jo o ones and gur hur hurl after first hearing. He must have been on something at the time. Also, the band sounds good but they dont add anything to their repertoire with these renditions. Only of historic significance, get Highway 61, Blonde on Blonde etc. first."},{"rating":"2","title":"respnse to \\"OCT.19,1998\\"","review":"Get a clue...since the early 90's, Dylan has played with a fire and passion that has gone unnoticed by people such as yourself who run on with their rigid, preconceived notions...ah, just go see him ASAP!

If you wipe the plates lightly with oil or spray with cooking spray you won't have any problem with food sticking, either.I've also found that you can use lots of different kinds of bread--it works with English muffins (make a breakfast sandwich of scrambled eggs and cheese!), pita bread, thick-crust bread, and traditional sliced bread.

How in Heaven's name, could he???The Mayan culture had degenerated from a single united kingdom by 1441 (a half-century before Columbus, and 500 years after the \\"classic\\" period of Mayan culture had ended). The Aztec and Inca were the only remaining Mesoamerican empires by the time the Spaniards arrived in 1517, with the Old World diseases (not religion) which so weakened the already-crumbling empires that they could not resist the heavily outnumbered Spaniards.Many scientists and sociologists consider the Spanish as the symptom, rather than the disease, so to speak, since the Aztec and Inca dissolved in much the same manner as the earlier Olmec, Maya, and Toltec, which had declined well before the Spaniards. In short, if the experts can't explain it, how in God's name would you expect a Hollywood \\"director\\" to come up with the answers???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Blood, Violence and Running Through the Jungle","review":"OK, I would give this film 2, maybe even 3 stars if the makers hadn't destroyed a beautiful and magnificent black jaguar.

Ok, well the acting is amazing and Mel Gibson did a good job on filming the Mayan empire almost exactly as I would imagine it to be. However, does he have to show all the blood when they sacrifice people and such? I could have done without all that.

It tells the tale of a young man, who is captured by the Mayans and almost sacrificed. I'll not tell the details, but he escapes, and suddenly is being chased by a large group of guards for about 2 days, never being able to sleep. And he did this so that he could get back to his wife and son.The only thing that kinda bugged me is that I think Gibson made the Mayans appear evil, and I'm not really clear on those details. I do know that the Mayans were very technologically advanced.But definitely watch the movie, and once you see it, think about it a little. You may just want to watch it again.

Score byJames Horner.A ho hum film about life in the Mayan empire before Christiancivilzation put an end to barbarism and human sacrifice. Numbinglyviolent and gory with a final half stolen from THE NAKED PREY, thisGibson film is done in by its own blood soaked excess which constantlyremoves and dulls the viewer to what is a nothing special story in anycase. J. Lee Thompson's film KINGS OF THE SUN is a far superior take onthe same material in every way.Hardly a bad film and not more violent from anything from theSAW films to DONNIE BRASCO, anti-Christian bigots set to hate this filmbecause of Gibson being a Catholic take note that you are plunging intoan intellectual cul de sac.

What makes this movie great is that it has poetic elegance. Also, several scenarios carry universal human appeal.

Perfectly made with a great story, great characterization, great customs, great music, great camera work, and a realness not found in any other film. I don't know how anyone could watch this and not feel deeply involved in the storyline. The only comparable experience I can think of is a novel.This movie crosses the boundaries of film as a spectator entertainment and makes it a deep emotional struggle to the end. The only other movie I can think of that even comes close to being this well done is Lord of The Rings. It blows Braveheart out of the water, that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior movie","review":"This movie was recommended to me by my sister.

You become totally engrossed and it's not easy to predict what will happen next. I like a story with some closure at the end, and this movie has that.

Calling on primal triggers and survivalistic instinct is at the core of the success of this film. Yes, the costumes, jungle settings, buttocks, breasts, and \\"cultural\\" details are enthralling. It is the power of tapping into collective memory and how we have formed our view of ancient heritage that is so astounding. Is it very accurate? Are the scenarios presented very likely?

Apocalyto is a very violent and gory movie, so it may not be suitable for children under the age of 13. It is quite obvious that Mel Gibson worked very hard on this motion picture. The movie in some parts can be somewhat unrealistic, but Mel Gibson still did an excellent job recapturing the Mayan culture. This is a must see for any fan of the Action/Adventure genre!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apolcalyptp disc.","review":"Enjoyed the movies and commentation but the disc stopped and paused at the 11th scene (sacrifice) and continued through the chase through the jungle. For what I paid it would not be advantageous for me to send it back. Last time it cost more than the item itself and out of $10. I received only $1.00 credit for it. I would however need another copy of this movie as it is very annoying watching it stop and pause like it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"The violence is a bit much and is the only reason why its not a 5 star for me. I could hardly sit still through most of it. It's definately high octane and loaded with suspense. The visuals are great, wonderful directiion. Whatever you might think of Gibson, one thing is clear: he's a wonderful filmmaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure, Great Enertainment","review":"Regardless of it's historical correctness, this film is entertaining and fun to watch and gives a glimpse of what life might have been like for the people of that time and place.As filmmaking goes, this is quite a feat. The sets, costumes and makeup alone are worthy of an award.My only nitpick would be the use of the phrase \\"He's f**ked\\" in the subtitles when the one native watches the other slowly die after being bit by a snake. It's a bit much and a cheap attempt at humor in an otherwise fine film. I don't mind the F word being used in movies, as long as it is the correct time and place, but that was really not smart on Mel's part. Totally inconsistant with the rest of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten Running Man Ripoff!","review":"I think that this was probably one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time..... I can't believe that such a thin plot could be considered anything but rubbish! While beautifully filmed, and including some excellent actors, there just really is nothing to this story, regardless of how much blood and gore is thrown across the screen. Man is captured, his village wiped out and taken to a Mayan capital for sacrifice. He escapes, runs home while being chased by Mayan warriors, runs into Spanish conquistadors when about to be finished off, rescues his wife and kids and then wanders back into the jungle. That's it! When I think how much more could be done with this time in history and location, it makes me weep.... I strongly recommend you get a copy of 'Atztec' by Gary Jennings to get an idea of what has been missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie","review":"I just finished watching this movie. I agree with another viewer that Gibson should have spent more time developing the characters. Most of this movie was a long and boring chase scene. There didn't seem to be a real plot going on.

I rate it a 0 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you Mel Gibson","review":"Of all the beauty there is in this world, it is very hard for me to imagine a group of people spending their time and money and other resources to create a movie with such extreme violence. Is it just for the money or do these people get pleasure from creating and watching violence. I could not watch more than 15 minutes of this movie and I'll never see another movie that is connected to Mel Gibson or anyone else who was a part of this project. Also historically speaking this movie cannot be further from the truth. Fantasy? well I'd call it a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's it?","review":"I was really disappointed with Apocalypto. I heard lots of good things from my friends and made the mistake of buying it without having seen it first. There is no story in this movie. It's moderately impressive visually, but Mel Gibson doesn't seem to understand that a lot of pretty pictures do not a movie make. It is more impressive that the main character (whatever his name is) is in virtually every shot, and yet still he is somehow not developed at all. The movie had me bored to tears and watching it I did nothing but ask myself for two and a half hours why it was ever filmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gibson's Latest Fever Dream","review":"Yet another aimless, overwrought, adolescent Gibson film. Some directors nowadays let the technology take over their films. Gibson lets his production designers make his movies. Just add endless gore, and raging actors, and boom, another 50 million dollar drive-in movie. Somebody stop this man before he films again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Film","review":"Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is terrible. Gibson's perpesctive of mayan culture was interesting up until the point he decieded to brutaly murder the tribe. He uses disturbing directing tactics in Apocalypto to manipulate your emotions. For instance when the tribe is invaded, Gibson sets up \\"emotional killings.\\" The son watches his fathers throat get cut, the lover watches as the tribesmen rape and abuse his love. These are cheap tactics to make you care about the events on an emotional level. Overall I hated this movie. If you want a good flick by talented directors watch No Counrty for Old Men."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't even finish watching this film!!","review":"I had looked forward to viewing this film for several months. When I was finally able to check it out of the library I was excited to watch it; however, I did not even finish watching it. Although the cinematography was captivating, this was a horrible movie. The violence was extreme and hard to sit through. In addition, the portrayal of the Mayan culture is inaccurate. I can't recall the last movie I was not able to sit through a movie. Quite disappointing......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original and thought provoking","review":"This is a very good movie.Some people might complain that Mel Gibson's graphic use of violence, reminiscent of the Passion of Christ, is excessive but somehow with him, unlike Tarrantino for example, it just doesn't seem to be for the sake of it. The execution scenes in the Mayan capital are very gruesome and probably historically inaccurate but they enhance the movie and bring home just how savage human nature can be beneath the surface, in any culture and at any time.That was also the core message of Conrad's Heart of Darkness and I wondered when I watched this film if Gibson's choice of title \\"Apocalypto\\" and Coppola's \\"Apocalypse Now\\", based on The Heart of Darkness, was coincidental.And that's the irony of the ending. The arrival of the Conquistadors will bring about a greater genocide than anything the viewer has just seen, and all under the banner of the cross and Western Civilisation.This movie makes the viewer think, as well as shocking him. Worth Watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apocalypto","review":"Mel Gibson does an awesome job showing how the Mayan's livedback in the past.

He has showered us with all sorts of gore. I wish he had used Mayans for this Mayan story. He used tall, long-necked Latinos; Mayans are short and do not have necks. I have been to Yucatan, Guatemala, Honduras many times, but I do not remember seeing high mountains and 200-foot waterfalls in the Mayan world. He did pick a super hero. This man took a spear through the abdomen, an arrow through the chest, survived quicksand, and then ran a marathon after being hit in the head several time with a stone axe.If a person knows a little Mayan history, one can fit the film into it, but there is very little story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie, not a documentary","review":"The March/April 2007 issue of Archaeology magazine has an article on p. 36 that basically trashes the historical and cultural inaccuracies of this movie. Like all the criticism surrounding the movie \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", the critics seem unable to understand that these movies are fiction, not documentaries. I thoroughly enjoyed Apocalypto and I intend to buy the DVD when it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"sad but true","review":"yeah so sad these people were just hanging out with the fam and mating and you know then these other guys came in like they were from Philly or sumthin and raised cain and next thing you know there are heads rolling down concreted stairs. At first I thought it was the news and those idiot terrorists were at it again with their cameras but thankfully it was just a movie. Goes to show you that terrorism was around long before Muhammed became some kind of Pope for the dumb. Melody Gibson directed it and yeah that is neat because normally she just does movies that kind of pic on jews which of course the terrorists would actually condone, but that is for the sequal called Jaguar Path of Doom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Apoc by sepptagenerianalypto","review":"I enjoyed this unuaual movie.

Amazon need to package the disc less","review":"First of all i want to complain to AMAZON: PLEASE DONT COVER BLU-RAY DISCS IN SECURITY TAPE. It sticks to the box and does not come off properly. I bought two blu-ray movies and the box of BOTH of them is covered with stupid sticky bits left over from the stupid tape you put on it.

Yeah its bloody at times but its not nearly as bloody as some would have you believe. Probably not historically acurate but I kind of doubt that was the director's sole intention. Excellent special feature documentary and amusing fact-filled commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic pic","review":"Fantastic movie, so great looking in 1080p, but very short on features. I assumed with it being blu ray the extras would be great, but nothing like my hd dvd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Scores again.","review":"Great movie, the speaking of the mayan dialect doesnt detract from this movie at all.Mel may be a drunk, jew bashing sob. But man can he make a movie. I went into this movie thinking I wouldnt like it but was throughly suprised by it. Its a true classic.If you liked his previous work and your looking for a movie with a southamerican motif you cant go wrong,Also I didnt think this movie was as gory as everyone proclaimed it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Gibson's Apocalypto - My personal review","review":"This movie is a must have collectors item. It demonstrates and captures native people without bias. Everything was \\"le-natural\\", all prior to the spanish conquistadors or the european invasion/occupation. Put simply, you will see how a society lived without a central government, militia, commerce, business, schools, hospitals, electricity or technology. This movie brings to life at close range a peak into what it was like in the everyday life of native people of the americas in an unpolluted environment. You will see mother earth and a people co-exist in harmony. You will see how different tribes interact, some peacefully, others fiercely. Conclusion, you will honestly appreciate this movie. You hardly have to read the subtitles because the movie is so visual. Outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Apocalypto","review":"Great flick with alot of action, violence and historical implications. Definitely a manly movie! I recommend it with popcorn and beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"great period movie but lacking in an original historically linked plot","review":"gibson's previous historicals - braveheart, patriot, passion of the christ - the stories of these movies were well integrated with the period they represented - often linked with actual historical events - scottish warrior fighting england, american settler fighting british colonialists, jesus being tortured by the romans ...but the same cannot be said about apocalypto.how many movies have we seen of a male who returns from peril (abductment) to save his mate and child?you can simply take the plot of apocalypto and make it in our own modern times with little lost. and by that the movie loses its claim to greatness.it is a pity that gibson didn't do enough research to find a story more intimately wedded to the times and culture to give the plot its uniqueness and make it a great movie in all senses.apart from this the movie is highly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"This movie was very disappointing. If you want to watch a movie about a mayan (long haired mexican/indian) getting captured, then released, and then chased through the jungle, then this movie is for you. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly, the worst movie I have ever seen","review":"This was not the type of movie that was so bad it became funny, it was so bad it became exhausting. I never thought a movie this violent could also be this BORING. The movie had no point, it was a long snuff film set at the end of the Mayan civilization (vaguely, historically accuracy is fuzzy at best)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get all the hype","review":"The first scene they hunt this wild pig, kill it, then they cut the testacles off it and make one of the guys eat them in hopes that he will be able to get his wife pregnant. They actually showed him eating the balls...gross. I promptly removed it from the PS3, put it in the Netflix envelope and sent it back. It is beyond me why you'd open a movie like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Representative of our moral status","review":"This is the kind of movie that uses pure gore, violence and creepiness to draw attention to itself. Nowadays movies that appeal to primitive emotions of human beings like savageness, sadism, hatred and intense violence for its own sake seem to make big hit. Other examples include \\"Kill Bill\\" and \\"300\\". Probably we should build a Colosseum and have naked people fight with lions to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Is Too Many","review":"This movie portrays one gruesome act after another to the extent that it is boring. It drives home the theme of man's inhumanity to man over and over and over. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have.Also this movie is entirely subtitles.I'm not a Mel Gibson fan anymore but tried it because I have Netflix and the Starz movies, of which this is one, will be deleted from the selections after Feb. 28, 2012. I'm trying to watch as many, that are interesting, as possible prior to the cutoff. I watched about 20 minutes of it and decided to try another selection.If I had known how dull it was, I would not have bothered.

Seems Gibson is fixated on oral sex and portrays the Mayan's as a bunch of rowdy soccer fan types."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apocalypse Then","review":"I had previously rented this and liked it enough to buy it once it came out on Blu-Ray. True, it's not for every taste but to my knowledge its historically accurate. Well, pretty much. It looked real, it sounded real and I felt immersed in Mayan history. What cruelty there is is done for \\"religious\\" purposes (except for one sociopath who just seems to get a kick out of it..there's one in every crowd.)I like escape/survival situations especially when they are realistic and Apocalypto certainly delivered. So, in my opinion you should give it a try but be warned...heads will roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Gibson's hands behind it,, Definitely I will give it 5 stars","review":"Mel Gibson is an excellent actor he is more than a starHe is also more than amazing director . Sure all his work goes to the top movies ever. No doubt about it .."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to spoil the party","review":"if you are looking for gratuitous violence in a historically incorrect flic, go for it. the characters and cinematography is great, the rest is fed to you a la Mel Gibson. He has a point to make, a visual experience to feed you, and that is about it. I watched the movie, and at the end, the story is neither plausible, nor all that intriguing. Many of the violent scenes and dialogues are just there for Mel to show you; they do not fit in with the scheme, nor do they answer the so what question. Not bad visually, but not much of a movie either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost.....FAMOUS!","review":"One teensy scene upgrade: GODZILLA shows up onshore! It would have made for a much more believable film. Why not come out of the closet my dearest Mel and just make a horror flick, all the elements did present well. Why bother with the diversionary costly landscape, which was breathtaking and single redeeming feature. The same plot, flute theme, final showdown, blood, gore, hatred inducing scenes, over and over again. YAWN!!! JagPaw, JagWar, JigSaw, SeeSaw, BigKflaw...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good picture, good action, poor plot and too much gore","review":"After watching excellent Gibson movies like like Braveheart, Passion of the Christ and Signs, I watched with disappointment Apocalypto. The movie has good picture and excellent special effects as well as action but all these good traits are constantly overshadow by an exaggerated display of gore. Now, I'm OK with gore when used to emphasize the plot but large parts of this movie seem to be the other way around: There's some plot added to emphasize the gore. I would not recommend you to buy this movie. Rent it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC MOVIE","review":"I saw this movie once and have been trying to find it every since. I will buy it for my collection.The story line was great. It kept me on the end of my seat. Beautiful scenes and detail. Even some humor.

If you haven't seen this film, you should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mayan Road Warrior","review":"Mel Gibson is a real artist. This movie is a work of art. Every thing about it - from A to Z, actors to zoology, is pure art. The movie no sooner starts when you're plunged into its fast paced drama. Like Road Warrior it shows the story instead of telling it, what the medium thrives on, without losing you in a lot of meaningless dialogue (Deadwood comes to mind). As a Native American (Spirit Lake Dakota Nation), I feel that it is the best movie yet that depicts the beauty, power. and compassion of Native people of the Americas."},{"rating":"2","title":"ripped off","review":"The movie is five stars........my only complaint is that no credit was given to Cornel Wilde......whose \\"Naked Prey\\" is the basis of every inch of this Mel Gibson rip off......come on Mel, tell the truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"apocalypto","review":"i like this movie because is sometime of the history of America before good movie thanks mel gibson's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apocalypto - Mel Gibson","review":"This is the first movie, either as an actor, or a producer/director that in my opinion Mel Gibson bombed out. The movie is boring and a waste of money to purchase. It's important that people know that the movie shows little about the ancient Mayan society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful but disappointing","review":"While this is a powerful portrayal of the Mayan culture, it lacks both breadth and depth (not what I have come to expect from Mel Gibson). The Mayan people were so much more than what is depicted here. Without a context in which to fully understand this film, one would assume the Mayans were little more than savages, when in fact they had a well developed civilization. Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good --","review":"I bought this movie in blu-ray format - and the clarity (quality) did not dissappoint. Excessive violence - and I still battle with having to \\"read\\" the entire movie. Subtitles distract from watching what is happening. Just my opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best mad max movie yet","review":"If you like road warrior, youre going to enjoy this one.All the cars are gone. people have been reduced to primitive hunting gathering. bad guys attack mad max's village and the action doesnt stop.i hope mel directs the next pirates movie or the hobbit. he does better work than that peter jackson dude. (its a 5 star mad max movie but I had to take it down for the offensive racist historical nonsense mel needs to revisit \\"Brev��sima relaci��n de la destrucci��n de las Indias\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so much violence?","review":"What's with Mel Gibson and all these violent movies? Does he try to top himself each time? Take away the violence and how many people would really go to see this movie? Seriously? Better yet, take away Mel Gibson's name and how many people would go to see this movie? I'm hoping, one day, he'll make a movie that normal people can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MOVIE THAT REPRESENTS!!!!","review":"First of all, i will like to thank director mel gibson, for bringing a piece of hispanic culture to the big screen and to the whole world...Hispanics get secondary roles in hollywood, like for example ( HOUSEMAIDS!!!!!!!!! JANITORS!!!!!!! LAWNMOWER MEN, THE TYPICAL LIMOUSINE DRIVER!!!!!!! THATS VERY IGNORANT FROM HOLLYWOOD!!!!! well finally we get to show some talent, self-respect, and culture with apocalypto...even thou its not that loyal to the real thing, but it represents for sure.... another hit is PANS LABYRINTH...made by hispanics, for hispanics, ( i guess no english dubbing on this one) which is good...!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless, Jack Bower without the cell phone","review":"While visually satisfying the appetite and creative in that sense, I kept waiting for a point to be made. Like \\"24\\" you have to suspend disbelief--a man is tortured, forced to walk for miles and miles through jungle and rapids and hills, no food, no water (no cell phone), shot with a spear through the abdomen, meets up with a panther and outruns him, shot with an arrow through the shoulder, jumps down a massive waterfall, survives all and still outruns several healthy, well equipped (but really lousy shots) and well fed pursuers. The ending was pat and predictable. Enough gore and bloodshed to satisfy even the most hungry mass murderer watching. I kept wondering, what kind of sick mind keeps making the same movie over and over--all Gibson's movies seem to have no other point that to kill and gore and behead and sever as many limbs as possible under the guise of pretending to tell a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinly masked torturefest.","review":"This may very well be the worst film I've ever seen. The setting of the Mayans and Aztecs attracted me to the movie in the first place, but it's merely the coat of paint thrown on a completely pointless and barbaric film.From scene one, this movie is grotesque. Mel attempts to connect us with the Mayans with an opening scene of tricking the fat kid into eating pig balls, then rubbing hot peppers onto his privates. And it just goes downhill from there.The whole film feels like an excuse to film the horrific acts Gibson seems to have become obsessed with. Near the end, it's like they suddenly remember they need some sort of confrontation and resolution, and it's like he just went down the list of movie cliches in order. In two minutes I saw every bad trick to build tension ever concieved.I'm disgusted that Apocalypto is selling so well. Or even at all for that matter. It's a horrible film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Ray Case Deceptive","review":"I didn't buy this movie on regular DVD because I DID NOT WANT TO READ THE MOVIE I wanted to watch it and listen to it!!! I bought this movie on Blue Ray because the case said it had an optional 5.1 English sound track --- but it did not! Both the uncompressed sound track and the 5.1 sound track are in the obscure language. The only English sound track is the commentary by the director."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRUTAL, VIOLENT, STUNNING","review":"Many reviewers spoke of the movie itself, which was incredibly well done and held your interest from start to finish. I wanted to comment on the blu-ray version of the film. Visually, it was brilliant, sharp, clear, with breath-taking scenes in the jungles and the Mayan cities. Images were stunningly beautiful. Audio was equally impressive, and I was using a mere 5.1 channel surround sound system. I can't imagine the sound through a true HD audio receiver. Overall, a wonderfully done movie, but as violent as violent can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful","review":"I almost missed the mesmerizing experience of viewing this captivating movie by Mel Gibson. What a dramatic and emotionally packed film this is.I couldn't take my eyes from it for a single second. Whomever the critics were that gave this film less than an outstanding rating could not have possibly seen the same film as I. I don't give a flip about Mel Gibson's bad press in regard to his behavior of late, and credit should be given where it is due. There is no question that it is due here. Forget all the negativity that you may have heard regarding Mel or this film. Run don't walk to your nearest store and buy this DVD, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Gibson's best","review":"I let the haters put me off of this flick for years. Then I watched it. It's no more bloody or violent than most modern flicks are. The entire thing gets you going. The illusion is consistent and constant. If you are an adult who likes this genre, action, I don't see how you can skip this flick? It is actually a dual line love story, one of a man for his wife and child, and one of a warrior's love for his son. Things get \\"messy\\" .....ruuuuuuuuuuuun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Apocolypto","review":"I had heard about this film, and happened to catch a couple minutes of it at a friend's house.

It is hard not to see the parallels between our society and the twilight of the ancient Mayans. This is a life-affirming tale that values human dignity over what humanity often degrades into.

Too bad this isn't on HD, only Blu Ray :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly entertaining, but WRONG","review":"This movie was...uhh....intresting but lacked any historical accuracy. More research should of been done on this movie before it was made. There were HUGE inaccuracies in this movie. The Mayan cities were abandoned atleast 600 years before the arrival of spaniards. This would be like putting Moses in The Passion. Anyone that knows anything about pre-columbian meso-america will be disappointed by this movie. Although there was a touch of barbarianism in this culture (as there was in every culture) they were not the primative cavemen Mel made them out to be. In alot of ways, they were further evolved than their european counterparts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, someone, take Mel to the Yucatecan Jungle....","review":"......strip him, paint him blue, cut his heart out, chop his head off, and save us all from any more of his stupid,loud, violent, bloody movies!

It has a mat finish that is like looking through frosted glass.Also, the backing paper that is on the back of this product, causes lines to remain on your sheet once you've printed. When you apply the sticker to your item, you can still see the lines on the product you've applied it to, even after smoothing it out as best you can.If you are using this product for printing photos on, you definitely want a crystal clear sticker sheet.

I don't think anyone on amazon sells it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT clear","review":"I bought this to put on a glass hurricane vase for a memorial candle. It was NOT clear at all, but more like a fuzzy, hazy translucent white. I put the sticker on the candle itself (being white), and it loooks great. My biggest problem is (and the reason I only gave 2 stars)that it is stated as clear, and it is most certainly not. Other than that, it does do it's assigned purpose, but I would only use this on white items so it blends without being obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"not clear but frosty","review":"I was really disappointed to see these have a matte finish and look like they have a grey background when used. I was assuming they were CLEAR not like frosted glass. I was going to use them on glass jars as labels, but they look like frosted glass and look terrible. So don't buy them if you wanted really clear sticker paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, poor workmanship","review":"Like a previous reviewer, mine also arrived with a crack in the handle. The edges where the two sides come together are warped, so that it can't be closed completely. This causes a huge half-inch gap down the middle of all three sides, when the case is closed, allowing in dust and bugs (which defeats the whole purpose). It is a big enough gap that small ornaments might even fall out. The plastic is brittle.I have a similar case in green I purchased years ago that is great (no cracks, heavier plastic, no gaps). What a disappointment. Am trying to reach the company to see if I can return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great ornament box","review":"TO start, it came with a crack on the handle. Though it does hold all ornaments in one neat place, the sides of the box are wedged open by the width of the ornaments (Even though my ornaments are regular sizes).

Consequently, she bruises extremely easily - often, all she has to do is brush up against anything solid such as a door frame or rest her arm on a table. Arnicare Ointment has been amazing in making the bruises lighter in appearance and then just disappearing; normally, she would be trying to hide a bruise for days. I don't know how well this product works in other respects, but when it comes to dealing with bruises, I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF","review":"Half of the book is worthless (and its less than 100 pages).

Learning yoruba can be very difficult because there are sounds in the yoruba language that are not in english. Olatunde Soroye does a very good job of using english words to assist the reader in learning how to make yoruba sounds. Also, ��r�� If�� Publishing in CA sells the tapes for the book, which makes learning Yoruba much easier!

The acting was so bad I actually thought they were trying to be bad actors. I was in the mood to be entertained and was very disappointed. The possible problem with this play was low budget.

I have seen bigger dolls for combing hair and this one was not in that league."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I'd hoped for, unfortunately","review":"The book has lovely illustrations, but I was hoping for actual photos because chickens in someone's backyard flock or at a show often look very different from drawings. A few of the illustrations were shaded with colors not normally found in nature, too, making it hard to tell what color the chickens really were.Otherwise, the drawings are very nice and the book is very informative on the 60 breeds mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was imagining","review":"I guess I was looking for a little more in-depth information about individual breeds. Instead, this book describes useless information like the angle of the tail of a specific breed. It really is a \\"field guide\\" for someone who might be observing chickens in the wild. The thing is, how often are chickens roaming around in the wild?If you are looking for information about breed temperaments, egg-laying abilities, compatibility with other breeds, or great photos, look elsewhere--You won't find it in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I know of on this subject.","review":"As a musician, an avid reader and a Texan, I take Texas Music seriously.

To truly understand Schubert, you have to listen to his lieder. To truly hear his lieder, you have to listen to Fischer-Dieskau and Gerald Moore. To truly understand Schubert, you have to read Fischer-Dieskau's little book.

The experiment performed by Davis/Brewer was in my opinion artificial (has anyone heard about mainframe software conferencing VAXNotes??) and has hardly anything to do with the way we use email / chatrooms / blogs, which were not yet there at that time (around 1990).Therefore, I find this book's title overhyped and misleading, the content being far from issues of computer mediated communication and virtuality. On the positive side, authors have sound knowledge of today's linguistic theories. It is only hardcore linguists, who may somehow profit from this book.

The subject matter might have been interesting, as there were plenty of rich topics that could have been delved into, but alas they were not.

So, I bought this item, and was sad to discover that although I got 6 episodes, numbered 1-6, it was NOT the actual #'s 1-6. I watched the first four episodes on the dvd, and at least 3 episodes were missing. One moment two characters are fighting, with every intention of killing, the next they are teamed up, and the next there's a new character out of nowhere who has been with them a while, with no explanation. That's two episodes skipped in between right there. I don't know whether or not there is nudity, or excessive language in the missing episodes, and that's the cause or not, but I just can't recommend this product until they release the series with every episode.

It's so stupid, it's an embarassment to hear...As if that wasn't pathetic enough, the abundance of self-referential lines out of these two is just another pronounced example of the overcommericialization of music.

She is so guilt-ridden after she and her boyfriend do their thing in Maurice's home, that any human being would have regrets.

His purity and inner strength allow him to wield great powers--a day-dream that every young boy has had. The twist at the end left me breathless and panting for book two...E.V. is a very talented author from whom we will certainly see many great works to follow. His descriptions are powerful yet seem effortless. His characters are real and alive because they are developed not only descriptively, but naturally through interactions with others and with their world. Throughout the book, I was not only able to know what Alexander was thinking in situations, but I was able to feel his experiences with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting \\"Knights\\" of reading await the fantasy loving reader","review":"After the first few chapters of \\"The Orphaned Knight\\", I was anxiously anticipating the final encounter but was in no rush to get there.

This is not true. It most accurately means 'sexual immorality' and definitely includes adultery during marriage. So Jesus DID make provision for divorce in cases of adultery! It is not always the right thing--even in cases of adultery. But in continual, unrepented adultery, it may sometimes apply."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshingly high view of marriage","review":"Joseph Webb analyzes the scriptural basis for marriage, emphasizing the importance of keeping vows, and builds the spiritual framework for marriage. He proves beyond reasonable doubt that marriage is something that no man can put asunder and that remarriage without the death of the original spouse is adultery. He maintains a high view of the marriage covenant and takes great pains to show his viewpoint as truly Biblically based. The book is well written and is laid out in a logical format. It will find a prominent place on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Read This Book","review":"There will always be a debate with this subject; you either believe or not.

Remarriage after divorce is adultery and adulterers don't go to heaven, however he refused to tell remarried people what to do about this predicament which seemed like a copout. No understanding of the grace of Jesus Christ. If our behavior is what gets us into heaven, we're all in a heap of trouble. I am a pastor and I have never been divorced and I find this book to be a terrible exposition of what the Bible teaches about marriage, human nature and grace.

I get tired of all these wanna-be R&B \\"soul singers\\" who pop themselves around like they've got something urgent and mean to say when all that comes out of their mouths is a constant stream of cotton candy. This album by Gretchen that I just bought is real, my friends--straight from the heart and it's a big heart too.

Not as good as the buddy lee (for me), but much cheaper and still a 5 star product.*The guy below said this is non-adjustable. It adjusts fine.

As much as the cast has changed over the years, things pretty much stay the same on Wisteria Lane. Through it all you see the same petty back biting, shifty characters and malevolence characteristic of soap operas. The show had a relatively promising start with the mystery surrounding the death of Mary Alice. Of course, there was only so far you could take this, and her voice no longer carries with it much concern as she continues to watch over her little enclave. In a rather desperate gesture, the writers have resurrected Paul Young, but there never was anything particularly appealing about him.

Although the ball is technically \\"Indoor/Outdoor,\\" a few minutes of play at the basketball courts at my local park caused dust/dirt to stick to the ball and made it EXTREMELY slippery for play. Shooting long ranged shots is extremely difficult due to this and the slipperiness of the ball has detrimental effects on other aspects of the game as well. In addition, the ball makes an awkward noise when bounced and does not sound like a regular basketball bounce. An extremely unsatisfactory purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased for outdoor use, it's terrible.","review":"-This ball does not provide a good grip once you start using it outdoors: the dust, wear/tear smooths its surface right away.-There have been many times when I can't make a good shot because of the lack of grip.-Like many other reviewers have noted, there is a weird sound when you bounce it (even after hours and hours of usage).Save your money for another ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I got this yesterday and returned it on the same day. First, the ball sounds weird when dribbled. I know it shouldn't matter, but its embarrassing when you are playing with it. Secondly, the ball doesn't bounce right.

This CD is not what I expected. I was eager to hear once again the desert birds like the mockingbird and quail illustrated on the cover of this CD. No track information is provided by Amazon, so I took a chance and bought this pricey album. It has only four tracks. The first, over 20 minutes long, is a donkey market in the Moroccan Sahara. Its sounds are frightening. Second, a \\"multitude of birds\\" at a temporary lake in the Sahara, could have been recorded on the Staten Island ferry. The third track (17 min.) opens with shrill whistling followed by dromedaries in a sand storm. The last track is a forest spring at dusk (the forest is near a desert town in Morocco)--9 minutes of frogs. I am truly disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak effort from a great band","review":"\\"Combat Rock\\" was the last album from The Clash with both Strummer and Jones in the line up. Sadly, it is a major dissapointment. It's two hit singles \\"Should I Stay Or Should I Go?\\" and \\"Rock the Casbah\\" are two stand outs amongst this unorganized collection of songs. \\"Straight To Hell\\" is also one of the best songs the group ever recorded. It is moody and lyrical and is one last remarkable song from one of the best rock bands in history. The rest of the tracks range from mediocre to poor. If your a big fan like myself, the album should be in your collection for the three tracks I mentioned. If your looking for an album to start with, try \\"London Calling\\" and their self titled debut, \\"The Clash\\" (both UK and US versions)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disapointment","review":"After the stellar album London Calling and the magnificent Sandinista, I expected great things from this album. I remember running to the record store and getting it on the first day of release..what a disapointment. The William Burroughs stuff is dreadful and their pop hits are just awful.The Clash always had great pop sensibility...some of the tracks on Sandanista and London Calling had a great sound (Somebody Got Murdered, Washington Bullets,etc).

Because it appealed to more than just the true-believers. If you read through the reviews of this album, many of the faithful are saying this is the Clash's worst album, not as good as London Calling, etc. I never liked the Clash much (other than a song here and there), but I did enjoy this album. I think it is more approachable for people who are into more mainstream music (i.e. not punk rockers). I owned London Calling and the Black Market Clash EP (a 10\\" record, called a NuDisc), and just never warmed to the music. But this album, although it did take a few listens to appreciate, really grew on me. Favorite song from the album? Ghetto Defendant..."},{"rating":"2","title":"You might want to look elsewhere if you just want PUNK","review":"The Clash by this point were actually far removed from their purely punk asthetic. As Mick Jones once stated, they were out to prove they could do ANY kind of music and use it to their own ends. This is an eclectic set to be sure, and that's a good thing. In fact, the only thing here I don't personally like is the sing-song-y \\"Inoculated City.\\" Everything else is at least intriguing when not totally righteous. \\"Ghetto Defendant\\" has a great bass line, great atmosphere (love that harmonica) and Gainesbourg's robotic interjections. \\"Straight to Hell\\" is an obvious classic; rarely has such a quiet song sounded so devestating.Those are just a few highlights from a very unique album that's well worth checking out.

In a way, by being more sophisticatedly dark (see Sean Flynn, Straight to Hell, et al), it succeeds at being more punk than anything the Clash did prior. Further, I fail to find anything substantively commercial about CR. Hits and sales are effects which need not point to commercial material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than You'd Think","review":"A few months ago, I was perusing my local used music shop when I came across the 'C' part of the tape section. Right in front of me was Combat Rock. I bought the tape, but never really listened to it until a few weeks ago. At first I was expecting it to be kind of \\"bad\\", since a lot of the punks say that this is kind of the 'sell-out album'. But. This record is amazing. Every song is unique and darkly beautiful, yet still vintage Clash at its best. 'Ghetto Defendant' alone is one of the raddest things I've heard as of late, but pretty much every track is very, very good. This is one album you can play all the way through with no need to skip a single track.

But not even half this album is good. Only five songs on it are really good: \\"Know Your Rights,\\" \\"Straight to Hell,\\" \\"Ghetto Defendant,\\" and the two mega-hits...you see, the Clash were at least wiser than other bands to put their good songs out as singles. Still, so many of the songs are scattered and experimental that it's pitiful. You may get it for the good songs, but still...pay VERY little for it, like I did. And please get their first album and London Calling. Adios!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine clash album.","review":"The Clash's finest album.

Even though it contains their 2 biggest songs \\"Should I Stay\\" and \\"Casbah\\" the rest is really bad. The only other good song is Atom Tan. They just sound too tired to write any good riffs and you can hear them just running out of steam. Well they had a great 5 year run and alot of great songs but this is not the one to get.

The rot set in with Combat Rock, which for all purposes really is the last true Clash album(Cut The Crap can be dismissed altogether). This album is nothing more than two hit singles sandwhiched between a bunch of filler that sounds like the worst moments of Sandinista, plus two pretty decent songs \\"Know Your Rights\\" and \\"Straight To Hell\\".I have it because it's The Clash, but hardly their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"\\"Should I Stay or Should I Go\\" is decent rock. But the Clash were really quite anemic for a punk band. I saw them live twice, and they never really had much impact on the audience. When I've seen the Stones live, even nonfans jumped to their feet when they kicked into that first song. Clash fans didn't. The only great punk band was the Sex Pistols. They were great.

Their music continually evolved, however, that evolution took a wrong turn with this album. It wasn't inventive like London Calling (yes you whipper snappers, nothing like it had been put out till then - we all realize that a lot of stuff since then has borrowed that sound) or experimental like Sandinista.

If you like punk, stay away from this, if not, you can listen to everyone else and buy it. I personally don't really think the Clash sold out, they're a talented group of musicians and punk can be very confining. Muscially, it's good, but no energy or spunk in it which is what I like in my Albums, oh well"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest disappointment","review":"'Combat Rock' was the biggest musical disappointment of my life: an album by my (then) favorite band that I couldn't even listen to a second time. And then, adding insult to injury, it becomes their best seller! But I don't think of it as a sell-out because it wasn't bad because it was trying to be commercial; it was just bad.

Get this only to complete your collection. get everything else first and forget about cut the crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little to recommend on this one","review":"Meandering reggae sound experiments and preachy lyrics condemn this Clash effort to the little played pile. After the ferocity of earlier work, this sounds like a band that has lost direction or worse has been co-opted by a feeling of self-importance. The only memorable numbers are the juvenile singles \\"Rock The Casbah\\" and \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go\\" which at least have melody and rhythm to recommend them. \\"Straight To Hell also jumps out as an example of more restraint getting better results in the midst of all this chaos. If at least the sonic clarity was better, the effort to wade through the noise and mumbling might be worth while, but as it is this was a few plays for me and then it will be collecting dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CLASH/ WHATS NOT TOO LIKE","review":"I will admit I have mixed feelings for this album. I'm shure many other clash fans feel the same. while some claim this is the album that ruined their career, others will say that it is their finest work. I personally think this album is very good, but not the same or nearly as good as their two first albums. The clash after having exploded in the punk scene, they moved on to break music barriars. While I miss their original style, its hard not to appreciate their their later work. No matter what which part of their career you look at, you are for shure absorbing some good music. Rest in peace Joe Strummer. We can't be certain about these kind of things but I really hope he made it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Diversity in Opinion Here","review":"Not being a punk-rock afficionado, I do like this album. And being that I was four when it came out, I have no recollection of The Clash ever selling out (if that's what you think they did). What I do know is that I appreciate a sub-par album if it shows a serious attempt to grow and expand by the artist that created it. The same formula becomes old and stale, and without change you end up with the Battle of Los Angeles and Chris Cornell as your new front man. I love The Clash, and London Calling, but I also enjoy Combat Rock because it is not either of those albums. It displays the reggae-dub, and electronic influences that would later make up Big Audio Dynamite's sound.

If you read George Adams memoirs, you will know that Christian, that adorable lion, was most likely killed by other lions or people, in no short order, and never was happy in Africa, except in that video, when he probably thought he was going home. He was tame, and not fit for life in the wild, and it was idiotic of those boys to send him to Africa, when he could have led a happy, healthy life in a wild animal park in England and they could have visited often. I find it horrendous that we buy into this nonsense - and those boys, now adults, are still trying to profit from their ill-informed idealism. Could you survive in the wilds of Africa? Well, neither could Christian. And we go, awwww, when what they did was cruel and inhumane. Send them angry letters, and don't buy this book - that is what they deserve.

I just purchased a second one, and when I took it out of the box and went to fill it, and one of the plastic pieces snapped! I didn't even get to use it once.On the other hand, it is very easy to clean, you don't have to get a tiny bottle brush into the small reservoir openings that are common with humminbird feeders.

The first lasted years until it was knocked off the window during a storm. We have several other styles of feeders at the house but this seems to be the one they like the most (maybe location but in any case, hummers like this).

The problem is that it is humid at times where she lives in San Francisco. She may not have had the suction cup stuck to the glass very well and the feeder fell two floors to it's death.

We made our own nectar (red dye may be bad for hummingbirds!), so we could see them through the reservoir. It is relatively easy to clean, and its 8 oz. capacity was perfect for our hummingbird traffic.The very big downside is that the plastic tabs securing the reservoir to the feeder are too flimsy. I broke two of these feeders in two years. If Perky Pet would improve the design (i.e. how the reservoir connects to the red base/feeder), I'd reconsider buying one. Lost my receipt (didn't buy it from Amazon) so can't get a refund. I did make the one that broke mid-season work a bit longer by taping the reservoir to the base.

Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books.

It jumps around through time, she was unable to create sympathy with ANY of her Civil War protagonists, the Yankee villain is a reversed Simon Legree (totally cardboard; I wouldn't believe even a Confederate jailer at Andersonville could be that bad), and altogether it's a muddle.

I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection. To each their own but it is not something I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived - neither well-written fiction, nor well-narrated history","review":"I read this on the recommendation of a friend. We obviously have differing ideas of a good read. I finished the book, only because I need to justify the time invested in beginning the read. After the third \\"life or death\\" nail-biting situation in which Anna finds herself, with the book only half finished, I was sorely tempted to ditch the book and call the time spent a lesson learned. How \\"intrepid\\" can one character be before she's deemed to be stupid? The Civil Was portion of the narrative failed to engender sympathy for any of the characters and bordered on boring. By the end, the only characters I had any minor feeling for were the lesbian lighthouse keepers. The use of Anna's \\"discovery\\" of the dead from both narratives in the same spot felt as though Ms. Barr was bored as well and strove to just finish the thing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLASHBACK","review":"I have just finished FLASHBACK and this was my 2nd. try at getting it read. I have finished all 17 of the books in this series and I do hope there will be more. However, I sure don't want to read any more letters. Ms. Barr's stories are amazing . When she describes the scenes in her book I am there. I can smell the flowers see the colors and isn't it great we have such great authors to choose from? If you read all the books in this series you wll probably find \\"BURN\\" hard to finish It is hard to imagine that things like this happen but they do. It is all the things that happen to Anna that make her character so fantastic. So grab a good book and enjoy!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the series","review":"I've read all of the Nevada Barr mysteries and this by far is the worst. Jumping back and forth between the two stories was tiring and boring. I only made it halfway through, and I had to struggle to get that far. The rest of the books in the series are good, but I don't recommend this one for a first time reader of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best . . . .","review":"I have read all of the Anna Pigeon books, and this is by far the best. Could be that I like stories on or in the water and stories about the Civil War--and this one had both. A previous reviewer did not like the way the book switched from chapter to chapter from the present to the flashback. That is a point I liked very much. Each chapter ended with you wanting to read more, and that is basic Writing 101 at its best! The clever ending tied the package up very neatly. This was Barr's best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"letters are great","review":"I love Nevada Barr & have all of her books. But this one was not her best. It starts out very slow. But poor Anna is almost killed again near the beginning of the book. But the best part of this book are the letters from her great-great Aunt. If fact they were so good that I read them to the end & then went back & read the story about Anna. This poor woman is almost killed at least 3 times in this story. The beginning is slow. It starts to pick up around the middle but the last of the book is so good you can't put it down. Even though it is not her best it is still a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a seasoned human resources professional, I was looking forward to reading this book.

While these elements are sometimes exaggerated for comic effect, the overall sense of reality and recognition is frequently chilling. The reader really cares about the hero, John Anchor, as he plots to get his severance package and stumbles onto a conspiracy that is both his greatest opportunity and worst nightmare.This novel is well written, tightly plotted and totally absorbing. A great summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"I found Severance Package to be a captivating novel that embraces not only the realities of corporate life but also the bizarre - which very often translates into reality. This book is a page turner that you will not be able to put down. Written along the lines of a Grisham novel, Nilsson captures the true essence of corporate life - from the frustrating existence of middle managers to the egotistical behaviors and mannerisms of the people with whom we work and to whom we all report. Interwoven in this story are true-to-life descriptions of life in Minnesota which include characterizations of typically conservative Scandinavian personalities to portraits of downtown Minneapolis. If you want to read about the people you work with, I recommend you get your own Severance Package. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit too tidy...","review":"I, too, am a former employee of this monolithic bank, and I picked up a copy of this book to see what parallels there may be with my own experiences there. While he describes the general atmosphere and political posturing very well, the read is often bogged down with unbelievable dialogue and an ending that's way too tidy. It all comes together a little too neatly in the end, and well outside of any reality-based premise, given the individuals involved.What's even more laughable is that the author thinks that a 6-month severance is some kind of godsend... when in reality, many people in middle management were getting much longer severance packages at the bank in question.I give the author credit, however, for sitting down and writing this novel and self publishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird organization and disjointed exercises","review":"Maybe I missed something, but a few pages into the book, the \\"hands on\\" exercise was refering to a page I had not created. Then the book continues to refer to this page, and others. This makes the book not completely hands on, in my mind. This is not what I was expecting based on other Sams books. Also, the organization of the book in a bit odd. Each page is quartered which may look graphically interesting, but seemed to make it harder to follow. Additionally, in a couple of minor places, the book did not deal with differences in the Mac version of Dreamweaver very well. If this were my only choice, I would buy it, and make use of it. It's not, so I'm going to return it and go with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"(...)","review":"(...)This is like the Dick and Jane books we learned to read with.

It's all presented in disjointed bits and pieces.2) Sometimes a later topic (tasks as Coley refers to them) builds upon an ealier Task that he assumes the reader has saved. But he does not tell the reader that they should save them for later!3) Does a very poor job explaining the important Dreamweaver Layers concept(layers, layout cells, layout tables). Does not tie them together or clearly explain how the user should or should not, use all three of these elements together in the designing of a webpage.This book badly needs to have an underlying webpage project in it so that the author can use it to tie all the important elements together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners only","review":"The Fireworks content is very marginal.

Well, I wasted two days reading this book and I can appreciate that it may be some masterpiece.....but to who? Certainly not to me. I found the book boring and the main character's life was so unrealistic..i wanted 2 puke..its ok to make it exciting..but come on.... too much is too much"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor recipes","review":"The book has great photos of the finished products, but the recipes--at least, the ones I tried--really are terrible. And most of the recipes in the book call for vegetable shortening instead of butter. Shortening gives the cookies a very odd squishy texture and does nothing for the flavor. It's an awful substitute for the nice crumb, richness and flavor that butter provides.I'd stay away from this book--there are so many beautiful collections of great cookie recipes available, there's no need to spend your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all here","review":"I have found that this book contains almost every cookie recipie you could ever need. Most of the old favorites and basics are here. There is a large \\"do it yourself\\" section for bar cookies--suggestions/recipies for a range of crusts and fillings. BEST OF ALL there is a color photo of the finished cookie next to each recipie. (So you can have an idea of what it should look like.) The negative side of this book is that the author uses names that might not be familiar. I just used a bunch of postits and tagged the pages with the names I use. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"I gave this item as a gift so I'm not sure of the contents of the book, but the condition was good and the shipping fast, I had it in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"TYPOS, TYPOS, TYPOS!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I am absolutely amazed that this book was published with the number of typos in the recipes. I choose 7 recipes randomly from throughout this book and of those 7, six of them had HUGE ingredient typos. For example:2 1/4 tablespoons of flour instead of 2 1/4 CUPS!1 teaspoon of liquid ingredients to 4 1/4 cups of dry!I will NEVER use this cookbook again as I cannot trust ANY of the recipes to be correct.Yes it's a \\"pretty\\" book. Yes it has a large number of recipes. However, if the author/editor and publisher are not going to test the recipes or pay attention to the accuracy of the final galleys, then it would have been better NOT to publish it at all. Not only did I waste my money on the purchase of this book, but I also wasted my money on the ingredients for the 7 recipes I choose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleah...","review":"Not thrilled - many of the recipes feature shortening, which tends to give them a rather icky texture & taste. They also often seem very doughy and come out underdone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes don't work","review":"This book is a marketing scam. It's got pretty photos, but all the cookies I made were failures. I ended up throwing out at least 3 batches from different recipes. I'm an accurate cook, and after following the recipes from this book, they came out absolutely inedible!!! Not even my sweet obssessed kids would eat them. I had to write this to warn others not to buy this book. Stick to recipe books that have been well received with tested recipes and written by well-known cooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures, flavorless cookies...","review":"I was VERY excited to buy this book, because I adore cookies of course. After trying a few of the recipes though, I have to say that this book is very disappointing. The recipes are just not that good. The cookies were very bland and not even remotely exceptional. I guess these people either didn't test these recipes out, or just have unbelievably low standards. When you write a cookbook, you should try to create the best possible recipe for each dish. They must not have cared too deeply. Another reviewer wrote quantity not quality. I agree!!! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some recipes don't work","review":"Overall, most recipes in this book are pretty run-of-the-mill. Like an earlier reviewer, I have only been surprised by how unremarkable the cookies are. Finally, I have had the experience with a number of recipes that cooking times and proportions are significantly wrong. I wrote this after one recipe for icing turned out to be a soupy mess, and the sugar cookie dough I had chilling in the fridge was unformable. Go with a different source for cookie recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy useful cookie recipes","review":"This book has many wonderful recipes. It's great for making cookies or bars using ingredients that I have on hand or need to use up. I've made about 12 so far -- mostly worth repeating but a few less than fantastic recipes, but that's OK. There are 1001 to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice source of inspiration but...","review":"Were any of these recipes tested? I'm a fairly experienced cooky baker - and bought this because of the many new ideas presented in it. Having tried making several types of the pumpkin cookies, and after reading the other reviews, I've come to the conclusion that none of these recipes were tested. How can you make cookies with no sugar? All of the recipes I've tried have turned out like unflavored rocks.I gave this collection 2 stars since it does allow one to glean ideas from the recipes - as long as you have the talent (or other decent cookbook) - to modify the ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot...","review":"I was initially excited at the prospect of so many cookie recipies under one cover, but upon closer perusal, I realized that in spite of the great number of recipes, homogeneity pervades this collection. There are too many variations on the theme (there are multiple versions of many common types of cookies). Also, many of the recipes are just plain bland. The photography is uninspiring (and in some cases, unappetizing). Overall, I was surprised at the lack of originality. There are definitely better cookie cook books out there (a great favorite of mine, although considerably smaller in size, is a spiral-bound collection of cookie recipes published by Land-O-Lakes. It is richly varied, scrupulously accurate, and altogether a pleasure to use.) Unfortunately, I cannot say I would recommend 1000 Cookie Recipes to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cookie Crumbles","review":"This is a good book as a reference for what a particular type of cookie is. It would be good for baking for International Day at your kids' school since kids will eat almost anything sweet. The cookies I have made have been edible but unexciting. I got it because the recipes call for shortening (my daughter is allergic to dairy products). However, I have had much better luck using other cookbooks and substituting margarine for butter. What do you need this many recipes for if you don't want to eat them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of errors, don't waste your money!","review":"I can't believe this ever got published! You can't trust any of the recipes, there are so many errors in amounts. It's obvious no one bothered to proofread it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flavorless cookies","review":"I have tried 26 cookies from this book. I have two that were good, the rest were flavorless. A large number must have had mistakes in the recipes as I ended up with dry, crumbly, dough (and I use that term loosely). I came back to this spot today to buy another cookie cookbook as I have finally given up on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy with this book!","review":"I got this book a long time ago, and have been testing different recipes in it over the years. Aside from the typos, overall bland flavors, and similar recipes, I'd just like to say...Has anyone ever tested these recipes before publishing them???So far, I've had many of the recipes fail on me, but nothing like what happened today. I consider myself a seasoned baker-- I do about 13 varieties of Christmas cookies each year-- and something like Mexican Wedding cakes is REALLY HARD TO MESS UP. But it baked for 3 friggin' hours & never actually...baked!Super fed up with this book. For every 1 recipe that is actually a keeper, there are some major bombs or \\"meh\\" recipes. You can find a better book than this one, and if you can't, just go to foodnetwork.com or cooks.com for your new recipes and avoid the disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cookbook!","review":"It can be a challenge to find a useful cookbook with a variety of recipes. This is truly the ultimate cookie book. There are regional U.S. reciped (the Hello Dollies turned out really well!) as well as international recipes. The variey in taste ranges from a simple sugar cookie to decadent bar cookies.I love that there is a photograph of every cookie- as many cooks know you wonder what the finished product will look like. The instructions are clear and easy to follow!A great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but haven't used it much","review":"I have to admit I was surprised at the reviews this book got, because I've never had a problem with it.

I guess I'll have to keep using it to see if it was really worth it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over cookie monster!!","review":"I was getting bored eating the same old cookies I would buy at the store. With this book it would take years to try them all. 1001 recipes on making cookies of every type, texture, and way you could imagine. It is impossible to get bored with this book. I spent hours just trying to decide which cookie to make today and which tomorrow. I can't eat them fast enough to bake another style. You can never be to old or to young for cookies.

I say unfortunately because these performances are curiously pedestrian, utterly routine and continuously lacking charm, grace and anything close to depth. It's all quite a terribly dull affair at Bach's expense--- and ours. To add insult to injury, the recording itself is heavily weighted in Ma's favor, which is hardly a bonus; Cooper's harpsichord sounds as if it's in another room somewhere in the distance... droning on and on and on. Even at mid-price, these renditions are simply not competitive.[Running time: 42:24]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whimsically Annoying","review":"I found Yo-Yo-Ma's interpretation of Bach's Sonata No.2 to be outright silly and without any depth. If you want to hear how this should be played correctly, listen to how Lev Aronson played it on his 1725 Goffriller back in 1971. Everyone wants to take a piece of music and \\"make it their own\\". Just play it like it is written, with passion, with depth, with understanding and with the intent of doing justice to the composer. Anyone can play notes on a page. My advice to Yo-Yo-Ma and others is to stop playing notes and start playing music. We're all getting tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ma never disappoints","review":"I must admit that I am a real fan of Maestro Rostropovich for the emotion he puts into his work.

I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective CDs","review":"I received a defective CD and returned it for another. The second CD was also defective - beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what Bach wrote folks!","review":"The so called Goldberg Variations is one of the greatest works ever composed for the keyboard. But keyboard in Bach' s time meant a harpsichord, a VERY different instrument from the modern piano. If you wouldn' t dream of hearing the Hammerklavier Sonata in an electric organ, why contradict Bach' s intentions? There is a quite marvelous recording of this work in the OPUS111 label with Pierre Hantai. This recording won the Gramophone award for best baroque recording. I am sure Bach would be very happy with recording, whereas Gould...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moaning Bach","review":"I purchased this CD, listened to it twice, then gave it to a friend, who sebsequently gave it to another. Mr Gould may be a fine pianist (I prefer Angela Hewitt), but his grunting and moaning are definitely not for me. It is very distracting, and I could only listen to it for two run-throughs. If there is a recording of Gould's Goldbergs without his moaning, I would like to know about it. Maybe then I could judge more fairly, but this recording just irritates me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Gould brings Bach's Variations to life with his amazing piano playing. There are some that are very upbeat and loud, and others that are mellow and soft, so that there will always be something to fit your mood on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Splendid After Another Version of Gold","review":"While I pretty much concur with every word written so far on this page, I highly recommend the 1995 \\"six star\\" recording by Konstantin Lifschitz (Denon Records - #78961) as a worthy successor. Lifschitz offers a performance every bit as powerful and precise as Gould, with a fuller tone and greater lyricism in selected voices. Even more, Konstantin's layering of voices and flexibility of touch adds shades of Sviatislov Richter to the mix, his spiritual predecessor, being especially reminiscent of Richter's Well Tempered Klavier. Finally, Konstantin takes all of the repeats to great effect, with some inspired creative variation to the variations.Gould's will always represent a gold standard among any recordings of this piece, but Lifschitz adds perhaps a healthy dose of white and pink to the yellow gold that Gould provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sing Along with Glenn","review":"Gould's hum-along with Bach is not acceptable to me. I want to hear one of the most important piano compositions in history unaccompanied, unadulterated by Gould's eccentric voice duet. How anyone can write a review of this CD without warning the potential purchaser of this factor is beyond me and I think a disservice."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLISS","review":"This transcendent recording lets me experience the divine far more than any Book. Sheer bliss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this recording","review":"I was intensely disappointed by the CD edition of this famous and superb performance of the Goldberg Variations. The engineering cut off the phrasing at the end of each musical phrase. This abrupt clipped ending is not what was originally played by Glen Gould, as I have the original vinal with which to compare it. I hated this mutilation of the musical phrasing done by whoever remastered this recording. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???My recommendation, avoid this dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest piano recording in living history","review":"Recorded in 1981, 26 years after the first recording, Glenn Gould returns to the music that launched his international sucsess. His interpretation of the music has changed, although it still remains Gouldian, but it is simply devine. He performs the set of variations as if it is one piece, and rounds off more beautifully and any other performer ever could, let alone did. His attention to detail in this recording, precision elegance, and care for every note is phenomenal. The only way to describe this greatest piano recording in history, is truly magical."},{"rating":"1","title":"The humming ruins it","review":"This may very well be the best interpretation of Bach's Goldberg Variations ever... but it's difficult to give it a fair appraisal because of Glenn Gould's incessant humming, la-la-la'ing and attempts at singing during each piece. And it's not just an occasional extraneous soft noise in the background, either. Sometimes his voice is almost as loud as the piano. It ruins the whole effect for me. How on earth did he manage to convince a record producer to release it like this? It's horrible. Do yourself a favor - skip this version and get Wilhelm Kempff's, Simone Dinnerstein's or Murray Perahia's instead. Each of them is a great interpretation of Bach's Goldberg Variations... and each of them puts a bit different spin on these beautiful works of art. And if you really want to push the envelope, listen to Christiane Jaccottet's harpsichord version. But the best part is that there isn't any humming, la-la-la'ing or singing to get in the way of the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable arrogance","review":"I listened to this disk for the first time on headphones in the middle of the night and couldn't believe my ears. If Bach had wanted a vocal accompanient he would have scored one. I found it impossible to enjoy the undoubtedly skilled piano playing due to the \\"sing along\\" Gould decided to add to this recording. I'd definitely go for his earlier recording of these variations."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Boring CD","review":"I love Classical Music - if played with life - the music was played to perfection - but, without one once of life.Bored me to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdly over rated","review":"the constant ridiculous 'humming' of Gould is not only unbearably annoying but unbearably self indulgent.How anyone can ignore it is beyond me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nails on a Chalkboard","review":"All these glowing reviews absolutely blow my mind. I have been listening to classical music for over 50 years and during that time I have consistently endeavored to improve the fidelity of the devices I use to play my music - receivers, speakers, headphones, etc. This has rewarded me with progressively richer and more rewarding listening experiences, until now! Hearing Glenn Gould's guttural utterances is aesthetically excruciating. It is also a slap in the face; what tremendous audacity to not only maniacally sing-along but also to insist that this insanity be included in the recording.I bought Murray Perahia \\"Bach: Goldberg Variations, BWV 988\\" within hours of buying Glenn Gould's recording, to get the bad taste out of my mouth, and like it a great deal. How does it compare to the Gould recording? I have no idea, I only made it half-way through Gould and don't plan to ever listen to it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop that humming!","review":"I had heard that this was one of the quintessential recordings of the Goldberg Variations, and that in combination with the 1955 recording one could truly appreciate the transformation of Gould and his appreciation, understanding and interpretation of the Goldberg Variations with age. All that is true.I had also heard that Gould hums with the music, but that the humming is not a distraction. He certainly does hum, but to this listener it is a tremendous distraction. He doesn't even hum on key! Either they should have explored tricks in the engineering to eliminate the humming from the recording, or they should have titled it \\"Glenn Gould Hums the Goldberg Variations (with piano accompaniment by Glenn Gould).\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much humming","review":"I realize that negative reviews are almost always branded \\"unhelpful,\\" but here goes. The humming by Mr Gould on this recording makes it unlistenable. Especially when heard on headphones, the groans are maddening. I am not interested in hearing moans; I would like to hear Bach. Whatever Gould's attributes (many, I'm sure, as demonstrated for example on the recent Great Performances series on piano artists), they do not make up for this defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooops...","review":"...I forgot this is the one where the idiot actually hums aloud while he's playing.Ten dollars down the drain.Oh well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting and quintessential gould!","review":"I think this is gould at his best. The goldberg variations are sharp and fast-moving while at the same time there is a cohesiveness that makes you follow along at the same pace...it's amazing and one of the best pieces of music I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connecting with President Reagan","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and it really held my attention throughout. It is a personal portrayal of a man that provides unique insight into how his values truly drove his behavior and how his personality and vision built the foundation for successful communications.

Seller has fast shipping and great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack from a great film","review":"All too many film soundtracks consist of The Big Theme and loads of could-be-pretty-much-anything-filler. This is different. There is a whole range of themese relating to characters and situations, and they are interwoven and displayed after the manner of the motif system, pioneered by Wagner in (appropriately enough) his Ring Cycle. There isn't a bad track on the CD.My only complaint is about some of the other reviews which refer to the \\"Irish\\" nature of the Hobbits theme. Humbug! Tolkien based the Shire on an idealised rural England of his childhood, and the Hobbits are his representation of the English yeomen and farmers he lived among as a boy. To anyone who knows the differences between the various styles of music in the British Isles \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" is quintessentially English, and reminiscent of compusers such as Elgar and Vaughan Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Shire in mid Ohio","review":"I have enjoyed the great banquet of Lord Of The Rings for over 30years and have anticipated the film and music that would do justice to Tolkein's expansive vision. My thanks to you Peter Jackson for this magnificent film and to you Howard Shore for the music that brings it to life. This superb score takes me from the comfort of the Shire into the black of Moria and the terror of Khazad Dum, onward to Lothlorien and down the great river toward Mordor. You have captured the emotional tone of friendship, courage, sacrifice and the powerful endurance of love. This musical score is a feast and a triumph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"It's amazing how Howard Shore can turn from very soft and charming tunes (like Gandalf's arrival to The Shire), to extremely dark and powerful (Moria). His capacity to show us music that is really as magical as the film and the book is shown through the wonderful and diverse themes, even including some music that is supposed to have been written by elves (it's in elvish, too).The Enhanced CD link is good, with many clips in Quicktime and exclusive e-cards.Great Buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This is some of the most moving music I have every had the pleasure of hearing. It blends perfectly in the movie and listening to it by itself is no less that thrilling. The theme captures the resignation with hope that Frodo and all the fellowship experiences. The Hhobbit theme captures the very essence of the hobbit's and establishes their culture in one's mind. All in all it is an excellent buy, and I would recomend it higher than highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great score...","review":"...but where is the lovely strings melody that is repeated heavily in the movie? I only hear it once, 1:54 into track 15, and there it's beefed up with an ascending brass movement behind it. Where's the original, less epic-sounding version of this wonderful melody?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too repetitive","review":"I love classical music. I love Wagner. His way to extract leitmotives that seems deeply inside all Western Culture. Well, here Shore in the movies tries to achive something like that. Simply wonderfull music. But not in this album ... so repetitive, lacking variety ... just 2 or 3 themes (the fellowship and Frodo's themes) repeated once, twice ... until you sell the CD. If you want Lord of the rings music, and I urge you to buy and treasure, \\"my preciouss reader\\", buy the others. No important music is missed, for there all the important themes that appear here also are present, mixed with newer ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not stealing this CD!","review":"All I want to do is listen to the music that I purchased - but I cant, this mess is locked up as a shockwave flash file.

Dont buy this mess, pirate the material instead, God knows that after having purchased the CD I have to go find a hacked version. You Producers are idiots."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip-off !!","review":"I really enjoyed the music in Lord of the Rings and wanted to be able to have a soundtrack of it. Unfortunately, what is sold as a soundtrack isn't. In order to add some completely worthless \\"enhanced content\\" (i.e. a single picture that matches the one on the cover and a link to their web site), they turned the whole CD into a computer disk rather than an audio disk. I want to be able to listen to music in my living room from my stereo, not be stuck with something that can only play from my computer. If your computer happens to be where you want to listen to music anyway, then the music on here is great. Otherwise, like me, you're out of luck. Apparently there isn't going to be any audio release of this music. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not that good","review":"I have listened to this CD several times now and while it is good, it isn't that good.

My music score had titles of each segment of the song we played so naturally I went online to listen to the full songs. All of them are absolutely terrific! The segments we played were \\"Many Meetings\\", \\"The Great River\\", and \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\". There were a few others we had played that weren't mentioned on the soundtrack list such as \\"Gollum\\" and \\"Beginnings\\".

The hobbit's song sounds like an attempt at a theme, but it certainly isn't something memorable. The whole soundtrack sounds like a collage of some of the more famous movie music. The music fits well with the movie, but independently it isn't nearly as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this for the Enya songs","review":"There are only 2 Enya songs on this soundtrack, but that was the reason I bought it. I did find many of the other instrumentals here entertaining (as much as orchestrated instrumentals can be entertaining), such as \\"The Treason of Isengard\\", \\"The Bridge of Khazad Dum\\", and \\"Lothlorien\\"; but to me, the real gems here are the two Enya songs \\"The Council of Elrond\\" and \\"May it Be\\", which are breath-takingly beautiful both in instrumentation and vocals. I listen to these songs often when I'm looking for relaxation and peace, and at times when I'm sad because these songs contain so much hope in the midst of despair, which is a world-wide cherished theme of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" books and movies. I have liked an Enya song here and there, but nothing she has done compares to the beauty of these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Soundtrack!!","review":"THis soundtrack is the best there has ever been in my lifetime...Howard Shore is a great composer he brought Tolkien's world to life with music...my family and i enjoy the film and the music!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songs!","review":"This is a great CD!

Everytime I listen to it, I want to go see the movie again. Tracks 2, 10, 17 and 18 are especially good.I can't think of a soundtrack that has moved me more. If you liked the movie, its a sure bet that you will love the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the Limited Edition!","review":"While the musical score of Fellowship of the Ring is quite beautiful, the \\"Limited Edition\\" packaging is a shining example of how genre films brutally exploit their fans.The music on the Limited Edition CD is identical to the less expensive version of the disk, and all the buyer gets for nearly twice the price is a [faux]-leather slipcase and picture booklet with lyrics to the vocals on the CD. There is nothing substantial in the Limited Edition packaging to warrant the greater expense. Nothing. For it's price and fancy packaging, it looks as though it should contain a second disk, but in doesn't. Don't be fooled.To justify buying this edition, you have to consider a red leatherette package and lyric book worth an additional 10+ dollars. If you love the music (which is outstanding, and worthwhile), buy the less expensive version and have money left over for another CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful music","review":"I bought this for my daughter and she listens to it all the time as she fades away into fantasy land!I tell her to turn it up--I want to hear it to!Awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD...","review":"The music is fantastic.

The majesty and archaic grandeur of Tolkien's masterpiece has been sucked dry by this all too average musical rendering.A far better choice for the music for this film would have been the German rock band Blind Guardian, who are notorious for basing their music upon all of Tolkien's works, not just \\"The Lord Of The Rings.\\" Take for instance some songs: \\"Journey Through The Dark,\\" (same subject as the comparable track on this disc), \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" (would have made a great opening sequence, based around the little poem inscripted on the Ring), and countless other tunes.The director and all the publicity folks for this flick goofed up big-time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been A Much Better Score ...","review":"If they'd hired John Barry or Jerry Goldsmith for the job. In fact, themes from Out of Africa and The Mummy was heard all over.

But it has a special thing, that makes the difference between both albums, as you listen to it, you will discover that there is light between the darkness of all the themes, i.e. the hobbits song, those fantastic songs by Enya and the elven voices that you can hear through all the album and more.You will see the strenght of a few rays of light, a bright hope in the night. The more you hear it, the more you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...","review":"Last December, I stepped into the cinema a Tolkien newbie, knowing only a rough plot summary of the movie. Now what I recall from my first viewing, other than the impressive effects and memorable images is myself saying to my friend, 'Maybe I should get the soundtrack' a while into the film. 2 hours later, towards the end, my friend started continuously telling me 'You really SHOULD get the soundtrack.'I did get the soundtrack and absolutely loved it. Keeping in mind that this is part one of three, I don't mind that certain themes: the ring theme, Minas Tirith theme, were not featured in the disc. We would get our fill in the following 2 CDs, I'm sure.This soundtrack was perfect for the movie, and also stands alone as a piece of art and as beautiful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest CD Ever!!!!","review":"This is a wonderful CD! If you have seen the movie, this is just as good!There is 2 songs by Enya, and they are wonderful! If you are a fan of Enya's get this NOW!!!!You can also put it into your computer, and it will take you to this website that has cooooool stuff. Like loads of Enya's pictures, the cast, and more. So you must be online to do so!So get it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome soundtrack","review":"One of the things i really loved about the Lord of the Rings movie was the wonderful soundtrack. I has many great themes, but my favorite is the one heard in \\"Concerning Hobbits.\\" It is very light and upbeat, but with a melancholy tune. I think this is the best soundtrack written in my entire life.(But I may have to change my mind...I'm only 13) If you cmpare this soundtrack to Star Wars, it is much more interesting musically. Star Wars has only one theme hear in each song, while this one has at least three heard in different parts of the movie. While listening to this you can visualize the scenes that each song comes from. Now that is really a good soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD!!!","review":"CD was in perfect condition...just as advertised! Fantastic transaction! Would definitely buy from seller again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Beautiful","review":"I've been a fan of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit since I was very young and have been waiting for a live action movie to come out since then. The soundtrack to this movie is very good at adding that element that made it, along with the wonderful special effects, something that I will listen to and watch for years to come! I think the theme music for the Black Riders was perfect. The deep bass instruments along with the coral voices of the music is haunting in its own way. The one track on the CD called \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" has to be one of my favorites too. It just describes the Hobbits to a tee. I can't say enough about the music or the movie! Can't wait until the first movie comes out on DVD and for the Two Towers to premiere in December!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music","review":"The Lord of the Rings Sountrack utilizes some of the most beautiful instrumental combinations I have heard. Track Two, the theme of the Shire is one particular such track. The flute/fiddle combination along with the rest of the orchestra always has a calming and relaxing effect on me. Also, throughout the sountrack, Howard Shore uses vocals to emphasise various points. Many vocals are used in the tracks involving the Ringwraeths (sorry about the spelling there) and some Elven singing in other tracks which, while I usually find vocals distracting for sountracks, actually add to the musical effect. This sountrack is deserving of its Academy Award."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite CD","review":"I'm 16, and the CD I listen to the most is this soundtrack. It's so versatile. I could listen to it all the time. I didn't want to see the movie at first, but after seeing it once I couldn't get enough. I bought Tolkien's book and saw it four more times after that, and have listened to the soundtrack more times than I can count. It may sound obsessive but it's true. I never get tired of it. It's so...indescribable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening","review":"I went out right after the movie and bought this soundtrack. While it's not a classic like the Star Wars trilogy, it is still absolutely beautiful. Enya's passage in \\"The Council of Enron\\" moves me to tears EVERY time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be","review":"Howard Shore had an immense undertaking for this project, and his final score is decent. The dark and ominous themes for full orchestra and chorus are effective in the movie, though somewhat contrived an un-original. Speaking of un-orginial, the other famous themes have their origins elsewhere as well. The triumphant Fellowship Theme can be heard during football season as the NFL Sunday Night TV theme. Crack open a hymnal and find \\"This is My Father's World,\\" whose first phrase is lifted directly for the Hobbit's theme.Aside from those disappointing steals, Shore does a good job with the background music to this movie. I would recommend this to fans of the movie, but not fans of original motion picture music. Don't get me wrong, it isn't terrible at all. However, I would not call this Academy-Award winning material by any means. Just a pretty good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE LORD OF THE RINGS C.D.","review":"THE MUSIC WASN'T WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO LISTEN TO IT BEFORE WRITING.

Great to listen to when you want to make something creative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile","review":"I have seen the movie five times, and I never really noticed the music all that much (the visual stills keeps me enthralled). When I got the CD I put it in, and really wasn't 'captured' by it. However on the second listen it started to pull me in, the third listen hooked me for good. By the fourth listen I was re-living the movie in my mind. I really like the fact that the tracks follow the movie score, it doesn't jump around, so you can follow the movie in your mind,Why didn't I give it five stars? To me a rating of 5 stars means everything is perfect!!! I will almost never give out five stars, but this is 4 1/2. The tracks by Anya, nice, but not spectacular. On another note: the last time I saw the movie my wife and I were treated to previews of 'THE TWO TOWERS'. I can hardly wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music, flawed recording","review":"Excellent music, but audiophiles will definitely notice the distortion in a few tracks where the recording equipment was simply driven too hard. It's only in a couple places, and doesn't detract much to an otherwise excellent score.

It's so powerful, enchanting, and haunting. So when I heard Enya was doing the theme song for THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, I knew I had to get the soundtrack. And after seeing the film on the big screen and hearing \\"Maybe It Be\\" during the ending credits, I totally went out and bought the soundtrack! The classical pieces by Howard Shore are also enchanting, and fit in well with the film's dark feel. I don't really have a favorite track on this album, unless you count \\"Maybe It Be\\". I still think ATTACK OF THE CLONES's soundtrack by John Williams tops this year's and last year's list of Best Soundtracks, but THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING has some wonderful music to it, too (as far as classical music goes, Episode II's \\"Love Theme\\" can't be beat!). Still, this soundtrack is a must-have for all die-hard fans of Howard Shore, Enya, or of the brilliant film. Classic!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Howard Shore is an underrated genius. LOTR \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is an amazing masterpiece. Evil dark lords and heroic themes are depicted in \\"The Bridge of Kazad-Dum\\". Quiet peaceful music in track 8 \\"Flight to the Ford\\". This is a one of the best soundtracks out there along with \\"Star Wars\\" and Jurassic Park\\". These Music tracks are the Jewels among some thorns in Soundtracks today"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing...","review":"Howard Shore has always managed to surprise me (from the subtlety of \\"Nobody's Fool\\" to the terrifying \\"Se7en\\") and again he does not disappoint; it is easily his biggest and greatest score to date. Not only does this soundtrack move fast, it's also very moving. Of course there's only 71 minutes of music, but the best pieces were chosen for the soundtrack. That is a VERY good thing.The music on this album speaks for itself, it needs no description. A perfect (and Oscar winning!) score for a wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting musical journey!","review":"The only classical music I ever seem to like is on soundtracks, and \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is no different. The Celtic sounds of pipes in \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" to the ups and downs of \\"The Knife in the Dark\\"--this is possibly the greatest soundtrack I've ever heard. My favorite is \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship.\\" Wait until the end and be treated with a sweet, sad voice and lyrics. Enya's \\"May It Be\\" and other contributions fit nicely with the movie. I am a huge fan of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and I was happy to see that this soundtrack lived up to my expectations and added perfectly to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S SOO GOOODDDD","review":"I get the CD when come out, and I love it, is beatifull and very relaxin, everytime I lissent I remember the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and nice soundtrack...","review":"I really like this soundtack, and I listen to it all the time, especially the hobbity parts.... I especially like the usage of the strings in the beginning of \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship.\\" As I said, I like the Celtic kind of music of the Hobbits, but I think the beginning of \\"The Black Rider\\" is a little too cute.... but oh well. It certainly doesn't outweigh the rest of this beautiful score. The only thing I found truely maddening was the cut out ending of \\"The Bridge of Khazad-Dum\\" which is in the movie but not on the soundtrack (just watch the part where they're all sad after Gandalf falls and listen to the music behind it. It's maginificent, but not on the soundtrack!!! AARRGGHH!!). Well, all in all, this soundtrack is great. It has many different moods and transitions in it and creates an overwhelming feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, to say no more","review":"Another person reviewing this album commented, appropriately, that some soundtracks stand on their own better than others, and felt this soundtrack lacks something without the movie. I agree--but only because this soundtrack is sooooo evocative of the movie, it stirs me to want to be watching again what is musically portrayed. The soundtrack and movie are worthy of each other--I can speak no higher praise. Perhaps it IS only a soundtrack, without the movie; nonetheless it contains some hauntingly beautiful moments that make me want to replay it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I can't wait to see the scenes that go with this music.

My props to Howard Shore"},{"rating":"2","title":"Introspective and Lyrical - per as usual","review":"Suzanne Vega's first song that caught my attention, and charmed me, was \\"Calypso.\\" And what particularly hooked me was how she managed to take the story of the Sea Nymph Calypso (a slightly-alarming one-dimensional fantasy dreamed up by Greek males) into a song about a strong, proud, self-aware woman who controls her own destiny.That same gently self-aware and self-confident femininity comes across on this album. The most interesting song in this vein is \\"New York is a Woman.\\" It's a love song to a city Suzanne Vega is describing as both supremely confident and supremely feminine. At least that's how I hear the song.I also like the delicately-crafted beauty of the music itself. Some of the songs are particularly lyrical. At work, I found myself humming phrases from \\"Ludlow Street\\" and \\"Edith Wharton's Lovely Figurines.\\"So long as you enjoy the singer-songwriter genre, and enjoy Suzanne Vega's distinctive voice, you should really enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"\\"Beauty & Crime\\" is a real work of art, proving that Suzanne Vega still has the rhythm and style she made her signature in the mid-80's. \\"New York is a Woman,\\" essentially the title song, is a gem of feeling that sets the tone for the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A small step back","review":"Listening to this new album has made me appreciate Mitchell Froom and Rupert Hine even more. I've always known that both are exceptional producers, but comparing this latest release to Ms. Vega's previous three or four albums, you can really tell the difference. I'm a bit of a music purist, though, and production can be very important to me, so this may not affect many other fans. Suzanne's song-writing and singing appear to be right on mark. However, for me, I find the music slightly less enjoyable as my production expectations have been set higher. The production on Beauty & Crime seems slightly old-fashioned (intentional in some cases, I know) and a bit contrived - I would actually probably place the quality somewhere between Solitude Standing and Days of Open Hand. Keep it coming, though, Suzanne - we love you."},{"rating":"1","title":"latest Suzanne Vega C.D.2007","review":"I love Suzanne Vega, shes one of the best neo folkies to me.I have all of her music,in fact her 1st one on l.p.record!

I didn't buy the CD yet, just heard all of it online, but now I'm going to buy it as soon as I can.Her voice, sweet and yet not fully clean. Her sound, something different, something we can only hear when she sings her songs. The lyrics of course...I also hope I'll get to see her show in SF soon, was once in her performance and she was great...As usuall a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we needed","review":"The long wait is finally over, and it's just as it should be. Her albums are always similar enough to be familiar, but different enough that each has its own personality and offers something unique. This installment is no different and has a secure home in her pantheon of classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this and get DePalma's original","review":"Objectively, viewed in a vacuum, this movie probably deserves two stars, not just one. But it doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's a remake of Brian DePalma's first Hitchcockian thriller, and I cannot forgive the new version for being such a bland and pallid imitation of an original that was so full of energy, humor, and terrific cinematic invention. How could something so full of zest have been so tepidly remade? The new version is practically a scene-for-scene copy, but the makers apparently failed to understand ANYTHING that made the original work. For A) creepy shocks, thrills, laughs, and suspense; B) racial, sexual, and political overtones completely lacking in the remake; C) Bernard Herrmann's superb music; and D) the BEST use of split-screen you have ever seen in your life (excepting maybe only DePalma's own CARRIE, which also suffered an inexcusably lifeless remake in this century), go with the original:Sisters: The Criterion Collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed with information","review":"I have this book and I found it very informative.

I am moving to Philly and was hoping to find some useful information on dog friendly parks, services, neighborhoods, etc... This was just a collection of places and restaurants in the Philadelphia area, but not with an emphasis on dogs. Restaurants were listed, but it wasn't clear how they related to doing things with your dog, i.e. whether you can sit outside w/your dog, or if there is an convenient place to tie them up. Additionally, it was just a list without any ratings on the quality of the activities. For me, it was not worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic mumbo jumbo","review":"I was excited to receive this book - I love learning about how other users master the techniques of Photoshop.

Plus, you really haven't lived until you see a 1970s midget woman's wrestling match.Having said that, this is not going to appeal to everybody. The matches themselves are all old school, and will probably not be enjoyed by modern day WWE/TNA fans (low production values, the women are not walking barbie dolls, and little high flying action).

We even eat them with a cup of yogurt or kefir as a light evening meal. You'll find your own favorite situations for this tasty treat. The only thing I would change is the packaging. Each thin box holds only 8 cookies, although each cookie is about 1 1/2 x 3 inches, so one cookie is plenty to eat in most cases. Also on the positive side, the small packaging ensures that the crispiness lasts after the box is opened. I should add, the cookies are in two plastic nests of four cookies inside a foil package inside the cardboard box, so a good clamp keeps the opened cookies crisp and whole.

Partisans from Tennessee and North Carolina spent a great deal of time going across state lines to attack one another in an effort to bring about their ends. These ends did not always include winning the war, but gaining food and oppressing one's enemies. Where the book suffers is in its effort to shed some light upon the politics of the region that worked to shape the manner in which the combatants approached their hate of one another. It does not shed a great deal of information upon the leaders of these groups either, which means we are left to wonder whether these partisans within this region were a mob which was lead, or were recruited by very smart, and maybe, opportunistic leaders.

This CD is therefore not a collection of rare cuts of Walter Rhodes, but just a mediocre piece of modern work on a field of blues revival / delta blues / acoustic blues. The recordings date back to 1988-89, not to 1927.If you dig downhouse blues revival artists like Taj Mahal, Alexis Korner, John Hammond, Corey Harris, etc, you might find this CD enjoyable.

Tested the backup pump by unplugging main pump and filling sump pit with garden hose. Everything worked fine and gave me a peace of mind that I no longer need to worry about power outages when I'm gone. I went down today to check battery level and that checked okay. It was raining this morning so I had a chance to see main (Zoeller 57) pump cycle on. That's when I notice water shooting out the bottom of the backup pump. It told me the cheap, garbage, mini check that Zoeller uses on their backup pump failed. I should have followed advice and my instincts to remove their check and use a better check in the system.Zoeller should be ashamed that they compromise what would be a good product had they spent a couple bucks more on a better check.I now have to remove the whole system and rebuild it.

It is a wet marine battery that the water evaporates from. You have to add water to this battery once a month. Who has time for this kind of maintenance, especially if you install it in a seasonal home? I took it to Sears and they said it was completely discharged. I replaced the battery with a sealed DieHard.Equipped with a new, fully charged battery, I proceeded to test the backup pump. It hums but doesn't discharge any water at all.

Emily is beaten by a mean schoolmaster, leading to her father's dismissal from his job and their move to a new location. Her father has an accident and dies, leaving Emily at the mercy of her \\"mean\\" relatives. Her mother and father both \\"magically\\" visit with her now.

What an absolute treat Emily of New Moon is. Each episode is thought provoking and the acting by all involved is fantastic. As you get involved with the story you come to understand the characters and what makes them tick. Emily is so very tuned into what is going on around her and it is a joy to see her follow through with her aspirations to become a writer. And she surely has the gift.

This was a huge disappointment. From my daughter's point of view it alternated between scary (ghosts of dead parents visiting) and boring. She hasn't even seen it all because she doesn't want to, while she has seen the Hallmark LHOP movie and the entire AOGG series dozens of times. From my point of view, the acting was really weak so it was very hard for me to watch with her (which I had to do because she was so frightened by the ghost scenes). DO NOT BUY THIS because your child loves quality books and films about the old days. You will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"The Emily of New Moon series is wonderful. While Road To Avonlea will always be my favorite series of all time, Emily of New Moon is right up there at the top too.

Wish there were more they 4 seasons to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, not what I expected from L. M. Montgomery","review":"I was surprised to discover how dismal this series is, especially as it seems written for children. As other reviewers have mentioned, Emily sees her dead mother all the time. In the first episode, she endures an unfair beating from her school master for supporting an Indian child, whom the teacher says is worthless and verminous. To top this off, the beginning of the series is confusing (why are Emily and her parents clinging to a sea cliff and crying? Then, all of a sudden, they are in a cemetery and Emily's mother is dead). The acting is very poor. I am frankly puzzled by the 5 star reviews.I am not a parent--if I was, I would not expose my children to this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMILY is just too weird","review":"Was looking forward to this because we liked ANNE OF GREEN GABELS, ROAD TO AVONLEA and other Montgomery-TV-productions.

Not only was this Barron's book out of date (the tests aren't structured like the CATs are!), but it's explanations often lacked depth. In addition, either Kaplan or PR books give you far more helpful tips. In the Quant section of this Barron's, they don't even touch on Probability and Statistics, two areas now far more common since the tests have been getting harder (in response to the huge increase of people taking the GMATs).

The most crucial is that the verbal questions are simply not truly representative of actual GMAT questions.

While Princeton Review's book accurately simulates the computer version of the test through its website, Barrons has a horrible CD that does not tally your score or administer the test correctly. For example, reading comprehension questions were jumbled throughout. Also, some of the math questions simply were incomprehensible. While I scored an 88% on the Princeton Review CAT, I got a 68% on the Barrons' version. (I can't verify if one is more accurate than the other alone, but from the general skepticism of others I thought it was clear that Barrons left many with a similar experience.)Spend the money for the Princeton Review book that gives you access to 4 online CAT's - that's the best way to actually know how you will do I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly edited, many mistakes","review":"This book has a number of mistakes.

The quantitative review pays no heed to the fact that you are sitting for a timed test and therefore must work efficiently, using shortcuts when possible. This book tells you the long way to get to the answer. For that, it is a decent way to go if you want to really re-learn the math that underlies the problems (for example, I found the Princeton Review book to have too many \\"tricks\\" and not enough real math review). I did learn a few things from it, but eventually abandoned it for Kapan and GMAC guides. Not a complete waste of time, but certainly not where I'd recommend beginning or ending your GMAT study adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book","review":"This is the biggest waste of money I ever committed. The math review is not comprehensive enough. I'm looking at other review books and there are many concepts not covered in Barron's. The section where it reviews grammar does not explain the rules in detail and assumes one has a knowledge of basic grammar. I think if we didn't need brush-ups on the basics then we wouldn't be looking to buy these review books. I would definitely advise against buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of mistakes - don't buy this book","review":"I wasted two weeks with this book before I realized that it was full of errors. Every answer key has at least a few mistakes in it, and sometimes the answer explanations would say C) but then go on to describe why B) was the correct answer.This book also does not mention the fact that it is a computer based test and that getting correct answers results in harder questions coming up - and that getting the early questions correct is the only way to get a higher score.This book ALSO gives 5 practice tests that are organized into 7 sections - THIS IS NOT THE FORMAT OF THE GMAT EXAM. And I checked with a friend who confirmed that when he took the GMAT in 1999 it was in the same format it is now.I'm not upset that I wasted $20 on this book, but I'm very upset that I wasted my time.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNIT. It has a loud buzzing / hissing noise in all recordings - especially on AM. The manual even says to turn the display off to reduce noise during recording. It helps but it is still there and still quite loud. Additionally, the built in speaker is so small that it sounds horrible. It shouldn't even be there it is so bad. If Pogo releases an updated version without the noise, a better speaker and preferably AA batteries, I will be first in line to purchase. I regreatably had to return this unit and am now using another MP-3 player / recorder and seperate radio with timer.Update: Recently purchased another one of these. Have a need to do multiple recordings which I could not do as described abouve. Either I got 2 bad ones before or the manufacturer has made changes. This one hardly has any buzz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave the light on","review":"Everything I read about this device was accurate, and I am almost 100% pleased with it. I have only 2 comments:1-for some reason, it once locked up into some kind of endless loop and nothing worked, nor could I turn it off. I called the help number and got an almost immediate (24 hrs) response. The tech told me to remove the memory card I had inserted and when I did, the device was able to be turned off. Never had a problem otherwise.2-The display backlight doesn't stay on long enough and the display text (to my older eyes) -could- be bigger, but hit any button and light comes back on, although not for very long (5 sec).I'm very pleased with this, but would suggest getting the larger memory version so a mem card would not be as needed.Oh! Voice recording with built-in mic was -very- good, very sensitive and clear. Bye-bye to my Sony digital voice recorder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor AM Reception","review":"I was so excited to get this product, but I am so disappointed: AM reception is awful. I've tried it at home, work, driving, and at a variety of locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, and the reception is worse than any other AM radio that I've ever heard. It even has trouble picking up the 100,000 watt powerhouse AM station in my area. It's very directional, but static is high on every station even at optimum positioning. I've tried coworkers' inexpensive AM radios at my workstation, and they receive all signals very well. Based on the other positive reviews, I'm guessing that I have a defective unit. Without good reception, the recording features are worthless; therefore, I can only give this unit one star. If I get a replacement, and if it works properly, I'll amend my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'ts not a big deal","review":"unfortunately at the little time of buying it began to present operation problems, the buttons didn't work when I push it, sometimes press a function and it makes other, I like that it is good recorder but the scroll to select the functions it is bad.The sound is not very clear, but for non demanding people is ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing crucial Tivo features","review":"Unfortunately, this unit does not serve the purpose for which I purchased it. Unlike a Tivo, you can not play a recording back until the entire recording is finished. In fact, you can't do anything while recording a radio program except listen to what is being recorded. You can't pause live radio. In fact, I can't find any way to stop a recording once it is started.Reviewing the other reviews, I ran across another missing feature which I haven't yet experienced myself: it does not \\"expire\\" older recordings to make way for new ones. Instead, it simply refuses to record the new program.The reception seems OK for stronger stations, but it would be nice if there was a model with some kind of super-quality tuner, if such a thing is possible in such a small package."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea, a bad product.","review":"Is a buggy product. It freezes with no reason and if you try to reset it (that was the sugested solution) then the radio stops working completely.It is a shame, because the idea of recording radio shows 'vcr style' is really original.I tried 2 of them, then I gave up. Fortunatelly I found the alternative for programmed radio recordings (Sangean radio)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swing and a miss...","review":"This is a fantastic idea that has been poorly executed. I love to listen to AM talk radio, but I can't always or often tune in at work. So I thought this would be a great way to get my fix... The reception is not what I would like (both AM and FM), and the unit hangs up at odd times. Here's the real clincher, though: I had a problem with really awfully \\"staticky\\" recording when I was using a 1GB Sandisk SD card to record my favorite radio program. I called Pogo Products to try to get a solution to this problem. The guy at Pogo told me that the problem was my SD card. he told me to return the card to the store and try another one. I told him that I'd keep the card and return the Pogo unit. I should like to say that if Pogo stays in business, I'll definitely *consider* buying the next version of the RadioYourWay- I love the idea, as it meets a very specific need for me. But this one's heading back to Korea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oregon S62 18-Inch Semi Chisel Chain Saw Chain Fits Craftsman...","review":"I have yet to have any problems with Oregon Saw Chains, Keep them out of the dirt and they last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Results","review":"I got this replacement chain for my Poulon Pro 4.0 HP electric chain saw.

More, a lot of it appears to have been transferred from videotape. Considering that the Hammer movies themselves are so lush, it seems a pity that the definitive Hammer documentary should be so cheap-jack. And I would have liked to hear about Amicus and the other Hammer offshoots, but I can see how that would be a problem to arrange. As with many British documentaries, it seems awfully formal at times. I don't want to make it sound all that bad, though. There are interesting interviews (many that I'd never seen before), behind-the-scenes home-movies, production footage and other surprises. In all, it's well worth the price if you are a fan of Hammer, or Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, who happen to be the hosts of the documentary!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Hammer","review":"I did not know this documentary was available untill I had rented the dvd.

Not even close!","review":"The book itself is very slow paced, too wordy about unimportant matters and really has little to do with the aftermath of the Rapture. The story is passable, and the author obviously quite knowledgeable in the areas of political jargon, corruption, and comportment, but if you're looking for something comparable to The Left Behind Series, give this one a wide miss. True, it started with the Rapture, but it's all downhill from there, just another droning tale of murder, mayhem, backstabbing, and the political maneuvering and menace that is our government today...as I said, politics as usual. I also find it rather irritating that Ms. Hart and/or Tynsdale Publishing have been allowed to trade on the success of the Left Behind name to sell these books that in no way compare to Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye's wildly popular series."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICELY PACED POLITICAL INTRIGUE W/STRONG CHRISTIAN MESSAGE","review":"I like this series, because I am intrigued by politics. Ms. Hart's description of D.C. intrigue, protocol and culture sound informed and ring true. The action, characterization and dialogue are quite good. The key to Left Behind's political series is that it is intended for a Christian audience--or at least to readers who are sympathetic to evangelical spirituality. There is a lot of dialogue in these pages, and much of it will garner \\"amens\\" from the already converted.Bottom-line: This is intelligent, realistic end-times fiction, with lots of political intrigue, and a direct Christian message. For those with minds open to spiritual discussion, Necessary Evil is an easy recommendation. For those who do not like to be preached at, or who tend to berate anything remotely \\"religious right,\\" save yourself the antacid and avoid this whole series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for maintenance","review":"Perfect if child has a solid grammar background.

Lastly, slavery is as Koranic as daily prayers. The movement to ban slavery world wide began with Wilberforce, an English Christian. This movement was resisted by the Muslim east which permitted legal slavery through 1968 in Saudi Arabia and 1964 in Bahrain.

Although a film like this is good for the Dolemite crowd, the DVD's poor authoring make this a problem. For starters, the DVD has a very diffuse, poorly recorded soundtrack. Instead of keeping the film in mono and the center channel, it sounds like the authors thought it would be clever to spread the sound over all five speakers. The net result is an odd diffuse sound that is only corrected when you turn Dolby encoding off. The video quality is watchable - but scratched and with muted colors.

It is interesting that the DVD played the accusation by LaToya Jackson of child molestation but did not show her later retraction when she claimed that she was forced by her abusive husband to make those accusations. It goes to show, as the previous reviewer noted, how magnanimous Michael's heart really was in completely forgiving his sister and embracing her. The film does show, interestingly, that the jury which totally exonerated Michael of all charges was composed of almost all white members (there was an Hispanic jury member, and no Afro-Americans), belonging to an older, conservative community. It was Garth Brooks who said that no one gave more to charity and humanitarian causes than Michael Jackson.

Thanks for the heads-up, I will NOT be buying this DVD because it will only make me mad-der! MJ has given his life. What more do these people want from him. Like both of you, I am sick and tired of the negativity. These naysayers can't find anything on MJ so they just make stuff up as they go, for money, ratings or whatever. Enough already! I'm a huge fan since childhood. I grew up with this family and no matter what anyone says they are for me Black royalty and nobody can take that away. I also agree with the other fan who says she has been tricked into buying substandard merchandise selling under MJ's name. I had to learn (the hard way) that if it is not estate approved, DON't BUY IT! I've gotten stuck with a few things myself that were a total waste of good money with people capitalizing on MJ's passing. MJ has left a great legacy with good music and great footage. No one can EVER change that!Renee R-San Francisco"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Uselesness of Schema","review":"I'm not too fond of this book, though there are a few phrases I like here and there (phrases, alas, are not poems). I, for one, am very aware of the artificiality of \\"production\\" when I read these \\"poems\\" and take it as a given that there are indeed no critical schema that can account for the non-poetic posturings of poseurs.

There's some good--not great--writing here and the references and bag o'tricks on display leave no doubt that Mr Henry was always at the head of his class (which is their intention, no doubt). You don't get too far into the book without realizing that the desperate alterations of voice and register are not \\"signs of a restless and probing poetic intelligence\\" (the typical explanation offered for such pointless post-modern kerfuffelry) so much as an attempt to hide these poem's essential hollowness.

The songs are upbeat, toe-tapping, funny and we found ourselves humming the music weeks after we saw the play. It was brainless but great fun! And the satirical lyrics were gems. So I was excited to stumble across this now-aged album and it did not let me down - the music brought back old memories and I find myself listening to the songs over and over again on my iPod.

It has been fun having it in the back yard. It certainly attracts crowds of birds. BIG crowds of birds. They actually queue up to get to the feeder.The only problem I see is that under normal load (say 3 to 4 smallish birds), the combination of it tipping and them feeding causes an amazing amount of food to fall to the ground, both through openings in the bottom of the feeder and from it tipping back and forth.If this thing is in active use, I have seen it empty out in two hours. While this can be fun to behold, be aware that you'll be filling it often, and that soon enough there will be more action on the ground under the feeder than on the feeder itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"International Awesomeness","review":"This is truly awesome, Green Day made a DVD!

The scenarios in the book about how to play certain hands on various kinds of flops is excellent and very aggressive.

The only thing McEvoy and Daugherty have you playing are premium cards which will eventually lead to being anted to death. Suited connectors are very valuable for their deceptive quality which can bring down large pots.

I was at Vinh Long with the 175th Outlaws and very proud of my unit. Mike's unit was the 82nd Med. Evac. and very famous in its own right. They were stationed at Soc Trang during my tour and then moved to Binh Thuy during Mr. Novosel's second visit to RVN. This is a very distinguished man, whose career is one of the richest experiences in Army Aviation. Anyone who knows the story of this Medal of Honor winner is glad to have made the acquaintance.

Griffen. I will not make this mistake again. There is no denying the author is a great American, hero and inspiration...but he is absolutely not a writer. This book totally lacks any description and at best it could be considered a very dry and boring narrative. The author is so sensitive to the feelings of bit players in his experiences that he never has an unkind word for any of them...at the very most he apologizes for them and I find it hard to believe his military career can be chronicled without personality inefficiencies. By far the most poorly written book I have chosen to read, which is unfortunate because a ghostwriter would have been able to tell a wonderful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this for my daughter on her fourth birthday and the only thing she liked about was throwing the balls around.

I couldn't tell by the photo that the red screw-on plastic top just has a hole in the center for the WIRE they include for you to hang it with. So you have to tie a knot in the end of the wire and thread it through the hole, and then twist the other end of the wire around whatever you're hanging the feeder from. The feeder gets heavy when filled with nectar! If you don't screw the plastic top down really well on the glass feeder, then it pulls out and crashes to the ground. I wish the hanging mechanism was sturdier. Then I also didn't realize the bottom plastic base is one piece and you can't take it apart to clean.

You can't get a bottle brush in to clean glass interior. You also can't get to the interior nooks and crannies of the plastic feed tray. The other little problem is that as the hummers feed it creates air bubbles down in the plastic portion and the birds struggle to get more nectar. When it gets to that level I go out and shake it a bit and huge bubbles come up. My feeder is in a protected area and suspect that if it were subject to wind that it would take care of itself.

It supplies almost 4 cups of sugar water, and I like using glass feeders so I know chemicals are not leaching into the water on hot days. There is a nice sturdy ring around the feeder for birds to rest on while they eat, and Woodpeckers have taken advantage of this. Of course they flip the removeable yellow flowers off immediately and then they use their tongues to get sugar water just like the Hummingbirds do. Now when I refill the feeders I just leave the yellow flowers off and all are happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic humming bird feeder","review":"I love this and it is the right size so you don't have to refill it daily."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],B={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-4494e093"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/39.md","filePath":"library/39.md"}'),j={name:"library/39.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{G as __pageData,P as default};
