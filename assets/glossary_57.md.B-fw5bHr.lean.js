Kathy Smith's 'Aerobox Workout' is one of my favorite all time videos. Alas, I was wrong.This has got to be one of the most repetitive, boring step workouts I've ever done. The only person I'd recommend this workout for is an absolute beginner. I hate videos where I end up watching the clock the whole time - this is one of them. The music is uninspiring and the moves are totally plain Jane. Spend your money on something else unless you're just starting out in step!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I did not love this workout. I have done step before and even the advanced portion was boring and simple. I enjoy a workout where I can break a sweat and I end up skipping this one on my DVD shelf more often than not.If you are just starting out with step it's probably a good option; if you have done step before you will probably find this too easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific total body workout.","review":"By far my favorite of the Kathy Smith series, this workout includes a thorough warm up, 3 separate stepping segments for beginner, intermediate and advanced level stepper, leg toning exercises, upper body toning and abdominal work before a relaxing stretch. Just the stepping segments (all 3 combined with warm up and brief cool down before the leg toning) is about 45-50 minutes. The whole workout start to finish is over an hour. The 3 stepping segments get progressively more difficult with more complicated choreography. Her instructions are clear and timely and all exercises are safe, with power moves as an option for the truly fit. The music is just right, the class working out with her the usual crew. All in all, this is my favorite step tape and my favorite Kathy Smith tape. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith's Step Workout","review":"I have had this one for years and it is great! If you are new to step this is the video for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Targeted toward beginners","review":"This would be a great video for a beginner stepper; otherwise, it's pretty boring. It's very repetitive - I found myself counting down the minutes until the end of each section. Ultimately, it did get my heart rate up and I got a pretty good workout. I just didn't enjoy the process at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"boring! good for those new to step but if you are experienced your mind will drift because it is just dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so advanced","review":"I thought this product was an advanced step arobics workout.... it's not at all!!!This DVD is more for beggining steppers, if you are advanced this video will barely get your heart rate up. And its very repetative so it can get very boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith DVD ***EASY to follow","review":"I have actually had the VHS version of this for years. To have it on DVD is wonderful! Since I usually do the same part of the video, now there is no need to wait for it to rewind or fast forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Step Workout!","review":"With no prior step experience, I started to use this step workout a few month ago. With three kids on my hand, I don't have always time to do it, but step by step I got from Beginner Level to Intermediate. It took me a while to learn all the moves, but I can do them now without looking on the screen. I get a nice sweat and really feel that I have done something good for my body. Kathy Smith is a very good instructor, and you can follow the moves quite easily after some practice. I recommand this DVD to everyone, who wants to start a good step workout. It's really great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"I just got this tape a few weeks ago, but it's already taken over as number 1 in my collection. The leg work is repetitious, but the arm movements keep the workout interesting.Do wish Kathy would give up that \\"aha\\" sound, but other than that, she is a great motivator. The queing is excellent, easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith Step Video","review":"This is a perfect workout for any beginner, the intensity is great. Some of the moves are identical to Kathy's Powerstep workout.So when you graduate from this video, Powerstep will be a cinch. I really like this video and I recommend to any Kathy Smith fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had this DVD for 3 years and it's still challenging!","review":"Yes it's a old and you might giggle at the leotards at first but this is definatley one of my favourite DVDS. There isn't alot of jumping or high intensity movements(non explosive), which means the routines are longer and i think it focases more on getting your stamina and fitness up. When i bought this DVD i used 2 step levels(adjustable step heights), then after having a baby and dropped it down to one level and built up back to using 2 steps. There is a big difference doing this routine on different Step platform levels so it's good for all fitness levels. Yes it can get a bit boring but it's worth it, definatley helped me alot. I use it once a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Workouts","review":"Kathy is a great teacher and this DVD is one of a couple that I have been using to get back into shape. The moves are easy enough for me to do and broken down into times that are managable. If you are looking for a cardio workout that is easy enough if you are getting back into shape, this DVD is a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used in high school and then 10 years and 3 babies later!","review":"I used this video along with a bike workout to maintain fitness while in high school. I used it in college, and then after baby number 1, 2, and 3. The routine is easy to pick up and memorize. These days I just shoot down the volume and work out to my favorite aerobic playlist while trying to ignore the 90's dress code. I've lost weight using this video. It has also been effecive to use on off days while training for 5 and 10k's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith Step Workout","review":"I like the routine, but as others have mentioned the stepping and the counting is off for some routines. The workout provides a good intensity level for me. I haven't done a step workout for years and this is exactly what I was looking for. I also enjoy the body conditioning for a complete workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing low impact workout","review":"I had been looking for a low-impact workout that really gets my heart rate up. I found it! Even with heel problems I am able to do this video. You can easily adjust it to your fitness level because it is divided into three sections. Kathy smith not only has excellent queing, but she is very good at teaching the moves. It is very easy to follow, fun, and a great workout for weight loss or just general cardivascular heath. I highly reccomend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intermediate step workout","review":"I am not well co-ordinated and prefer simple routines to follow. I was worried that this might be too easy because I own other Kathy Smith DVD's and find them boring and easy. I hadn't done step in about ten years until about a month ago. I do all three segments and get a really good cardio workout. I didn't like the ab or upper body segments at all. If you prefer more complicated moves or are an advanced stepper, this is not for you. I haven't found any exercise videos/DVDs that have good music and as far as instructors go, Kathy Smith is easy to follow and probably one of the least annoying. It's a good intermediate step workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step work-out and I mean work-out","review":"I read the other reviews before I purchased this DVD..and understand the concern over intensity.I am not really coordinated and it has taken me sometime to get the routines down. That said.. after doing a section in slow motion for a few days..the moves finally come ...It also took a few days to get \\"up to speed\\" with thework-out....but it really gets me going !!I am 60 and if I can do it... most people can also."},{"rating":"1","title":"About the workout","review":"Nothing wrong with the seller...but the workout is not what I expected. Not enough variety. Some of the steps are too repetitive. I have seen and done step workouts that had enough variety to be fun enough to do over and over....too bad the ones I am thinking about are not on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout, cuing could be better","review":"I am new to step aerobics and wanted to try an old standby, so I bought this one. And, come on, for $5, this is not a bad deal. As others have described, the DVD is broken into sections. As an intermediate-level exerciser, I could get through the whole thing. The only big complaint, is the \\"fancy footwork\\" without adequate cuing. No doubt, by the tenth time, I'll have gotten it, but a bit disappointing. You will sweat and a true beginner may be challenged to do more than the first segment. So what? Keep up until you can do more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Steppers I've Done!","review":"This was the first Kathy Smith tape I had ever purchased, and I have to say...this is one of my favorites. Kathy isn't annoying or cheesy like many instructors. It is a GREAT workout, and I don't seem to get bored with it. I feel it's easy to follow and doesn't have any crazy jumps or hard moves. I recommend it to the beginner all the way to the advanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best step video for beginners-intermediate","review":"If you are just starting out stepping, I would highly recommend this as starting point.This is one of Kathy Smith's best efforts. The workout is well designed with a warm-up, 3 progressive levels of intensity, cool down and quick toning sections. Depending on your level of fitness you can do one or all three stepping sections.The choreography is very easy to learn and Kathy does an excellent job breaking down the steps and cuing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way this is for beginners","review":"I have been working out for over 6 months and decided to change it up by adding a step. I ordered this DVD because I liked other Kathy Smith videos that I own. I couldn't even keep up with the Beginner segment! She goes much too fast, and changes the moves way too often, without enough advanced instruction. She either changed or added a move every few seconds, before you could figure out what she was doing. I don't believe that a real beginner to working out, which I'm not, could keep up with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but a Goodie","review":"I used to do this work out in the 90's while it was on VHS. I was happy to find it on DVD.The workout itself can be \\"basic\\" but I enjoy it because I feel its more challenging than other step video's I've done. After doing the work out, I noticed I was sore in some muscles. To make it more challenging, I added weight gloves, which helps I think.Yeah, it does look dated, but its a favorite of mine. Another thing I like about it, the performers seem to enjoy being there and everyone is on cue. Some of them even lead the cuing, which makes it a nice change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated but Effective","review":"This step workout has been an enjoyable and effective step aerobic workout. The video is dated, probably from the 90's, but that can add some amusement to the workout at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Wheel in the Sand","review":"I'm an avid step-aerobic exerciser and consider myself knowledgable and informed when it comes to this subject. I was excited to view this video after having read the comments about it on Amazon.com. Much to my dissappointment, it was not all that I had hoped it would be. I suspect that I may be a little particular when it comes to working out. This video is well over 50 minutes long, broken into segments designed to cater to individual workout levels, and never seemed to get started. The music is terrible and reminds me of some new age chanting...hardly motivation to get pumped up. The only redeeming quality is that the sculpting portion at the end of the video is pretty effective. I do not recommend this video to spunky people who are serious about their workout \\"working them out\\"!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still powerful","review":"This group has first become popular (in Poland) as pioneer of prgressive art rock. However, its leader (Romuald Lipko) has then discovered his extreme talents in making pop hits (composing also for other performers).

My advice would be to skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing compared with his first book.","review":"John Gilstrap's first effort, \\"Nathan's Run\\" was a great read.

He has become my favorite author leaving me with a desire to keep reading all his books and to look forward to future writings. I can always count on an excellent read when he is the author. At All Costs has kept me not only guessing but so interested in finding out what happens next that I could barely put it down. If you haven't read any of his books and you like mysteries I completely recommend your reading this and all of his books. It is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"I read this book after reading the numerous good reviews this book received. But, I believe some of the negative reviews more accurately represent the numerous problems this book has. The author does an excellent job making this book a quick, mindless read, but the author sacrifices realism to keep the plot moving at a frenetic pace. There are several points in the book where I just scratched my head and thought that there is no way the character would act that way. In fact, the reason the good guys are on the run is far-fetched and laughable and could have easily been prevented by the good guys talking to the police right after the incident happened instead of finding excuse after implausible excuse to do the wrong thing. I am now in the middle of a far superior novel called \\"The Trial\\" by Clifford Irving, which is a true example of fine, fast paced writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a surprising end","review":"The novel At All Costs by J. Gilstrap deals with the pretty topical subjects of international warfare/ arms trafficking and the corruption of FBI. Gilstrap combines those subjects in a very interesting way. The novel is a thrilling page-turner with growing suspense and a real surprising end.The way the characters are presented is logical, detailed and very realistic, thus makes them rather interesting and gives the reader the possibility to identify with the main characters.In our opinion the beginning is a little long - winding, but it turns out to be a stylistic device aimed at building up suspense. This \\"normal life\\" beginning makes it unputdownable.Unfortunately the novel gets very violent and even a little artificial in the end, so Gilstrap is kind of breaking the mood.But all in all we would say that At All Costs is a book worth reading especially because of the surprise of finding out who the guy is who pulls the strings in the background and why."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious, predictable, two-dimensional","review":"This book was a big disappointment, especially given the reviews it has had on-line here.

However, overall I enjoyed the book and read it beginning to end, although the last half definitely went much quicker than the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining and compelling book","review":"Having read 'Even Steven' I hoped I was in for a good read. However although an avid reader of fiction I was driven by this book, at times I felt my eyes could not move fast enough.

This is definitely not the case with this release by CeCe. I must confess the name of the CD caught me. Having all of CeCe's other albums I though this would be one that would transport me into that special place. Instead it not only left me firmly on the ground but searching for some understanding as to what happened. Personally, I think CeCe should let her brothers write for her. Or maybe some more traditional Gospel artist and stop experimenting with these strange writers/producers whose style does not match her being. You cannot feel CeCe in this album. It feels like she is ministering to a Japanese group and struggling to communicate all the while being worn out in the effort.

This cd is awesome. It's a wonderful praise and worship cd. I think we often times forget that there should be a profound difference between Christian and Secular music.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the time to read this book!","review":"Who cannot relate to being \\"overstretched, overbooked, and about to snap?\\" As with his other books, Dr. Hallowell presents not only the problem (overcommitted, speeded-up lifestyles), but some practical solutions as well.

This movie is modeled after the dirty dozen, only without the budget, the talent, the script or anything else. The characters are generic stero-types of ones you've seen a hundred times before and better in other films. None of the actors seem the least bit emotionally invested in their roles and the script could have been knocked out over a weekend without benefit of a rewrite. Sorry, gotta call it like I see it.

They also meet a lot of other people. (One such is a real dipstick. DOWN WITH ZELOS!!) The graphics were great and had rare anime cutscenes. The voices were kinda high pitched. And when you may think your nearing the end... THINK AGAIN! There are also a lot of sub-quests. Also, the 1-4 player gameplay in battle is really fun. You can even make the game fight for you. The bosses are kind of fun also. This game is overall, REALLY, SUPER, EXTREMELY, GOOD!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game will be awesome.","review":"This game does NOT require a Gameboy Advance to play with relatives/friends so this is the ideal buy for anyone who wants decent multiplayer, Heavy Plot line, and just good ole' rpg goodness. I wouldn't recomend this game for children 10 and under because it takes a lot of patientce and the puzzles in the game are very challengeing.

So, when I heard it was getting really good reviews, I thought about buying it. Now I realize I should have scrambled for the store like a rabid dog when it came out. I love this game to pieces. It's fun, entertaining, and touching. The battle system could get annoying for some because of the inability to pass by an enemy without jumping over it. But, the graphics are really good. If you just leave the gamecube on instead of touching anything at the start, you get an anime introduction. Overall this game had a great story line that always kept you guessing, nice and short dungeons so you don't get bored, beautiful battle scenes, bosses that aren't overly hard, and the ability to play a great RPG on the gamecube.Do yourself a favor and buy this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will need a gameboy advanced ??????","review":"Like Final Fantasy and Zelda four swords, need I find tree or four GBA to play with another 3 players???

For me, the best things about this game are the gameplay and characters. The two really stood out and made the experience much more worthwhile. The story is great although a little confusing and typical, the graphics are amazingly edgy, and the replay value is incredibly high. Some parts of the game are really challenging but once you get pass them you will be well rewarded. This made it really rewarding to venture through some of the side quests. The voice actors did a great job and the theme music was really good as well. I will always remember this game and it is one title in which everybody needs to experience at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best gc game i have ever played","review":"This is the best gc game i have ever played i have beaten the game 3 times and i am still not bored with it. I think that they might have over used the cuss words a little bit but when they say them it is funny. this game has a great story to it and the gameplayis addictive, the characters are awesome and are never boring especially characters later in the game. i think the game could have been a little bit longer they should have made the second disc much longer than it was because i finished the game the first time in 54 hrs but i keep playing even if i start to get bored of it about 10 minutes later i have to play it again. This game in my opinion should be bought by all gamecube owners unless they are like 6 yrs old cause some content is for some of the older crowd.I hope this review helps some people to buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS GAME!","review":"I LOVE THIS GAME!!!

You start off as a reckless young boy with his friends sets off on a journey to save all mana and when you think you know whats right then it takes a couple of turns and completly changes your mind. I played this game for a while but turned it down when I couldn't get past a part because there was a lot of talking and just got bored. Then I picked it up again and adored it! This game is worth the money! It took me forever to beat it and was sad when I did. If you don't like hard battles, great adventures, and a quest greater than to save your world than I suggest you don't buy this. Long live Tales of Symphonia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MAN!!! wait WOMAN","review":"This game was another great one. The Battle System was one of the best to date for sure.

While several books have been written by and for specialists, a general work has still to be written.Unfortunately, Lester Hyman is not the man to do it. As ex-dictator Charles Taylor's lawyer, he's hardly an objective source. And, writing from Washington, D.C., where he is based -- he never spent much time in Liberia -- he lacks the on-the-ground experience.Consequently, the book he wrote is nicely documented, but is is more of a partisan defense of his former client and an attack on successive American administrations that \\"let him down\\" than an objective narrative. Perhaps the author should have attempted a personal memoir of his infamous war criminal client (that would have been fascinating) rather than trying (and failing) to write an objective historical account that requires more detachment than he is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highschool gangster movie","review":"Ok, I really wanted to like this movie because I saw the previews on another movie and it looked very interesting. I guess that I should know better than to judge a movie by the previews. To me, this movie was simply awful. It was a bunch of highschool kids playing \\"gangster grown-ups\\" in a very adult manner. These kids at this age don't have that much of an organized mind to plan out such an elaborate scenario. The only reason that I gave this movie 2 stars was for the acting which was very good.

Then again, they might also work in the lunatic fringes of bad-independent films where teenage girls recite poetic blubber while playing dischordic melodies on mommy's grand piano? All told, this film has one of the most ridiculous scripts and premises I've ever seen, and I would realistically estimate that I've seen over 3,000 movies. I agree with the other reviewers who stated that \\"swallowing a brick\\" would be much easier than swallowing this implausible, self-important piece of fluff. So I give the film \\"zero\\" stars for the incredibly bad dialogue, and \\"one\\" star for trying to pass a difficult storyline. But the cast was superb, and merit five-stars... Even so, I cannot recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"This film is more of an exercise in the medium of film (playing with editing and genre stereotypes) than an exercise in storytelling with any relatability or character development.

It is artistic and stylish without taking away from the movie and very well rounded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake and pie, oh my","review":"It doesn't surprise me that this film has received a lot of negative reviews. This isn't the sort of movie you can guarantee that others will like.The literal-minded 'this is unrealistic' criticisms miss the point, of course. The film knows it isn't realistic, and even winks at you (e.g., the mom serving apple juice). The same can be said of grumbling about the convuluted plot and slangy dialog (that's the nature of the genre). I do think, however, that the muddy sound of the dialog is a problem. You end up missing some great lines (and you shouldn't need subtitles).What I like best is, despite the small budget, Brick is great to look at. Great washed-out California background, nice interior sets. Rian Johnson makes good use of jump cut editing and low camera angles and even a sunset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared to concentrate","review":"This movie has so many twists that you will need to watch it more than once. The vocabulary of street thugs is impressive. Proof that there's more to our language than the F word. Only heard one or two 4 letter words even though this movie deals with drugs and the violence that is caused by them. The language is somewhat Shakespearean and at times hard to follow. Great movie for teenagers, many lessons to learn here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078","review":"This movie has a great cast, a seemingly good story, and a ton of eye candy, but even with all that it has going for it.

Some nice ideas, some great camera movement, a horrible soundtrack and far away from fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"A World of Children","review":"Yes, it's well-written, and well-directed. But I'm one of those people who simply does not buy the gimmick, this Neo-noir world inhabited only by adolescents. Adolescent \\"detective.\\" Adolescent chanteuse. Adolescent femme fatale. Adolescent gangsters. Adolescent everything. The gimmick kills the story--kills it dead. Good writing and good acting can't revive it. I think you have to take teenagers a lot more seriously than I do in order to enjoy this movie. Indeed, you have to take them at least as seriously as they take themselves in this movie (and that's pretty damn seriously).It would have been much better using adult actors. Adult stories need adult actors. I'm not surprised this flick got such poor distribution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and not at all hip.","review":"I had really high hopes for this movie. What a let down. If the director is trying to attract a younger audience, I am afraid none of them will get it. I do understand what the premise was, but think it was poorlly executed. Not believable enough for adults, and too deep for teens. What a waste of my time. I totally don't get all the positive reviews. I fell asleep half way through, then tried to get through it again before finally turning it off. I love deep thinking suspense movies. This was epic garbage. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 star noir","review":"Unfocused and clumsy, although the inversion of traditional noir themes carries it somewhat.

How dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work for me","review":"I thought that this movie sucked. It seems like a movie made by someone who took all his favorite noir movies and rolled them into one. For an added zinger, they decided to set it in a High School which I just can't swallow. It is the high school thing that gets me, it's so unrealistic it just loses me. And I get the idea that it's supposed to be semi-satire but it doesn't work for me and in my opinion just ends up being corny not clever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious!","review":"This movie is great because it can be watched repeatedly, and each time the viewer will learn something new! It has an excellent dark mood, and it is fascinating how the filmmakers updated the film noir genre to a modern day high school. I loved the way the characters talked in this film. It is almost like a poem, which admittedly may take some time to get used to. I recommend watching this movie once without subtitles to focus on the action and once with subtitles to uncover all the secret, twisting dialogue. This movie will leave you with a lot to ponder for a week or two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maltese 90210","review":"A difficult, brilliant film, \\"Brick\\" is as noir as anything written by Dashiell Hammet. Writer/director Rian Johnson has a big future, and his next contract will probably be in the 7-8 figure bracket; Hollywood will see the movie for what it is, money in the bank. It is difficult to equate the depth of character, motive, and experience depicted in the film with your average 20-year-old, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief, \\"Brick\\" is easy to enjoy.The actors; the lead, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, imparts the gravitas of any actor in the major leagues like Pacino or De Niro, and Pin's prime enforcer, Noah Fleiss, carries off a smoldering performance reminiscent of Russell Crowe in L.A. Confidential.\\"Brick\\" is certainly worth checking out just to find out what the fuss is all about; and it doesn't hurt to be in on the ground floor when Rian Johnson or Joseph Gordon-Levitt becomes the next big thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie puts film noir back on the map","review":"The acting was superb, the story was awesome and engaging, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen the entire time, and it is filmed and directed with care, which is rare in films these days. So what if the world was mostly inhabitated by teens in this film? It did not flaw my enjoyment of this film. While the film was obviously influenced by class Film Noir genre movies, Cache, Veronica Mars, and, yes, many mafia films, Brick is clearly an original piece, which is a great change from all of these \\"Bread and Circus\\" films that are plaguing mainstream cinemas as we speak. What more can be said other than sit back, pop this dvd in, grab some snacks and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tour de force","review":"This movie has the feel of a Raymond Chandler novel brought to the big screen.

Brilliant stuff.I enjoyed this movie immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Present Day Film Noir","review":"The movie has a great pace and a really interesting feel.It does take place in a high school setting - but that hardly seems to matter.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has blossomed as an actor siince his time on 3rd Rock, did a spectacular job of taking the audience through the dark world of drugs and super hip and smart players as he tries to find a killer. And in true film noir style the person that pulled the trigger isn't even the one you end up blaming so much as the person that set the wheels in motion.The dialogue takes a few minutes to adjust to but once you start emersing yourself into what the director has created you become part of it. Because it is an alternate world. This terribly dark chic place isn't where the rest of us dwell. But it was a lot of fun to visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Crap","review":"This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time, I couldn't even watch half of it.

I didnt quite get the plot. The characters seemed dazed to me, they made me feel dazed too. The acting was a bit too inward. The villains look irritatingly queer. What is brick,anyway?

The only reason I continued watching this horrible cinema vomit is because I hoped that it would get better. The moive had a fade to black scene about every fifteen minutes. I'm not sure whether to take that as 'artistic' or just not knowing what to do next. It seems that this movie was made frame for frame all the while hoping that something would come to them after each take. This movie was a good attempt to be 'art'.

Another unrealistic teen movie where the characters don't seem to have parents, where much of the filming consists of some schmo slumping around with a camera following him, and where the pace is dreadfully slow. Sure, there was a murder. So what? Slump, slump, punch and kick. Not much heavy dialogue, not much action, at least not to the point where I turned it off. This movie reminded me of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, another movie I turned off, except that this one's star was better looking and the plot turned around a murder, whereas ND didn't seem to have a plot.

It's a great foundational tool to cover the basics of the Christian faith. And it answers some of those questions that you know you should know the answer to, but can't find the right words to do so. The questions at the end of the chapters are great for discussion, but it's also good to just go through the chapter to see what points stuck out to each of us.

Great to Sing. 5/5I know I put 5/5 on all of these but Jump5 deserves them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too sure if I like it....","review":"Okay, I gave this CD two stars for a reason.They have great beat but they sound like whiney 12 year olds.And the guys sound... Well, they don't sound right.And SORRY if this offends fans but, I gotta speak out!If you want some better more mature singers, try Superchick, Barlowgirl, Zoegirl, Stacie Orrico, John Reuben, Ginny Owens,and if you're not christian but you like to listen to Jump5 for fun but you want a more mature group/band try Superchick, Stacie Orrico, Avril Lavigne, or No Secrets.And SORRY if I offended any fans. Thanks Lots! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!!","review":"I liked this cd a lot! all the songs were great, though i dont listen to all of them. if you have the original jump5 and all the time in the world, you'll probably like this one. its titled, \\"accelerate\\" here's what i recomend for each somg:1.do ya 5/52.we are family 5/53.wonderful 5/54. pressure 4/55. why do i do 5/56. way of the world 4/57. walking on sunshine 5/58. every part of me 2/59. all because of you 4/510. shining star 5/5also, check out the jump5 remix cd titled \\"mix it up\\" its a really great cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convinced...","review":"I am still not convinced that Jump 5 is in the least bit musically talented. However, I do have to admit, they are on a step up with this album. I bought it after hearing \\"Why Do I do\\" on the radio. I kinda liked the song lyrically, but it was still kinda annoying. I read reviews and heard that it was gonna be a different album and not so \\"poppish.\\" That's a good thing, because I'm not a big pop fan! Anyway, I haven't listened to the whole album yet, it was too annoying!!! The only 1/2 decent song is \\"Wonderful.\\" I have heard them in concert and they just are not talented...I'll just keep with Jeremy Camp, Relient K, Superchick, Everyday Sunday, and Switchfoot!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful love/gospel CD","review":"There are some wonderful tracks on this CD. One song \\"God's Precious Love\\" would make a great wedding song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but Needs a Better Organization","review":"I really like this book, but wish it had an included index for looking up names with a specific rating on one of the scales in the book. There is a name index in the back that is useful for finding a specific name and looking up the information about that name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great experience","review":"The shipping was prompt. The book has a different cover, but the seller disclosed that in their advertisement. The book is in great shape. I would do business with this seller again.If this is not a review of the seller - the book is really cool too. It's like a horoscope based on your name. The author explores personality types & traits based on the sound of their name. It's pretty cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for Everyone","review":"This book contains every name I've tried to look up so far. The descriptions per person are so unique, I could read someone else's name description and it wouldn't match just anyone.It's a fun book to pass around in crowds of people and even more fun when you share what it's saying about you, or someone you know. Once you start understanding how this book really works, and their theory behind names, you can dissect any name without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is in a name?","review":"I found most of the descriptions to be correct in my own and the other names I looked up in this book. Makes for intersting reading. The book hooks you by appealing to your curiosity. Aren't we all a little fascinated with names? I mean a name is a pretty important thing!I found the way in which the names are broken down and analyzed to be a little odd. But the system/research the author used to arrive at the interpretations given must work, because there was a lot of truth to each person's name that I looked up.Fun coffee table type book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource!","review":"This is a great book. I like the fact that it doesn't just give you a flat historical meaning, but bases the meaning on the sounds that the letters in your name make and words that have similar patterns or sounds. We all make associations with words, so it's worth it to consider this idea. I really enjoyed reading about the history of each letter and how the sounds of letters and combinations can have different effects. I haven't seen a name book like this before. Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intriguing!","review":"The first thing you'll do upon picking up this book is turn to your name -- in my case, \\"MTH\\" names (for Matthew). I read through my description and it was seriously dead on. Intrigued, I looked up my sister Katherine (\\"KTH\\" names), and it was again virtually 100% accurate. So I looked up my ex-girlfriend's name, and I was floored as I read an amazing page-long description -- as though the authors had followed her around and wrote about her temperament and beliefs.I highly recommend you check it out... Don't know if there's any science to it, but it is definitely interesting. You will get a kick out of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"neat, unique book","review":"After enjoying looking up myself, family, and friends, I took it to work, and my friends seemed to enjoy the book even more! One disappointment is that there were a few common names that weren't in there, like Lupe. Working in Labor & Delivery, I've had several patients who were thrilled to look at this book as they made last minute decisions on their baby names. Good book for finding out more about what your name can mean for your personality, as well as others. Some of the descriptions are shockingly accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I bordered this book and was really anticipating it having read other's reviews of it as...- a must have for club kids- less like a novel, more like a crazy night out- the kind of book you'll read in one sitting- written by a NYC DJ it describes the ultimate club, that fantasy many clubbers chaseI'm on p. 113 and finding myself skipping sentences to get through this quicker. It is awkwardly written, often improbable and there are skin crawling hints of a too-close-for-comfort kind of \\"close\\" family. I'm yet to read anything about the club as I'm trudging through the three main characters unremarkable childhood. The ony thing keeping me going is the promise of the novel but the book seems so different from how it was reviewed that I had to research it again to be sure I didn't accidentally buy another novel of the same title.I hate not finishing a book so will try my best to keep reading but really feel this is a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't connect with the characters","review":"SynopsisA retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen tale parallels the story of a 20th century young man. Both are cast out of their homes and must discover how to stay true to themselves while being persecuted by the people and circumstances around them.ReviewUnfortunately I found this book difficult to get through. I was not able to connect with either of the main characters and found the supporting characters to be flat stereotypes. The pacing was a bit awkward, and the parallel story lines were confusing at times.My RecommendationI was just not a huge fan. 2/5 - If it happens to be around, it's OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"An oddly touching fiction which I found interesting. But it was missing something I can't quite pinpoint...."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stories: Puritans and Gays","review":"First off, I want to say I liked the author, I just didn't like the subject of this book. It should have been two books, in my opinion.It was frustrating to read 2 entirely different stories, that did not seem to have anything to do with each other. So much so, that I found myself skipping ahead so I could contine story 1, then going back to pick up on story 2.Story 1: The age-old Swan story with a Puritans-persecuting-others twist. The self-righteous, selfish, lying clergy who with many of their foaming-at-the-mouth followers, were ready to hurt anyone not like them.Story 2: This one was so depressing! It rehashed the terrible time in the 80's when AIDS was first discovered. This whole story was about homosexuality with religion thrown in. Sad and cruel.The author wrote well, but I would have never picked up this book if I had known what the subject material was. I was expecting a nice Swan story. So if you are looking for a happy book, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a case of love at first bar!","review":"I was actually watching the film for this when I got hooked on it ... so I went to the website, listened to some sample tracks and decided it would be a good buy.It was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Good","review":"I listen to this product alsmost everyday.

I was so glad that the music was the same music that was in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie may not be great the CD though .......","review":"The movie may not be worth its salt-its actually downright awful(bad acting, shallow script you name it). The soundtrack thought-now that's something you should not miss! It features some of the greatest current R&B stars (Missy Elliot, Angie Stone etc.) most prominent of course is Beyoncé who sings six songs on this album. The title track that is pretty much a Missy Elliot number is maybe one of the best. It is funky and simply hip. The heart and soul of this album are the gospel songs and they are truly marvelous. It is very enjoyable to hear how Beyoncé goes back to her roots and sings songs like \\"Swing Low Sweet Chariot\\" and \\"He Still Loves Me\\".Don't watch the movie-just get the soundtrack. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT CD TO LIFT YOUR SPIRITS !!!","review":"Beyonce' is singing her tail off and I love the O'jays (they still got it going on!) Even Melba Moore can still belt out a note. But my favorites are Shirley Ceaser, Angie Stone, and Ann Nesby.I was hoping there was a soundtrack to the film because the movie was only half the fun. I even felt moved on these preformances of:Rain DownTo Da RiverI'm Getting ReadyThe StoneHe Still Loves MeTime To Come HomeOne thing we all have to remember is that gospel music has evolved just as any other genre'. God does'nt care how you praise him....just that you do!This album is a symbol to that testament. So dont just look at the the singers themselves. Look at the quaility of music that is being performed. Expression is an art which is also a gift from God.Enjoy and God Bless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just great music!","review":"This music is a blessing for my heart and my ears. I can't remember enjoying a soundtrack that much since \\"The Preacher's Wife\\" was released. Sure, \\"The Fighting Temptations\\" is musically much more up-to-date. There is some traditional gospel like Shirley Caesar's and Ann Nesby's songs and great contemporary gospel by Beyonce, Angie Stone and the others. There is also some great so-called secular stuff. In fact, there isn't a song I wouldn't enjoy. The album is really uplifting. I can't get enough of this music ;-)And the film ... well, it's just a simple story about essential things: what it means to be a Christian, what Christianity is really about and how great it is to give glory to God.Both the film and the soundtrack are higly recommended, to my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment value","review":"Very much liked the movie, appeals to more than just the gospel music set (includes rappers and music appreciaters of all kinds).

Personally, I like that sometimes you don't know if an enemy is actually dead or just wounded... war is like that... not making sure can kill you! I also did not find the lack of save points a big problem. It forces you to be more careful and to think about your mission.

Inner contentment far exceeds six figures. Don Snyder is a hero to himself and to his family I will read this many times!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits close to home","review":"I just read this book while still mired in a job search going on three years. The emotional tailspin the author displays is heart-wrenching and familiar; the tone of the first 200 pages felt like reading my own journals. I did not identify with the author's deceptions and strange behaviors, however, such as lying to his wife or to an insurance company, or considering selling a new baby. But everyone has their own threshold for going haywire, and the point of this book is that Don Snyder got through it and learned something about life, work, and family.THE CLIFF WALK, beyond the author's personal journey, raises excellent questions about the \\"American Dream\\" and what it means in our modern age. It also looks at the meaning of work, and how we draw self-esteem -- even identity -- from what we do for pay. This is a courageous book, even if you don't always approve of how the author responds to his plight, and it offers a strong dose of perspective on what really matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yea, right.","review":"To borrow a phrase from Don Snyder-which nicely summarizes the book nicely-blah, blah, blah. Or said differently, lazy, lazy, lazy. Sniveling? Yep. Dishonest? Yes sir! Lazy. You bet. But Snyder overcomes all of those character faults by the end of the book. The problem is we have to listen to his slothful and narcistic attitude for more than half the book. I wish he would have gotten to the good part-about making an honest living as a working man-much sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells a reality that I must now face...","review":"I originally read the book because the book cover hooked my attention.Now as I wait on the results of a reorg with the possibility of my department being eliminated, I feel more mentally organized to accept the change if need be, as though I've worked through the mental process while I've read the book.When first read, the book was a love/hate piece of literature as I cheered \\"just get a job..tutor...work at a bookstore...do it for your family.\\" Now, I realize my credentials are based on a fragile foundation of \\"continuous work experience\\" that aims at a career target the size of a pea. Once someone takes away the target, the foundation is challenged and a new path away from what looks good on paper threatens the strength of your experience, and your ability to choose work.Snyder wrote well and honestly. I recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest sharing","review":"In this brutally honest reflection, Donald Snyder shares how he reels from a lost job as a successful English professor and finally finds his balance in a new life as an independent handyman. He also recounts his battle with extended anger and depression as rejection letters mount from other colleges. Finally, he comes to terms with his overweening pride and arrogance, and his sense of entitlement to a prestigious career and comfortable life. Financially and psychologically depleted, he takes a job as a contractor's helper, where he gradually reclaims himself and his humanity ... and he finds dignity in working with his hands. Through all of this, his wife remains committed to him and their family -- four young children -- and finds work herself to hold the family together --until Don finds his way back, to them and himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic to the core!","review":"I chose to read this book because I am a young English teacher with aspirations to be a college professor. I found this biography to be a moving, yet disturbing, piece.

The book is enjoyable because of the way it is written, almost at times like poetry. But that doesn't detract from the serious issues the author addresses. He takes the reader inside the family and his head as he attempts to deal with major issues like providing for four children and a wife after being fired and minor ones like his son's being upset about dad's bald spot. At times Snyder was almost too sensitive to his children's day to day concerns and yet not aware of his own needs.The author deals with issues everyone may have to confront at some point: how to deal with a total job change because there are not enough positions in the field for which you are trained. This truly is a book for our times"},{"rating":"2","title":"very revealing and very human","review":"If this books seems at all farfetched, it's because you haven't \\"been there\\". Trust me, losing a job has a way of stripping you of a lot, including pride and self esteem. It's like people can see you for what you really are and there's no hiding or pretending behind some job with a title and a suit. You become raw and exposed and it requires one to muster everything from deep inside to pull it all back together! Snyder captures it all so perfectly and vividly. It made me angry to read because I'm going through it and I have a masters degree...I'm not alone...there is no such thing as job security...we are all self employed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put it down!","review":"I am glad that I did not let the few negative reviews listed here deter me from reading this book. I realized very quickly that the author had lived a charmed life prior to his job loss, and the entire way he dealt with it had to do with this. He didn't take the loss very seriously at first because he was waiting for the next thing to fall into his lap as it always did. I don't fault him for that attitude, because that's all he knew. He had to learn the hard way that sometimes things don't just fall into your lap. Anyone who is looking for advice on how to deal with a job loss should look for a self-help or otherwise instructional book. This was an amazing story of a person's harsh self analysis of his behavior during a difficult time. I am going to recommend it to everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professors can write but they are lost in space.","review":"Professor Snyder's tale is well told and poignant, but it does show that if you spend too much time in academia you can lose sight of reality.

He spent days in his room, depressed, while his wife held the family together and got them through the rough times.

The crushed cans slide right into the container. I gave it only 4 stars because one of the plastic bolts wants to work its way out over time if you don't position the aluminum can just so. Don't push it quite all the way back into the slot before crushing, or you will need more force and that causes more stress on the mechanism. Also, it's pretty pricey overall for a product that can't handle mixed-metal cans.

The push bar isn't quite tall enough to suit us, but we are tall people & for a stroll around the neighborhood, it's comfortable enough.You can lock the steering and the rear wheels (nice for walking the long straight-aways) or you can unlock the rear wheels and the adult controls the steering.This little bike is cute, well built, (it's a Kettler!) and quite reasonable in price.

Not so with this album-- it's superb musicianship all the way, a joy for the discerning musical ear, or mellow at low volume as background music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for my metatarsal pain","review":"I have pain between my metatarsals (the bones just before the toes) often.

This little device did!Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy...Perfect For Any Beanie Lover or Budding Entomologist","review":"I bought this for my 11 year old son who spends the entire summer in trees hunting for real cicadas. Every summer he does this without fail, and has done it since he was three years old. He looks forward to cicada season every year with as much enthusiasm as most kids do Christmas. And he's sad when they start to go away in the fall. There's something comforting about listening to them cheeping in the trees on a warm summer night, so I can definitely understand the appeal. I found this while browsing for other cicada products for him and knew he would love it. He displays this on his shelf in his room next to some of the genuine specimens he's captured over the years. He especially likes the rough mesh panel that makes up the toy's face. This is something I know he's going to enjoy having around for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medical Botany is a Great Book.","review":"I find that I refer to this book all the time. Medical Botany isn't a book for non-readers, not a kid's book by any means but it is very well-constructed, highly interesting, and chock full of information not easily found elsewhere. The authors of this book are considered by their peers in biology and botany to be THE medical botanists. They have spent many years in the jungles of Peru searching for new medicinal plants and few writers are better prepared for this than the Lewis's. Memory Elvin Lewis is a world-class microbiologist and her husband Walter H. Lewis is widely considered to be the world expert on pollen, allergy and plant connections. Mr. Lewis is also the senior botanist at the Missouri Botanical Gardens. I consider this to be one of the most valuable books I own and highly recommend it to anyone with a serious interest in botany, medicine, or both."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on Medicinal Plants","review":"Medical Botany by the Lewis's is the book to read and own about medicinal plants.

I will say one thing though, if you've read David Kuo's Dot.bomb (and if you haven't you should) this book becomes somewhat interesting because it really shows off how warped a man Craig Winn really is. It is a truly sickening account of the events that transpired (btw, those sensitive about racist/sexist comments should probably avoid this book as well).On last note, please notice that all the good reviews of this book are from people who remained anonymous. I wouldn't be surprised it they were written by Crain Winn himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and entertaining","review":"As a small business owner who has hopes of making it \\"big\\" one day, this book gave me all the tools I'll ever need to navigate the business world.It was informative, inspirational, and even entertaining. The cast of characters involved in Value America's rise and fall are a true mix of the best and worst of society - and the author's insight into the people that helped destroy the company was very educational.The book was brutally honest and shared not only the author's triumphs, but also their tragedies - there wasn't any sugarcoating.The most impressive aspect of the book was the road map of how to build a company beginning with only innovative ideas and faithful people. Now I'm even more determined to think big and follow my dreams to help my company succeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely worth watching","review":"Unless you live and breath for Brooke, skip this DVD and just watch the E! version on TV... the 10 minutes bonus footage is more of the same, and the production values are almost non-existent.

However the DVD is just a poorly-done documentary on Brooke Burke, offering her annoying commentary over swimsuit shots done to a bad soundtrack. Like most other models, she is stuck-up, conceded, and too used to getting her own way and having no true challenges lying ahead of her. I'd take WWE's amazing Trish Stratus over Brooke anyday. Trish goes through much larger challenges than Brooke daily, in wrestling matches. Brooke wouldn't fare too well in that department. As for her looks, she is very very hot, but this DVD just brings it all down.

But they are still entertained.My three year old plays with hers more than my six year old. She (three year old) even sleeps and takes it almost everywhere she goes. My six year old likes to brush and braid her ponies hair. If you are considering buying this toy it is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pony Love","review":"My daughter got this for her 4th birthday and it is her favorite present.

The book is also a documentary in some way, since she lived day-to-day with the Masai people and describes their every day life, culture etc.The author is not a writer, so the style is not unforgettable, but the story itself is so gripping that one soon forget about the style and it is hard to put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panda puppet review","review":"I am on a puppet team at my church and I purchased this puppet to use for our VBS.

It just wasn't that good. I'm sure a lot was lost in translation, because I watched it in korean with english subtitles. There were what appeared to be a LOT, a TON of dramatic scenes with dialogue between a couple of characters. Pretty boring. It seemed to me, that they had a few good ideas for some fight scenes, or action scenes, and then tried to write a movie that would fit. Although the fight choreography was ok, the movie just wasn't that good. At times it looked like something you'd see from the early 80's, like flash gordon, but other times some of the special effects (if you could call them that), looked like stuff only seen more recently. Don't be fooled by the \\"matrix\\" looking picture on the cover. 90% of the movie doesn't have any guns in it or shooting.I'm sure that most american viewers will NOT like this movie. Be wanrned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"Avoid this at all costs. The story here is so confused that it's nearly impossible to tell what is actually happening.

Nothing syncs up and nothing goes anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for little ones","review":"Halloween Bash was great fun for my younger children.

What it is though is a beautiful rendering of classidal music using voices as the instruments. I first heard the first song (Beethoven's First Piano Concerto) some 50 years ago. I was having coffee in the Student Union cafeteria and the info desk was playing music over the loudspeaker system. I got chills up and down my arms and immediately went to find out what I had been hearing. Thus began a life-long love affair with classical music.

First of all, the guitar input jack ALWAYS falls off. The loose input jack makes a very static-y noise. Also, after owning this guitar after 2 months, the tuner head for the low E string falls off so the E string is too loose to be played, and the switch does not work. Be very careful with this guitar because it's easily damaged, and it's prone to fret buzzing. The finish is nice and sound is okay, but reliablity and action aren't so great.I wouldn't recommend this guitar because after a couple months you'll need to replace it. If you look around Amazon hard enough, you can find great deals for much better guitars. I found a $1000 retail guitar for only $300."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy but...","review":"Guitar is gorgeous, Sounds greatish \\"now\\" but had some issues when I I tried to start learn/playing it (did not sound right and I was finding it hard to play), I bought this to learn guitar on so I took it to a friend who plays and had him look at it and see what he thought... his words on what was wrong \\"a complete maniac set this thing up omg\\" he put a straight edge on the neck and it had approx. 1/32 bow, the action of the bridge was set up at an angle that put the low e string about 10/64 above 12th fret and the high e string was darned near touching, soo he adjusted the truss rod and bridge and in his words got it setup close enough for me to start doing excersizes on but will need to be taken in and be professionally setup because he has some suspicions about the nut and and first fret and he did not have the tools nor the know how to mess with those, so I am looking at another 50 bucks or more to put this guitar in proper order and am not very happy about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful puppet","review":"This is so well made!

Being the player of usually Lawful Evil characters, it's refreshing to see the main character of this book not Elminster, Drizzt, or a Harper, but one of the bad guys themselves; a decidedly Lawful Evil Loviatan cleric.Though the writing is not to the level of the more well known authors in the FR fiction line, it is quite entertaining, dipping into one of the more hilarious storylines in the source books (That being the Church of Entropy, a bunch of idiots who worship a Sphere of Annihilation).

The Germanic tribes centuries ago needed Wotan to explain thunder, today we know better - but the authors argue at this level.They quote scripture to show, that the Bible condems racism and treats women and men equal, but there are other quotations in the Bible which claim the opposite.Maybe the book gives additional 'arguments' to a devout Christian, but it is simply to flawed and too simplistic to convince anybody else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Enough Sparkle","review":"These jackets are exactly what I was looking for.

A plus was getting to hear \\"Flagpole Sitta\\" by Harvey Danger. But a big minus on this CD is the omission of Dickie's signature song - Christopher Cross' \\"Ride Like the Wind\\". That song is played three times and plays an important role in Dickie's life - most notably when he uses it to help Sally get a spot on the pep squad.

Some voice are ok, the lyrics aren't bad, and the orchestrations can be nice, but overall its just boring. Dull. Unfinished. Another problem with this recording is you need the synopsis to tell you what the heck is going on because none of these really seem to go together. For Sondheim fans I would suggest NOT getting this and saving yourself the depressing bore that he produced here. If your a new listener of Broadway DON'T get this. If you like the transition between new and old Broadway this might be your cup of tea. This CD should only be bought by collectors and older-style fans. (But I'm not sure even they will like it!)

They are not shouting or happy or angry but flows in its way with great depth, like it accepted everything in life with a touch of sadness.. and the feelings want to reach to the top without any urgency and Fazil Say is feeling this emotion the best.

I always thought my partners were the one's who caused my relationship problems, and this book has made me take a good look at myself and realize my actions and feelings were the true problem.

A very good album, although it isn't quite great because too many of the songs sound too similar, but I can't get enough of the few that seperate themselves from the pack, especially \\"Working Girls (Sunlight Shines)\\". A hearty recommendation as well for fans of bands like The Posies, who seem very similar to my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Not bad, but not particularly amazing either.The songs don't really distinguish themselves from each other, and Pernice's voice is way too mannered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another melodic gem","review":"While not as immediately absorbing as \\"Overcome by Happiness\\" or even the Chappaquiddick Skyline side-trip, this new cd does contain some beautifully crafted pop songs.

It does provide a useful summary of the basics. But that is exactly the danger, it only describes the basics and does not indicate how you go beyond the basics. The problem is that risk management is too important and too complicated to be left to beginners. The danger is that someone could read this book and be left with the impression that they understood risk management. There is so much more that is not covered here and very little guidance on how to find it. I am sure that beginners will love this book, it makes it all seem so easy. The only problem is that it is not all so easy and many topics skimmed over in this book e.g. operational risk need much more attention than this book provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's live action alright","review":"but the action, horror or sex-wise, is not very lively. Very disapointed in this tame and uninteresting low-budget exploitation flick. The gore, special effects are minimal and so is the nudity and sex. The greenish cover with the girl on all fours with tentalces around her is arguably the most exploitive thing about the entire film. There are some cute Japanese girls and a scene or two of note maybe, but that just means it's worth a rental at best. With a poor film and no major extras, a purchase is not recommended. For something a little more explicit, gruesome, and weird, try Entrails of a Beautiful Woman, if you can stomach it that is. As for Angel of Darkness(#1), I say skip it and save your money, time, and energy.Note: I don't know if the rest in the series are as bad, as the first one was poor enough to make me not bother with the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic Bliss","review":"I never really followed hillsong but ran across this DVD and instantly fell in love. The first video I saw was from the inside out and was amazed. I especially love the percussion drums in the background. Great artistry in the lighting and filming.

Christina Aguilera has a very good voice, and it is put to good use here. I think it's unfair comparing her with Britney, because apart from their ages and their hair colour they're really not that similar at all, and it's obvious there's some bad vibes between them. There's no reason two talented artists can't go out and do their own thing without having to put up with comparisons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody Rub The Bottle- Don't Let Her Loose","review":"What can I say?

But I was wrong! It mainly covered anatomy and barely touched on the topic of drawing the figure in perspective. So buyer beware. Yes, there is some material on visualizing body parts as slices, but no solid principles or processes for drawing the human figure in perspective. If you are looking for a book that covers anatomy, perspective, and figure drawing, there is no better book than Andrew Loomis' \\"Figure Drawing for All It's Worth\\".No, it's not a 1-star book. There is some interesting information on anatomy, but nothing that isn't covered in more depth in other anatomy books or in Loomis.

I had read several reviews saying that they were tight enough to be considered \\"snugger fit\\" condoms, but they seemed to be just as loose on me as regular Trojans. Basically, these did not meet my expectations. The condoms tended to unroll and become baggy during use. I have had a much better experience with the Iron Grip condoms.In addition, I do not like the \\"sheerlon\\" material in the Beyond Seven condoms. It tends to dry out much more easily than plain latex. I have also read people complaining that these condoms break too easily, but I did not run into that issue. The reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is that the condoms did not break and technically did what they were supposed to do.Now... what to do with the 90-odd Beyond Seven condoms I have left?

They reflect the various tastes and various acts. 'Total Lounge' is a difficult CD to both listen and watch with its accompanying DVD. The concept was decent, yet the compilation must have bounced through 10+ producers before it was even made.The beats are rather sterile and lack warmth. Moby's dithering 'Wispering Wind' shows why he's losing stock with regurgitated beats that even a high schooler could produce off of PC software. The annoying 'Me and Yoko Ono' by Tosca feat. Anna Clementi bent my ears while Radiophonic's 'Desert Wind' dragged on and on.France & Dom's \\"Scam' and Leggo Beast's 'Noodle Soup' are the few exciting cuts from this drab, over-analyzed, and ultimately dull CD.Hopefully, producer Water Music Records next attempt will forgo the complacent music syndrome and add some much needed excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Through These Eyes fully gives you a sense of what it was like growing up during the depression and the encounters of those (boys) who fought in WWII.

That is, it doesn't burn my skin off while reaching the maximum effect, like some products have (Thera-Gesic Pain Relieving Creme, Maximum Strength, 3 oz.). Be warned, depending on the amount of inflammation you have, it can make you feel cold. Covering up with a blanket after applying it will help with that, though.

However, they still produced a lot of good songs, and DJ Die was the man for the catchy melodies. Indeed, beside Roni Size, he was my favourite at Full Cycle.This CD is a disappointment, however. There are only very few really good tracks on it, and otherwise it is very repetitive and very hard. Hard is fine if you mix it up with some good tunes, but Die does not give you anytime to relax, and outside of a club, this is not so good. Maybe its a good mix if you want to give a DnB-party, but if you want to listen to it at home or whereever, it is too repetitive, almost dull.I hope his next mix is better.

The performer on \\"A Window in Time\\" is utterly unlike the real Rachmaninoff. The Stahnke Rachmaninoff plays with almost no expression on a small-sounding piano with limited dynamic range. He is metronomic and boring. The REAL Rachmaninoff performed with color, with rhythmic vitality and alertness; none of it is here. This CD is deadly computerized ennui. If you want the Rachmaninoff piano rolls, try London's \\"Rachmaninoff Plays Rachmaninoff\\" CD; it's done on a real concert grand. It may not be elegant, but it's alive - more than can be said for this insomnia cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"mechanical echoes","review":"As a classical music buff and an amateur pianist, I eagerly purchased both volumes of \\"A Window in Time\\". Unfortunately, I found both albums disappointing. There is little range in touch and dynamics; for example, the virtual performer seems incapable of legato. The technical problem lies in the recording of the piano rolls. Although the rolls are \\"digital\\" in nature, they do not have the capability to capture nuances. What is left is some sense of Rachmaninoff's timing, but even that is suspect - in the liner notes, Stahnke mentions the problems he experienced with determining what speed at which to play the rolls. That \\"impressive speed\\" you hear may be artificially sped up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific ride through history.","review":"Now, I understand what pianism is all about. Before I purchased this CD I never had the belief that what I was playing was true to the composer's intentions.

Rachmaninoff's playing is quite simply, outstanding, an unbelievable tour-de-force, that sometimes results in the most delicate of playing, while never losing sight of the real picture. Anyone who has ever heard other playing by Rachmaninoff will revel in this new technology, and find themselves in a world that they thought existed.

WOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Begin here!","review":"Barbra Streisand was at her best in the 1960's with raw and pure talent. I recommend this album if one wishes to start a definitive Streisand collection. Her renditions of \\"The Man in the Street\\" and \\"A Taste of Honey\\" are simply exquisite. And of course her re-invention of \\"Happy Days are Here Again\\" is a joyous classic. This album is based on the songs she performed in the Village nightclubs, and the listener can truly appreciate the potential star that would emerge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Purchase!","review":"My daughter received this as a gift fro her 7th birthday. It can count quarters okay. But if you put in a penny, nickel, or dime, it always counts a dime. My 4 year old enjoys it, she puts pennies and nickels in it and calls it a dummy pig. I'm very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what a piggy bank should do","review":"I picked one of these up at the warehouse store - something of an impulse buy. We used to have a ceramic scrubbing bubble bank and it broke so we needed something to put change in. A mason jar was doing the trick but this looked cute so I got it - yes, for myself, a grown adult (probably 28 at the time...)It works. My husband finds it irritating how it vibrates and all once you put the money in but I think it's funny. Holds a good chunk of change and does what it should - it's a bank with a little extra. Despite the vibration feature, the batteries have lasted forever.I've never heard it guess wrong - thought the pink counting one my son got for his birthday does miss a few now and then.Recommend this for either a kid or an adult with a weird side."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to put this book down.","review":"This was a difficult read. It is printed in Great Britain and written for that audience. Therefore there are subtleties that were lost on this American. Chapter 2 is devoted to meeting step children.

I somehow was blessed with finding a Kryon article in Sedona Journal of Emergence and His words inspired me to change my life 500% for the better. This is an excellent book to start with if you are unfamiliar with Kryon.

There was less action, more talking, walking, talking...Hojo's ancestor, and talking. I like Kagura, and she was in the movie. It had an interesting plot, don't get me wrong, but it didn't make me want to watch it again immediately after I watched it the first time, like I did with the first one. For those of you who like the Miroku and Sango side lines, this is a good movie. But if you are into action, watch the first one again. A good movie, but not as good as the first!

They also look great with jeans and moderately dressy pants.However, they're not as waterproof as they used to be - my first couple of pairs never leaked, but my last two or three started to leak within a few months.But the biggest change is the soles. They wear out in less than a year now. They used to last for at least 2-3 years. Toewarmers, what is this new material you're using in the soles?

Each DVD contains only one hour of programing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I bought this compilation as a gift for my sister who really enjoys the show. I should have known something was up based on the low price for the set, but I was extremely disappointed to see that each disc only contain 2 half hour episodes. This is an extreme waste.

RIP-OFF ALERT!","review":"This DVD \\"set\\" comes with no descriptions of the episodes, and with good reason. The majority of the material appears on the much lower-priced single volumes of Burns and Allen released in 2003. You're paying for packaging. There are only 2 episodes on four of the discs. The final disc is a documentary. Save your money and buy Burn and Allen Vol. 1 & 2. This is a great disappointment and an utter waste of money!

You get to see the first show of the TV series...and then other, too.

They give us FIVE dvds...each with just under 60 minutes on it. Would the world come to an end if theyput TWO HOURS on each dvd...and saved us some space on our overcrowded dvd storage units?

Even ONE star is too high a rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The collection is a huge disappointment for a 5 disk collection. The collection only has 8 episodes of the George and Gracie Show. The documentary would be a nice addition but with 5 disks, more episodes should be included. With only 8 episodes and the documentary, 2 disks would have been sufficient. It just is not worth your money. George and Gracie are great and were some America's finest entertainers. Gracie is the funniest woman I have ever seen, including the legendary women comedy actresses like Lucile Ball and Carol Burnett. The show is a great example of how the old Vaudeville shows were adapted to television. It is good for the younger generation to see how the commercial advertisements were built into the show. But for 5 disks with only 8 episodes is not a good value. I find it very insulting to the careers of Gracie Allen and George Burns."},{"rating":"2","title":"DrNo","review":"I love the old Burns and Allen TV Shows. The built-in commercials are outstanding and really add to the fifties feel. Gracie is about the funniest comedian ever.The picture is a bit grainy, but this is expected of TV shows that are this old. The sound is mono but reasonable.The only disappointment is the number of shows. They only fit two half-hour shows on each disk, for a total of 8 shows plus a one hour biography show.

Remembering hearing these in the sixties on AM car radios with a single speaker, the new environment can be a revelation.Take this music for what it's worth: it is relaxing to listen to, great 'mood music', and able to transport many of us back forty or more years.

Over all i thought this was a good gun for starters and people who just have small air-soft wars with friends. The silencer attachment all tho does not silence it increases the accuracy in the gun and i recommend using this. The red dot scope does not work well and i recommend just using the regular sights for the best accuracy. The chain mag (high capacity mag) works and is amazing if you wind it up enough it can shoot consent fire for up to about 25-30 seconds. The low capacity mag also works great and is easy to reload but it is a tight fit in the gear box. Over all out of all my Smg's this is one of my top 5.

Both the May 1, 2000 Business Week and David Kuo's \\"Dot Bomb\\" make it painfully obvious that the demise of Winn's Value America was a direct result of his deluded sense of place in the world combined with a profound inability of managing anything larger than a lemonade stand.

This book will open your eyes like no other that I have read. You will get a first class education while you enjoy the novel like format. I checked its sources and amazingly they are very accurate.Excellent book to read....must get for people who want to understand why there is so much terrorism in the world associated with Islam."},{"rating":"2","title":"America. Its time to open your eyes.","review":"This book contains both, a marriage of fiction and non-fiction. It's an eye opening chronological account on the roots of Islam, as well as a white-knuckle anti terrorist story.Islam is not a peace loving religion; it's an indoctrination of hate.America, its time we open our eyes and see the true threat we are facing before it's too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth will set you free","review":"An excellent source of information on the background and origins of Islam. Chillingly set in novel format, the story is graphic, compelling and honest without being over-the-top, or profane in its depictions of violence or in its dialogue, which I personally am very grateful for. I particularly found amusing the thinly veiled portrayals of Yassar Arafat, and Hillary Clinton as President: a disturbing preview of our 2008 administration. Don't look for this to be a motion picture soon: Hollywood can't handle the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynda Barry is the Total God of All Geniuses","review":"Lynda Barry is always wonderful. Even when I begin to think that Fred Milton, Beat Poodle, is starting to become tiresome, I realize I'm mistaken if I pause for a moment to consider it again...So buy a copy of The Freddie Stories. This is one of her best works, along with Cruddy and 100 Demons. Beautiful, sad, hilarious, touching, filled with truth and love and pain and Barry's amazingly funny magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat of a disappointment","review":"Being a major Lynda Barry fan, I looked forward to her first new book to be published in some time. Sadly to say, the book does not meet my expectations. The illustrations are as wonderful as ever; the storyline has wonderful possibilities; but half-way through the book, I wanted to throw it against the wall! The main character (Freddie) begins speaking in some type of 'wierd-speak' which actually caused me to look ahead in the book just to see when he would stop! This 'baba-baby' talk severely interrupts the flow of the story. I also noticed that the text of the story is, for some reason, much larger than in the past, and limits the size of the drawings to sometimes no more than the bottom third of the panel. I will re-read the book to see if I missed something."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Lynda Barry but this one is a sincere disppointment","review":"I am sad to say I did not enjoy this collection very much at all, mostly because it lacks Marlys and Maybonne! Freddie is very different from M & M--I can't believe he's related to them. There are lots of trippy skulls and bad kids who kill old ladies, and none of the pimply fun of M & M. I do not recommend this one unless you are trying to complete a collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of some what good cartoons.","review":"This book was not real intoresting.

I didn't hear from them for a long time. When I finally called them to find out where my replacement was, they told me it was no longer in stock. Since the charge was on my visa, I told them to refund my visa account and that I would get another radio from someone else. I still have not received my Visa credit.

The switches have an imprecise and awful feel and seem very delicate. The sound quality is very poor (Remember those less than $5 transistor radios?) and the reception is worse. Even the strongest stations in my area only come in with a great deal of fuzzy sound and you can always hear the radio stations near them in the back ground.

She was indecisive, somewhat whiny and strangely bland (despite that sad desperate attempt to make her interesting by involving her in some sort of secret sisterhood). He was godawful. With his broken redneck speech and hairy ways, I kept picturing him as a dusty Paul Bunyan type with beard lice and dirty nails. NOT ATTRACTIVE AT ALL.

What a classic. There are some mad shredding riffs in there. As a guitarist, Waters has always been some kind of inspiration even today.I think the vocals on Alice in Hell are more rough and draft than Never Neverland but that's just me.

I bought Alice In Hell by itself for about 26 bucks a few years ago so you can imagine how psyched about this. Annihilator is just one of those bands that has never sold out and wrote soft music and toned down their approach. Jeff Waters riff writing and soloing genious speaks for itself on these amazing early releases. If you have ever liked thrash metal go out and buy these this is one of the only times a relaease will actually be worth the 18 bucks they're charging for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles at Carnegie Hall","review":"This is Miles at Carnegie Hall with his group, including the underrated tenor saxophone of Hank Mobley. Also, the Gil Evans Orchestra makes an appearance. The sound is unbalanced and raw. Fans of Mobley will obviously want it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best....","review":"This book is better than the Nikon instruction manuals that come with the D1 family cameras, but only marginally. A lot of the information in this book can be found on digital photography websites. Also, this book is rather padded. Far too many chapters include duplicate information which leads me to believe the author simply did a cut-and-paste job on several of the pages and used them throughout the book. Another thing: the photos in the book are (for the most part) very nice but the repoduction is very poor. It is difficult to see the quality that these cameras are capable of by looking at these soft, slightly out of focus images. There are some useful tips regarding white balance and extra software, but for the money I felt this book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that means something !","review":"So much of the \\"music\\" we hear today is nothing more than noise coupled with the required dancing. Take away the visuals and there's NOTHING !! While I was growing up, I refused to listen to traditional Irish music, folk music, classical music, etc. What a pity !! I will always regret not seeing the Clancy Bros. perform... one listen to this masterpiece of beautifully crafted songs filled with wit, humor, anger and sadness shows why ! In particular for me is \\"The Parting Glass\\", the final song. So simple in it's construction; which belies the genious; it is a heart touching tune sung solely by Liam Clancy then achingly beautifully joined by the others. In the end,when Tom Clancy emparts to the audience with \\"God bless\\"..... you know he means it !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have been looking for the Children's Medly forever!","review":"I was so excited to find this CD including the Children's Medly.

It has the same clear-plastic handles and and the same black-plastic sprayer. (The base of my faucet is rectangular instead of oval.) It has probably been in place since the house was built, about 50 years ago. By now, it is understandably scratched and deeply scarred, but what I object to is the difficulty of cleaning it. You have to fold a dishrag in half and run it around the base of the handles periodically to remove accumulated sludge. However, inside the clear handles is a disgusting accumulation of filth and mold that is impossible to remove. As for the sprayer, it diverts only a tiny fraction of the water from the faucet, so it wastes enormous amounts of water when used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful intrument, No case","review":"I ordered anEpiphone G-400 Custom SG Collection Electric Guitar, Antique Ivory.

So, the guitar still has not been checked. In particular, I was concerned about some string buzzing, which should be simple for the technician to fix.Usually, Amazon does a good job of informing customers of low inventory, but this has been a disappointing lapse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grow!

We were pleased at DK's clear delineation between the major sects were given as much devotion to detail as the sects in DK's Christian book (as well as fair portrayal in the DK Religions book!). The differences included practices by the people versus the monks, by evolution through countries, and recent adaptation to America. I don't know that the Editorial Reviewer got it right when they said the belief in afterlife was obscured. It's a Western measurement that negates what the DK Religions book and Buddhism book gives a vantage to. Very interesting stuff for those ready to move past the 9/11 God-centered/Christian-Islamic dialogue toward a more inclusive world view!

But that's because of a couple of reasons: First of all, you have to have patience with his books. What I mean by that is, I mean that in order for you to like it, you have to read the entire book of his. And, in the entire last vampire series, I think the entire series is one book, telling one story of the same character with a bunch of unique plot twists intertwining. It's a great book, and so is the rest of the series. Sita grows from a cold blooded creature to a character that You later learn to love if you read the rest of the series.

It also does not portray her as the perfect good guy, she has killed and still kills and never regrets it. This and all the other books in the Last Vampire series are the best books Christopher Pike has ever written. When I hear the titles of the books I think they are just cheap horror stories like R.L. Stine's books, they have much more substance than them. Christopher Pike books are not a crappy kind of horror that is supposed to be scary but is not too scary (Like R.L.Stine)The books are Fantasy and are very realistic and he gives an original, intelligent view of things. For example Sita doesn't bite someone and they become a vampire, that's unoriginal, instead she has to mix blood with them and let her DNA overcome their DNA. That's a lot easier to believe.

They show no interest in the textured \\"bump\\" pads, even with the catnip, and they pretty much chewed up the rubbery center spindle knob in the first couple of days.Save your hard-earned money and just buy fresh catnip periodically to sprinkle in a safe area, and use kitty brushes to groom your cats, and you'll be better off :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun times!","review":"I picked this up for my cat that loves to rub her chin on everything she can touch.

I wrapped it for Christmas (yes, corny, I know), and the cats could smell the catnip it came with through the package, so chewed on it until I let them \\"open\\" it. Then, one paid little attention to it, while the other monopolized it, as long as I could keep the teeny-tiny compartments for catnip filled. My cats very quickly destroyed the gum massager, and cleaning the hair out of the various brushes was time-consuming. Prepare to spill a lot of catnip getting it into the compartments. The toy also takes up a lot of room and is difficult to store. I threw this out a long time ago, have a new kitten now, and will not waste my money on one of these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats like","review":"My two cats seem to really enjoy this toy, but only if I add food or catnip to it.

However, now that he is 8 years old and loves to be brushed and groomed, he immediately responded to the product and knew exactly how to use it and what the product could do for him. The only flaw I can find is that the product should be stabilized to the floor or better yet to the wall so that the cats can use as much of their body weight as they want, to apply as much pressure and receive as much stimulation that the product delivers. I highly recommend this product, especially for the cat that is frequently left alone for extended amounts of time. They are able to get the stimulation and massage that we cannot provide through the day and as a result they can have, in a small way, their need for immediate pleasure and stimulation provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roy Roger's is a Keeper","review":"How can you go wrong with the King of the Cowboys?

From the first line of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" it was obvious that Joni Mitchell has blown out her voice with years of smoking (the cover even shows her with a cigarette in her hand). There were only two or three of her early songs (and they were performed poorly). All the other songs sounded alike and bored me to tears. Even in DTS 5.1, the sound was distant and thin. This was a real disappointment. Try Roy Orbison's \\"Black and White Night\\" (includes AC-3 AND DTS) for a involving performance with a stunning and truly surrounding sound field - the room literally comes alive!

Sadly, I suspect we have been left with an old Joni Mitchell. I would recommend an ENT consult, stat! Surely that rasp is diagnostic of something unpleasant.

The arguement that Saddam Hussein had support of his fellow arabs was plain and simply erroneous. I feel examples such as this are irresponsible and unethical for use in a text of this nature.

HOWEVER, the next day I looked at the tires and they didn't look wet at all. I DIDN'T EVEN DRIVE THE CAR and the product had already worn off! I thought maybe I had done something wrong, so I tried it on my other car (which has really dirty tires) and again they looked pretty clean at first. In fact, I sprayed it on twice just to make sure they were fully coated. The next day I looked at the car and the product had worn off. I will not be buying this ever again.

It is most excellent EXCEPT for the DHCP chapter which has blantant TYPOS galore and is just flat out INCORRECT at parts.So I scored 100% on all sections EXCEPT the DHCP where I scored a big fat 0% -- all DHCP questions were service file location and purpose, no client/general questions (many blank fill-ins too).

I come to this decision fairly easy due to the lack of material in this area. It does have very good information but there are about 4 chapters where I found some inconsistencies. The chapter on DHCP was an ordeal, although it did have the best TCP/IP Suite and IPv6 coverage. The book does not have a prep exam the kind you would find in an Exam Cram (hmmm, that could be immensely helpful). It does have 10 or 15 questions after each chapter which were good (minus inconsistencies in some chapters) but it also has two essay form questions after each chapter as well. The intro alludes that these essay style questions are needed for the exam but this is false and a bit of a distraction. I passed the first time and learned a few things so I gave it marginal 4 stars. Study the book, refer to man pages to iron out typos and inconsistencies, purchase a home copy of Solaris 8 x86. good luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous to use","review":"I have a pair of these knee pads with McGuire-Nicholas branding.

I have had no problems digesting any of the foods and the recipes I've made have had the protein my physician wanted me to have (without the carbs) have been extremely easy to make.

Even when the books aim is to make women the focus, it still talks about women as if they are abstract beings to be inteerpreted by a man serving perspective. Crap! Stick to the book, Women: An Intimate Geography. It is a great book written by a woman, who bashes through gender science to illuminate how much of what we take for science about the genders is nothing but crock science aimed at perpetuating gender biases than actual science.

It is a neat bottle design, but somewhat confusing. We still have not figured out if the plastic casing comes off of the actual bottle or not. It seems like you would have to pry and break it to get it off, but at the same time seems like it is supposed to come off. We didn't pry it because we didn't want to break it.

The author also tries to explain how to make a quilting design fit the size of your own quilt but that is done very poorly. I have seen much better instructions in other books. The quilting part is okay but it is just a few pages. This is definitely not a book every quilter needs even if you prefer hand quilting to machine quilting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For an anthology that promises zombies, several of the creatures encountered in these pages barely qualify for the term.

The choice of episodes here are also not the best. One of the worst episodes \\"Lucy the Fight Manager\\" with Don Rickles (an annoying presence), has NOT ONE funny moment in the entire episode.

It is more a grammar than a language course and it would be ideal for those who have already learnt the basics of Maltese and wish to have a grammatical reference whenever they hesitate about the language rules. Very few exercises and quizes, and not useful at all in which concerns to learning Maltese, no dialogues in the whole book, and very \\"hard\\" explanations about the language. I gave it one star because of its cover, which is the only nice thing in the book.

It is only relatively recently that Teach Yourself have begun to add culture notes, pitching themselves more at the middle-of-the-road learner who is keen on travel, rather than the academic. A plea therefore to the publisher: please update this one so that more can learn and travel to this wonderful country!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars if you are a descriptive linguist.","review":"My copy of this book was published before 1999 and I do not know whether changes have been made, but the title is misleading. As a student of linguistics for eleven years, I believe that the book was not written for people who want to learn Maltese; it was written for linguists who wish to fit the language into its proper place among other forms of colloquial Arabic. This is the reason for complaints about its terminology. The book is excellent, but the title gives an inaccurate statement of its objective.For learning to speak Maltese, see \\"Beginning Maltese,\\" also listed on this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best out there,...","review":"The author assumes far too much from his readers.

It sounded like a can of washers was rattling around in the back and nothing I could do would stop it. I really could not find the cause for several months of the winter but this spring I lay in the back and kept pounding and twisting and pulling until at last I thought I had it. The joints between the bows and the side brackets would work up and down and make the noise. I took it all apart and removed the bows, then pulled the U clips off the ends. I tapped a 6-32 hole in both sides of each bracket and installed small set screws. I then put it all back together and tightened up the set screws until there was no movement between the bows and side rails. This fixed the noise but it should not have been there in the first place. Extang needs to do a little more engineering. If you do not want a rattling truck and don't want to make the repair.

It contains a lot of popular Christmas tunes, as well as some not so well-known, especially in the USA, but perhaps more familiar to folks in the UK.

Most of them are quite large; the Regina is about table-top sized, and some (such as the Polyphon) can be the size of a large refrigerator or china cabinet(!). Due to such monstrous sizes, real range of pitch is possible. Anyone who labors under the unfortunate misconception that all music boxes must be High-&-Tinkly need only to listen to this album to be permanently cured of it -- particularly in the case of \\"O Sanctissima\\", near the end of which occurs a note so low that it is almost (but fortunately not quite) unmusical! (Play it, you'll hear what I mean.) My personal favorites among these pieces are: \\"Spin, Spin\\", \\"Ihr Kinderlein Kommet (O Come Little Children)\\", \\"O Sanctissima\\", \\"Jesus Lover Of My Soul\\", and of course, \\"Stille Nacht (Silent Night)\\".

It is just way too experimental. Yes, Progressive House in 2005 beginning to sound a little dirtier and techier and Fabric 20 by Digweed is a perfect example of that. I heard Sasha spin several times this year during his Fundancion monthly residency in NY and he also sounded very techy and experimental. With all that said, no one sounded this experimental. Some tracks are just plain annoying and impossible to listen to. If you want weird psychedelic sounds, you can pick up any Infected Mushrooms compilations; those are much better and actually specialize in experimentation that works. However, there is no reason to get disapointed with the Balance series. Anthony Pappa's Balance 006 is awesome;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Chris Fortier Cd Set ever ! ! !","review":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I cannot believe I waited all this time for a new chris fortier release and was completely disappointed. This album is nothing like his previous bedrock cd set. There are no tracks on either of the 3 cd's worth listening to.

I THINK SASHA,DIGWEED,PALASH AND TIESTO ALL SUCK TOO. I'VE MOVED AWAY FROM HIGH ENERGY TRANCE AND MOVED INTO THE PROGRESSIVE SOUND A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND ITS BEEN SLOWLY GOING DOWN HILL.

It grabs the listener from the start. The first and second discs are superb, however I haven't gotten the chance to listen to the third disc yet. The second disc is pure progressive, never increasing in beats per minute (a constant 126bpm). Fortier also uses the same style as he did for Bedrock. Ultra smooth, gradually increasing climax, and an amazing closing track on disc two that adds an emotive appeal to it all. Very well done, and I look forward to any upcoming releases by this individual."},{"rating":"1","title":"someone said it sounds great when you're in the mood","review":"For starters, I love progressive and trance. I think Holden and Pappa's Balance mixes are amazing. Mr. Fortier just seems to fall flat. I never got a sense of where he was going with these mixes. Yes, there are 3 discs here, but there's no connection between all three, other than the man spinning them. It's all gone tech-house...there are no giant builds or releases...it's relatively flat over the course of all three discs. Because of this, these come off as bland sounding...sort of like Eric Clapton...sure, some people like Clapton, but if you're not a big fan, the music is just sort of *meh*. That's how this mix comes off...it's never bad, just never really shines. So if you're in the mood for Clapton..."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"this has got to be one of the best mixes in a long time. compared to this everyone else chickens out when it comes to going experimental. it's like aphex twin infected this mix in a very good way. i don't understand how people don't like it. i guess it just shows how the majority of this genre is somewhat low on the artistic scale. sure, dance music is all about fun and \\"phat jamz\\", but it can be mind-candy too. i ate this up from the very beginning. i understood it perfectly from the very beginning. if you like any Ghostly Records or more experimental music you will like this. if you only like music that allows you to zone out and \\"partay all night lawng\\" you might not like it. try some random prog-trance thing instead. like nick warren's new global underground mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"second best in all Balance series!!!","review":"As I wrote earlier about the Balance series - the main reason I totally love this series is that they try to come with something new with every new edition.

By Chris Forties I was not dissapointed at all but very surprised!!!I do not want to describe how good the music is or what are you going to hear, but if you look for something unusual, progressive, not mind numbing at all, something what takes you deeply into the set, so this is it.My favourite is 3rd CD, definatelly, this is a masterpiece. Fist one is good as well. Enjoy and remember, you have to let yourself surprise :)Btw, the other of my favourite from Balance series is (of course) James Holden, Will Saul, Joris Voorn and SOS.

If those trade-offs are not acceptable to you then cough up the extra $400-600 for a 5hp 4-stroker.For the money it's a really good fishing engine. I like that I don't have to deal with a water pump repair anymore, so overall it's an easier engine to maintain. Always starts by the 3rd pull (1st pull when it's warm). I like being the only one on the water with American Iron on the transom; it has a distinctive look (I call it the FlatHead) and engine note.

Second, it doesn't tilt sufficiently to get the prop out of the water like a water-cooled engine so we have to take it off the dinghy if we want to tow the dinghy. Third, the gear shift is really clunky to operate.

Thank You!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bold effort to synthesize modern research with belief.","review":"In defense of Jacobs' much-maligned works, I believe that this book makes a valiant effort to describe a mode of Judaism that harmonizes historical-critical research and belief. Although the author himself admits that gray areas do exist in his non-traditional \\"liberal supernaturalism\\", it is certainly a step toward a definition of belief for today's Jews. The book is written in a very personal tone, one that some readers may find distracting; I found it to add an interesting autobiographical flavor, one that reflects Jacobs' journey from yeshiva student to Masorti proponent. Incidentally, he makes no claim that the so-called \\"High criticism\\" represented by Wellhausen's Documentary Hypothesis has been utterly rejected, only that it has been subject to scholarly revision and modification in recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A guide in misusing Biblical texts","review":"This book should really be entitled 'Beyond Reasonable Scholarship.' Dr Jacobs bases his argument on the false claim that Jewish tradition only countenances a single author for Psalms i.e. King David. Then he goes on to infer that as this is untrue (how could David write about future events?) the belief in the divine authorship of the five books of Moses must also be untrue. This is blatant nonsence as Dr Jacobs must know.There are several Talmudic references to Psalms as a composite work and many later commentators such as David Kimkhi and the Malbim also explain how Psalms was the work of over 10 authors, edited in his generation by David and that later editions added Psalms written in the Babylonian exile. Therefore the supposed authorship of Psalms has not a jot to do with the authorship of the Pentateuch. This a bad book full of bad scholarship. It is also an insult to any academic or traditionally learned Jew who is aware of the sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Read, Poor Arguments","review":"Louis Jacobs is trying his best to defend the obviously untenable position of having-the-cake-and-eating-it-too, by offering another book to explain the Jewish Conservative movements \\"Liberal Supernaturalist\\" view. He wants to explain how one can deny the historical truth of Judaism's core beliefs, the Revelation at Mount Sinai, and the divine source of the Oral Code - while at the same time stay committed to the observance of Halacha. The core of Jacobs' argument is that Biblical Criticism is a scientific fact. But when faced with the fact that modern scientists totally reject the premise of High Criticism - he reverts to the indefensible stance that current critics do not accept the divine source of the Torah. The current rejection of the \\"popular\\" Criticism is enough to give the believer a reason to stand by his beliefs.It is also quite boring to read the history of English Jewry and the personal adventures of Jacobs the person.Still, it is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great knife","review":"The CRKT M-16 is not a terribly good knife. First off, I find closing it a real pain in the keister. You have to depress a safety knob before you can push the liner lock out of the way to close the knife. This makes one handed closing a bit of a chore. With practice it can be done, but I think the system is overly complicated. Also, the action gets stuck at times and you have to exert quite a bit of force to move the liner lock. Just another thing to go wrong and it makes the knife undependable.The knife is, to its credit, very sharp. But the handle feels cheap and does not sit well in the hand. It also does not ride well clipped inside a pocket. I only carry the knife if think I'll need to lend it out. If it gets lost I won't mind.

The CRKT M16-10Z EDC was not a good purchase. The pivot screw, which is not made of metal but Zytel I'm left to assume, fully unwound itself after a handful of openings and closings, causing the knife to literally fall to pieces. After many such occurrences, I took it apart one more time, investigated it's innards and threw it in the trash. One may ask why I rashly threw it away without taking advantage of CRKT's excellent warranty? The answer is that it is far from an expensive blade and frankly wasn't worth the trouble to deal with the warranty.

Whatever happened to character growth and development? These people start out unsavory and unlikeable and simply intensify their characteristics to a point beyond -- well, beyond four-letter-word description. The inaptly named author declares he wrote the sort of book he'd like to read; if you relish graphic depictions of body parts, functions and actions perhaps you will find this entertaining.

What motivates him isn't altogether clear, and whether he's an idiot, an ( ), losing his sanity--or all three--he's a far from sympathetic figure. Peace's writing is altogether awkward, he tries to hard to achieve some kind of flair, and plot threads.

I do NOT want this to happen when I take the LSAT.I've found some of the other books take simpler approaches which are far easier to learn. That's where I would spend my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best logic games study tool","review":"This book offers the best explanations and tips to solve the various types of logic games found on the LSAT. I bought this book after going through both the Kaplan and Princeton Review LSAT prep books and found it to be the most thorough.The Powerscore book uses questions that have actually appeared on the LSAT. On the other hand, the Kaplan logic game practice questions were so unlike the ones on actual tests that it was actually detrimental to my studying.I highly recommend this review book! I just took the LSAT today and it definitely helped me improve my score!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book was labeled as in good condition. That is not the case at all, the front and back cover were completely trashed. The book is falling apart on the outside as well as has disgusting food particles that I have had to clean off. Inside the book it only gets worse. Every page is scribbled on and it is impossible to erase it all without taking away the actual text. I am completely disappointed and will never buy from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST LSAT book available","review":"I used this book as a supplement to the PowerScore classroom course, and I found the book more helpful than the actual course! When I began to work through the book my score was a 168, but I now score consistently in the 173-174 range. As I practice, I get even faster...the techniques really are superb. Just leave yourself enough time (2-3 weeks) to work through the book without rushing so that you can absorb each concept, and then leave at least 3 weeks to do your own practice, honing the techniques on actual LSATs. I've been working just the games section from one test each day, and then an entire test every 4th day.Unless you think the games are easy, this is the most important LSAT prep book you can buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"INSTEAD OF BUYING THIS, BUY MORE PRACTICE EXAMS","review":"Nothing at all in here that you can't figure out on your own after looking at a few practice tests. Your money would be MUCH better spent on additional practice exams. [1 star] is only because it seems that [0 stars] is not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"The Logic Games are the easiest part of the exam. They are the most simple and objective (compared to the utterly contrived reading problems), so why bother?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny!!!","review":"Before purchasing this book, I purchased both Kaplan and Princeton Review prep books and still SUCKED at the analytical reasoning/logic games section of the LSAT. I spent two weeks with this book and was able to complete every logic game accurately. I'm still working on the timing but at least I'm able to diagram the games and arrive at the correct answers, which is something I struggled with before. If you have difficulty w/ the logic games - this is the book for you!!!UPDATE: I still stand behind my recommendation of this book. I went through the book at least 3 times prior to taking the test and the results were amazing. I only missed 4 questions in the games section when I took the LSAT. That's pretty amazing for someone who started with 2% accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself $45","review":"This book will be a total waste of your money. It is over-priced and poorly written. Preparing LSAT with this book and taking a course given by Power Score are two different things. By the time you are done going through all the pages in this book, you will have so many rules in your head, in addition to the rules that you have to deal with when you actually try to solve the logic questions, you will be completely bogged down.Don't waste your money. Even more importantly, you will get a poor LSAT score if you use this book. Take my word for it. I used it for two months to prepare for the logic section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Basics","review":"This book is okay if you are totally bewildered by the games section. However, this book does not help much with timing. The book isn't good for preparing for games with few restrictive rules in them. The last few pages of the book is how newer games are constructed. Paradoxially the info is skimpy towards the end of the book. It seems like the book just needs to be updated and a little less self congratulating."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BOOK","review":"Five Words of Advice: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! I've read my share of books on the LSAT, and this is absolutely the worst. I feel that people would be better off buying any other book on this subject. I am a bright, nimble individual, quick on the uptake, and I read books on logic games and LSAT questions because I find them stimulating and enjoyable. Most of the time. In the process of reading this particular book, however, I felt as if my brain was being wrung out like a mop. The goal of such books should be to help people think clearly and score well on the LSAT, not to muddle their thinking, not to twist and tangle the fiber of their brains. Lord, it was painful for me, but I read this book all the way through, and I'm just thankful my wits are still intact. I'm slowly recovering from the ordeal, and as part of the healing process, I am writing this review so that others might not make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster for Prep","review":"You will wreck your chances on the LSAT if you follow the advice, and you will waste your prep time by reading it.

Avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for preparation","review":"This is a must have you can learn so much yourself pay attention to the contrapositive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Helpful","review":"I bought this book as well as the Powerscore Logical Reasoning Bible. The Logical Reasoning Bible was excellent and extremely helpful. On the LSAT I took, I got most of the Logical Reasoning questions correct. However, I found that the game book did not nearly prepare me enough for the LSAT. When I was in the test, I could not figure out any of the games and guessed at all 22 questions. Had I done better on this section, I would have scored really well on the test. I would suggest either supplementing this book with another book, or researching and purchasing an entirely different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book was not at all what I expected. As a member of middle management I was looking for suggestions on motivating employees on more of an individual basis. Most of the ideas in this book I felt need to be implemented by upper management throughout the entire organization. As supervisor of a small department, I do not have the resources or authority to implement these types of changes. Also, most of the ideas would only work in businesses with high customer contact. For those of us that work only within the organization, most of these ideas are not applicable."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books on the topic...","review":"This book is just okay. There are a lot of examples of how to improve morale at work, but the writing isn't that great, and the book isn't very well organized.

I was looking forward to reading about Rafe Stonebraker, who seemed to be the most mysterious and sexy of the trio, but was disappointed with the same old, same old.

Any books written by her always end up going home with me without even looking at the synopsis. I enjoyed this futuristic novel very much and even went searching for the other ones I missed. This iss the best one of her futuristic trillogy. The language of course made me wonder if she didn't feel very Dr. Suess-like when she made them up. I understood the reasoning for why such names as she went into the story, but still hard to say out loud without laughing and thinking a child's silly word play book was mixed in or not.

Sometimes, I just tread back to older artists and the songs they've recorded, because it is a little bit more used to in the back of the mind. That does come with Vanessa Williams and her soulful, elegant voice. Her single, Where Do We Go From Here?, is the signature song from the 1996 movie Eraser. The song just speaks out very well, and stands out well for what the song is all about. Although many people may not be interested in Vanessa's voice, as much as the people are more interested in Britney Spears, and other manufactured singers, this song is just beautiful. If you want to hear this one, get Vanessa Williams album Greatest Hits: The First Ten Years, and see where you go from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Just keeps getting Better and Better and Better !!!","review":"I'm not going to write a long review for this one.

A 5 star effort that really rocked and was full of monster hooks. Even the somewhat inane lyrics couldn't detract from the music. The inane lyrics are still here, but the hooks have gone AWOL. Still some rocking moments, but no memorable songs on this one. It almost sounds like they are trying way too hard despite having entered the studio without any worthwhile tunes.

And what follows is a funked-up hard rock and blues explosion. \\"Steppin' On\\" is trademark Glenn Hughes soul. The guitar grooves are just as intoxicating. The tempo changes and melody of \\"Monkey Man\\" really define the track. \\"You Got Soul\\" displays each members unique funk talents on their respective instruments. Hughes is backed-up by a faint acoustic guitar on the sad ballad \\"Frail.\\" Soft strings are added to elicit more sad emotions. As Glenn's feelings grow, so does the songs energy. The riffs are a little meatier on \\"Too High\\" but the soul is still running wild. \\"This is How I Feel\\" has a bass heavy Chili Peppers feel to it.The BadNothingThe VerdictGlenn Hughes reigns supreme as the king of hard rock, blues, and soul.

The plot is non-existent and the characters shallower than a puddle in your driveway. The financial aspects are poorly covered and hardly recognizable to someone with experience in financial jargon, and hopeless for the average reader.This is a novel that never gets started. Mr. Erdman may have tons more experience with Wall Street and high finance than me, but even as a lay person, I kept waiting for something to happen; even something that would make me feel real suspense........it never arrived.

I found myself reading this book so that I can finish it and pick up my next novel, not because it was interesting (I hate to leave anything unfinished). This could have been a much better book if the author had taken the time to give depth to his characters. It seems that he was more interested in establishing the scams and explain high-finance, which was interesting; however, the writing that put the story together left much to be desired.

This lively collection of tunes seems even more relevant today as the rest of the music world starts to catch up to where these artists were six years ago.

There are many air bubble pockets when applied to the iPAQ the first time which will contrast against the screen and is distracting to the eye. Even when using the plastic squeegee you will not easily remove the majority of the large air pockets. Then I removed and washed the screen with mild soap and reapplied with much better results. The plastic screen protector is very thick and looks like it will protect your LCD screen well, but does not compromise the use of a stylist or fingernail when selecting or writing on the LCD screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now Subtract One Star ...","review":"Bad. As a novelty collector of CDs by all-girl groups, I took a chance on the CD single of B*Witched as an experiment. Experiment failed. This is the most juvenile (instead of youthful), childish (instead of childlike) schlock of bubblegum that sticks to your brain like a tumor. The ridiculously wretched \\"B*Witched Go to the Moon\\" takes the cake, and while the actual *songs* are slightly better, one wonders why some corporate stooge in a stuffy office signed these girls to a record deal. Their looks? Sure. B*Witched is an insult to anyone's intelligence and is so bad, they make Barney look like Shakespeare. Next to B*Witched, the Spice Girls are the Beatles.

Masterful interweaving of traditional delta blues with modern urban blues and elements of soul and New Orleans all in a compelling mix that defies categorization and still sounds fresh thirty years later. Taj is one of those rare talents that combines influences in a way that sets him in a niche all by himself. He's just so amazingly earthy and soulful in such a unique and beguiling way and this record belongs in the pantheon of classic blues recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Natch'l Best","review":"For my money this is Taj's best album, and I've waited a long time for it on CD. It sounds glorious!!And the bonus tracks? \\"The Cuckoo (Alternate Version)\\" is okay (I think I still prefer the original) but the other two tracks, previously unreleased, are easily as good as anything on the album. \\"New Stranger Blues\\" in particular is a fabulous find, a long very cool slow groove with some great slide and dobro and Hammond. Might be my new favorite Taj tune! The other is a fast-tempo instrumental blues, also very cool.In all, a fine, fine reissue."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original take on the blues","review":"I've listened to the blues all of my life being lucky enough to grow up in a home full of people who loved music.In a genre such as the blues it's hard to be truly original. Taj and guitarist Jesse Ed Davis find a groove on this album that interprets this old and revered style of music in a personal and original way. This is Taj's finest work. The happy,country feeling he explores pours out through his vocals,his steel-bodied guitar and his fabulous harp playing. I also consider this to be the very best work of a gifted guitar player, Jesse Ed Davis. He's extremely mellow here,understated but feeling the groove and letting those feelings emanate from his axe. Give a listen to \\"She Caught the Katy\\" or \\"Ain't Nobody Gone Steal My Jellyroll\\". These songs have been done countless times but never before or since like Taj and Jesse do them here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Professional, Commercial, NO Passion","review":"There's lots of competent musicianship here but I keep waiting to hear the passion that the blues signify for me. The tunes are occasionally catchy but otherwise these songs smack of covers of songs that have been made more palatable for a mass audience. The originals say a lot about the African-American experience, this album appears to eliminated most of that identifying emotion. There is more soul and passion in John Hurt's Corinna, Corrina than in this whole album. I don't hear anything \\"natch'l\\" and I don't hear the \\"blues\\". If this album turns others on to wanting to hear authentic blues, then it will have served a purpose, otherwise it's just a precursor to someone like Keb Mo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"How to Make (the descendants of) Aztecs Angry\\"","review":"This is apparently the fourth book in a series that considers \\"teaching history\\" to be synonymous with promoting racist stereotypes about \\"people with unpronounceable names.\\" Sure, the Aztecs spent time on both ends of bloody conquests, but since when are genocide and enslavement topics for grade school humor?

It's part autobiography, as we learn about his early life, military career and initial foray into the jewelry business in Hawaii.The story really takes off when he does - journeying to far-off lands in search of exotic gemstones, often getting more than he bargained for.Primarily focusing on harvesting lapis lazuli out of Afghanistan, he navigates international politics, Pakistani border guards and Taliban warlords. Exciting stuff.And then when he finally gets out into the mountains, he has to mine the dusty Afghan ranges, mainly using dynamite to blast the lapis from rock.Great true-life adventure, if a tad meandering.

Best sax sounds come from 'Freezone' and 'Further Down the Road.' 'Beveled Edge' are uneven, detached rhythms. 'Compound' has a spiritual, yet spacy sound lots of synths and samplers work into this number. This album's driven on the heavy fusion jazz side and that's fine for all jazz enthuasists.

The album has a distinct jazz flavour.Fans of Jonah Sharp's music will be very pleased with this release as we know his music never stays the same. We always expect a change, album from album. On this album his fondness of Jazz comes to the fore, with some tracks being long jazzy jams with a veritable orchestra in the background.Another new direction for Sharp and another great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"visionary landscapes","review":"adventurous, visionary bits of ear candy to catalyze wonderful new neural arrangements.

But this album, from the songs, to the cover (which makes her look like a 50 year old rich debutant) does not showcase her talents.Her voice is good here, as always, but she seems removed from the music, and she sounds like she simply doesn't get what she's singing, which is very unusual for her. After a string of \\"trying to be modern\\" records, she gave up and went back to the 1985 Broadway Album, which won her the acclaim she had lost. She needs to stick with standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD at a Good Price","review":"I love this CD, and was pleased to receive it promptly, brand new and at a very good price.

The voice is Barbra's though, and therefore it's not the worst album ever made. But what she did to \\"A little help from my friends\\" is unforgivable. Only her version of \\"Alfie\\" by Bacharach stands the test of time and is a true classic. Only die hard fans will enjoy the campiness of this album..."},{"rating":"1","title":"crossroads in her career","review":"If there's one thing to say about this album it's that it's unusual - rather eclectic even; Regarding the two tracks 'Honey Pie' by the Beatles, and 'I get by with a little help from my friends', Neither song feels right on this disc.

I let the other eggs steam for an additional 20 minutes, and they still weren't hard set. The fun part was trying to scrub the egg off of the plastic with the holes in, it took me the better part of 30 minutes.I don't know whether this is the way all of these units are or if mine was defective.

Currently it is nearly impossible to dry this inlet completely without pushing a qtip or tissue through; and no, turning it upside down doesn't help since the inlet's curves are designed to keep water in. Cleaning this part is also near impossible for the same reason. This is just really stupid.Oster should spend more time testing their products. This should have been fixed before being released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat Healthy","review":"This steamer is great.

The water started to come to a boil but then the timer beeped an error signal and turned off. I added more water in case that was the problem, but it still did the same thing. The water got warm, but never got hot enough to start the steaming process. I had already tossed out the box it came in as I thought the product would work like my previous one. There wasn't even a receipt in the box for me to use for my return. It appears that I'll have to deal with the manufacturer with a warranty problem rather than with Amazon.

It's extremely convenient to use and it's much easier to clean than our old model was. I have only two complaints, and they are very minor. When the steamer is finished, the timer bell is a single quiet beep which is quite easy to miss. On the other hand, thanks to the keep warm function it's not as if the food is going to burn or get cold. We usually know how long the food is going to take anyway. Also, the cooking times printed on the steamer are not accurate. Although certain fresh vegetables are supposed to cook in 15 minutes, we find that it takes more like 30. All the same, we are very pleased with the steamer and would buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE the idea...","review":"I really wanted a steamer! So when I received this one for Christmas, I was so excited. Until, that is, I examined it further.It's made w/ a #7 plastic (usually polycarbonate), commonly found inbaby bottles, microwave ovenware, eating utensils, and plastic coating for metal cans.Reason why it's BAD: Made with biphenyl-A, a chemical invented in the 1930s in search for synthetic estrogens. A hormone disruptor. Simulates the action of estrogen when tested in human breast cancer studies. Can leach into food as product ages.I called Oster and spoke w/ a supervisor, and specifically asked whether he could confirm the product was BPA free. He could not. He also told me to do what I would like w/ the info he gave me - either keep and use the appliance, or return it. I'll be doing the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"23 reviews so far, and all 5 stars! This is a great product!","review":"I'm a single 47 year old guy. I'm not a great cook. I've lost 25# (am now down to 168) and am trying to eat better. This makes it easy! No more nuking junk food, or frying food covered in fat, just steam it. No more worries about burning things (the smoke detector used to be my warning that dinner was done). I bought the Oster 5712 last week. I've cooked boiled eggs, frozen chicken breast, Contessa stir fry frozen oriental dinners and frozen fish in it so far. It rocks! Tonight I'm going to cook diced chicken breast and wild rice with seasonings in it and I'm 99.9% sure it will turn out great even though I've never tried it before. This baby makes cooking easy. Cleaning it is also easy. No burnt food on it, just hot water. For cleaning it's almost like is has already been soaking in hot dishwater. Just a bit of soap and spray it off.

Use the smaller \\"egg basket\\" on the bottom and the larger basket on the top to steam more than one thing at a time and you can cook two things at once without using your stove.Just use caution and a pot holder when removing the lid to avoid a painful and nasty steam burn.

I use it at least 4 times a week and I no longer have to microwave veggies or steam in the too small steamer basket inside of a pot. I love that you can steam multiple foods with the different size steamer bowls. The rice bowl steams white rice perfectly, but I can not seem to get brown rice right, the alloted time according to the directions are not nearly long enough, and when I add extra time the brown rice comes out over cooked. Either way, this is a great product and I highly recommend to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steamer","review":"It is a nice steamer at a good price but it appears to be a little cantankerous about the water level.

I dropped some of the parts of the original and after 12+ years they cracked. This one works at least as well as the older model. My main criticism is the LCD display. It is small and non illuminated. With aging eyes and bifocals it is difficult to read. So I have to make a personal adjustment and down rated by one star for that. Some reviewers have criticized the ability to empty the heating water fully. I don't seem to have any issue with that. Once the cooker is done and we eat the food I simply turn the base unit upside down over the sink and dump the water. A twist or shake or two and the water seems to drain. The unit is still warm and any residual drops of water will evaporate."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good steamer","review":"This steamer works very good.

There is no way to clean the external fill compartment.This unit defines an over designed product. I must concede that the really great part about the see-through water level indicator is that you can see when mold starts growing in there.

It's a perfect item to have for steaming veggies and the egg boiler is great. I love the texture of chicken breast when using the bottom tray. Also, it does keep food warm for quite awhile, so need to worry about pushing a reheat button or anything like that. I'm not too fond of the rice cooker, especially for long grain rice. If you have a rice cooker, use that instead. The only true downside is cleaning the bottom tray.

It heats up very quickly--it continuously takes a small amount of water to boil. Unlike the traditional steamer, the whole pot of water has to boil before any steaming can be done. This electronic steamer only takes second to produce steam. It is very efficient. It also has a drip pan so that the water in the reservoir is not contaminated. There is an external water fill system which is very handy- just add water as it is steaming. If a prolong steaming is required, one might want to check on the drop tray--making sure the drip tray does not overflow into the reservoir where the heating element is. The digital display is a plus- two buttons, up and down (for the timer). Only reason not giving a five star is because of the smaller tray with the egg holders. The little indentations are difficult to wash by hand. Overall it is a very good teamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real shame...","review":"I initially was not sure how much use I would get out of a food steamer so I bought this product because it was well-reviewed and affordable. But in the three months or so that I've been using it, I've gotten a lot of use out of it and I credit it with eating healthier overall. So why the low rating? Well because it just died on me for no reason. I didn't drop it or submerge it in water or anything like that but it refuses to turn on nonetheless. Otherwise, it's well-designed and did its job admirably (just not long enough).

I made a Thai type of dinner with fresh local shrimp, frozen mixed veggies, and jasmine rice.The device was also a no brainer to use and had a nice capacity.My only disappointment was in trying to make rice using the two tier method. The only way this works is to steam the rice in the upper compartment and they tell you to steam it in the lower. The upper seems to work but takes a real lot longer. The rice tray fits into the lower compartment fine, but you can only put the lid on it and not the upper container as the ears on the rice container stick up too much to allow the upper compartment to fit on top. I guess the workaround is to try and find a container that will fit, but this seems to be a serious design fault unless they think that the rice would get contaminated by some drippings from above.....when you are going to serve the stuff all together anyway, dont see how that would matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and Disappointing","review":"I bought this after reading the reviews but I am totally Disappointed by this item.

It's extremely frustrating that it isn't better implemented. As many are trying to increase their intake of fresh vegetables, this product makes it so much easier. The downsides are - It appears to be made with a polycarbonate plastic which contains BPA and I'm assuming it contains that. The other complaint is that the water reservoir leaks all over the counter. I'd be thrilled to pay $80.00 for this product or more if it were just made better. The timer and keep warm features are great. Vegetables have never tasted so good or been more convenient.

It says for 8 eggs, but you can put more than that in there by shoving some against the edges. I'm on my second one (first one I had for 7 years). The only reason I had to replace it was the vent holes near the handles cracked over time and caused the handles to essentially fall off the lid (don't know if this was from the dishwasher or from heavy use). Given that, it was either replace the lid (for $15) or replace the whole thing for $35. I am happy with it given I use this weekly (for 7 years) to hard boil eggs.

I just like the way these two people were able to find love for the second time around. With Peter losing his wife and rasing his kids, With Mel having to rasie her twins girls by herself when the twins father ran out on her, to find someone in a different state and to hold on the love that they have and figture out where to go from there it's like your are taking a ride along with them to find the journey that they hope to find together as a family, and what a journey it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changes by Danielle Steel","review":"This was a good book as all Danielle Steele books are; but not one of her better ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I think that this book was very interesting and I liked it very much.

I forced myself to finish it because I kept telling myself that it had to get better, but it didn't. The writing is sophmoric and repetitive and the storyline is very predictible. The main characters were very unlikable... Mel is a wimp and puts her needs and the needs of her step-children above the needs of her own children.

The music is a little Black Sabbath, a little Judas Priest but there is something more here. There is a feeling that you get when you listen to early Mercyful Fate, something that cannot be explained, you just have to listen to the music to understand. Another thing that sets this band apart from others like Black Sabbath and Judas Priest is King Diamond's voice! Ozzy's voice is okay, and I do believe that Halford's is amazing but King Diamond is a God on the mic! The tracks sound amazing and you can't beat the price for these two great albums. My only complaint is that they should have added lyrics and pictures, but if your a fan of true metal, power metal, black metal or NWOBHM you'll love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Cuban Trovadour","review":"Pedro Luis Ferrer is not a simple guitarist.

My issue is that it is very awkward. I believe a lot of this is due to being a lefty. The extension bar for measuring is not in a place that works well for me. This would be okay if I could flip the cutter around, but because the bar that holds the paper in place only raises on one end, it makes it awkward no matter how I turn it.So, righties, this one is a good one for you.

It's like arm work out! Also the paper really doesnt stay still unless you hold on to the paper by the cutter. The ruler that extends out is very stiff to put in and out of the cutter. I've tried cutting different types of paper but it only cuts the thin papers well and once you get into the thicker scrapbooking papers it wont cut well.

Second issue is that the water has no where to go - so unless you drill some holes in the bottom of these they will get too heavy and fall through into the barrel. Our solution was to get a block from home depot - like the ones used for block walls. Put it under the liner to hold it up. Then drilled a few holes in the liner so they could drain.

If that's how you feel then this album should get no consideration from you. There's no happy ending here.And will someone please tell the guy to quit trying to sing???

The awful remix of \\"Gravity of Love\\" should've been replaced with the sweet, jazzy remix on the \\"Turn Around\\" single. \\"Mea Culpa\\"'s remix should've been the Orthodox Version that is on the song's video (no one can get this mix otherwise!).

Everything I knew and did not know, I found in detail in this book by Jonas.You will find the background on the history of Gnosticism in Alexandria; history on its development; the various contributors (e.g. Babylon, Syria, Greek), the various \\"systems of thought\\" (eg Valentinian) and their proponents; and a bit of philosophy on Metaphysics.The excerpts and quotations from ancient Gnostic sources like the Mandaeans tracts and Manichaean books are very helpful and exciting. It is well structured and very easy to follow!A disadvantage is that it tends to overlook the influence of ancient Egyptian mythology of the after-death (regarding the journey of the soul after death), which influeced Gnosticism profoundly! Also it does not mention the Cathars and Catharism. But this should detract nothing from the book, it is a classic and a masterpiece on Gnosticism!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing intro","review":"Reading Jonas is always a pleasure; the way he divides and presents the field is still useful, despite the many discoveries that have occurred since book's publication.Most useful for people with a philosophical background: while (excepting the final chapter) the book is in no way 'philosophy,' Jonas thinks like a philosopher; he brings Gnostic figures and myths into a kind of dialogue with philosophy (especially Stoicism)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've Should've Would've Been A Five Star Book If Only,..","review":"It is an informative book, and is written in a fairly engaging manner. It has relatively few typos. It is, however, also rather bigoted at points.

Construction workers with heavy boots were able to slip these on and they appreciated not having to take their boots off to get into the house. The bad news is that the covers frequently tore when they were taken off (about 1/2 the time), so don't count on re-using them.

Davey Havok's vocals take some time to get used to, but when they do you wouldn't want them to change at all. He's a lyrical poet in songs like God Called In Sick Today and Clove Smoke Catharsis. Their guitarist is the single most orginal guitarist in the whole punk genre and never fails to impress me with his riffs. And Hunter is the most underrated bassist ever.Now only if some other punk bands would try something new, the genre wouldn't be anywhere near as boring as it is today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Sails Prevails","review":"Absolutely excellent cd.

I began listening to them more, and got a hold of Black Sails on the Sunset. I found it interesting and exciting, but just slightly boring. It was a change from the punk rock i was used to (Blink 182, The Vandals, Guttermouth, ect.) but almost all the songs sound the exact same. Several Songs like \\"Narritive of SOuls AGainst Souls\\" and \\"God Called in Sick Today\\" rise above the noisy pattern.

It has much more to do with stepping outside of the structuralism and moralism of feminism, to get a different perspective. It's also a great model for students, who will benefit from seeing a top scholar do close readings of important texts. I appreciate that while Halley is trading in big and often complex ideas, she writes to reveal and is very readable. I got a lot out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"selective and elitist","review":"What sounds like an intriguing book falls flat upon reading it. Halley's version of feminism is an elite and whitewashed feminism that has been under attack for 25 years. Her critique is nothing new. By positing her definition of feminism, Halley exposes her own ignorance, particularly of the central place women of color have in feminism. What's also frustrating is the complete lack of political efficacy in her argument. She completely avoids issues of reproductive rights, which are central to feminism. She attacks feminism on the ivory tower theory level (which just so happened to have helped get her, and other female professors, her job) but completely ignores the other side of feminism: activism. Halley's book was dated when it was published and does more harm than good. To critique feminism, she needs to use a fuller, more accurate, and contemporary definition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical","review":"I've found this to be very useful as I'm still a rather middling beginner with Arabic script and verb conjugations.

I can't comment on whether this book contains errors, but I have found a lot of phrases and terms that have been helpful and which also agree with the modest vocabulary I already know. If you don't know the Arabic script or don't know it well, this will be useful in accessing words and phrases to fill out your speech. It's not exhaustive by any means, and it you may find that it doesn't make use of the broad range of dialectic differences across 17 Arabic speaking countries, but there aren't many like it.

A few things still mystify me, such as where the reference line in a Pareto plot comes from.

This movie should of gone straight to video. The entire movie's plot had nothing to do with Steve Erwin, other than the fact that he happens to stumble along the satelite info. near the end of the movie. The rest of the movie, it just shows Steve and Terri finding animals, and some CIA agent looking for the satellite. It was more like the t.v. show than anything else.

If you like the Crocodile Hunter and Crocodile Hunter Diaries you should enjoy this film.Why, if I like it so much, do I only give it 4 stars? I'm trying to be fair - it's a good movie but certainly not a great movie. I don't feel that giving it 5 stars would be realistic. Do I recommend it? Yes, especially if you have kids (although adults will enjoy it as well). Do I hope it's a success? Yes again.

Then there was also the part when he calmed down the biggest snake in Austrailia!! WOO!! It was amazing!!!!! I th ink the biggest reason that this movie is great was because of Steve Irwin himself!! Well I hope I convinced you into buying this great film!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, and want to see it again.

God Bless You..........."},{"rating":"2","title":"THRILLED!","review":"I am a fanatic about The Crocodile Hunter. I love Steve & Terri and was thrilled when the movie came out. I even took my 3 year old (who is a HUGE croc fan) and he lasted through the whole thing without moving a muscle. To see anyone who can be as passionate as they are about what they do is very uplifting to me. There was comedy and action and very suitable for all ages of the family which is really hard to come by these days. I will anxiously be waiting for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I was unimpressed with the novel as a whole. There is some interesting information on the A-bomb development and history but the characters are rather bland. We never really understand the fascination the husband, priest and Kavan all have with Eleanor b/c the description of her is so weak. She is just a generic heroine/female protagonist that we are supposed to care about b/c she paints presumably yet the paintings themselves, as another reviewer writes, are never adequately described for the reader to appreciate or understand. The characterization of Kavan is better but having all these famous incidental people in the background of the story, doing nothing, kind of reminds me of pointless cameos in movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"I've worn out 2 albums of this.

And, yes the sexual chemistry is another reason I love her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tired to like this book","review":"Maybe back in the 90's the love scences in this story were considered hot but they are so tame compared to a basic biology book. Not one of Brenda Jackson's best work in my opinion. I know the plot reasons for romance book weddings can be totally unreal but this is definitely one of em. Woman who loves kids so much, she was named Teacher of the Year agrees to give her's up to save a company - yeah right. Man who thinks his mother was coldhearted towards him doesn't see his plan as just as coldhearted - he needed to see a shrink with his issues.I can see why this is not more or less out of print...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A challenge named Sterling","review":"What a challenge for Colby Wingate to accept the proposition of this superstar actor Sterling Hamilton.Have his child and after leave it to him.But she has an another idea justified by the love she feels for this man.

So, it was so emotional to read the way she turned this wild man in a man full of tenderness and compassion that I thought that it will be wonderful if it was a true to life story.This story deals with importance of family and respect for LOVE.I appreciated very much this book and the author has a great talent.

So needless to say that this book lives up to your expectations and then some. You will be pleased with this selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BELIEVABLE","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. I have read all of Brenda Jackson's books, I love the Madaris family stories. This story made Colby look like a weak female that knew right from wrong but she was willing to sacrafice that for the love of a man, not so much to save her brother's company. How could she agree to act as a vessel to carry this baby she contracted to give up in a year. She is suppose to be an advocate for children, but she was willing to birth a child for this selfish man just because he wanted an heir, what about the well being of the child. You don't sacrafice a baby to save a company, YOU FIND ANOTHER WAY TO SAVE A COMPANY. We as women should not be in awe of any man that we will do anything to be with him. NOT A GOOD MESSAGE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulled me in from the first page!!","review":"When I read the summary for this book, I thought -- what kind of weak woman would ever agree to give up her baby like that?! I don't care how fine and rich the brother is! However, Colby is not weak at all. Even though she signed the contract, she had every intention of remaining a permanent part of her baby's life (she just didn't tell Sterling). To me, that redeemed her character. Sterling was hurt deeply as a child and he thought the best way to not be hurt again was to not get emotionally involved with any woman. I loved the way Colby didn't back down from his snippy remarks and commands. She held her own and he couldn't help but fall in love.All in all this is a great read. It only took me about a day and a half to finish. So far, I still like Eternally Yours and Fire and Desire the best, but this one is definately up there too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is wonderful","review":"I absolutely love this book. I was drawn in since the very first page. This book should be more popular cause it is truley a good book. I read this book 2 times and still want to read it again.

The film was beautifully shot with some real great camera work but quite simply does not work at all. The tone is all wrong for the script or the script is all wrong for the tone. Its like Airplane meets the 3 stooges meets I dunno what? The major plus is that Bruce Campbell has a supporting role as the sleazy \\"Renaldo\\" and is AMAZING.

The prison scenario is cliche. The horror aspect was more of a joke. Not bad enough to be in the Ed Wood category, and not good enough to pass as worthwhile entertainment. This is part of a 20 Horror DVD set available at Wal Mart for $5.00.

The computer is decently priced but the applications are not all integrated with the MS MediaCenter. The MC application is often buggy and often crashes. It also makes use of additional external apps very hard. The motherboard on mine was faulty and made the computer unable to reboot after 2 weeks. Even the front bezel was defective. I noticed that the same problem was noticeable on demos in stores. Also, don't expect external soundcard or video card to be compatible...i learned it the hard way with my creative card.To top all this, HP Support is mediocre at best. They ask you to ship them your computer and return it back to you a week later with no comments, no names of repair person, and even in my case missing parts that got stolen. You won't know what they tried to repair and just hope they didn't wipe your hard disk for no reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book...

However, if you're willing to put in the requisite time and effort, you will find one of the best books on \\"complex\\" sales ever written.

Part of successful selling stems from a natural talent. Some individuals could sell snow shoes to desert dwellers; they are, indeed, born with such a special gift. For others, the task is not always an easy one.

This new edition adheres to the authors' axiom of changing to be successful in a competitive world. The techniques and processes of thinking strategically about a particular sales cycle will sharpen the focus of both veteran and novice sales teams or individual sales people. There is also a Miller-Heiman training course that is a great follow-up to reading this book.

Someone who is mentally retarded could write better music than this crap.Perhaps people just take a look and see that Lil' Jon is contributing, and therefore by some form of amazing grace the song will suddenly breathe life, but in this case, there is nothing inspiring about this song other than a sudden will for suicide.

As the story develops, you see cool plots but are somewhat puf off by the fact that one of the bad guys appears to be going to evil without any reason whatsoever. The introduction of some icnonic characters into novels would satisfy your curiosity - it is done very skillfully. The plot develops well and keeps you to the pages. It is reminiscent of some of the early books in the Forgotten Realms, adding the flavor of being written by 2 of the Greatest Realmsian writers - Greenwood and Cunningham.

I don't know why they don't bring this out on DVD, but I guess because maybe many other folks didn't like it. I personally foundPalance's Ebenezer a true genuine difference in this telling of the old Christmas Classic. It is superb; sometimes a bit hammy, but I guess the rest of thecast decided to have some fun in their respective roles.

My skin sometimes feels a bit itchy with the medication, but that's due more to the drying out of the skin than anything, so it's tolerable. I actually changed to applying it once every other day, instead of once a day because it was drying out certain parts of my face too much (but no worries, that was easily fixed with a lotion).Overall I am seeing results with this product and after almost 2 weeks of use I definitely feel that my acne is clearing up bit by bit.

If you do not do this it will dry your skin out and will also leave white smudge marks all over your face.Remember, this is NOT meant to be used as a face cream/lotion, use it sparingly and only in areas that you need it.

If they're very young, you can draw the details, but if they can hold a pencil, they can probably add the simple shapes and forms to make their own pictures.The more drawing I do with kids, the more I realize how these books develop skills. They're a perfect gradient for youngsters just sitting down to draw. The books tell them what shapes to add, and it's a matter of duplicating those shapes in the right places--a skill one needs for more realistic drawing.This is a great starter for a series of books that your kids will enjoy for years and will give them a comfort level and basic skill set they can use to make more sophisticated drawings later, if they want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love LOve LOve","review":"This is such a sweet book that we ( kids and i ) all love. its very inspiring for all types of fun projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and clever ideas!","review":"This book has some VERY cute and clever ideas.

You have a clear picture why some art is considered valuable, while some is not.Carol Duncan's book delves into the reasons why we have art museums and then focusses in on some notable museums of today.

It has all the faults of the original scan such as underlined words, plus some defects of their own printing process added. Also the binding appears to be just glued together.The publisher states that \\"This important reprint was made from an old and scarce book. Therefore, it my have defects such as missing pages, erroneous pagination, blurred pages, missing text, poor pictures, markings, marginalia and other issues beyond our control.\\" This information should have been made available before purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...a faultless piece to see...\\"","review":"With a small quote from Alexander himself as the title I clearly state my approval! His works are unlike anything I have read in early English Literature. His very original attitude and way of speaking his mind makes him who he is. A must read for any reader who wants to be entertained!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly disappointing","review":"I bought this anthology based on the two positive reviews from other purchasers. Four stars seemed like a pretty good recommendation. However, I received the book yesterday and was fairly disappointed. Many of the songs are quite poorly done, and all of them are much too simple. Big Yellow Taxi, for instance, has several chords that are clearly not correct and sound nothing like the \\"real\\" version. I thought Circle Game was the best rendition overall, but other than that, I wouldn't bother purchasing this. I have not bought any other Joni Mitchell book, but if this is the best out there, then I think I've just discovered a niche in the market....I'll be off writing my own, and accurate, version of these songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Inaccurate Transcriptions","review":"Don't fall victim to the falsely positively rated reviews. Though somewhat comprehensive, the transcriptions featured in this anthology are blatantly inaccurate and do not directly reflect Ms.Mitchell's beautiful songwriting capabilities. River, my favorite, is horribly off, using a major C chord for the beginning piano solo. Do not bother purchasing, unless you want to rip your ears off each time you attempt playing these transcribed \\"versions\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why you're not happy with the chords....","review":"The reason for the above reviewer's disappointment in the chords of the Joni Mitchell books is easy to explain; They are not the original chords. Why? Because Joni has had no formal training and has literally made her own tuning up as she goes along. That's why it sounds so refreshingly dreamy and unique. It's like tuning to an open D: notice how frequently she plays chords by just barring the fret board from ABOVE...not reaching around the neck from under neath? Bear in mind that SOME of her books will actually take the trouble to diagram each tuning for each song. Most though, do not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like adopting a child without legs...","review":"This is great. I've always wanted to know how to play Carey, (I'm) Don Juan's Reckless Daughter, Big Yellow Taxi, River, and other great Joni Mitchell songs.But guess what? My two absolute favorites, \\"Blue\\" and \\"The Last Time I Saw Richard\\" are both absent. Oh well. Get it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another \\"Blame the Victim\\" Book...","review":"Not sure why people like Dionisi miss this important point (perhaps criticizing the Bush Administration is just to tempting to pass up?), but the reason 9/11 occurred isn't U.S. foreign policy or George Bush's obvious stupidity...it's religion. If you choose to read this book, contrast it with something by Christopher Hitchens and get a feel for what it leaves out. Yes, Bush and his cronies are after oil. Yes, U.S. foreign policy needs to be changed. But, bin Laden and his gang of thieves are motivated by a typical Muslim hatred of all things non-Muslim. This book provides a one-sided, myopic view of a very complex issue, and manages to do something that is all too common with today's liberals...it blames the victim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis SACD/DVD 1983-1998 Box Set","review":"Awesome box set, amazing quality.

This book is very easy to read for those who do not normally read for leisure. This book is filled with good ideas and truly has the feeling that the author wants what is best for her readers. You get the feeling that she wants you to succeed and free with her. This book is a must read if you have found yourself or if someone you know has sunken into poverty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for CEO's that are investing in IT","review":"Tremendous read. Mr.Liautaud carefully builds a foundation that allows the reader to understand the technological issues presently facing his, as well as most business. The power of this learning is difficult to calculate in exact value for the executive, but it is significant. At the same time the author, using a number of methodologies including well constructed case situations, helps the reader develop/create significant competitive advantage in acting on this information in his own business. This is a very interesting, engaging, well written book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hundred of pages of bromides","review":"I cannot believe I was reading the same book as the other reviewers.The book reads like a several hundred page marketing brochure chock full of commonplace, superficial thinking. Nowhere is there criticism of technology. Nowhere is there any thinking about the limits of this technology. Nowhere is there any insight on how to manage human beings so they use this technology intelligently.In fact, in a perverse kind of way, the book describes technology in a way that you think the techology is more suitable to more stuctured, settled world of non-e business rather than the up for grabs environment of the e-business world."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD","review":"VERY GOOD EXPLANATION OF THE E-BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE CONCEPTS, GOOD EXAMPLES OF ACTUAL APPLICATIONS AND AN INTERESTING ROADMAP INTO ITS FUTURE.

You'll find the reviews for this book, including mine, very polarized. I believe it has a lot to do with your BI product bias. This book was written by a Business Objects executive. It doesn't take a scientist to figure out where the author is coming from. Fortunately I can say I didn't pay for the book, it was given to me by a Business Objects sales rep. Otherwise I would have been even more disappointed.The book does offer sound generalization of concepts so it's not a total loss if you're just getting into the technology. On the other hand, if you're looking for real strategy and implementation best practices, there are better resources available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough details to be useful","review":"I found this book to be very weak in details and concepts. It's easy to say that companies need business intelligence and throw around some very vague and general facts and examples. And that's what this book does. The case studies offer no details at all. If you've never heard of e-business or intelligence (basically if you've been living in a cave) then this book will introduce the topic at a high level. But if you're looking for more information you'd better look some place else. I know the author is the founder of Business Objects, but I just expected more from this book and was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Code of Conflict","review":"Sorry,but I cannot recommend this book. I was given a copy to read, as I am a retired Naval Officer and the person who gave it to me thought I might like it. I didn't.The story line is unrealistic, there are more errors of fact than I could count, and if the author has any Naval experience it certainly wasn't evident in his writings.I am hapy that I didn't have to pay for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch!","review":"Puerile. The first word that came to mind. Followed closely by- why the hell did I spend good money on this junk? Badly edited, poorly written, and a terrible storyline out of sync with current geo-political realities and punctuated by a very poor knowledge of the strategic and military environment in the Indian sub-continent. If you're looking for military thrillers, look elsewhere- at least go to an author who gets the names of countries right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this book!","review":"It's too bad that Amazon requires you to give at least one star, in reality it doesn't deserve any. This is one of the most ridiculous novels ever written. In the book, India (already a poor nation that only spends 2.5% of its GDP on the military) attacks Bangladesh. That's exactly what India needs, another 150 million mouthes to feed. And that's only of the utterly moronic sequence of events that takes place in the story. This guy is a Tom Clancy wannabe. I suggest you keep searching and find a story that's more original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Techno-Thriller but Theme Frightening!","review":"The action and suspense are excellent...keep you hooked. The theme concerns a conflict between the Navies of the US and India. I had always felt India is the kind of country that doesn't go out looking for trouble and also that India and Bangladesh are, well, friendly. But the author actually describes the Indian military using nuclear weapons on neighboring Bangladesh which I found very disturbing. Some events such as the escape from Rhode Island and a single, crippled US warship taking on an entire Indian CBG by itself seem to be a little out of class for this class of novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Code of Conflict","review":"Skipped around some to start, but tied in very well. You could really feel for the characters! Overall a very good read !"},{"rating":"1","title":"The author showcases his lack of knowledge","review":"This book was a disappointment. I wasn't expecting much, but the writing is at a low standard and is not fit for publishing. It was a boring read and I now know what to expect from Mobley. Sorry I wasted even a dime on this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"LACKS OF LOGIC, REALISM AND KNOWLEDGE","review":"The book is poorly return and clearly exhibit the lack of Authors knowledge and logic about the region in question. One of the Major country Involved Bangladesh is wrongly refereed as Bangal (a state within India) and Bangali. The book is usual portrayal of mighty good forces fighting against unprofessional, foolish villain. The novel goes against the logic of current world order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeing demons where none exist","review":"As an Indian-American, I am totally disappointed with this book. Apart from terrible typos, the book also suffers from terrible imagination. At a time when the relationship between India and US is getting better, the trade is growing and they are both getting closer in terms of their world-perspectives, the author's attempts to paint India as villian is not just inexplicable, but downright dishonest. He does the world a disservice by painting one-sixth of humanity as bad guy. If you must buy this, do so to laugh at the author. Also keep in mind that characters and storyline are figment of the author's demented imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Lie","review":"I've owned this product for a couple of years now. It is the drum for my Brother HL-1040. Brother has a nice setup where you purchase the toner cartridges separate from the drum. According to Brother, the drum prints 20,000 sheets before it needs replacing. So, you get 20,000 sheets and then you can either spend the $160 on a new drum, or just buy a new printer.Let me say that if you get 5,000 printed sheets from this drum you are doing better than most people. Brother lies to their customers when they claim this drum produces 20,000 printed sheets....it just doesn't happen. And at those prices for a replacement? These are deceptive claims that try to justify the price on a new drum.This product should be avoided if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother, is this worth it?","review":"I decided not to buy the replacement drum, because the first drum only lasted for a few thousand pages, about a year. It is almost as cheap to buy a new laser printer, but it won't be a Brother. The drums wear out too fast. I have bought three brothers and each one was worse than the last. I am going to give Samsung a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother Printers are CR@P","review":"Have had a Brother HL-1020 printer for about 10 years now, and had to replace the drum unit on it on average after 3000 - 4000 sheets. Was shocked to see that Brother rates their drums at 20,000 sheets ~ cause that's a load of crock. The last drum I bought has only lasted 2000+ sheets, and its starting to leave blank spots on the print pages. I was going to replace the drum again, but I think I will just run this printer till it dies, then junk it. Will probably NEVER buy Brother again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommended by Lonely Planet travel guide to Egypt.","review":"Lonely Planet travel guide recommends this book for insight into a period of politics in Egypt.

The soundtrack includes singing from Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, and Martin Short which is actually really good. A couple songs were written by Randy Newman. Then there is the wonderful classic westernscore by Elmer Bernstein. After reading the liner notes I found out he scored classic westerns like the Magnificant Seven and John Wayne movies as well. My only complaint is some of the scores are too short, like under 3 minutes. I wish they let them go a bit longer because they flow so well. My 2 favorites on this are the \\"My little Buttercup\\" and \\"Blue Shadows\\" both well made and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tea, Good Price","review":"I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea).

In fact, I think it would be wonderful for that.I never have used it for meditation as I do that in silence. I can see easily how this CD could be used for that with great success, but if like some of the others you are looking specifically for a meditation CD I'd suggest shopping around. I believe, however, that anyone who meditates would be delighted to have this music in their collection.

Get this if you are a beginning teacher!","review":"This is a wonderful book designed for grades 2-6. It is broken down into strategies for each step of the writing process. The best part is the chapter on mini-lessons. The mini-lessons are on creating an opening that grabs attention, adding details, changing verbs to action verbs, using dialogue, showing how characters feel, organizing paragraphs, and using figurative language. The book also has a helpful chapter on fun strategies to get kids to revise their writing.

He was unrepeatable and unforgettable. No one else sounds much like him, although I have a George Russell recording where Russell (more known as an arranger than a soloist) betrays some influence.Monk is most known for his quartets, but this is a big band setting with multi-layered and swinging arrangements by Oliver Nelson. Yet Monk is still Monk: the use of space, always playing the melody, the long, inimitable arpeggios, the percussive sensibility, the serious playfulness and earnestness without being precious or pretentious.Yes, Monk tended to play the same tunes repeatedly at this point in his career, but these renditions shine, nevertheless.

The movies were excellent, the books are a miserable waste of time.The plotlines in the two movies aren't anything like those in the books.

With a similar plot engine to Coogan's earlier The Parole Officer - man suspected of a crime he didn't commit has to use his clients to save him - it's the kind of US film Peter Sellers might have made during the early 70s lull in his career and which you'd expect to see on an airplane.

Previous reviewers mentioned grammatical errors but I thought I would be able to overlook them. I was wrong. Note to author, editor and proof reader - when you use the word \\"guest\\" that implies one person and if you are speaking about two or more the word \\"guests\\" is used. The \\"s\\" at the end of the word guests implies a plural (more than one guest). Hopefully that is enough said about that. The dialogue was quite basic and not much detail.

It made me nauseous.It was so bad, I couldnt get past the errors to lose myself in the story and I am really unsure how anyone else could, unless this is the state to which our english language has deteriorated.I seriously debated writing to the publishing company and offering my services as an editor, thats how distracting the grammatical errors and poor writing were.I will NOT be buying another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The quality is terrible","review":"The quality is terrible.

It will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it.There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epi Gig Bag","review":"I returned the bag.

I don't know how many girls play soccer in those. She isn't exactly wearing shin guards either, more like holey knee socks. They do match her cletes though. The ball is probably a size three, (way below standard size.)Since she is still in the box, I would have to take a guess at her durability. Her overall frame seems strong, just her hair seems pretty delicate; it can easily get frazzeled.Overall, I think this doll is hot. Her soccer uniform is co ordinated and she does have the basic gear. Her make-up is pretty and her bag makes her appear as very professional.

There are definitely highlights, especially the new version of \\"Quittin' Time.\\" But it seems to me that Chapin couldn't decide whether to do an album of live tracks, lesser-known songs or copies of her older hits -- so instead she did a little of each. That just makes the collection come off as schizophrenic. Amid the interesting new material, the familiar versions of songs like \\"Passionate Kisses\\" and \\"He Thinks He'll Keep Her\\" feel flat and boring, without any particular reason to be on the album. I applaud Chapin's desire to do a \\"different\\" sort of greatest hits album, but I wish she'd been consistent in giving her fans material they don't already own or hear on the radio every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does not get any better than this","review":"What a great idea. mixing new works with live recordings and special recordings.

She may be a \\"media darling\\", and has her fans for sure, but her abilities are quite pedestrian. So little here is noteworthy that it is hard to know where to start, but the \\"live\\" tracks are a misnomer. If she has any strenghts, it is in the studio with her very strong band. As a solo performer, I doubt that she could keep an audience's attention in a venue larger than a coffeehouse for more than three songs.

Otherwise, it is just a dust collector. The live versions of her songs (albeit the \\"Can't Take Love for Granted\\" live version) are just terrible.

If the body of the was even 1/4\\" larger in length or width, it wouldn't fit. It's a tighter fit than necessary to keep the guitar from rattling around, and probably doesn't protect the guitar quite as well as it would if the fit was just a little looser.The internal compartment is big enough to hold a few sets of strings, picks, and a string winder.

With that album, they stepped it up a notch. With \\"The Paramour Sessions\\", they stepped it up another notch. This album embodies exactly what I look for in a rock album. It's sincere; and after reading about the experience the band had while recording the album in the mansion, you can clearly see that in the music on the CD. This album doesn't have any real radio friendly songs on it, like GAWM did, but that surely doesn't take away from the album at all. In fact, it only adds to the album, since these songs were written with sincerity, and not for the almighty dollar. Great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"GO BUY INFEST, IF YOU LIKE MTV PUNK THEN BUY THIS.","review":"What the hell has Papa Roach done? That is all I have to say.

I am with the fan from Gainesville,FL it is a disgrace to No Limit and Master P.

I still got love for NO Limit though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is a disgrace to NO LIMIT","review":"I was pretty excited when I heard this CD was coming out, but I now realize what a joke No Limit is turning out to be.

Rap su**s nowadays. I listen to the rap of ten years ago (including: NWA, Public Emeny, Beastie Boys), then listen to today's rap.

Now, lets discuss ten years ago. 1989. Some rap was so-so. Like NWA...the first two tracks. Public Enemy....we can't be stopped. Beastie Boys.....the whole album boyeee! Now, theres (ugh) this \\"music\\". I agree with bolsy32@aol.com (review for Pauls Boutique): Rap (most of it) is talentless noise.

Next to other talentless rappers as Full Blooded, etc. The best tracks on here were the last couple, they were just instrumentals of P's earlier song, called B-Ball. There were no lyrix in there and i was happy. I also listen to a few other tracks, the ones with Big Ed, Mac and Servon, as well as Reginelli and Pheno of Gambino Family, because they are all pretty lyrically talented, but the subject matter--of making an entire album dedicated to basketball, especially since Master P was dropped from Charlotte was a bad move. Don't sellout No Limit."},{"rating":"2","title":"There Is No Better","review":"Donald Graves has broken new ground in that he has written what constitutes - without qualification - what is simply the finest regimental history ever to see print. He blends perfectly the veterans' experience with detailed historical research, and supplements the package with hundreds of original photographs and superb line drawings of everything from the tanks themselves to local campaign maps. His appendices are the best I have ever seen.Regardless of the depth of your prior knowledge of the Canadians in WW2, finishing Graves' SOUTH ALBERTAS will leave you awestruck, wishing for more. I would hope that this author and others might consider similar, follow-up works on other Canadian regiments, while the veterans are still with us; there can be no greater tribute to their sacrifices. Other, popular histories are but a pale imitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear-sighted, straight-forward rememberances by Michener","review":"For anyone interested in the craft of writing, this is a fun book to have; it is clever and unsentimental. Michener recalls encounters with Hemmingway, as he (Michener) was asked to write a blurb for The Old Man and the Sea (after a dissapointing Across the River and Through the Tress) which, as a result, made it a bestseller and garnered it the Pulitzer Prize, with Margaret Mitchell at Macmillan, and how he marveled at how tiny and thin she was, with Truman Capote and how they both escorted a beautiful woman together, and many other wonderful recollections. It is not trite with sentimentality. This is a book of an old man looking fondly back at his encounters with some of the literary legends who changed literature as we know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"Excellent follow-up to the previous Nolo editions.

Linda is a good instructor. She does each sequence of poses three times and I am able to push a little further each time. There is a second instructor who shows an advanced form of the poses. There is not a wide variety of poses in this tape but she keeps you moving throughout the routine. I have all four of her tapes and this is not my favorite but it is still good. There are a few times when she doesn't cue pose changes when you are not looking at the TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"I found this tape to not be very challenging at all. Linda Arkin might be a good teacher, and very concerned with proper technique, but the pacing is much too slow. She also talks throughout the entire tape, and spends the first 15 minutes of a 45-minute tape on chatty introductions to the sequences. That leaves 1/2 hour to practice 3 or 4 moves.

I loved this book. I loved Mark. he's the kind of guy that a girl would love to end up with and i loved Stacey. Phillipa was a complete mess, but Stacey was beautiful. I loved how her relationship with her daughter was not perfect, how she doubted herself, how he doubted himself, never seeing the greatness that they each possessed. It was a little predictable in some ways, but it's what readers want. It's what makes a happy ending. I highly recommend this book.

After reading this book I was rather ashamed that the rest of the world did nothing. Worse, we continue to allow atrocities to be perpetuated in that corner of the world. This book remains topical. Conflicts continue to erupt in the region and anyone who wants to speak intelligently on the subject, understand the story that's not in the news or would like to read about an un-sung hero, read this book. Kemal is presently working on a new book and reading this one would be a great starter. I would read this book over and over again.

The only tracks I could listen to all the way through were 'hit his ass' and 'for my players...' The third verse of 'hit' was nice (I don't think it was White Dawg tho) and the chorus is tight. The production on 'players' is so nice that not even White Dawg's vocals could ruin it. If you can tolerate a really annoying and obviously fake emcee and you like your music dirty then maybe this is for you. I give it four stars for the nice production and minus two stars for White Dawg on the mic."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't meet my expectations","review":"I purchased this to replace an aging panasonic battery.

This blender is powerful at 500 watts and it will literally move on the counter due to the vibration while blending. It is fairly loud but it is a blender. It makes great smoothies as long as fruit is cut in pieces and enough milk or soymilk is used for a smooth consistancy. However, this blender uses a fuse that I assume protects the motor. The fuse cannot be replaced by the consumer. I cut out the fuse after it burned out and connected the wires to the motor. The blender worked great for a while until the motor coupling broke. Oster promotes this blender as all metal drive. A motor coupling connects the motor shaft to the blades. This coupling is a thin threaded metal rod enclosed in rubber. Mine broke and now I need to replace it. I won't buy another Oster again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too heavy, too powerful!","review":"I think that Tim \\"the tool man\\" Taylor, designed this blender. There is a very high pulse speed and an even higher set speed (the only 2 speeds). This creates an air pocket around the bottom so, you have to pick up the blender and shake it every 10 seconds. This is the only way to get what you're blending to fall back to the bottom.Also the lid broke in the first month when the center feel into my shake. The blades are strong! They broke the plastic lid in seconds.The container part is a heavy thick glass which is good or bad depending on what you want.It is also very loud!

HUGE Lewis Black fan. However, this is unquestionably his worst performance, and makes me wonder why this piece is in stores. I HIGHLY REGARD AND RECCOMEND \\"The White Album.\\" Black's, not the Beattles'.Also, it seemed that the second-half of the album was written by political lobbyist. I can and will laugh at ANYTHING as long as it's funny (i.e. yes, I'd laugh at an old lady falling hard on the ground if she bounced just right) but this CD has NOT been played after my initial listening.If you really hate your mother-in-law, THIS is THE gift for her.

At the best, Rules of Enragement elicited a couple of chuckles from me, but not the gut laughs that \\"The White Album\\" and half of \\"The End of the Universe\\" did. Stick with those two CD's and his Daily Show appearances."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can justify two Starbucks next 2 each other more than this","review":"Lewis Black needs to write better material, and somewhat reinvent himself.

They seem to do that a lot. Instead of coming out with additional villains or other Spiderman characters, they give us this garbage. This sculpt was done first on the Punching Peter Parker with Burglar Trapping Actions figure. A better figure than this one. This figure has the same articulation as the Punching Peter Parker and the joints stay pretty tight. The accessory is OK, but doesn't sell the item.

Coming across such a work as this is only possible at select universities; which to my luck there was a copy available to me. The text deals chiefly with the exploration of narrative, under the heavy, unrestrained use of opium. The writer discusses four writers, De Quincey, Cobbes, Coleridge, and Thomson, throughout his essay; which was his dissertation at Harvard. There is much input concerning the lives, and writing, of the last three authors; but De Quincey serves as the consummate image of the troubled writer devoured by the visions that haunt his dreams, which inevitably brought forth the description that so very few read to this day.

All in all, I felt cheated by Amazon, which knowingly or unknowingly sold me an unfinished product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable plot, full of typographical errors and omissions","review":"I was quite surprised to find that this is at best a draft manuscript of a book.

Yes, I do have experience reading charts (I do lots of complex knitting, and I did detailed cross stitch about 15 years ago), but I would not discourage someone from buying this book just because they are not a needlepoint expert. I subscribe to the \\"If you want it enough, you can do it\\" school of thought. If you find richly colored needlepoints with unusual subjects to be inspirational, this is certainly the designer for you. I don't find most needlepoints to be worth the time invested, as they seem rather ordinary. Jill Gordon's designs are all extraordinary!

Smart Media is much smaller in capacity (128mb vs over 1000mb). This is a very important consideration when looking at any camera which produces such large image files. Smart Media isn't very smart. Since unlike Compact Flash it has no onboard controller. (meaning fatal error happen much more often). Transfer speed is much slower. How long do you wish to wait between shots? The slower the memory card, the longer the wait. And including a measly 16mb memory stick is a JOKE. It can hold 4-5 raw images. Also in a camera costing this much, rechargable batteries and a charger should be standard (and for most other cameras it is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is an awesome camera!

I also have the Olympus E-10. Huge difference in ease of use and in price. The viewfinder on the 3040 is poor, on the E-10 super. Zoom is greater on the E-10, which, I believe also has image stabilization. The E-10 is a pro-level camera and weighs like one; the 3040 is a compact that barely weighs anything. that's why i have both. For serious photo excursions, I'll take both; for bopping around and the opportunistic photo I use the 3040."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome camera","review":"I've shot lots of pictures using MF/AF film SLRs but always hated buying and developing film. SO I initially tried an HP digicam with horrible results. This drove me back to the film segment for a few years until I bought this camera used. It is fricking awesome.

If you can find one in good shape, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympus 3040","review":"I have owned this camera now for several years. Takes great pictures. Lots of creative options when using.

Close up flash pictures are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures, very flexible in all light settings","review":"This camera is great. There are plenty of options for the novice photographer to the low intermediate photographer. The pictures come out clear, well focused and the camera responds well to a wide variety of light conditions. Whether taking pictures in a dimly lit theater without flash or at night or during dusk hours - the pictures come out very well. I would definitely buy this camera again. One or two little nits, 1) carry a set of extra batteries if you're going to take several pics at a time. There is only brief indication that the batteries are getting low and then - boom - the camera is out of juice. 2) there is a brief delay between hitting the shutter button and the picture being taken - but it is easy to get used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic except for 128Mb smartmedia","review":"The camera is fantastic. Takes great indoor pictures with no red-eye problems. It takes great action shots with the 3 shots/second (at high resolution).

It is a leave-in conditioner, so you can use it anytime your pet needs grooming. It contains silicone, which really helps repel dirt (less bathing yay!) and keeps the coat shiny.

I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little surprised when I listened for the first time. With that out of the way, let me tell you about this album. The Scott Miller who put out this album is a Nashville studio musician. It's obvious that Miller and his supporting musicians are accomplished, but that alone doesn't make a good album. The songs sound as if they're performed directly off sheet music. It's a little too down-home to call the album \\"elevator music,\\" but I really don't see where else something like this would be played. It's not unlike something you'd buy in a Cape Cod gift shop. If you wish Dino was a little more country, then this is the album for you. But if you're looking for a holiday companion piece to \\"Thus Always to Tyrants,\\" you'll just going to have to wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I heard a segment of his stand-up on the radio and had to hear the rest.

Then he gets \\"industry insiders\\" to tell you to get a lawyer before trying to sell beats.Seriously I have just told you all the (useful) information that is on this DVD.

One example: the Wexfords, in California, telephone home and reference is made to the time difference, remarking that the UK is 8 hours behind California. It should of course be the other way round! This mistake is repeated several times. In a mystery, everything can be a clue and this is just the sort of thing a reader will take note of. Well, the reader needn't bother -- the author didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative and harshly worded advice book","review":"This may be a good book for practitioners, but it is not a good book for pregnant women. The advice and information here is presented in such a negative, harsh manner that a reader comes away with the feeling that if she managed to beat the incredible odds against her & her baby and actually have a healthy baby, it would be a miracle. Dr. Shapiro has absolutely *no* \\"bedside manner\\" and he puts the worst news first: only after being scared to death would a woman learn, for example, that the risks of flying during pregnancy are actually quite minimal. Other books will answer your questions and will do it without scaring you to death, undermining your confidence in your own body's ability to grow a healthy baby, and have you worrying needlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flip through it first.","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but I can see how some women might not. This is not a book to read cover-to-cover, nor is it light reading. It is a reference book, and it really lays out the facts. If you are comfortable with medical jargon, and you want more information than you'll find in the typical pregnancy books, check this one out. I wanted to know more about WHY I couldn't have certain medications, what studies had shown, etc. I found answers to many questions in this book that either weren't in the other books or weren't covered in depth. This is a good book if you're not content with being pat on the head and told to listen to your doctor. It's also a good book if you've got medical conditions and want to do some extended research. But don't rely on it alone. It's best as a suppliment to a book like What to Expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this to be paranoid throughout your pregnancy","review":"Although this book is written from the standpoint of presenting the facts, it does so in a warped and paranoid way. The \\"facts\\" presented in this book are not the facts but the author's extreme ideas presented from extreme reported examples that are perfect to make any mother-to-be paranoid about her pregnancy. This book will make you believe that having sex WILL cause you to have a miscarriage (which is extremely rare!) In addition, the author speculates that having one x-ray at any time in your life will cause all of your future offspring to be deformed... which could not be more FALSE. This book sells lies instead of the helpful information a mother-to-be will need. In my profession I have already had to council the fears of a young mother who read this book and received all of the wrong information."},{"rating":"2","title":"great rock songs","review":"The new CD by Ocean Six is a great example of songwriting and mainstream rock chops.

I don't do potty seats that require mom to empty out & clean a bowl - what's the point? We bought a regular seat that sits on the toilet and a step stool, but he was still too intimidated by them (one fall off face first and another one into the toilet didn't help). This seat is great because it gives them the step, with the handles to hold on to and uses their weight to provide stabilty.

As for the \\"enemy\\", while similar beings have been seen in other books of the genre, their history is completely new.

As with any book of this type, it is only for initiates (if you don't know what this last sentence means, don't buy the book), this is a very academic approach to tantra. I should have ready the sleeve more carefully before purchase, as if I had realised that the book is a re-print of the author's PhD thesis on one particular sadana which I am not and don't need to be familiar with, I wouldn't have bought it. In saying that though, the introductory pages (which make up about half the book) are well written and do prove interesting to read about the subject when it is written from such an academic perspective.

The story had captured me by the end of the first chapter, and I couldn't put the book down. I was afraid the story was going to be predictable but I was wrong. I won't give anything away about the ending, but it is definitely unexpected. Jackson's story telling makes you feel as if you have grown up in the town of Possett, AL. The characters are relatable and dynamic. A great summer read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I truly wanted to like this book. The first couple of chapters were good and I was hooked. As the book progressed, however, it went downhill. Most of the characters seemed like cariactures to me, especially Lena's mother and aunt Florence (who actually is a truly warped character--I found the Phoebe the chicken story fairly disturbing). Many of the flashbacks are overly drawn out, and I kept thinking, \\"who cares?\\" By about 2/3rds of the way through the book, I no longer cared what happened. Like I said, I wanted to like this book and was bitterly disappointed especially after reading so many great reviews here. I do think the story concept had potential. Hopefully Jackson's future books will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks substance","review":"The humor that was promised never came to fruition. The characters are not believable for the era and setting. Joshilyn Jackson writes as if she were the angry voice of her main character. She attempts to portray the actions of the characters as humorous, but instead they come across as classless boors with no respect for others or themselves. If I were not from the South and didn't know better, I would have a low opinion of Southerners. Jackson uses the same typical unimaginative descriptions that have been used for eons to describe Southern culture. The whole tone of this book is crude and insulting. Thankfully it is a quick read (translation:short) and doesn't take much intelligence on the reader's part. Rating: R for language and content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been better without the \\"F\\" word","review":"I like this book, but the overuse of the \\"F\\" word made it hard to want to keep reading. The author used this word constantly, and after reading it 10 times on one page, I would sometimes have to just put the book down. I think she could have conveyed her point by other words instead of this one, especially since no other four letter words were used very often if at all. Plus, it is had to get started on and drags on a while, only to end the way you predicted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book!","review":"Great book! I can't wait to read another one by Jackson.

Complex, twisty, quirky and humorous. Like in Minette Walters' great classic mystery \\"The Dark Room\\", nothing is quite what it seems.And yet it's unfair to compare this book to a murder mystery. Yes, there is a murder. No, that's not what the book is about. The book is about causality, motherhood, dark secrets and family love. The issue of bigotry is handled with a lot of sensitivity and a lopsided smile, and it's not allowed to _become_ an issue.I honestly wish there were more stars to give. 5 doesn't do it justice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"underappreciated debut","review":"I eschew Chick Lit, and I hesitate about potentially melodramatic thrillers. Fortunately, this is neither. Ms. Jackson has created full, complex and sympathetic (if not always likeable) characters with comprehensible motives. In so many ways, this is a story about family, loyalties and the things you will do for someone you love. Funny, serious and remarkably, not schmaltzy or overwrought, Ms. Jackson has crafted a real, if not politically correct, depiction of adolescent sexuality and expection."},{"rating":"2","title":"CrAzY!!

However, I found this book to be a shallow misrepresentation of female power. What the women do in this book is extreme vigilantism, but we're supposed to applaud it in the name of \\"girl power\\". This was no \\"Time to kill\\", where murder was justified. I kept waiting to read something that made me want to see someone killed.. it never happened. Murder isn't cute or funny, but again, we're supposed to think so because the murderers were victims of a heinous crime, and FEMALE, so its okay... gosh its even funny. We're supposed to feel warm and fuzzy that the main character gets on with her life, I didn't.

I literally had to force myself through the 7th chapter and at the beginning of the 8th chapter decided to put it down.The protagonist in this story is an overly promiscuous murderer who falsely attempts to justify her utterly contemptible and immoral act of sleeping with every boy in her high school class as well as the murder of the star quarterback as heroic deeds in defense of her cousin.I picked up this book only because of the rave reviews and I've learned that we can't always trust the reviews of others. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It???????","review":"Why all the hype on this book? After the first two chapters the book goes downhill fast. It's terrible the way some people hype up a book to get a reading audience only to have them become thoroughly disappointed. Pass this one over and don't waste your money on it. Wish I could get mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chore","review":"This was a chore for me to read. I finished it, but it wasn't easy. I had no sympathy for any of the characters, and just found most of them to be annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"gods in Alabama","review":"I found gods in Alabama to be shallow, contrived, trite, and unconvincing. How it got to be a best seller is a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shotty first attempt","review":"Waiting to finish this short audio book was torturous. Catherine Tauber narrates this story as if she were a bored 10th grader whose English teacher just called on her to read to the class. Not helping her is the undeveloped, disjointed, oft-times cliche-ridden story that Jackson has written. The story wasn't plausible, (a girl can't kill someone with one crack on the head with a bottle), her characters are as shallow as a papercut (Aunt Flo does nothing but scream, Burr's character is written as if he were a woman and Clarise is too sickening sweet). Additionally, there is an entire chapter dedicated to car games that Burr and Arlene play on their trip to Alabama.This isn't entertainment. This isn't Southern literature at its best. This is a quickie novel that Ms. Jackson probably penned in under two months and someone accidently green-lighted without a proper edit job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Even Finish It","review":"I decided to read this book based on the rave reviews it received, and didn't make it past the half-way point. I could not identify with (or understand) the main character at all. In fact, I found almost all of the characters to be contrived and stereotypical. Jackson's description of the south was just as stereotypical as her characters. The lack of originality, however, paled in comparison to the weak narration. Overall, I was completely unimpressed. I forced myself through the first several chapters, but didn't finish it because I just didn't care how it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can run but you can't hide!","review":"Arlene made a promise to God. If she didn't get caught for the murder of Jim Beverly, she promises to not sleep with any more men and to never ever go back to her hometown in Alabama. Even if her aunt and mom call her up every week begging.Her boyfriend, Burr, thinks she won't go down there and introduce him to her family because she is embarrassed of him. They get into a tiff about it.Rose-Pop shows up at the college where Arlene works and wants to know what she knows about Jim Beverly missing. Arlene avoids Rose so Rose leaves a note saying she will just ask Clarice, Arlene's cousin. Afraid Clarice will spill the beans about Jim, Arlene finally decides to go home after 10 years.What did happen that night with Jim Beverly and why would Arlene hate him so much? How will Arlene's family feel about Burr being a different race?Read this fast paced book and find out the mystery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There are Good Books in the South","review":"I read this book in 24 hours. Just couldn't put it down - couldn't wait for the next plot twist. Just as I would predict a new bit of info, something would shift with a character or idea, and the whole scenario had to be rethought. I liked that. I like to be strung along, some, as I read. Just predictable enough to be a comfort, but suspenseful enough to be interesting.Arlene's sarcasm and intensity blend perfectly, so that I find myself wanting to know more about her, to hear her talk about this and that. I would have liked to know justa bit more about Clarice, about how she lived with certain memories all those years.All in all, I enjoyed this book and have even given it as a gift and recommended it to multiple friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Treat","review":"Gods in Alabama has it all: Engaging characters, inventive prose, and an addicting plot. Arlene Fleet is one of those heart-breaking characters that leaps off the page and stays with you for days. An utterly compelling read, and one of the best Southern novels I've read in a long while."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOOKWORM","review":"JACKSON IS AN AUTHOR WHO CAN MAKE YOU LOOK FOR HER CAHARACTERS WHEN YOU GO OUT.

THE BOOK IS A PAGE TURNER."},{"rating":"2","title":"gods in alabama","review":"This book is easy to read, yet the characters are complex and well developed. There is also a mystery that keeps the story moving nicely along with a great suprising and tender ending. Any Southerner will be able to easily relate to the characters, and Jackson has some good points about stereotypes in the South. She seems to accomplish admonishing the racist characters but also making them sympathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable and memorable writing","review":"As with all of Jackson's books, this is very entertaining and the characters have depth and renter your thinking long after you have read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading that keeps you guessing","review":"This is by far one of the best novels I have read in quite a while. You'll come to love the charachers as they are wonderfully written and draw you into the story while keeping you guessing about what is going to happen next. This has been the one book that I have passed from friend to friend this summer and we have all read it in record time. It's the kind of story that keeps you on your toes til the end with twists and turns. A must for your summer reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gods In Alabama: Funny and Entertaining","review":"I found this audio book to be both heartwarming and hilarious. The characters are sweet southern bells with steel backbones. I enjoyed the author's dry wit, and her other book, \\"Between, Georgia\\" is even more entertaining. I would recommend the book to anyone who likes a novel with intrigue, humor, and oblique reference to various issues of the Southern United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking","review":"What an amazing novel. It shocked me over and over, even as it touched truths in my own experience-truths about the illogical way people think and act, about secrets, about judging and misunderstandings. I was entertained by the humor, gripped by the unanswered questions, and satisfied by the ending. Jackson's gods in Alabama is everything a novel should be and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 Really","review":"This was a great book! It started out a little slow for me but then I couldn't put it down. I loved the characters and the mystery gave it that little extra something. Highly recommend for a quick summer read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was hoping for more","review":"When I read the reviews on this book and all the press that had been written about it, I was looking forward to reading it. It's well written and has decent characters, but the crazy is just too easily forgiven. There was always a reason someone was the way they were, instead of taking responsibility for their actions, they blamed it on that reason. The book is a decent day or two read, but I was looking for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Wonderful","review":"As teenagers we make our own memories, hiding from them and finally learning the truth as adults.

Sad to say, the same mistakes made in the first were made in the second. Rehashed dialogue and repeats of same scenes were in this too. It is as if it wasn't properly edited. Hearing Jenna, the lead characted moan and cry throughout the whole book about how she wasn't good enough got real old. Again, a missed opportunity to tell what could have been a great story about the hustle and bustle of the black elite of Washington, DC. I think this author should give up writing romantic fiction or take a few more writing classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like this one at all","review":"I hated this book, I felt that the leading lady in the book Jenna was selfish and only out for self, and that Mike should have just left her along."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST OF THE BLUES","review":"Listening to this stunning collection of songs from the 40s through the 60s from the bluesy, indomitable Miss Lee is not as much a blast from the past as a smoldering, come-hither nudge as only Peggy can deliver. These recordings sound better than ever and four CDs are just the right amount to adequately represent the various styles of music and collaborators this genuine American original has complemented. Her fading health in recent years seems to have dimmed Miss Lee's contribution to the world of music, elevating Ella Fitzgerald, Rosemary Clooney, and Billie Holiday to higher rungs at the same time. My advice is to listen to this collection of classics and be reminded, ever so subtly, of the brilliance of this musical genius and startlingly original visionary artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bindings are terrible","review":"Sorry to rain on the rosy reviews, but these snowshoes leave much to be desired. The biggest deficiency is the bindings, which are absolutely awful. I came here to price check these snowshoes, since I expected them to be about $50. I couldn't believe that anyone would pay $140 for these when there are so many superior products on the market.I typically use a pair of Atlas Snowshoes. The atlas bindings are super secure yet highly adjustable and the nylon pull closures can be adjusted with a glove on.This weekend, I rented a pair of the MSR, and the cheap rubber buckles came undone several times over the course of a hike. There is no room in my closet for any bad gear, especially when it costs the same as good stuff.It's disappointing, because MSR makes some good stuff. Not these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"Bought these snowshoes two winters ago for out of track trekking.They rapidly show signs of wear but I didn't mind as different sellers told me that they were indestructibles.But after using them well, maybe 20 times, the plastic frame broke.If you intend to do snowshoeing off the beaten then go for another model."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for the product, 1 star for Philips!","review":"I was very lucky to get this handy product as a gift. Nino is very impressive. First, no setup is necessary, just take it out from the box and it is ready to be used. I also used the handy Nino-to-PC cable to connect it to my PC. Unlike many other products which require USB, Nino can be connected via regular RS serial port, which is a standard on any system.Personally, I didn't face problems connecting the port. But some might since serial ports have their own stuff. For example, they must not share the same IRQ. Now the customer service at philips are not smart enough to tell you that. So I guess you should go over your Windows manual and philips manual for troubleshooting.Nino is very portable, and except the fact that it is thick not to fit in my pocket, I think it is great. I anyway am a college student and carry my bag almost anywhere I would carry my nino. In this case, Nino fits nicely in my bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unauthentic writing","review":"This biography of Babaji indicates the authors lack of true experience in the tradition he attempts to write about.I fully agree with many of the other criticisms of this book.It is, in its own light - highly uncorroborated & inconsistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T PAY FOR THIS BOOK IT'S TERRIBLE","review":"This book is a horribly written account based only on gossip and hearsay( disgusting illustrations as well) It's supposedly scientific basis is but unfounded blather designed to appeal to ignorant spiritual seekers.

Ask yourself the real motives behind his 1991 publications about Babaji's \\"new\\" techniques and then use your own judgement based on your study and research.Since the publication of Autobiography of a Yogi by Sri Paramahamsa Yogananda Giri in 1946, many people have claimed that they had met Mahavatar Babaji and that he supposedly continues revising and sharing new pranayama techniques of kriya Yoga to the World.Think thrice before spending a cent on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend it","review":"I have enjoyed this book.

It inspires through the wealth of information it provides on some of the great Siddhas and their world vision of love and service. In addition, it includes glorious color prints of Shiva and Murugan and Sri Aurobindo and the 18 Siddhas which are powerful inspirations if one meditates on them. Moreover, I have found that as I have used the book it has become a faithful tool in my sadhana. Due to the Shakti, which must have guided the hand of the author, I am guided to various teachings from the Siddhas whenever I need them. This book is so much more than it appears to be.

Consequently I don't feel I have 'met' any of the other characters. Also, though he has a few mishaps and adventures, most of his days are spent....rowing (as you would expect). While I have no problem with this, and it gives him ample time to muse over various topics, this isn't an exciting book. But it is very well written and won't disappoint.

Like another one star reviewer said, because it's bulky end, it cannot go all the way insight the earphone jack of my phone. My thought was since the male side end has much smaller diameter, it will go all the way in. but they didn't send me the one as shown on their Amazon picture. This is misadvertisment. And after I emailed them a few days ago, they haven't given me a damn.

This live CD from Rush is CRAZY GOOD! The sound is enormous, like the show was. Now, I agree that without the sound check, the sound crew needed a few songs to help Geddy's vocals to stand out more. But, hey, take it with a grain of salt! This is an incredible performance and an amazing show captured here, if somehow not \\"perfect\\". It's live, man! Stop nit-picking! Rush is on top of the world on this night and they celebrated this event with a sound and visual document to preserve it for posterity. They did a great job and the music ROCKS! 5 stars, at least. Buy this CD and/or the DVD. Celebrate the amazing career of Rush. They deserve the praise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"By Different Stages instead!","review":"I love Rush and expecially live Rush, but this is NOT a good live Rush album. The mix is not very good, Geddys vocals are too far down and there is too much bass. The audience is also way too loud in many places too. Different Stages (from last tour) is MUCH better, and it has most of the same songs anyway. (Please tell my why they did Natural Science again instead of Camera Eye like they were thinking of doing). The only good part of this album is the 2 bonus tracks, Between Sun & Moon and Vital Signs. Both a far better quality then the Rio show, and are great versions.So if you just want a good, recent Rush live album, get Different Stages. If you really want a live concert from the Vapor Trails tour, get one of the many, live DAT recordings via trade. Some have better sound quality then this concert recording!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recorded from a bootleg handheld tape recorder? =)","review":"Ah, Rush... what have you done? I can hear behind the horrible recording, your artistry; which seems to me to be perfect.This is not unlike trying to watch dirty movies on a scrambled station...Great sets, but if you want a live album, try \\"Different Stages\\"So disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound NOT soo bad...","review":"On first listen, I too though 'oh my god'. BUT, upon several listens now, the sound has grown on me. To all who think it's too muted and distant, just turn up the treble. It worked for me, all the detail is there.In fact, this does sound more like a very excellent bootleg rather than a polished live recording. Which only adds to the power and listenability for me.The drums sound FANTASTIC on this CD. The guitar and bass are fine, and whoever claims that you can't hear the bass guitar, are you even listening? It sounds OK. The vocals are a bit undermixed. Adding a little treble brightens the whole thing up and makes it completely listenable.And, it's simply one of best live performances ever captured. The DVD and performace are stunning, best Rush ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I picked RiR up on the spur of the moment. I haven't been a major fan of Rush for a few years, but a live album is always entertaining. And, usually Rush live albums aren't too bad.Well, this one definitely is bad.This is easily the worst mix on a live CD I've heard in several years. Vocals virtually disappear; the drums frequently sound unbelievably thin. It sounds like a midrange quality audience bootleg.Which is a disappointment, because their live albums are usually pretty good best-ofs with some extra oomph and excitement. This album lacks any of the subtleties of previous live Rush recordings, and words can't express how bad the mix is.If you want a recent live disc, get Different Stages instead.(the CD-only tracks sound a bit better than the bulk of the CD but are pretty thin sounding.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the crowd noise","review":"Crowd noise may be appropriate on a DVD, but a live CD? Maybe at the end of each song, but not conpeting with the song itself. I love Rush and hate this release. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better Rush CDs","review":"The audio mix on this CD makes it difficult to enjoy.The Rush signatures of strong vocals and clean bass lines are missing from this CD.The mix on the vocals is much lower volume than the original records so it sounds like they were picked up by a mic in the drum set and the bass lines are dulled.The constant crowd noise is irritating.The one good thing is that the drum mix is rather good when you can hear it over the crowd noise and Neil Pert is more precise than a drum machine.This CD may sound better on a premium sound system with very fine controls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is Terrible, Rush say it isn't so!","review":"I'm deaf in one ear so at first I thought it was just something people could hear in Stereo that I could not, until my all-ears friend listened to it, and said it sounded like a horrible bootleg someone attempted with one of those old tape players you buy at Radio shack.It was just horrible, too much base, I tried to lower the base, change the treble, play with the EQ, no luck, still crappy god awful sound. The first poster was spot on the money, I'm just re-affirming that this is by far the worst Rush live album I've ever heard.I'm sadly disappointed with Rush on this, they were the ones that signed off on this project, if a partially deaf guy can point out how awful the sound is, I have to ask, did Rush even LISTEN to this album?Okay to be fair here, what's good about the album.. the art work is pretty, the set list is arranged well, the CD's are nice and round with no jagged edges, other than that there are far better live albums out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Rush allright","review":"This is what Rush is all about.Most of the concert is hard rock and very technical stuff like Naturall Science,Tom Sawyer,the Spirit of Radio and YYZ(listen to the groud during this!) but there's also some neat pop/rock tunes like Bravado and the acoustic Resist.The set list is from the whole 30 year career of the band and includes all their hits.So good so far but then the sound of the recording makes it hard for the listener to get a grip of the material (expecially if you have'nt heard the songs before).Unfortunately Geddy Lees voice dissapears at times and Neil Pearts drums sound kind a thin but it's sill Rush and for a fan this live document of the Vapour Trails tour is must.I recommend buying the Rush In RIO dvd instead of this triple cd because the consert dvd really sounds better.Still the songs are great and Rush is back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who left that EQ alone? AWFUL!!!","review":"To enjoy this album, you will ABSOLUTELY NEED a 31+ band EQ on your stereo. It will sound HORRIBLE and very WASHED OUT on most \\"PC speakers\\" and in most standard car audio systems.I'm assuming that Alex and their engineer Jimbo did the best they could with the live sound they had... but since Jimbo is credited with the recording part, it seems like he had significant hearing loss by the end of the tour.It sounds like the whole thing was bootlegged from a little Panasonic cassette deck back in the 50th row at the concert.TERRIBLE and not worthy of the \\"Anthem\\" label. Even the FIRST RUSH ALBUM had better EQ!Do yourself a favor. Find someone with a great deck who's got a very good EQ and a CD recorder, and run each of the CD's through it to fix the EQ, then use your copied CD's for general playing.Rush should definitely recall this album and replace our discs with better mixes. Utterly disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people are just two picky...","review":"I don't know what these people are talking about. The audio quality is fine. If you have ever heard the original un-mixed audio, you would say otherwise. And by the way, most recordings are EQed at the show, and THEN mixed at a studio (with the exception of the two board recordings, which are recorded directly from the PA mixer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta agree; the sound is underwhelming","review":"First off, this is a fine performance of the Canadian rock trio on their first tour in many years. As well, you get just about every Rush song you'd ever want in a live setting. BUT, what was guitarist Alex Lifeson thinking (or hearing) when he helped mix this thing? Singer/bassist Geddy Lee's vocals are so deeply buried that I found myself straining to hear them on almost every song. After awhile, this became so frustrating I stopped listening to the album and have traded it in at a used record store. For a far, far better listening experience, pick up the R30 DVD/CD concert package celebrating the band's 30-year anniversary."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's next?","review":"First we get Vapor Trails, which probably has the worst sound quality of any studio album on the planet, then we get Rush in Rio, which is probably the worst sounding live album on the planet.With this trend, what exactly do we have to look forward to?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushing Along The Amazon","review":"Rush is one band whose music and lyrics are always superb. Imagine my disappointment when I heard the indifferent sound quality and non-existent mastering. It falls prey to the thing live concerts always do: the giant purple monster: the audience. If those Brazilians had just put a sock in it, maybe we just might have something. I cannot see that in an age of digital recording/mastering that this collection of noise could be seriously released as a high priced album. And I know such live albums has successfully been done: Genesis Seconds Out (1977), U2 Under A Blood Red Sky (1983), Simple Minds Live In The City Of Lights (1990), and your pick of Pink Floyd performances. If these live concerts can sound good with primitive caveman equipment, I wonder what happened. I know: it's the Brazilians that happened. I am sorry I have write such review concerning RUSH, but, if you cannot enjoy something with such price tag, then buyers beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a Rush Job...","review":"Sorry. couldn't resist. It's true though. As one who has almost all the Rush vinyl (including rush through time)and both the early live LPs, I was really disappointed by sound quality. I mean, I have boots (black forest comes to mind) that sound 10x better than this.Guys gotta keep it sharp in their old age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst SOund Mix of Any Album","review":"Save your money for the inevitable Remastered, properly mixed set. Very disappointing for a loyal Rush fan. Buy Different Stages instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy if you like a DVD of people screaming !!!","review":"O.K, I read all the reviews and bought it anyway. Bad choice ! The sound IS BAD, and I mean BAD. The mix sounds like one mic for the band, and several hundred for the crowd. I have many LIVE concerts (tape,DVD,etc.)but this one rates at the bottom. I'm sure the boys sound great but you can't tell... Exit Stage Left, done over 20 yrs ago, blows this one away for sound quality. If you want crowd noise go to an NFL game, or buy this DVD. It's about the same. As a RUSH fan of over 20 years, what a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album inutile","review":"J'adore ce groupe, ils sont d'excellent musiciens mais un band de ce calibre ne devrait pas se rabaisser à produire un album qui sonne comme un band heavy-métal des années 70.

Its really too bad that the sound quality is fairly poor. The 3 lads from Canada show that they still have what it takes, and sound quality aside, this set really kicks. I am currently reading a book written by Neil, about his journey to rediscover the meaning of life after 2 very tramatic events in his personal life, and you may want to check that out as well. \\"Ghost Rider\\" is the title of the book, it is very well written and entertaining, and gives a good insight into the man who pounds the skins for the band.If you are a Rush fan, this CD set is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush of pure energy!","review":"It is incredible the euphoria and energy that this album delivers, the song YYZ is worth the money. Yes, it is not A+ when it comes down to sound quality but it makes you feel as if you are right there in the middle of it, experiencing the concert. Simple: Awesome pure raw energy, thats what this record is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST LIVE ALBUM YET BY RUSH !!!!!","review":"This album is for music fans, and not just Rush fans. The amount of music in the package, the quality of the recording, the energy captured from the record is amazing.Die hard Rush fans will appreciate the wide range of songs from their early beginnings to the current releases. Also, new Rush fans and music fans not exposed to RUSH will appreciate this recording since it encapulates the essence of RUSH -- the energy, and the power of thier live perforances.Its a LIVE recording for God's sake!This and the DVD are worth it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"performance=amazing / sound quality = horrible","review":"this is rush at the top of their game, performance wise.no way to refute that. but the mix is very muddy and the vocals are frequently burried beneath the mud. overall, it's hard to get past the sound quality. this should have been offered as a free download from their website, or at least advertised as more of a bootleg. for twenty five bucks, i'd like something of much higher fidelity. so many of these rush fans have bought stacks of rush cds and paid top dollar for concert tickets, how about putting in the effort fora top shelf live recording?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Setlist . Horrible Mix","review":"The setlist and the music execution of this album is great. However the sound quality is awful. This sounds like an amatuer bootleg recorded with beginner's equipment. I find it hard to beleive that an ablum of this quality made it out of the QA department."},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETIC","review":"I started out, years ago, with \\"2112\\" & \\"Moving Pictures\\". I had some other stuff, & thought their metal-sounding stuff was o.k., but as they grew more progressive & techno, it just wasn't my bag. Then, when they came to New Orleans for \\"Hold Your Fire\\", someone told me that, if I didn't see Rush at least once, I'd regret it. Well, I went, & was blown away! The key to appreciating Rush is to get the FULL live experience, & that ESPECIALLY included SOUND! If you missed 'em, & figure you can at least hear it, DON'T START HERE! This is PATHETIC!, & I never though I'd live to say that about a Rush recording! I've heard bootlegs that sounded better than this! It's very Guitar/feedback heavy, the crowd drowns out Geddy's vocals, & you can hardly recognize what song's being played! I'm giving this 2 stars because it does sound like a good show. You just can't HEAR it! Hopefully the d.v.d. will be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long-time fan that is disappointed by the mix","review":"This is easily the worst-sounding live album from Rush ever; it's even worse than the antiquated All The World's A Stage. Rush definitely are still in fine form performance-wise, but the audio mix on this recording is horribly muddled and the crowd's screaming on top of it just makes it worse. This is truly a shame given the poor audio mix evident as well on their last studio album, Vapor Trails, an album which contains some of the best music Rush has produced in ten years or more. I get the feeling that the guys mixing the album (which I think included Alex Lifeson) did the best they could with what they had, but in the end it is very disappointing. I have no doubt that long-time fans like myself will buy this album and its associated DVD anyway, as they still provide at least one session's worth of enjoyment, and the DVD of course provides a rare look at Rush \\"behind-the-scenes,\\" something which fans have never really gotten before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who erased all the bad reviews of this album","review":"I guess Amazon.com only puts reviews up if they are positive. I wrote a negative review of this album yesterday, just after I bought it and it never showed up. And all the other negative reviews are now gone. Where are they Amazon?Maybe someone should report you guys to the BBB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually benefits from some EQ tweaking","review":"Um but ISN'T THAT THE JOB OF THE ENGINEER?!?!Insane performance. Insane Brazilians. What else can you expect?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst live Rush recording EVER!!","review":"Unbelievably bad. The DVD sounds even worse, as it is more compressed. I still can't believe Rush even agreed to release this garbage. Their audio standards are usually quite high. The person in charge of this mix should NEVER be let inside a studio again. EVER. I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a bootleg?","review":"The sound quality is so bad, it could easily be taken for a bootleg made with a hand-held casette recorder. The music is muddied by stadium reverb and crowd noise. It is often difficult to make out the vocals or any particular instrument at any given time. I think even die hard Rush fans will be disappointed. There is some novelty to owning a bootleg, even if the sound quality is poor, but an official release? Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused!","review":"When I bought this item, I though that it was going to be a DVD, however, when I played it, it was only a CD. I do love the music but, it was not what I was looking for. Is there a DVD available on \\"RUSH IN RIO\\"? If so, I would really be interested. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Large Victory!!","review":"Wow! That's all I can say. This CD set so wonderful because it is sequenced, for once, as the songs appeared live. For instance the first disc contains the ENTIRE first half of the show. Amazing! Tell me that does not bring back memories. I saw the tour four times and let me state this clearly; this CD captures the pacing, the feel, and the sound of those shows.I love all of the previous live Rush CDs, but SoH and ESL sound too produced. Rio, on the other hand, sounds raw, relentless and energetic. Is that not what Rush is all about?There have been some negative reviews of these CDs, but the good outweighs the bad. Believe me, you will be smiling from ear to ear when you listen and don't be surprised by an occasional goosebump or two.The mix sounds like old, hungry Rush and it is clear that they are having a good time and playing their hearts out. So go ahead and buy this CD, play it really loud, and remember what a great LIVE band Rush is."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY AMAZING","review":"It's hard to imagine a band can servive for 30 years these days, let alone play with thetalent and passion as RUSH does. This latest DVD shows that they are as solid as ever! They take you on a trip down memory lane with such classics as \\"By-Tor and the Snowdog\\", \\"The Trees\\", \\"Working Man\\", \\"Tom Sawyer\\", and \\"Closer to the Heart\\"; while ripping out new songs like \\"Earthshine\\", \\"One Little Victory\\", and \\"Secret Touch\\". Neil Peart plays a breathtaking drum solo (as usual), while for the first time Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee sit down for an acoustic version of \\"Resist\\". This 2 disk set not only gives you a great concert, but a chance to follow them around and get a sneak peak into what goes on before the shows. This DVD set is a MUST HAVE!!! This is the best music DVD show I've had the privelege of seeing, buy this IMMEDIATELY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Rush into this one...","review":"I can't believe all the good reviews of this album. I consider myself a casual Rush fan, periodically buying their records for the last 27 years. Prior to release I was excited to read they would include Working Man and other early material. After one listen I considered it a waste of $20. CD one bogs down after New World Man and the energy doesn't pickup again until Freewill. There is nothing redeeming here, on CD three you get cheated out of a minute and a half of Working Man. And what's with The Trees again? Why not Red Barchetta? There may be bootlegs from this tour with better sound. If you must buy this CD, borrow a copy first. I'll stick with Different Stages. This album is nothing more than a rack warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT BAND, UNFORGIVABLY AWFUL SOUND!","review":"Atrocious recording of what should have been a stellar representation of Rush's triumphant return in 2002. People are not exaggerating when they say this is a horrible recording. I love this band dearly but can't bring myself to listen to this album after many attempts at trying to get into it. It literally hurts my ears. The band actually listened to all the complaints about Rush in Rio and R30 (their next live recording release) is miles improved with Richard Chycki at the helm. Skip this one and wait for Snakes and Arrows Live 2007, which comes out in April 2008."},{"rating":"1","title":"great band, awful sound ..... why?","review":"gret track list, nice packaging, good price, great band .... horrible sound! why must someone buy hi-fi equipment to have such a terrible noise! Avoid this cd, much better all others Rush live cd ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super set-list..... Worst cd that I bought last year","review":"Don't even think about buying this cd. The sound on this cd is the worst that I have ever heard. The whole time you can hear, what seems like 5,000,000 Brazillians, hooting and hollaring. Normaly crowd noise is welcome on a live cd, but they overpower the music. Save your money. Don't say I didn't warn you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"Buyer beware! This 3-cd set has the absolute worst sound I have ever heard on a live recording. The fact that this was recorded during the 2002 tour makes it inexplicable. Geddy Lee's vocals are almost completely buried. Alex's guitar sounds like it is coming out of a 15-watt amplifier. Neil's drums are totally bass-heavy, and the crowd noise is obtrusive to the point of being a real distraction.On the other hand, the DVD's sound is excellent. I don't know what these guys were thinking when they released this cd set; they have done so much better in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good live discs","review":"The concert is very good , but the audience is too loud at times. Very nice tri-fold. Also has 2 tracks from the sound board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality is deplorable","review":"You would think that in view of their remastered catalog being of such high quality that a new release would continue their committment to excellent sonics. This CD sounds as though it were recorded in a coffee can. I doubt I'll be contributing to the Rush bank account in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds good to me.....","review":"I'm disappointed to see all the comments on the sound mix on this one. I've been into Rush since 1974 and have seen them about 8 times. This CD sounds just about like being at one of thier concerts (I would agree that the Rio audience is particularly interactive). Nobody should be buying a LIVE CD expecting anything close to studio sound quality- the ones that do sound really clear have been substantially \\"cleaned up\\". Anyway, I think this is their best live CD with the exception of All The World's A Stage and that was from the 70s. Any Rush fan should appreciate that they are still together and as vital and powerful a band as ever. Rock On."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Band, Bad Recording","review":"I have been a Rush fan for many years and finally decided to purchase Rush In Rio as I wanted a live CD from Rush. This is a horrible recording. The music sounds muddy and vocals get lost. I myself,as others have suggested tried it on different stereos thinking that was the problem but that's not it. I have several other live albums by other bands that were very good. Thin Lizzy Live and Dangerous, Jethro Tull Bursting Out, Fleetwood Mac Live to name a few all were good recordings but you can still tell they were live recordings.

This CD, however, is unlistenable and a huge disappointment. The crowd noise throughout overpowers the music. I give it two stars only because the set list is great.If you enjoy listening to live music on a subway platform with a train approaching, or if you think the problem with most live records is that it's too damn easy to hear the musicians, you might enjoy the acoustics of this release. Otherwise, you will indeed be disappointed -- despite your best intentions to convince yourself otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars Based solely on the sound quality...","review":"....the actual content and performance garners 5+ stars from me. But the sound is pretty crappy. Surprised they didn't master it better. This is especially evident when you listen to the bonus tracks that were taken from another R30 tour show. Both shows were soundboard sourced, but the bonus tracks sound WAY better. That being said, this is a great, great set with amazing performances and a fantastic set list. I won't go over it because if you went to any of the R30 shows, it's basically the same set. All in all, a great live set (3 CDs of live Rush, how can you go wrong?) and it totally bucks the trend of 4 studio released and then a live one (coming only 2 albums after Test For Echo)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grt on the paint/clearcoat, okay on everything else","review":"This is one of the best things in this car wash set!

Every time I watch Shiloh Season with my grandmother she has tears in her eyes by the middle and the end of the movie.Another reason I liked this film so much is because the cast are perfect for their roles. For example Michael Moriarty plays the firm, but fair father and protects his family when Judd comes around.I would recommend this lovely film to any dog lover and families who like to watch movies together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Message Sender","review":"I love all kinds of dogs particularly hounds and I really enjoyed watching Shiloh II Shiloh season.

I will never-ever read a collaboration novel that involves Oke and another author again. Both of their writings were too jumbled and did not flow well. I was able to figure out who wrote what, and you shouldn't be able to do that - both of the authors writings should mesh together in unison. I thought Bunn's writing overpowered Oke's. Since I focused so much on the techniques, I did not enjoy the plot one bit. I finished this book feeling unfulfilled. A huge disappointment - I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap fun Seiya figure","review":"Now for the price you pay, depending upon how much, I didn't go above 14 dollars, but these things are also hard to find. It has great poseability and you can stick the wings onto the Pegasus or onto Seiya, but ultimately this figure won't measure up to the quality of the God Clothes, but if you're not looking to shell out big bucks and you want to play with him than this would be a cool figure to buy. He comes with only the Pegasus and wings to attach to both Seiya and the Pegasus. Coloring is fine though keep in mind, it's fine for a regular retail figure. It's good for a regular retail figure, but ultimately not the high end figures that Bandai Japan exports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of the world go around","review":"I remember so well Mr Deon Jackson with his big hit Love Makes the World go Round, it scored big in Philadelphia and we just couldn't wait to see the man who sang this popular song and our expectations were well met with galdness at the Uptown Theater in the 60s.

I am speaking of the Future Interests section in particular.In order explain concepts, the book uses terms that are defined later in the chapter, and simply gives examples without clarifying.I think the authors are capable of explaining these concepts in an understandable way, but fail to do so. This is evident once you use the Gilberts outline written by Dukeminier, where concepts are well defined. Perhaps this is a ploy to sell more Gilberts. Regardless, the textbook leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Law School Book","review":"This book will give you many hypotheticals, which you have know way of knowing the answer for sure and the book will not tell you the answer. Much of the book is worthless, you can guess what the answers are by they never tell you, and many of the Hypothetical are much different than the case preceding them, you have no clue what the right answer is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Textbook","review":"Possibly the worst textbook I've had to use so far in law school. The editors include a lot of unnecessary historical information that is no longer applicable. The cases are edited fine, but the notes that explain the concepts after the cases are confusing and don't really explain the concepts very well. The inclusion of pictures is not helpful; I'd rather not pay extra for pictures that don't explain the core concepts of property."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not like you have a choice","review":"Yes, that is the sad truth of casebooks, regardless of what I put here you will be paying too much for it. What would Posner say about that choice?Well, I agree with other reviewers that this is a very well written casebook, the editors do a good job of tying their little infuriating hypotheticals and questions into the text.On the other hand, Aspen casebooks are horrible. You are going to have red and black paint all over anything that touches these crappy books and they are going to fall apart the second time you open them.However, this property book is exciting because it is so small. It is much smaller than your average casebook and fits snugly in your hand. Why? I have no idea.

It is as good a description of this unique writing style as you will get. The list of poems making up Drought is a bit misleading - in general the segments are prose poems ... or prose. However, there is a narrative line - a very powerful tale of the death of a relationship within the stress of drought.The second piece \\"Say what you like\\" is less memorable than \\"Drought\\". In this case the relationship includes abuse - and when the relationship disolves the identity of the individuals is rendered uncertain in the best postmodern style.A new poet/author's whose work is well worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I got this ring recently from Amazon and its tiny.

Note: I purchased it from another website at a much higher price. addendum: After nine months to a year the product no longer functioned properly or predictably. I no longer have a use for it.

This movie is not about being a Gene Hackman fan or Henry Thomas fan, although I am a fan of both. It's about human emotion and family relationships, namely father and son. It's a story that really draws you in so that you relate to the characters. I cry every time I see this film so you might want to have some tissues on hand. If you like a good drama, then you'll definitely like this movie. ENJOY THE SHOW!

Alas, if you buy \\"Paul Simon Greatest Hits Songtab Edition\\" you're not going to get anything close to authentic transcriptions on most of the included songs. The arrangements in this book are often quite nice in and of themselves, but considered as transcriptions, most of them would rate from mediocre to poor. While this book might appeal to someone seeking simplified fingerstyle arrangements of Paul Simon songs, for the intermediate to advanced guitarist seeking genuine recorded-version transcriptions, this book can only be something of a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Sufficient, but NECESSARY to excel on the LSAT!!!","review":"At first, I didn't want to spend the money, but This book breaks down every type of question to its smallest parts.

Despite what many people say about how great this book is, it is not a miracle maker. I found that this book actually decreased my ability to read the questions correctly - their methods are actually very time consuming and could be detrimental for your prep. Powerscore's marketing strategy is really to mock other prep company's materials, but they're not really different from other companies. I would recommend LSAC's OWN PREPRERATION MATERIAL - no one can make a prep better than the actual test makers themselves. If you have money, just buy LSAC's 3 LSAT books that have explanations inthem. This is a waste of money and valuable time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will actually boost your scores","review":"There are no classes anyone in my state that someone can take to help prepare for the LSAT.

I started my practice tests in mock trials at 151, and got a 163, which is 89th percentile on the actual test. I firmly believe if I had kept on studying, I could have scored even higher.

Fewer still provide as accurate of a model for understanding the development and operation of the modern linguistic conflicts and sloganeering which revolves around regulation of economic activity.This book is a must for readers emergent from the idealistic haze of liberterianism who want to reintegrate the importance of human groups and religious belief systems into their thinking.

That you shouldn't be allowed to sell anything below what it cost you to buy/produce it (whatever that is supposed to mean)?

I think it's time we move female characters beyond revenge marriages and hanging with abusive men past all reasonable limits. Lianna is an enjoyable character, unusually educated and business savvy for her times, but very foolish in love. She falls hard for Rogan, despite the fact that he is a hate filled, revenge seeking slob who cannot even remember her name. Of course, in the end, he learns the error of his ways and they live happily ever after. The historical detail is very well researched. Rogan is likely reasonably true to men of the time, but I'm skeptical that Lianna represents even a remotely typical women of the era. I've given it four stars, simply because I enjoyed it so much, but with misgivings large enough that if the story and Lianna weren't so likeable I'd probably have given it only 1 or 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted","review":"I have been reading romance novels longer than I can remember.

He was the meanest, most ruthless hero I've ever read and I couldn't imagine how I'd come to love or at least like him.

I have read some of her other books and this one did not disappoint at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the world romance and compelling mystery","review":"Jayne Anne Krentz, aka Jayne Castle, always has intriguing characters and often has complex puzzles. This book ranks up with the best in both - unusual characters in a world far away, but sufficiently familiar not to be totally put-offing. And when the mystery was solved and the book was far from over, I knew there was more to come (but I didn't see what/who was coming)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, Fun and Entertaining!","review":"I thought it was a fun read! I enjoyed the light-heartedness of the mystery. But wait....is it a mystery or a romance or a sci fi tale? It has elements of all three. The story is set in the future on a distant planet. Many of the inhabitants have paranormal abilities. I found the story fun and the concepts presented fascinating. Set aside your disbeliefs and let Jayne Castle take you on an entertaining jouney to New St Helens. This book is the first in a series. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amaryllis","review":"I found this novel to be very lacking as a science fiction/ romance. I think that it is truly one of the worst books that I have ever read. As a romance novel I thought that it moved along to fast. One minute they were having an agrument, the next minute they were practically sleeping with each other. As a science fiction novel it was absolutely horrible. Ms. Castle did not take enough time to talk about the plot or defined it as it needed to be. Frankly, if I hadn't read a book worse than this recently this book would be getting a one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a believable futuristic OR romance","review":"The romance between Amaryllis and Lucas wasn't much to write home about, and the world Castle has created is a confusing mix of earth words and concepts and fantasy.Amaryllis is a prism, which in psychic terms means she can help focus talents, and this just adds another confusing dimension.It's definitely not my kind of book. I prefer the older Quick books with their better love scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book went from boring to just really bad...","review":"This is the second book that I have read by this author, under the name Jayne Ann Krentz. I picked it up from the library. Had I known this book was by the same author that wrote, \\"Dawn in Eclipse Bay,\\" I wouldn't have bothered.Not only was the concept not believable but it was just plain stupid. The writing is juvenile and the characters were neither interesting nor likable. I found myself not caring one way or another about the out come of the book. ...

Ha! \\"Deep in the Heart\\" won't win you any friends from Texas (\\"that's why we moved our band!\\"), \\"Hole in My Soul\\" and \\"Ain't it Funny,\\" all great.

Here the translator of the texts chooses to render certain difficult and problematic passages as if they would appear contrary to a coregency, while exact translations reveal that they are not indeed. So while the book is good in general, it is to be avoided when dealing with historical and, most of all, chronological problems related to the succession of Amenhotep III. See for this the strong comments of F. J. Giles and A. B. Knapp in 'The Amarna Age: Western Asia', vol. 1, 1997."},{"rating":"2","title":"kids twill pull on pants","review":"These pants are of good quality.

And sometimes it's nice to be reminded of the movie without having to watch it. But honestly, this probably isn't an album to buy unless you've already got everything else. Depite \\"Scarborough Fair\\" and \\"The Sound of Silence\\", this album rarely gets off of my shelf--it's a pain to have to program my CD player to skip \\"On the Strip,\\" etc. every time I want to listen to the disc.

To enjoy a novel, I have to be able to like the protagonist and more or less enjoy reading about his or her adventures. In this case, I grew to quickly dislike McCade because I found him to be irritatingly stupid, and because he was so stupid his adventures weren't interesting or entertaining. Added to that was my feeling that the world Dietz created for McCade was pretty unimaginative, at least compared to the authors I've really enjoyed -- David Weber, Jack Campbell, Ian Douglas/William Keith, Catherine Asaro, et al.So my advice is to not waste your time on this -- it's not hard to find something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 really again.

The frequency response was not flat. It had a very strong high frequency attenuation, explaining why my keyboards sounded so dull. The unit still picked up noise with a regulated power supply. I also found that the mixer inverts your signal. Generally this isn't much of a concern, but if you ever have a situation where you need to listen to both your source signal and the mixer output at the same time, you will get signal cancellation.I suppose the performance of this unit is due to the low cost.

Firstly, the picture quality is not consistently good. Secondly, the content is mostly biographical, which is to be expected, of course, but is overall rather staid. Indeed, the information on the political, industrial, and social developments of the Bronte period is satisfactory, albeit presented in a sullen tone. Lively interviews with scholars, writers, and students of the Bronte works would have introduced a variety of view points on the Bronte sisters. Also, such interviews would have breathed some life into this documentary which relies almost exclusively on a narrator's voice with occasional and somewhat dull dramatizations of journals and novel excerpts. Only the view of the Yorkshire moors and their influence on the Bronte Sisters' work make this documentary worth some attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Happy Hardcore","review":"This CD Is great for people who like Happy Hardcore.

My advice is to read Maria Nemeth's \\"Mastering Life's Energies\\". The tools are pragmatic, simple, do not cross over into psychotherapizing the client, and get to the root of the problem in a direct, succinct manner. Free association and overuse of metaphors is not as powerful of a method for coaching as it is for therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new under the sun ...","review":"Average book elaborated on nice but not surprising model.

To much \\"fluff\\". They wrote the book as if they totally created the concept of 'Life Coaching' themselves. To spend a whole chapter on 'Intuition'...Please! The authors feel as if they have to explain the same skill over and over, and twenty different ways. I totally lost interest, and couldn't even finish the book. And I think the \\"Gremlin idea\\" is stupid. I'm not telling my client a Gremlin took their motivation! That being said, this book is going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"The theory of co-active coaching that provides the title for this book makes sense: By making the interaction between coach and coachee a relationship of equals, both parties will feel less constrained by pre-assigned roles, and thereby freed to learn from another. Unfortunately, the rest of the book fails to live up to the promise of the initial intriguing, yet common-sense idea. Specifically, the coaching methods and tools described by the authors never progress beyond generalities that basically amount to this: The client already has the answers, the coach just has to bring them out by being curious and creating a safe place where the client can be honest and take risks. However, we [...] do recommend this book on the basis of a few features, like the excellent sample dialogues and illustrative hypothetical examples, which provide simple but valuable lessons to managers, consultants, teachers and all manner of would-be coaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"how-to\\" for aspiring professional coaches","review":"Personal and Professional Coaching is THE service job of the 90s.

I bought it because I was interested in learning it in order to possibly become a coach myself. So I believe in the system, but I found the book difficult to wade through. So many words that the points get buried. Too much to read that just goes on and is not terribly enlightening. I've now read the whole thing and am not sure that I know anything I didn't know before.

I was equally excited about that book. You may to include Taming Your Gremlin by Carson as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Co-Active Coaching - Very Helpful","review":"I have tried several books written for coaches offering guidance, resources, tools, business strategies for coaches. However, sometimes I have been disappointed. This book does work for me and other colleagues in coaching because for over 1 1/2 years, I have used and continue to use this book extensively as: 1)it was required text for graduate-level Organizational Development degree course; 2) required text for my current coach certification training program (MentorCoach LLC); and 3) it is a helpful desktop reference with forms and a CD--good for both established and new coaches. My copy is well-worn and I intend to keep this book in my coaching toolkit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too 'warm & fuzzy' for business application","review":"The first few chapters were a turnoff for myself and a few others who I asked to read some of it. Maybe alright for personal counseling and 'new agey' life coaching, but not for business-focused coaching, for managers and supervisors coaching skills development, and for executive and business coaches. Unfortunate because there are some useful frameworks and tools presented in places in later chapters but even they are mixed with over-soft platitudes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Therapist to Co-Active Coach","review":"I first got this book from the local library.

Instead, I found what I see all too often in training and human resource works: a presentation of a single methodology which the author has developed, which is not very flexible and focuses on the methodology more than the client's results. I think coaching involves processes which are to be flexibly applied depending on individual, environment, other performers, etc. So I'm not a fan on lock-step techniques which we superimpose on everyone as if we're trying to fix equipment. Perhaps with a different title and subtitle, I wouldn't have been expecting something else (and wouldn't have purchased the book). One final comment: I see no indication of validity of the approaches, merely the assertion that the author practices them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life coaching - not business coaching","review":"This book presents some useful strategies for life coaching.

I was less fond of Nocturama than previous releases mainly due to relatively weak lyrics. These two discs are as lyrically deep as they are musically. Nick is really a modern straggler from the romantic period. His words look as beautiful on paper as they do in song. The sound of these 2 cds is very mature...not to mean it's not still raw and experimental at times. Two very different albums in one package. Abattoir Blues simply rocks! This is powerful stuff. The only song I can't really digest is \\"Breathless\\". It rather amused me the first time I heard it, but now it's grown to be more of an annoyance. I don't think the reggae tinge works. That's just me though. I've seen others point to \\"The Lyre of Orpheus\\" and \\"The Fable of the Brown Ape\\" as weak points and those are favorites of mine. But everyone seems to agree that it's a damn fine release. Cheers Nick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best release of 2004","review":"There is no musician on Earth who is better suited for releasing a double album than Nick Cave.Cave, who has always presented two sides of himself: the snarling man seeking revenge, or the introspective man seeking redemption, has used these sides to his advantage and has released one of the best album in the entire catalogue of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds.As others have said, one disk is more manic in its energy and the other is more laid back. However, both contain Cave's wit and excellent song writing, making it hard to pick a favorite of the two.The Bad Seeds, who have always provided such a powerful element that matches Cave's voice, have been joined by the London Community Gospel Choir, who add even more substance to the music.Simply put, this is the best release of 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has to be heard to be believed.","review":"This is one of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds albums ever.

The packaging was beautiful- I love good packaging- it's a silkscreened fabric box-- but the contents...well, maybe I didn't give it enough of a listen but I couldn't get through it. It had choirs and all kinds of schmaltz that I did not see coming from Mr. Cave. I guess finding Christ was not good for him artistically. Maybe if I picked it up again and gave it another shot, but when I hear a choir, I generally have to think they've hit the \\"We are the World\\" point creatively. The only choir I can tolerate, generally, are real ones singing actual classical music, or the Polyphonic Spree. Other than that, I don't want to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant. Captivating. Addictive.","review":"I'm not sure whether to consider this an amazingly successful new incarnation of Nick Cave, or the perfect culmination of all his work to date. It contains all the great riffs, anger and darkness of Murder Ballads plus all the smooth, insightful and moving lyricism of Boatman's Call and No More Shall We Part. I used to think Nick Cave's early and later work was produced by two different people, both of whom just happened to be named Nick Cave. In this album, those two people meld to form one beautiful whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Mother of Sunshine","review":"Nick Cave seems to have experienced an epiphany, drawing on gospel, rhythm and blues and earthy blues to piece together what is perhaps the most emotionally satisfying collection of his career.

Yet, the haunting refrains still lurk beneath the surface which is what makes this 2 CD set so memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathless","review":"A satisfying album. The mood on every Cave album differs, however, this one follows in the steps of Nocturama where it is more upbeat, yet mellow and a bit restrained. The mellow songs are excellent, perfect tunes to relax or chill-out to on a beautiful day.Breathless has got to be my favorite, a very melodic, happy, acoustic tune...if only more of those were present (even though I believe this song has been lying around in some format or another for years, a [gloomy] version of it was performed with Kylie a few years back).Although the heavier tunes are solid (Get Ready For Love, There She Goes..), it sometimes seems as if the band is just banging away mindlessly on their instruments. The [heavier] melodies aren't as sweet as they used to be. Nevertheless, you cannot go wrong with purchasing this album. Mr. Cave has still got it (praise the Lord!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good easy listening","review":"few, if anyone, can match Clint' fantastic voice - not all tracks are him singing, but this is a nice, smooth album for easy listening"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed Mr. Walker's singing but a little disappointed in CD","review":"Clint Walker has a lovely, mellifluous voice and I enjoy hearing his singing. The musical choices reflect his abilities well. However, I didn't realize that a few of the songs would be done by a women's chorus rather than Mr. Walker. The songs are lovely and well done, but it's such a treat to hear a strong, manly voice in song, that hearing the chorus disappointed me. I thought that he had made an album of ballads years ago, but I can't find any information about it. On this album, \\"With These Hands\\" was my favorite, but my twelve-year-old daughter prefers \\"My Kind of Country.\\" It would be great to see a collection of his songs from \\"Cheyenne\\" and his various movies also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another piece of genius.....NOT!","review":"This game is just sad.

I absolutely recommend this game to every single Gamecube gamer alive! The Graphics are great, the story is great, it's extremely addictive, and the music isn't bad either.The only downside of this game is its length. I beat it in two weeks.

Use these books as a guide for every subject (english, math, history, science, art, music) and add a few workbooks like math and science to make school work easy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If my son can finish and understand what this book covered..","review":"If my son can finish this book and understand what this book covered, I don't know what he can learned in the next 6 years. Besides the math is way too simple. The other materials are way to complicate and too difficult for 1st grader. My son attended a private school. The school mostly follow this book for the teaching materials.When other kids in other schools learning living, non-living objects and air, water, solid objects, my son was learning digestive system, nervous system and that Maya worship natural gods.You tell me, smart parents, do you really learned those stuff in your first grade?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor set up","review":"I do not like this book. I like the idea of it--but I don't like it this way. It seems poorly set up and not what I expected. I bought it as a homeschooler to compare what kids would learn it public school, but I quickly sold it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whole series is a bit off.","review":"As a former teacher and current homeschooler, I find that much of the material in the early levels of this series are not appropriate for the grade levels indicated. I use the books as references but not usually at the grade indicated by the title of the book. The history sections are especially inappropriate. Children at these early grade levels do not have enough background knowledge (i.e., comprehension of the passage of time and the geography of the earth in relation to their own place in it) to fully understand the material presented. Thus, they are very unlikely to retain the knowledge or to apply it meaningfully to other areas of study. Parents trying to stick to these grade levels are bound to be frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE textbook on squeeze play","review":"This isn't the sort of book you pick up for 10 minutes before bed... it's the sort that you read at a desk with a pad and paper to take notes with! If you're willing to put the time and effort into a serious reading of this book, however, you will learn a tremendous amount.If you're looking for an accessible, casual introduction to the subject, look elsewhere (I highly recommend David Bird's _Bridge Squeezes for Everyone_). It's also not suitable for beginning players. This is a book for serious study but is well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by an non-expert bridge player","review":"Absolutely fantastic book on squeezes! The book gives a fairly complete survey all types of squeezes and explains the background and particular structure of each type. It does not just give a lot of diagrams and shows that a squeeze of some type exists. Instead it provides a very clear description of all conditions and the reasoning behind 'the cards should be played in this particular order'. I especially love the chapters on double compound squeezes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE definitive textbook on squeezes--bar none.","review":"If you are a true student of the game, whether intermediate or expert, and you are comfortable with a \\"textbook\\" type structure (most science and math people are) then this is an absolute MUST for your bridge education. Suffice it to say that I read it for the first time in 1970 and 5 times since (the last in 1997-8), and have expanded my knowledge of this subject significantly each time. This is a book that requires time and devotion. If you are willing to put in the effort, and you have any talent whatsoever, this book will add to your enjoyment of this greatest of card games immeasurably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent research","review":"This is a companion volume to \\"Fallen Soviet Generals\\" and goes through the descriptions of what happened to Soviet officers who were captured. Some like Vlasov would join the Germans in one form or another and others would continue to resist German recruitment efforts yet in the end be labeled 'traitors' by the Soviet government and Stalin. It would take at times decades for this label to be taken off and for their families to receive the respect and pensions that they are deserving of for what their husbands or father's had to do and sacrifice. Just like Maslov's other book this one uses a variety of sources and research that is going on to the present day to give a history and explanation for each General and the circumstances he found himself in when captured. Very useful and well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well worth the money??????","review":"\\"Well worth the money.\\" This is a quote from the previous reviewer. Depends on how you look at it. Personally I think that having to fork out the sum $ 150,00 for a book of some 250 pages, a new book that is, not some rare bibliophile first edition, or a copy signed by Stalin, is a bit steep. I could even go one better and say that this price is bl**dy ridiculous, no matter how interesting the subject is!$ 150,00I!! Go sit on it, mr. Maslov!. Geez! I mean: couldn't you get some money form some corrupt superrich Russian oligarch, who then would support the arts instead of blowing all his money on some English Premier League soccer team? That would be better than robbing us poor Eastern Front afficionados. $ 150,00..tsk, honestly, I ask you......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Interesting","review":"We have had several of the Kumon workbooks over the years and they have always been fun and exciting for our children to work through the problems.

I wish I had looked at it more closely. As someone else said, it's the same 2 types of games throughout the entire book. Gets very boring very quickly even with different pictures on each page. One side of the page has a connect the number (which my son will do with no problem) and the other side is color by number which he hates. I would have thought a book of games would have been more varied. As it was, it was pretty disappointing for the money.And, as with all the Kumon books we've purchased, the pages don't tear out. The weight of the pages is pretty heavy so it's hard to keep the book open well without breaking the spine.

One of the best stories in the Elminster story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elminster's Daughter - Quite the Chase.","review":"Ed Greenwood writes another epic tale. Although Elminster barely is in this one you will enjoy the usual style of the author. It does differ in one aspect of his tales. This one is more or less one long chase scene. I have all of Ed's books on my shelves and am now getting these awesome tales on my Kindle. On dead trees or as an e-book, Greenwood never disappoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacked focus and depth","review":"I love thieves and rogue chars so I thought I would love this book. I was a fan of the first 3 books in the Elminster Series and I don't like short stories so Elminster in Hell wasn't my style but that was forgivable. This book had a habit of going ADD on story lines of chars that didn't matter, the thief daughter wasn't wrote about near enough and what chapters one did get about her were generally cluttered with parts about characters not her or action scenes that gave no depth of personality. The book started off strong enough that I was to invested not to finish it but the last half was a chore with little reward. It was interesting to note that a naked woman made an appearance somewhere in almost every chapter in some nonchalant way. Overall, not a terrible book but it would of been better served if it focused on the daughter more. I hope to read more about her in the future but this book isn't one I'd seriously recommend to anyone but the most die hard Elminster fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Find","review":"This is Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures 1910 ed, leather with the Gold Cross and Crown insignia, by Mary Baker Eddy.

I showed it to the Reading Room attendant, who was amazed, it's like it belongs in a museum. Trust me, it is treasured, loved, revered, and kept in the bubble wrap and in a plastic ZipLock bag as are all of my rare and beloved books, when not in use.

More distressing than that was her inability to develop her characters; there was so much more that could have been said about Verdi, Rowe and Johnson. Kitt and Posie,however were well structured characters. This book was so unlike her other very great works. It was as though someone was forcing her to write a new book or else her \\"public might forget about her\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMENAL","review":"After reading Tumbling I knew that there was no way Diane McKinney-Whetstone would be able to top such an impressive debut: boy, was I wrong. Blues Dancing is phenomenal. I love that in McKinney-Whetstone's world there are no heroes or villains, just very real, very flawed human beings. Verdi's protected and ultra-safe world comes unhinged when her first (and only) true love, Johnson, comes back to town after a separation that's lasted more than 20 years. Verdi's been involved with another man, Rowe, the man she credits as having saved her life from the hell that Johnson introduced her to in the first place. I won't give anything away but if you loved Tumbling (and who didn't?) then you will also appreciate this masterpiece! Diane McKinney-Whetstone is my new favorite, contemporary author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I've read Tempest Rising, and Tumbling from this author.

When it arrived, I started reading it, again immediately, and couldn't put it down. Insightful book on the times and what could and did go wrong with many of us in that era. The book moves along and is very well written and the characters were vivid. High recommend it to those who lived through that era and to those who want to learn more about this period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue and Sad Narrative","review":"This book had very depressing undertones. Even when the characters are supposed to be happy, they feel sad. I don't get it?The characters personalities were not fleshed-out enough. Certain characters I could never really understand who they were, and how they fit into the overall scheme of the story.There are too many holes in this book. Since the author jumped from the 70's to the 90's she should have done a better job of filling in the gaps.Someone gave me this book, and I am very glad. I would have been very upset if I had actually shelled out money for this story.I do not recommend this dull and boring book to anyone. And, I will never read another story by Diane McKinney-Whetstone. An author gets only \\"1\\" chance to impress me. First impressions, are the lasting impressions.

At least I did finish this one, I can't say the same for Tumbling. I obviously missed something in this book! This was my book club's read for this month, everyone struggled with this book! I can't really explain what it was, but whatever it is, it is the same in Tumbling!

When all is said and done the blues that exists between Verdi and Johnson cannot be denied and the love they share is enough to orchestrate another dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dearborn Plows","review":"I found this book very informative.

As for all Wayne Dyers books, the words alone bring an inner peace, an immediate positive outlook and assist me in staying in the moment and growing continuously into the person and spirit I want and am meant to be. All of his books have inspired me. This book I am enjoying especially because I feel like each entry is teaching me to put it all into action, to live the path to enlightenment with an instruction book at my side from incredible teachers that I am sincerely grateful for.

It's empty headed blather, full of misrepresentation, error and confusion. I cannot speak to the Zen, Hindu and some other references, but the discussion of the Christian, Jewish and Moslem traditions are utterly without merit. If you're looking for a cheap emotional high typical of the so-called \\"new age\\" genre, this book is for you. If you want real insight and thoughtful, scholarly interpretation and comparison, look elsewhere. At best this book is a waste of time, at worst it's spiritual cyanide. Dyer got off to such a good start with \\"Erroneous Zones\\", but his material since then continues to plumb new depths of pseudo-spiritual tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it, maybe you do?!","review":"It depends if you are interested in reading about important people from the past and what they have teached the world. I just ignored that, because I wanted to know Dyer his ideas, although it was the main reason of writing this book for Dyer. Anywayz I consider it's a summary and/or rehash of all his ealier books and/ or ideas. Next to it almost every page is about God this and God that and I'm not that religious, so it quite bothered me. The main thing in this book is: mediate, do yoga or something like that, don't be afraid to be yourself and do not let anyone manipulate you etc. Just borrow it from someone like I did and get the info you want and need...."},{"rating":"1","title":"i see an error","review":"in one of the texts, he used E.E.

I'd like to xerox them off and put on walls for inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Ego please.","review":"Although Mr. Dyer's selection of great people and their work has a lot to offer, his ego spoiled the scene. He inserts numerous plugs for his other products, and too many examples from his own life.

I had read some of his early self-help books. While they were okay for what they were, I found them lacking depth. This was a clearly deeper and more spiritual man. So, I bought the book. It was likewise deeper and more spiritual than those early works. Dyer presents topics and relevant quotes from sages of the ages. He then presents his ideas, observations, and sometimes examples from his own life as they relate to a given topic.The book is thoughtful and well written. It didn't change my life.

TECHNO should have been what was on the cd even if what was in the movie wasn't enough for a cd how about extra tracks by the same artists. That I can accept.

So where is the music that's actually from the movie, on this soundtrack? In my opinion, the two best songs are the mix of \\"Confusion\\" by New Order, which was an 80s synth-pop group, but now supposedly does techno, and \\"Playing with Lightning\\" by Expansion Union, another good techno group. Secondly, there was no rap in the movie. So where did the rap on this \\"soundtrack\\" come from. I'm not a fan of rap/hip hop or whatever it's called. So i got really angry when i saw that instead of this CD being a great techno compilation, it was just another rap-lovers' CD. Techno fans, the only good things you'll find here are the few techno songs at the end. But you can thank the guy that made this \\"soundtrack\\" and left out all the good stuff so he could replace it with crap music, that wasn't even in the movie, for that. I gave it two stars for the two good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Techno less rap please","review":"I was very dissapointed after buying this cd.Then why give it two stars only for one great song on it and that's track 12 by New Order that's played at the begining of the film.Other then that one song,the soundtrack is pure garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Blade was an excellent movie (one of my favorites) and I was very intrigued by the music. However, this disc does not appear to contain any of the songs (like the rave scene at the start) that I liked. What happened? And why? The rap songs did not stick out in the movie yet they seem to dominate the CD. How disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drat!!!! Foiled Again!","review":"Much like many of the other reviews, I found this disk to be full of music that I didn't hear in the movie... I thought the point of a movie soundtrack was to compile all of the cool music highlighted in a film and make it easily accesible to the consumer... Boy was I wrong. .... I too returned the disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?","review":"The movie was pretty crummy, but I loved the techno music. So i bought this, and it's crap.

The first eleven rap tracks are alright if you are into that but I wouldnt have bought the album if these were the tunes I heard in the movie. I returned the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I wasn't watching the movie as closely as I thought","review":"Where did all this rap come from? I don't remember it in the movie... I remember quite a lot of electronica, but not most of the music thats on here. I *do* remember the music from the club in the beginning... first song we hear in the movie is... 12th on the CD??? Its an odd mix of rap and electronic, being rather light on the electronica and extremely heavy on the rap. Maybe I should watch the movie again, but this isn't what I heard the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half of this music did not appear in the movie.","review":"Having seen Blade, I really fell in love with the sound track they had going. It fit the action scenes wonderfully (especially the opening rave scene), and had more energy than you could hold in.Having bought the CD, did I really see the same movie? The first ten tracks are unlistenable tough-guy gangsta rap. The tone of the movie shows through on the later 5 tracks, including a phenomenal New Order mix.The later 3rd of the CD is really really good, the first 2/3 I can't stand. 2 stars, and shame on the person who blew this opportunity to make something really shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"I don't often write reviews, but this CD really [upset] me. This isn't even close to a soundtrack album. It's 95% rap. The awesome techno that made the film rock is almost completely missing. Do yourself a favor and find the real tunes on other CDs. This one's a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gross misrepresentation of the films music","review":"I guess there should have been two volumes of music for this movie, what was in the movie and what was not. The movie was okay but I really liked the music. when I bought the soundtrack the bulk of it was rap. I was expecting a lot more techno. be careful because if you dont like rap you won't like this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Comment, Different Guy","review":"Its officially a consensus that this disc needed more techno from the movie, please at least list where I might find the actual techno tracks other than the 4 on the CD, the other comments pretty much cover the situation, the whole reason I came to the site in the first place is to find the TECHNO tracks, I saw the movie and it was killer bought the disc and found myself screwed, deny me not the music I desire, I don't want to waste more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"WANT TECHNO....NOT MUCH HERE!!!!!!","review":"THE MOVIE WAS THE BOMB THE SOUNDTRACK IS A BOMB! GREAT TECHNO TUNES ALL THROUGH-OUT THE MOVIE AND THE FIRST HALF OF THE ALBUM IS RAP. WAS THA DILLY YO? THE BEST TUNE ON HERE IS THE REMIX OF NEW ORDERS CONFUSION!

I was going to be a happy \\"sucker\\"... So... Why all the RAP?!?!?? I mean, if it were a PART of the film, fine, but RETCH!!! Picasso released as a paint by numbers...

After watching the movie, which I liked, I thought I wanted the sound track, but I'm not sure from the samples that the very song that is techno is even on the CD. The song is the one that is played when all the vampires are dancing in their club waiting for the kill right before Blade comes to the rescue. Does anyone know where I can find that music piece or if it is one the CD. I don't want to buy it if it isn't and I don't care for rap so I'm not even sure I want t spend for the whole CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"how do you want it/california love","review":"I was very disappointed in this transaction.

It is so captivating, and coupled with your own quality dinosaur models, makes such a gift of lifetime interest; it is a shame to not purchase the dramatic larger Zipbin. This size is easier for a toddler to carry, but that age passes so rapidly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy mini ZipBins - they are not worth the money.","review":"I have purchased other ZipBins in the past and loved them. They are durable and my boys enjoy playing with them and carrying around their various toys or legos in them.

Definitely. Screech advances some rather different thoughts on not only shunga but ukioyo-e prints in general that should leave you thinking. Yet, as firm as Screech's views are and as consistently as he advances them throughout the book, they do not overbear. Thinking through his points and exploring the images offered takes on into new and intriguing territory. It is a fun trip.The writing suffers from some occasionally very tortured passages. The lack of an index and any sort of cross referencing of the illustrations is a significant detraction. Neither of these is enough to counsel against the book, but are frustrating on occassion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality for little kids","review":"This book was a birthday gift for our small naturally born daughter on the eve of our adoption of an older child from a foreign land.Unlike most other readily available adoption titles for little kids (with the exception of Let's Talk About Adoption), this book shows real photos of real babies, kids, birthparents and adoptive parents.It explains in very simple terms why some parents cannot care for their children, and would choose to place them for adoption. It also shows photographs of real adoptive parents who cannot bear children of their own, who desperately want children.And it introduces the idea that adults have often been adopted too. One child in this book tells his teacher that he was adopted, and the teacher confides that she too was adopted as a child.Altogether this book provides a great introduction to the beauty of adoption as a way to build a family. Being a family means loving one another no matter what. Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't care for it","review":"I didn't care for this book at all.

Brookes echoes Bush administration phrases, hardly quotes from scholarly work at all, uses colloquial language and skims over thousands of issues like someone who pretends to just want to give you a quick overview, but essentially, Brookes doesn't have anything to offer but a quick cash-in into a currently hot topic with a quickly-written book that isn't worth its money."},{"rating":"2","title":"No First-Rank Classic, But Worthwhile","review":"ROMA CITTA LIBERA, something of a fizzle in its day and virtually unseen for over fifty years, has turned up in one of No Share's spiffy DVD transfers, providing many pleasures for fans of 40's Italian film. Filled with too many formula picture touches to really qualify as neorealism, ROMA nevertheless features many familiar faces from the great movies of the period -- de Sica and Valentina Cortese, for starters. The actors, writers, director, cinematographer and composer (you'll recognize Rota's principal song here from its reuse in Fellini) may have all achieved greater glory elsewhere, but ROMA's wry wit and wistful humanity cast a melancholy spell that's frequently pure magic. If this picture piques your interest, chances are you'll find it quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Materials","review":"I was looking for the Case Logic case which wasn't available. I have owned many Case Logic cases in the past and have never been disappointed by them. But being this was the only choice i found for a faceplate case, i decided to give it a gamble. The service and shipping were great but the quality of the product is less than expected. The material is a cheap vinyl material that will probably not hold up to heat or cold. The nylon used by Case Logic is much better and lasts a long time. All i can say for this, is its better than nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer be ware","review":"The case is fine, actually it's really great. My problem is that the vendor sent me two when I only ordered one. They did allow me to return it but charged me restocking fee. You have to decide if you want to deal with these guys. I would sure see if someone else has this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, bad translation","review":"This is a really great story, especially if you like Megaman. But if you have seen the Japanese version of the Anime, you will probably get a little annoyed that they used the English version of the Anime's sound effects and slogans. Example - Japan says \\"Plug-In\\", whereas English says \\"Download\\", and other random things like that. One main thing that got me was how both this series and the anime came up with different names for some characters, even different from the American games! Such as Maylu for Mayl.. and giving some characters such as Mesa a western accent. Oh well, can't have everything, at least they brought it over here in English :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"My review","review":"Okay, first off the manga followed the game, not the anime. So all of the people who've only seen the anime might not follow this.Second off, once again Viz horribaly dubbs this English version, using the (also horribaly dubbed) anime names, cheap dialouge in place of bad words, and bulky English sound effects.All in all, story line was good, fight scenes were good, and once again Viz destrys the good name of a good series.You can see this in ZOIDS, Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, One Peice, and other Viz liscenced mangas. In my opinion, messing up the names, dialouge, and sound effects is as bad as printing completely blank pages. Whenever Viz decides to change this, I'll be willing to comply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great angel book!

In ways I hear Enigma and other artist, but when the last song is played you still know that B-Tribe is playing and that your either dancing to the beat or relaxing to it.

I just need to buy one more of their cd's and then look forward to buying more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I have been a big fan of the b-tribe for the past 9 years. CDs like Sensual Sensual, Suave Suave, Fiesta Fatal, and Spiritual Spiritual are the best in the Spanish/New Age genre that have ever been made by anybody. This CD seems to be a try by the group into Jazz/New Age genre. They should stay with what they know best. This CD was certainly a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true wake up call for the airline industry!","review":"I would have to say that if anyone starts touting this a \\"right-wing\\" book, then I accuse them of having not read the book at all. (Merely seeing the words doesn't count, just as hearing and listening are very different.)Michael Smerconish writes a great book about how silly and ineffective our airline security has become. Perhaps his only mistake was getting an endorsement from Rep. Sen. Arlen Specter before going to print. Had he added Dem. Sen. Joe Lieberman to the cover, all those left wing loonies would have been forced to shut their traps.This is not a Republican issue, this is not a Democratic issue. This book is also not an open invitation to use profiling as the only means of defense. Merely, the book tries to portray the fact that when it comes to dealing with terrorism, we are afraid of even whispeing the words \\"young arab males.\\" A great read, for those who actually read."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st is the Worst!","review":"We've all heard it: 1st is the worst! SO TRUE! The first season of this show was horrendous. Seriously! Things only got GOOD on this show when the girls started to grow up and when Aunt Becky (Summerland's Lori Loughlin) came along. Plus, there was some cross-dressing and gay humor in a few episodes. Just don't buy the worst season! It is evil! Plus, everyone was ugly and stupid in the 1st season and the jokes weren't funny.

Finally a DVD that our entire family can watch together. Never any fighting or extended suspense, and plenty of humor that appeals to adults. BUT. . .The DVD sounds CRAPPY. I have a home theater setup, and this is the ONLY DVD in my extensive collection that routes ALL the sound to the center channel only and cuts out the low frequencies. VERY disappointing. Maybe this won't be an issue for you if you listen through the TV speaker, but really, this DVD on my system sounds HORRIBLY tinny.If bad sound annoys you, do what I now do. Full House is now on heavy syndication rotation on Nickelodeon and other cable channels. Just set the DVR/TIVO/VCR or what have you to record and timeshift the Full House episodes (I can currently catch two different ones per night). The sound on playback is fine, and 1000% better than the DVD.

Although normally I am the sort of person who enjoys humor relating to small children, the jokes of that subject featured in \\"Full House\\" are boring and cheesy, I hate to admit. Usually, such humor overestimates the typical dislikes and fears of young children in laughable fashions as though something unspeakable is being brought up. In many series this can be funny, but in \\"Full House\\" it just is not. It is a typical, unrealistic, corny situation comedy featuring impossible, odd situations that are always handled by the end of the episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift","review":"my 21 year old loves, loves, loves this show... watches as often as she can.

On the DVD, you can watch the first 22 episodes of the show and there are also a few special features, including the original TV pilot. They also had Full House trivia on some of the episodes. I loved seeing the people from the show when they are young, which you hardly get to see on TV. If you like Full House, this DVD is great! If you think the show is really sappy, don't get it. I think it's a great show for children and adults!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent show but missing from the DVD....","review":"I got into to watching this show in reruns. It is decent. It did rip off other TV shows, an example the Partridge Family. Old TV show habit, using same actors in different parts.What I was very disappointed about that was missing from this DVD set was having any of the stars speak about the show. I would have liked to see that.Of course, the episode where the Jesse & Joey characters are arguing about music & comedy. Timely now because of his season 3 of \\"The Surreal Life\\" is Dave Coulier's line about \\"Charo\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm just a kid","review":"I'm just 11 years old, but I can recognize quality entertainment when I see it. Ever since I was born I've been glued to the television, watching shows like Fresh Prince of Bel Air, and classics like the Cosby show. But not since Jerry Springer has there been a show as heartwarming, as joyous, and enriching as Full House.

It has tons of lame jokes (Such as \\"You got it dude!\\" and \\"Cut it out!\\" with its stupid hand motions). The show is about 3 girls who live with 3 men. Sounds like a gay situation, dosen't it? Well, anyway, the one man, Danny, is a TV talk show host, who is a clean freak. The other man is Jesse, a motorcycler and Elvis freak. And the other man (I mean child!) is an immature stand-up comedian who isn't funny. And then their are the children, who are annoying.I recall in one eposide, Stephanie crashes a car (Or bulldozer? I don't remember) into the house. But, of course, being the unrealistic show it is, Danny says to Stephanie, \\"You can replace walls, but you can't replace daughters.\\" And it all ends with a hug. How unrealistic. None of the things in this show aren't even remotely realistic. I am 12 and I think this show has jokes only 7-9 year olds would find funny. And if an adult watches it, you have problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full House (First Season)","review":"**Jenny- San Francisco, CAI bought the Full House DVD 2 times at store when I play the movie it doesn't have sound when I play the movie.

Because only we know about what the pioneers thinked, we can further modify or invite new semiconductor devices.

In this darkly humorous take on Penelope's story, Atwood addresses Penelope's challenges while Oddyseus works his way home from the arms of beautiful goddesses and escapes the revenges of Poseidon. She is irked by the uproar her dramatic cousin Helen has put in place. When her husband returns, he and their son hang twelve of her hand maids the hanging of the maids hs always been a puzzling part of the legend. They really had no choice in their acceptance of sexual approaches. They and Penelope present their case from Hades. It's a worthwhile re reading of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lackluster Protagonist for a Lakluster Story","review":"Disappointing. My hope was for a retelling of The Odyssey that would give a richer, more intriguing and unique viewpoint of Penelope and her maids over the twenty-year span of Odysseus' absence. What it instead ends up being is a boring recounting of Penelope crying, filling up the time doing nothing, or being sarcastic about life now that she inhabits the Underworld. She speaks in far too modern a tone, and sounds much more like a feminist mouthpiece than anything else. The book also assumes knowledge of the Odyssey--granted, it is a retelling of sorts, but should be enjoyable without me puzzling over certain names or events. And Penelope herself is, in a word, boring. The redeeming factor of the book lie in the interludes, songs and poems and small scenes featuring Penelope's maids acting as a Greek chorus. They are beautiful, clever, and occasionally terribly moving or even funny. They provide the only relief throughout an otherwise dragging story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative and Shallow","review":"If I had never read anything by the enormously original Dorothy Parker or seen Woody Allen's \\"Mighty Aphrodite,\\" I may have been impressed with this book. But I was not impressed. It had the all snarky tone with absolutely none of the side-splitting humor or heartbreaking depth of emotion I so adore in Dorothy Parker and Woody Allen's works.I appreceiate the idea of Atwood's re-telling the myth from Penelope's point of view, as well as her attempt to go the feminist, moral route...but it was executed in an obvious, silly, and derivative way.If you want a light book to read at the beach, this will do...I have heard her other novels could be modern classics, so I am reluctant to criticize Atwood as a writer on the whole until I read more of her work. I am, however, disappointed that I didn't choose one of her novels as my introduction to Atwood over this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Margaret Atwood can't write a bad book, period.

Is this a case of no one wanting to say that the Empress has no clothes on?I love Margaret Atwood, and have read just about all of her books. This resembles NONE of them. It is cotton candy and fluff! It's written in a comic book style that is supposed to pass for wit, I guess. I'm scratching my head and wondering why she bothered with this book at all. Maybe she needed some quick cash?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"This novel was a beautiful twist on the classic Homeric Epic.

That was an interesting device."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit disappointing","review":"I was really not crazy about this book.

However, this book is not her best. She is funny and witty in her writing as usual but for me this story was like a highly didactic story for high school students. I could read the effort behind the words to create a \\"through the female eye\\" version of the Odysseus story. I don't want to say that I did not enjoy reading the story, but I more than once had the feeling that I'm reading an assignment done by an eminent student: well-researched, all the necessary stylistic elements in the proper place, but the whole personality of the writer didn't immerse into the story. The writer couldn't fully identify with Penelope, so neither can the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Atwood","review":"It is the distress of Penelope, wife of Odysseus, that is the subject of Margarat Atwood's latest book. A daughter of King Icarius by one of his concubines, a minor courtesan, auctioned off to the great warrior.The prose contains the best of Atwood's spare, earthy, plucky language. The story is a tragedy, narrated to us by the disembodied spirit of Penelope, strangled along with her maids by the same cord, by her husband, to join the corpses of her suitors and lovers. They, butchered, after the return of Odysseus from his long campaign at Troy.Atwood trancends easily classical and modern spheres and reference points, maintaining an ironic connection to the modern world, the plight of women.. but she never loses her sardonic wit. The mood is breezy and cheerful, but with an unmistakable brine from its propellants of desire and vengeance. She floats away on a boat harnessed to the moon in a starry majesty, accompanied by her foil and rival Helen.A remarkable book, one of Atwood's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atwood Can't Match Homer","review":"It is an interesting premise, a fictional account of a collateral character in the Odyssey, but she gets bogged down in foolish concerns and makes too many errors in continuity and historical context - like Penelope gazing through a window smeared from the smoke of countless fires.

One thing is clear: the songwriting is retro but fresh, and the vocals are excellent. The lyrics are well crafted and befit the overall feel. It strikes me that these guys know how to create something 'in concert' (the all-together sense). Apparantly, the live show is one of the best parts, and a trip to thier website's photo gallery suggests some of this craziness.

They are all slow and the tunes are the same. The only good songs are \\"Crush\\", \\"Somewhere, Someday\\", and the remix of \\"Always You\\", because they have a beat to them.

There is a chain letter targeting a technology-obsessed group of teens. They have to pass it on or a psychopathic killer mangles them in a most creative way.A combination of \\"The Ring\\" and \\"Stay Alive,\\" this movie avoids the excess torture of the \\"Saw\\" films, as well as the long drawn out storylines of other films of this nature. It's just a good time. There is nothing stunning or original about the film that will make it stick in your memory forever, but it satisfies the horror film lover's appetite for lots of gore, a little nudity, and an overall great time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be more interesting if it were about chain smoking","review":"What are the odds that I'm viewing another Noah Segan (Deadgirl) high school movie? I looked him up on imdb, and he was born in 1983! Time to retire this teenage crap. Seems any movie revolving around video games/computers/technology automatically blows. This movie is no exception. Neil (Cody Kasch) receives a chain letter, and it gets passed on to four friends and relatives. Ignore it and you die. CHAIN LETTER! The box says: \\"As time runs out and the deadly letter's rules become more challenging, the survivors must untangle this chilling secret.\\" I'm not sure what there is to untangle. Ignore the message, and you are treated with a visit from a giant deformed creep. A subplot about an anti-technology cult is touched upon, but not explored. Many gruesome chain-related deaths and a grim ending cannot save this turkey, turkey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocused, Over-Bloated and Pretentious","review":"You know you're in trouble when a slasher movie feels the need to start off with a quote from Neitzsche.Some truly impressive gore effects can not keep CHAIN LETTER from smothering under the weight of its ludicrously unfocused, over-bloated script, and this weird sense of arrogant self-importance that seems to hover over the whole movie.Dion seems to think he's layin' down some real heavy you-know-what here, but he's not.

I suffered through the poor acting in order to see the end. Perhaps I wasn't paying much attention but the ending sucked! Who did the murders? I don;t like movies that leave you without an end.

I like movies that have lots of blood and gore, I also appreciate movies that actually show the killings, which Chain Letter did. I like the way it started with the garage killing, and I'm glad they showed it at the end for those who didn't know they were her parents. The movie as a whole is not one that I would recommend. However, the killings made watching the whole movie not a total waste of my time. I give it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gory, gross, no hope","review":"Okay, it's a horror movie and they don't exactly uplift the viewer. But this one is just plain...mean, nasty, a real downer. I like a tad bit of fun or comic relief with my horror, but this one offers up a sick universe where no such things exist to counterbalance the nastiness.That said, Brad Dourif is as effectively creepy as ever as a teacher who does not care for technology inside or outside of his classroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chain Letter Review","review":"This movie stinks like WWE Wrestlemania 9!!! There's nothing to the \\"If you the chain letter,you get killed\\" storyline. The plot drags on & on like that \\"I Quit\\" match between The Miz & John Cena from Over the Limit 2011 and copies most of it from The Ring. The title opening is annoying like that orange from Youtube. The opening kill was pointless like Peter's cow kite. The cast are also annoying,forgettable,stupid and 1D. The only A+ is the blood & gore but gets ruined by bad editing. The villian is also 1D like the bullies form IT. The jump scares are predictable & not scary. This makes WCW Halloween Havoc 2000 scarier by compairson. I give Chain Letter a 1 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"malaza malagasy","review":"This book covers a wide range of topics for anyone interested in Madagascar. I've found it especially useful for general information about the island's paleo-history, as well as more specific information in my field of zoology. The editors have done an excellent job of organizing the material into a good flow of reading. Seems to be an easier read than the earlier \\"Key Environments: Madagascar\\" (1984). The \\"gloomy\\" outlook that may exist for the wildlife of Madagascar is not just presented to depress the reader, instead they present a positive outlook in their last chapter using Ranomafana National Park as an example. A must-have for anyone interested in this unique island (and with its interesting people, history, and animals, that should be everyone!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Exquisite","review":"Among the very best!!!The sound is outstanding, taking you on a melodic journey which does not leave you wishing they finished the piece differently.

This book read more like a paranoid political mouthpiece than a thriller and I'm very disappointed that he thought his fans would think that was a great idea. This \\"thriller\\" was so non-thrilling the only way the author could attempt to bring tension to the story was by blatently hiding facts from the reader (for example Justin would get on the phone with another character and instead of making the reader privy to the conversation we, the reader, get to read that Justin told the other character what he wanted -- not any details. How bogus is that?Because of the political overtones early in the story I could have written the end of the book about 1/4th of the way into it as well.I hope this author returns to the original formula that won him so many fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time reader of R.

Which I agree with all those who've pointed it out... Small town cop + new female officer = NOT GONNA HOOK UP! If this guy is so smart, he would have avoided that like the plague. The author tends to use the \\"hero's\\" full name WAY too often... Justin Westwood this and Justin Westwood that...

I can without a doubt say this is the worst vaccuum I've ever owned. For starters, it is very heavy. Anyone who is not fit would have challenges with that alone. None of the tools or attachments fit well. They barely attach to the hose, and then fall off almost every time we try to use them. The hose is stiff and attached to the vac at such a point that nearly every time we use it, the vac tips over unless we hold it.We have also had lots of noise issues, rattles, sqeals, etc.The final straw for us was when we accidentally spilled a display the other day and the Oreck failed to pick up a visible amount of the sandy debris. One of my employees who lives nearby ran home and brought back their $100 hoover and it quicky picked up everything the $400 Oreck left behind.

Granted it was old tv and film footage, it didn't take one long to get engrosed with the pure entertainment and talent that Liberace possessed and shared with his audience.

As far as I'm concerned, the autograph is the best part of the book.The book tries to show the benefits of cooperation and sharing. However, the story itself is trite and predictable. Three friends encounter a rabbit trying in vain to dig up a giant carrot and keep it all for himself. The three are kind and helpful, even as the rabbit is greedy and unfriendly. Of course, by the end of the story the carrot is dug up and the rabbit has seen the error of his ways. There are no surprises here, and even the language is uninspired and dull.On the plus side, the illustrations are colorful and playful.Children who are familiar with these characters from TV might react better to this book. For kids like mine who don't know these characters already, don't bother trying to introduce them through this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary Genetics for Easy Reading","review":"This book is good for those who want to learn about genetics without reading a tedious, text-ridden book.

(its an all regioun DVD player, so yes, it does play regioun 1 DVD's fine) But even if the movie was presented in propper color.....I was expecting it to be great, Tom Arnold, and National Lampoons....sounds great right? Too bad it wasnt :(The movie has written on it \\"its the mighty ducks meets caddyshack\\" or somthing like that?

Maybe a kid under the age of 10 might get somthing out of it? but I dont even know how this came to beeing bothered with to be put on DVD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"BAD\\" expounded.","review":"This film is no more than a preachy after-school special in lowest vein of family fluff as \\"Mighty Ducks,\\" \\"Heavyweights,\\" and countless others. While those at least pretend to be real movies, GP somehow manages to be worse in every aspect. Scene changes seem crafted for commercial breaks, the titular \\"punks\\" are a motley crew of misfits who (as tradition dictates) couldn't act their way out of a citcom parent trap, Arnold is dumbed down to play his \\"Stupids\\" character in earnest, and misguided attempts at slapstick would fail even if the film had any credibility. The soundtrack is the icing on the cake (left out in the rain). Basically, it consists of an alternation between a Casio keyboard demonstration and a slackjawed old guy repeating \\"we all end up in a hole,\\" forcing an especially bad pun down the viewer's throat for the entire film. The self-respecting viewer will not last through the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"lampoon movies aren't like they used to be","review":"i remember a time when i got excited when i saw a lampoon title.

However, after I listened to the whole thing I found I really liked it. I think that this should be revived because it's quite nice. Some of the lyrics are a little odd, and its got religious underlyings, but it could be revamped and a new broadway hit. This CD is something that almost everyone would enjoy, orchestraitions are very much in the older musical theater style, but the songs are funny and catchy, and tell a wonderful story. Definitly one for the collectors and more serious Broadway listners. Favorite song: \\"Something Somwhere\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst!","review":"The music of Richard Rodgers was just a shadow of it's former self when this score was written. Nothing could save it. I saw the show the week after it opened, before Danny Kaye broke his leg and started clowning around: maybe it was better then. Not even the comedic genius of Madeline Kahn brightened the evening. There is one beautiful ballad-\\"I Do Not Know A day I Did Not Love You\\" but the rest of the score is simply horrendous. When Danny Kaye began to sing \\"Hey Girlie, Don't Go Yet\\" to his dying wife, the audience burst into hysterical laughter. Not the intended effect. Collectors will want this score because it is Richard Rodgers. There is no other reason to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"What can I say.

Could anyone ever come out and release a live album of with 6 covers and become a legend from it? I do not think so. BUT, if you have the talent and the guitar licks that make you stand out, yes, the cream does usually rise to the top. The \\"And\\" is all about a dude named RICK DERRINGER playing 2nd guitar in the band. Yes, nice right hand man to have on your side...

Goode. Starts off with the famous ROCK 'N ROLLLLL growl you hear on radio stations occasionally.It might be hard for folks today to believe that the college radio station actually played great, great music, of which this is just one example, 30 years ago.It should be interesting to see if folks' kids and grandchildren will be listening to today's stuff, the way good swing, jazz, and rock is still listened to today, 30 to 70 years after they came out; or whether most of today's stuff will be laughed at as hopelessly lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Winter And Live!","review":"This album is a MONSTER.

Rick Derringer is no slouch either when it comes to the electric git-tar. To the fellow who said the album was pretty good, you don't have a clue pal.

Both have well-padded seats (older models of Turbo booster are not as well padded), and comparable head support wings. The Turbo booster hands down has better selection in patterns, and costs anywhere from $10 to $40 less (depending on the pattern). The Compass had two features that I decided were must-haves: (1) the lift-up armrest, which makes it easier to clip in the seatbelt, and (2) the adjustable back, which rises up from the base, as opposed to the Turbo booster which just rises at the neck.The Compass booster colors are difficult to discern from the photos: Tru Blue is a royal blue-on-blue color scheme, and the Sapphire is navy blue with medium gray. I knocked one star off the rating because they don't have cute patterns like the Turbo."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 and back in a car seat","review":"my daughter is 7 years old and we just got rid off her old booster seat to find out that she did not meet the requirements beacause she is very small and only weighs 43pd so we went shopping .we were going to buy the britex car seat for a 100$ when she tried out this one she felt more comfortable and loves it so far ."},{"rating":"2","title":"great look and feel but hard to sleep in","review":"My 31/2 year old daughter loves this new carseat.

This book is about a college teacher in his 30's dating his students. I realize that does sound a bit simple considering the book has almost 300 pages,but when I reflect that's about it. The author has made this character quite obsessed with his private anatomy. He really is quite good at coming up with all kinds of descriptive words concerning his part and what he does with it.Actually he tends to get pretty boring with his sex talk ,he throughs it in nomatter what the situation happens to be.

You can trace a drawing and you can do the same thing to music.So I guess they get an A for effort for being able to accurately rip off the early Beatle sound.Also, The Beatles were very much identified with Rickenbackers; I'm guessing that's where the name \\"Knickerbockers\\" comes into play, but whatever.

If you subscribe to the Farenheit 451 theory this book is also for you.(not to memoorize but to burn) Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This guy was a mess and it is great that this approach helped him, but to assume that mind is the cause of all back pain and that conventional methods of treatment never help is narrowminded.While it is important to consider all possible causes of back pain, this book gives many irresponsible generalizations about the causes for back pain and the solutions as well as their results. It pretty much says, it is all in your head and surgery and physical therapy will cure only about 1% of the patients. I don't agree with this and although I kept reading to see what I could glean from the book that might be helpful, I was very disappointed that I spent money on the book.Bravo to the author for curing his problem - I'm just not sure it is a cure for all (maybe not even a cure for most)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rapid recovery failed","review":"I was misled when I read the description of this book before I bought it. I wish that the pain I have been experiencing for almost one year now was \\"just in my head\\" or due to some repressed anxiety. However, the pain is very real and not due to my mind wishing it up. Be very cautious if you are looking for relief of your pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for people with real physical manifestations","review":"Actually, NO stars. This book is NOT for people with REAL physical manifestations such as those shown on MRI or Full Body Scan - herniated discs AND a growth on the spine. NOR is the one by Sarno. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RSI almost cured","review":"This book offers a practical implementation of Dr. Sarno's theories. I read \\"The MindBody Prescription\\" as well as this book to cure Repetitive Strain Injury in my hands. Now, six weeks after first encountering this approach, I am 80% cured. I still have some symptoms in my hands but I'm no longer scared of the pain. I don't know if this book will work for everyone but it had a lot of good advice for me. Thanks Fred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babbling and ice cream","review":"After reading this book I thought \\"my subconscious must really hate me\\" with all the pain I have. Fred gives himself ice cream when his so called manifested pains go away. Putting unnecessary sugar in your body does more harm than good.I do believe the mind can really play tricks on you, but not to the point where Fred goes.It wasn't until I found Kelly starrett that my life truly changed for the better. As a person with a botched back surgery from 1995, no one could or would help me. Kelly was able to break it down and make me realize this was not \\"all in my head\\".I'm not trying to push Kelly or his methods here, but his methods are real world and work. I don't know about you, but I want less pain through real and solid medical methods.So as much as I would love to eat my way to better health with ice cream, I will stick to what works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many instructions","review":"It is okay if one writes from one's own experience but this went way overboard.

It lacks clear guidelines and is not really helpful compared to the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"pedantic","review":"the author could have made this book into a pamphlet by deleting all of his hypochondriacal verbage. More than half the book is devoted to all of his amazing melange of aches, pains and maladies. Not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing . Advice possibly damaging.","review":"The author of this book teaches the reader to talk down to their sub-conscious and treat it with disrespect. His advice tells the reader to treat the subconcious as a child.A healthy individual makes friends with his/her subconcious. They become partners. They do not \\"beat up\\" their subconcious like the author teaches. Treating your subconcious with such disrespect as this book recommends is harmful . How can you love yourself if you disrespect a large part of yourself (the subconcious)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Be The One","review":"I really love this song and the fideo is so cool to look at i have the video on my psp . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty Christmas Jazz","review":"Buying Christmas music can be so hit and miss, it's often hard to tell what's good and what's crap (I've been burned more than once taking a chance on a CD, ouch). In the opinion of this music teacher and trumpeter, this is really good stuff. These Seattle jazzers swing hard on creative arrangements of Christmas tunes. It's the kind of thing you might hear at a high-brow Christmas party or fundraiser in a hotel ballroom. They've hired the top jazz musicians in town to jam in the corner while everyone mingles around dressed in glittering dresses and tuxedos sipping champagne. If that sounds good to you, buy this CD, you will not be disappointed! Happy Holidays!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite finishing salt","review":"The texture and flavor are unique.

Pretty sure now, based on this exhaustive recounting of the Americal Division history during the 2nd World War.

Some of these recipes are classics and help make the place famous. !!!! !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"I purchased several songbooks to use with my ukelele at the same time. I like the fact that this songbook has so many different songs, but many of the verses and chords are incorrect. The piano arrangements are relatively simple and can be played with little practice, but I found the suggested chords a little difficult to play on the ukelele. I tend to search for songs in Rise Up Singing: the Singing Songbook first when I want to play a song on the ukelele."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids and I love it too!","review":"I am a nanny for a young child under two, and we have a great time singing and playing songs on the piano. She bangs along on the keys while I play, and sometimes I stop playing and let her have at it, and she makes up her own songs and music to play. She is developing an ability to play specific and consecutive notes, which is pretty remarkable for a such a young child. Most of the arrangements are very good as noted by the other reviewer. The book is also very well illustrated, she takes as much delight in the drawings as in the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Songs, Bad Lyrics","review":"My wife and I found alot of the lyrics to be \\"off\\" from what we knew as kids. Also, I thought there would be more verses (many times you get the chords/notes and only one verse).As a beginner guitar player playing chords only, I found most all of them to be accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance electro-clash from Isla Vista","review":"The Kissing Tigers have a definite presence in their hometown of Isla Vista, California.

The real reason I picked this gas bottle is that it was recommended by Weber in the owner's guide for my new Genesis 330 grill. On page 12 of the manual: \\"Weber recomends the use of cylinder manufacturer's Manchester and Worthington, with a 47.6 lb water capacity.\\"It sure doesn't fit my grill or the regulator the way the manual shows. I suppose I should ask Weber what's up with that. I'm going to try to post a pic of how the Worthington bottle fits in my Weber Genesis S330 grill.Update:The bottle works fine. The spring scale it hangs from in this bbq works like it's supposed to. The bottle is the same as the last one I bought. I'm not sure why the Weber manual shows a smaller diameter bottle in the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propane Cylinder","review":"The propane tank is great quality. Unfortunately I didn't shop around and paid way too much. You can buy the same tank with a meter on it at Sam's for $29.00 or Home Depot without the meter for $29.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"No propane! What's the point?","review":"Nowhere in the product description does it mention that it DOES NOT ACTUALLY CONTAIN ANY PROPANE, and, therefore, ended up being a waste of money. I had to take it to Lowe's to get it exchanged for one that was actually filled. Perhaps I should have inquired in advance, but I didn't even think to do so since Amazon \\"recommended\\" that it be bought together with my outdoor heat lamp. Boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two of three would NOT open.","review":"this makes me so damn mad. Tonight I had six friends over for steak dinner. Brand new blue rino tank from Ace. Once before I had brought one home and it wouldn't open, and provide gas to the burners. Tonight, using the recommendations from the Ace guys, I opened it reallllllllllllllllly slow! Didn't make a damn bit of difference. We couldn't get a smell of gas from it. Go to the kitchen, get an iron pan smoking up the house when it is 90 ourside, finish in an oven, while the gas grill sets unusable. NO WAY IN HELL WILL I EVER BRING HOME ANOTHER BLUE RINO TANK. This control valve is a piece of junk. Preposterous."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE TANK IS EMPTY","review":"It must have been stupid of me to assume that this tank would show up with propane in it, but somehow I did. The tank was empty, which makes sense from the safety perspective, but sucks from convenience perspective. I think the product title and description could be more explicit about the fact that it will come empty. I'm sure that the tank is great and all, but it means that I'm not getting to grill tonight, and will have to now figure out where to go to get this thing filled, or worse, I'll have to exchange it for some dinged up tank with gas (goodbye my brand new pretty tank, it was good to know you). Anyway, I just wanted to create this entry to warn others that THE TANK IS EMPTY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lords of the Underground","review":"These forgotten masters of early British hard rock had reached their peak on this ultra-heavy debut. A great record. Much like early Black Sabbath (without the dumb lyrics). Aside from the few acoustic songs, this is a one-track exercise in sonic overkill. A must-have for anyone interested in the roots of contemporary hard rock and grunge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mixed of funk,jazz and heavy rock","review":"Have heard of it. Love the way music were arranged ,performed and also singer is able to control playing and singing at the same time. Which I found to be unique as not all band can played that.

The pic. quality is excellent and the machine is well featured but I had trouble with hi-fi sound quality. When using w/home theater setup there was extra undesirable noise introduced into the soundtrack. You could hear a ticking in the background of the soundtrack like the spinning heads inside were somehow adding noise to the audio track. Being a big home theater fan, this was VERY distracting. I ended up purchasing Toshiba's M675 and am very satisfied. They have a new head design that eliminates extra distortion in sound & picture. Overall pic & sound quality is better than the sony too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied...","review":"This machine is fine for watching movies or setting up the timer to tape programs while you're out; however, for my taping purposes (trying to tape specific segments of shows) I find it very frustrating. There is no memory function for the counter so I continually need to adjust the tape's position myself, and there is an annoying delay upon pressing record and the machine does not start recording immediately (missing things when trying to hit record on a program coming back from a commericial break when I paused/stopped it). A few other annoying details as well; I will be going back to Magnavox next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"First of all, when I opened the box there was no user guide, and when I installed it to watch a movie there was alot of snow, I tried to adjust the tracking and there was still snow.

Instead, we discovered that the only dragon picture in the deck, is the one seen on the box, and that turned out to be the back of the card. I understand my brother when he says that he can't expand on them like one can with some oracle cards. Dragon Cards have words, giving straight forward meanings, instead of pictures one can elaborate on. Don't get me wrong, these cards may be right for some people. I prefer something that involves more intuitive thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not All There","review":"Although the motor was the correct part for the repair, the total product received lacked all the pieces necessary for the fix.

At this point, I went to a local auto parts store a purchased their version of the motor kit. This kit contained three separate interconnect assemblies to choose from depending on your vehicle. The motor was identical and the price only 10% more. This items description needs to be a little better regarding the interconnection, or lack thereof.
