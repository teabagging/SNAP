It was shoddy from the outset, but for $10 I managed to use it despite the dim display and tinny alarm for one trip. Then I realized the battery only lasts a few weeks. I would have spent more on batteries than the clock itself in the first year. It also began to literally pull apart at the seams. I mailed the clock to Sharp's corporate headquarters in NJ with my complaint and received a letter back saying it wasn't one of their products even though it clearly says \\"Sharp\\" right on the front. So either they are lying and producing terrible products or they are not protecting their trademark and allowing other companies to manufacture shoddy products and market them with the Sharp name. Either way I could never buy a product with the Sharp name on it again.... how could I ever be sure if it would be backed up by Sharp or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece. Of.

No sound. After spending far too long trying to get it out of silent mode (including removing the battery in order to rest it to factory default), I called Sharp for help. Two phone numbers later, they tell me \\"It's not a Sharp Product.\\" Even with Sharp's name all over it, it's not a Sharp product therefore they don't support it.

Features looked great and display seemed easy to read. So I set the clock and the alarm on the first night. There is a large button in the center for Snooze and/or illumination. Every time you hit this button it clears the clock back to 12:00 and deletes any alarm settings. This happens every time. I managed to avoid touching the button for the next few days, but the clock still reset to 12:00 every time you turned off the alarm. By the end of the week, the battery door just kept falling off. Each time that happened, it became a bigger problem to keep the door secured. This product is just a piece of junk.

I was seduced by the sleek look and portability, so thank goodness it was cheap because those two things are all it has going for it -- for me anyway. (I don't remember where I bought it -- not Amazon -- so I can't return it.) I pulled it out a couple of days ago because the trip is coming up, and I fiddled around with it for quite a while, but failed to set it, and I am far from a technological idiot. I am sure I could figure it out if I spend enough time, but should I have to and why would I bother for something this cheap? If it's a production every time I change time zones, it's just not worth it, not to mention the possibility of setting it wrong and missing something important. I'm going for something simpler -- one of those mini versions of the old-fashioned alarm clock that simply gives me the current time, a wake up time, and an obnoxious noise to get me up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 14 months then...","review":"As other reviewers have reported, the alarm clock was very functional for a while and then the alarm quit working. We purchased this at Wal-Mart a while back. The temperature gauge was nice and it's difficult to beat the compact size. However, when we set the alarm now it doesn't beep anymore and the light just stays on during this period. We tried changing the battery but that doesn't help. I saw two other reviewers reported the same problem. FYI, the product is made in China. I'm kind of surprised that Sharp ties it's name to such a product. If you're looking for a short term solution for 6+ months then this will probably work fine but don't count on it as eventually it will probably stop working for you too. Just hope that the day it stops working is a non-important one for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I bought one of these a few years ago at Walmart and it lasted okay, and then died. So since I liked having the temp as well as the not-too-loud alarm, I ordered two more from here. I just threw the second one away yesterday, and the first one about a week before that. Something is wrong with the battery connections so the battery doesn't always connect, and the clock resets itself to 12:00, if it comes back on at all. I fooled around adjusting the connection points, and finally threw it away.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone I never knew...","review":"I never knew Chad Pearson but after reading this book, I felt as if I did.

Finally, as you close this book and wipe away the tears, you will hope you will never have to experience the pain of losing a child, but if you have lost a child or loved one, this book and Ms. Pearson's advice will definitely help you better cope with, and understand your situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"up there with \\"shipwreck\\" and \\"blonde exodus\\".","review":"Definitely in the top five best albums Connelly has done solo. I wouldn't say it's the top; shipwreck is quite possibly unrivalled in the man's catalog. But Chris's solo work has become more challenging, and yields greater pleasure as a result. If you're looking for Ministry, go FAR elsewhere. But if you're into, say, neo-folkies like Devandra Banhart or his spiritual predecessors in Current 93, you may find a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dense, impenetrable, claustrophobic","review":"It is almost impossible to imagine that parts of this album were recorded under open skies. The music on this record is so dense and impenetrable that it could have very well been recorded in a bunker. It is an extremly hard listen, exhausting and demanding, yet unlike other famously demanding works (like Scott Walker's \\"The Drift\\"), it offers few rewards. The biggest problem is the dense texture of the music that leaves no opening for the listener and Connelly's technically weak, monotonous singing. The vibraphone which is used well on the opening track should have employed more prominently, because it adds a lighter touch to this claustrophobic album. Connelly's ambition is admirable, but the results are bewildering. It is hard to imagine that he will find many listeners willing to follow him into his dark realm."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Queen, and Empire","review":"The creator of Sherlock Holmes was definitely for the Empire first, England second, and history third. That being said, it is on the whole a good read although it drags at times. The writing style captures a certain late Victorian imperial mindset, not unlike the Sherlock Holmes novels, that is itself fascinating and historically valuable. I recommend the \\"Great Anglo Boer War\\" by Byron Farwell, which is both more readable and accurate than Doyle's lengthy work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Too many facts...

Though this volume, as well as the other nine of this series, concentrates on the elite and upper-class families, it is an invaluable resource for the historian and genealogist. For each family mentioned, the author provides a short history about their origins. He then provides a genealogy of the family in Cuba. For each generation he gives the names of the parents, their children, and sometimes the spouses and their children. At various times several generations of each branch are given. Though many times the dates on which various events occurred are not included, by careful reading they may be deduced.

I would like to stress that since the castle only comes with one figure the addtional figures and playsets are needed to keep kids entertained, but the prices are reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too impressed!!","review":"I was so excited to get this toy for my boys, but when we opened it.....it was crap.

There's no text, only seemingly self-serving photographs of her and her gowns in her over-designed house. The only thought I had while flipping through the pages was how difficult it must be to keep it dusted! I would have been much more satisfied were there some explanations as to how she might have come to some of her design conclusions, because to me it all seems cluttered and complicated, and somewhat random. I guess that's part of the appeal, but I expected more text and fewer images of the woman herself.

She is beautiful and obviously loves to dress up and glam it on. How can you not love her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster book, buy Modern Glamour instead.","review":"I loved her first book and was excited to receive the second but I was very disappointed.

Sort of blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money!!","review":"While I very much enjoyed Miss Wearstler's first book, I found Domicilium Decoratus to be borderline obnoxious.

It is comprised entirely of material I hadn't heard before. It's definitely Lola at her height. The soaring, full-bodied voice and heart-tearing passion is everywhere in evidence here. There's no discographical info with this set, no dates, but it sounds like the 50s and early 60s. Most rereleases of her work come without dates, making finding the earlier material very difficult. These disks met my highest expectations in that regard.

No matter who you are, you'll run across some people who make you say \\"Well, I don't believe THAT.\\" But you'll probably also run across people who make you say, \\"Hmmm.

The entire novel is basically a take on an idea developed by Kenneth Hite in one of his \\"Suppressed Transmissions\\" columns, collected (if memory serves) in the first volume -- what if Justinian of Byzantium (as portrayed by Procopius) went to war with King Arthur? The author then does that one better by having the central protagonist be a thinly-disguised analogue for Hal Foster's Prince Valiant!While certainly amusing in segments, it's just too derivative to be taken seriously.

But, like the previous reviewer said, too much information is crammed into this relatively short book -- the entire geologic history of NC is too complicated to be confined to ~200 pages. The result is a watered-down geologic history of NC, some of which is outdated and inaccurate.On the other hand, Fred Beyer has written an easy-to-read book on a subject that isn't always easy to understand.

Even harder than the impossible task of making it integrate with your word processor is getting it to know what you want it to do. Luckily I have the Publication Manual (which I love, see my 5-star review), so I could double check the helper's output: it screwed up on more than one occasion.

I kept my Onkyo powered sub which seems to work fine with the other five matched speakers. I had no problem attaching them to my existing speaker stands. These speakers have some weight to them but they are fine with the stands. So don't look any further than these Polk Audio's for the best sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly manufactured","review":"Sound quality is fine. Input for speaker wire manufactured poorly.

Both times, it has been fully charged, and it has helped to turn the car alarm and dashboard lights back on. But it does not hold enough power to prevent having to call AAA or ask for a jump. All it has done is caused more aggravation, and it wasted a lot of our time trying to get it to work (1-2 hour from multiple rechargings) instead of just getting a jump from someone (<10 minutes). Worthless as a car charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"This pump replaced a 10 year old Craftsman .5HP which started to make load noises.

He overlooks no detail that will aid homeowners in deriving a sense of satisfaction from their homes.

All of the stories are outstanding, but one in particular, \\"Dog Heaven,\\" is a masterpiece. I've read this story at least half a dozen times, and each time I read it, I'm moved to tears, and love it more.

Once I was finally able to get the mouse and receiver to sync I was pleased. One thing that was immediately apparent was that I was going through batteries like crazy. I would even pop the battery out when it was not in use, but that did not help at all. Also the battery compartment would not always close correctly. Maybe this was just with my specific mouse, but what I would have to do was hold the batteries down myself and then close the compartment (vs sliding on). After about 2 months I began to have trouble syncing the receiver and mouse. I would have to unplug the receiver, plug it back in, and try to resync again. During this time period I began to have trouble with the mouse actually moving correctly, so I purchased another brand.

I feel for the longer-strided tall mommies.-The backrest has to be laid back to put in the carseat and it blocks the storage underneath.On the plus side, I love the fabric, and the bag is a nice addition.

Great stroller, I just wish that it had a tray and I didn't have to remove the front bar padding to attach the infant carseat. There is not a console for my drinks; however, there is a \\"diaper bag\\" attached to the back of the stroller and I just put my drinks in the bottle holder or zippered pocket.

I'm very satisfied with the features. The 5-point harness provides enough security and is confortable to my son. The leg and the back rest can be easyly adjusted. It doesn't have cup holder, but it is not needed because it has a removable bag to storage whatever we need. I loved the material and the design because it is verylightweight and at the sametime very resistant. It can be easily driven with one hand because is lightweight and the design of the wheels allow to controll the direction easily. It is compatile with the Companion Car seat wich is even greater than the stroller. The only disadvantage that I found is that when the back rest is laid back to the completely horizontal position it blocks the basket underneath, so if the child is sleeping it is not possible to take things out from the basket."},{"rating":"1","title":"This has to be the WORST Stroller ever!","review":"Ok, this is a little tongue and cheek but not much. When you use something every day, it really should work better!How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways...1. Sunshade stinks - doesn't shade much.2. After a few months with the Companion carseat on it, stroller became creaky and felt unsafe. Very rickety.3. Unwieldy to steer and turn - definitely NOT one-handed.4. No cupholder.5. Attached bag is too small.6. Very little basket space.Friends who bought less expensive strollers had much better experiences than I did with this one. If I'd been a more experienced mom, I would have tried to find a different stroller to fit my Companion carseat. They're out there. I'm more prepared this time and we'll NOT be using this stroller!!I literally have nothing good to say about this stroller (and that's not like me!).Not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very comfortable for my son!","review":"I chose this stroller for the Britax name (good quality), and because I needed a stroller that was lightweight and not too expensive (keeping it at my parents' place in Maine). In general I think it's all right, but it's quite annoying to open and close, and the handles aren't really high enough (but I think this is a problem with many strollers). My main complaint is that the back doesn't go upright enough, so my son has to be half-way reclined when he's in it. It doesn't look very comfortable for him, and he much prefers his usual stroller that has 3 positions, including one that is bolt upright. This stroller has 2, and the lying-down position is fine when he's sleeping, I just wish the \\"upright\\" position was actually upright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britax Preview Stroller","review":"This stroller looks nice and has a lot of stroller storage. I like the extra storage that hangs from the handles. It rolls easily. My complaints are that it is heavy, it is hard to open and hard to close. The first time I used it, it took me 10 minutes to get it open, and no I'm not stupid. We bought this to go with our Britax Companion carseat which we aren't real crazy about either. The carseat snaps in okay, but it normally takes a couple of tries to get it in securely. My last complaint is that the handles don't come up enough for me and I am 5'6.

It would be a TON of work to do that and in black and white the games to not hold his interest. Waste of money. I have found other truly 'instant\\" file folder games that are precolored in, but they still require cutting and laminating, which can be very expensive. Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This may not be fair, as I did not go through all the activities, but the emphasis on low level skills in most of the games tells the whole picture. Yes, playing these games beats doing endless worksheets mindlessly, but to what end? As research has shown (read Children and Number by Martin Hughes), one of the biggest problems faced by beginning learners is the transit from their concrete experience of maths to the abstract knowledge. In other words, while most children are equipped with fundamental math skills when they enter schools, they have difficulties going beyond concrete experiences.My reasons for not giving this book more stars are: 1)it fails to make connections between concrete experience and symbolic representations; 2)it overemphasizes on basic skills; 3)the games are not really fun and creative; 4)they are not really effective in improving math skills. 5 take away 4, so there you have it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Both structure and electronics are fragile","review":"We've had this product for a year and a half. It was a lot of fun at first but out of the box we noticed that the electronics were fragile. Every game, if played long enough, would result in the scoring system crashing and restarting, apparently due to the shaking and jarring it experienced from being hit with the balls (the electronics are in the backboard). This was disappointing but my 6 year-old son still had a good time with it until after about a month of on-and-off use the plastic pips began to loosen up and crack and the Velcro that holds the scoreboard in place ripped. This is through normal use. I personally am sick and tired of toys that are broken out of the box and that do not stand up to ordinary use that they should be designed for.

Since they were marked individually as 3 for 99 cents, I'm assuming that they were put out for sale and what weren't purchased at a physical location were sold here on Amazon. The fact that there were only 21 in a package supposed to contain 24 only adds to that assumption.

This anime was brought to America by U.S. Manga, and was originally done by AIC and Pioneer. It starts with a boy named Shu who meets a girl named LaLa-Ru and they get taken into another dimension where LaLa-Ru is wanted for a pendant she possess. She hands the pendant to Shu but Shu loses it in a fight between himself and a solider named Kabuca. The King, Homda wants the pendant to minapulate their low water supply. They are all on a huge ship called, Hellywood I believe, they are also fighting in a deadly war. The King and Lady Abelia have kidnapped many children age depending to fight as soliders and once they win the war they can go home, basically! It's a really good anime, and trust me I've seen many anime, one of the only anime's that come close to being this good is Martian Successor Nadesico, Evangelion is alright!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY NEW BOOK","review":"An excellent book.

Someone has said that \\"God whispers to us through our pleasure but shouts to us through our pain.\\" Dave Shive's testimony is a living example of that truth. What a blessing to know that the Lord's most significant work in our lives is often disguised in trials and difficult circumstances. I read this book two years ago, but I wasn't experiencing a \\"night shift\\" of my own at the time. Now that I am, I have pulled it out again and have found comfort and understanding through its insights. All believers will endure their own \\"night shifts\\" at one time or another.

The first short story is pretty interesting. The second \\"story\\" bogged down in lots of boring scifi/fantasy conference stuff.

The first story ended when I thought there must be more. Very unsatisfyingIt is full of violence, torture and meaningless death. And the religious elements are a mishmash.

After working through the frustration, I began taking control of my life, one step at a time, and am setting up my own business. I did this knowing full well I can make better decisions about what goes on in a business than those running the companies I have worked for, and I will have to answer to no one but myself one way or the other.

The conversations are quite natural and not artifically spiked with interesting tidbits that real life doesn't often have. Real life can be monotonous and petty, yes you still get hungry even if you have had a death(s) in the family.

I have to check and recheck to make sure that I get it exactly right and that I haven't set PM when I wanted AM - that is my fault, but it happens more than I would like it to. Also the white lettering, alarm set, time set etc is wearing off.All in all, it does what it is suppose to, wakes up someone who normally would sleep through a quiet alarm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent travel alarm clock","review":"I realize that this clock has gotten mixed reviews, but I have found it to be an ideal travel alarm clock, and much better (at least for me) than the smaller clocks expressly designed to be \\"travel\\" alarms. It is only slightly larger and heavier (by an ounce or two) than the latter, and in return it has several advantages: a large time display, easy to find in your luggage, and easy to locate when you are repacking.

I bought this one based on the high review it got from Consumer Reports. The RCA DRC285 worked fine for about a month (daily use), and then suddenly started freezing up. The picture would be frozen in a garbled image, and then the machine would be completely unresponsive, and I had to unplug it / replug it in to get it to work again. Near the end it would freeze up after 5 minutes on any disc. The RCA was a great deal for a 1080p unconverting player ($50), and I definitely got what I paid for. Returned it and went with the Sony DVP-NS77H, which I haven't had any problems with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine Lasted 13 months","review":"Actually, it is still working, but it is failing in the middle of videos, and has to be rebooted.

It worked great for about a year of light use, then became useless. I've had DVD players for years and never had one fail. So I can only conclude that there is a manufacturing defect (most likely a defective chip) so you think RCA would offer a repair solution. This really damages their reputation. I got the player for about $50 dollars at Sears so its more of an annoyance than big financial loss. Stay away from this product and save yourself time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got two of them - both failed","review":"Bought one of these, and two months later it failed.

Switch to usb mode takes about 45 seconds. Back to dvd is another 25 seconds. It plays jpgs but the lag is so bad that you'll just live with the slide show or not bother. When it finishes playing a mpeg it immediately starts playing the next - would be nice if this was an option, but you have no choice. To get out of the loop you have to switch out of usb mode and back again. Unit died on me after 45 days. Contacts RCA for support and never heard back, apart from the auto reply which said 3 days.RCA support is horrible, they don't even have a phone number. I'd steer clear of all their stuff for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good For Only 7 Months","review":"I wanted a DVD player that upconverted to HDMI; picked this one despite the negative reviews because it was cheap and a Consumer Reports Best Buy. It worked fine for 7 months; one quirk is that I couldn't get it to NOT strech 4:3 dvds so I ended up only viewing letterbox dvds on it.However about 7 months later it started freezing up on DVDs, and now it can't seem to play anything. What a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised - misleading","review":"I purchased this item for the TV Guardian feature, but I cannot find it on the set up menu. I have even had an(very limited and not easy to come by)email from customer service that explained the steps as to how to get it to work. It is just not there. It has a feature that allows me to set the level of movie allowed to play (G, PG, R etc...) but that is not what TV Guardian is. It was only about $40 with $15 shipping so to send it back would be a waste. So I guess I will just have to keep it as a back up or ebay item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasts, which may not be long","review":"My first RCA DRC285 player performed very nicely for about 6 weeks, and then failed, with the picture freezing into a random pattern on the HD screen, and with all controls on the unit and the remote having no effect. Unplugging it unfroze it for a few times, and then it crashed altogether. I sent it to Thomson's Austin, Texas warranty return location, and two months later received a replacement unit. This one lasted through about 5 DVDs and failed so completely that not even unplugging it could unfreeze it. I haven't decided if I will send this one in for another warranty replacement. The new instructions indicate you now have to send it to Canada, which really speaks poorly for Thomson Electronic's response to their obvious quality control problems. Unless you hear that the Canadian models are way more reliable, I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone, which is too bad. For basic upconvert DVD viewing, I thought it worked quite nicely.SD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the Job Done","review":"I have video hooked up with component cables and have not tried HDMI yet. It produces good video and sound. I have had it for about a month and have had absolutely no problems. The menu and remote are anything but sophisticated. Overall it gets the job done and keeps the kids happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I have had the player almost a year, bought through Sears. I have been careful to use the remote only opening and closing. So there is virtually no physical wear and tear on the device. It has been sitting in the same location. Recently it has decided to completely freeze up and cease working after getting about 15 minutes into a DVD. Some electronic glitch. Unplugging and replugging at first would reset it, but after a few times, that ceased to work and plugging it in no longer gets the red wait light.I will not buy another RCA DVD player. Made in China. Piece of garbage. Not everything made in China is garbage, but like Pet Food and Babies milk, the Chinese and American corporations seem to care less about quality and safety as long as they're making a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"An otherwise good DVD player but with very poor product quality. Looks and feels cheap. Died on me after watching just a few movies and right on the very first time I hooked it to my TV using the HDMI port. Returned it to the store for an exchange. The second unit died in the same way after watching a couple of movies as well. The first unit first showed black stripes across the screen and then after a while it froze and the screen was full of garbled image. Second unit died suddenly with the same garbled screen.It's a shame because the built-in USB port is really useful. You can view pictures and watch movies shot with a digital camera. You can also play music files from this port as well or convert an audio CD to MP3 files into any flash drive plugged in the USB port. This port was THE reason I originally chose this particular model over other upconverting models despite negative reviews I had read elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, this is defective","review":"I have one of these units and it worked fine for about 2 months and then it died. It had a great picture while it lasted but I would not recommend it to anyone. Buy a different brand if you want something that will last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warranty is a joke. Broke after 6 months","review":"I purchased this from Amazon 6 months ago. It broke last week. Since it is suppose to be under warranty I called RCA. They wanted to charge me a $50 service fee to have the DVD player switched out, which is almost the full price of the unit. Basically you really only have a warranty until 90 days, after that point you are forced to pay their \\"fee\\". They do not support their products whatsoever. I am now left with a very large paper weight. Save yourself the trouble and buy from a company that actually stands behind their products and offers a full warranty with no strings attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawkwind - 'Night Of The Hawks' (MVD) 4 1/2 stars","review":"Originally had this show on VHS, but of course it's great to have it now on DVD. 'Night...' was recorded in spring, 1984 at the Gaumont Theatre in Ipswich, UK. Picture and sound quality is pretty good. At least with a DVD, I won't have to concern myself with the color fading. I thought it was interesting how co-founder Nik Turner was allowed to return to Hawkwind, as I noticed that Dave Brock allows Turner to be the frontman and focal point through out the entire hour long concert here. Tunes I more than thoroughly 'soaked in' here were \\"Ghost Dance\\" ( a different version than most others), the futuristic \\"Watching The Grass Grow\\", \\"Ejection\\", my two favorites here \\"Ejection\\" and \\"Uncle Sams on Mars\\" as well as \\"Sonic Attack\\" \\"Psi Power\\" (where Brock steps out to provide the lead vocals) and the stunning encore of \\"Silver Machine\\".

It has spectacular shows by Donnie Burns, Gaynor Fairweather and Marcus and Karen Hilton -- they are the top of the ballroom dancing world! Thanks to V.I.E.W, Inc. who produced this video! END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected or Wanted","review":"This is not the \\"International\\" in a classic London venue; it is a competition in Ostrava in a lack-lustre setting resembling a 1/4-filled gymnasium. The DVD production resembles an old home video: camera-work is mediocre, video quality (touted as \\"enhanced\\") is poor, sound quality is poor--on top of a very weak music presentation from the venue itself. Having seen in person most of these couples dance at better venues, this DVD did not do them justice. In short, it is a poor-quality production displaying the end of the era of British-defined/dominated International style competition ballroom dancing. I was greatly disappointed and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little scary","review":"Ballroom and Latin dance has come a long way. Even though many of the dancers on the DVD are still at the top ranks of the pro circuit, this is NOT a great showcase. This is nice to watch in order to compare to the styles and skill of today, but not the kind of video you will watch over and over. The only truly spectacular dancing is that of Marcus and Karen Hilton (standard only). They were then, and are now quite amazing. For those of us in Canada, Alain Doucet and Anik Jolicouer are on this tape, briefly, in the Standard final."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price.","review":"Good measurer for the price.

However, a conspiracy of Communist holdovers and Mafia killers hopes to return the island to the bad old days melding the commmunism of Castro with the mob days of Batista.

Very few people can write and speak equally well but Kucinich does.He is highly intelligent but explains complex issues in plain, everyday language that everyone can understand.I am anxiously awaiting his autobiography, \\"The Courage to Survive\\" which will be a classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good essay from Studs Terkel; the rest is new-age nonsense","review":"Dennis Kucinich inspired me to get into politics. He is a courageous progressive who stands up for that in which he believes. That said, this book is not worth even the bargain price. It begins with a great essay from Studs Terkel, but then descends into a lot of Kucinich's new-age, moon-beam psycho-babble. Is it any wonder that the media considers him a joke? Mr. Kucinich should stick to his progressive populist platform (an ideology with which I no longer identify, to be fair) instead of drifting into Natural Law Party metaphysics. Terkel's essay deals with the former, the rest of the abbreviated book deals with the latter.

Kucinich, more than any other Democratic candidate, is in touch with the soul of this nation. A Prayer for America clearly articulates Kucinich's political platform, from his support for a revolution in the public education system to his efforts to reform and redefine our deeply flawed foreign policy to his commitment to provide every American with a clean environment, free healthcare, and fair wages. Overall, a grand education, both informative and inspiring. The best $10 I ever spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speeches that Inspire","review":"I totally disagree with the review by Publisher's Weekly. This book is not intended to be flowing novel reading. It is a book of public speeches given by Congressman Kucinich at various times and places.

It even states that you can be an absolute novice but when you begin the program and set it up for a complete beginner, you have to match phrases- and how can you do that if you are a novice?

A nice start to a friendship.\\" But little do you know...it's just the small peak start to one of THE BEST SERIES EVER! Yes, it's about friendship, and horses, and horseback riding, and dude-ranch experiences, and mystery, ADVENTURE, COMEDY, famous, important, awesome, THRILLING horse shows! HORSE/RIDER bonds and experiences! Read this series, people!!!!!!!!! As the series progresses, the riders learn more and more and so do the horses and more and more stuff happens and what's also cool is that stuff that happens also effects books later!!!!! And ANOTHER series springs up! BOOM! It's Pine Hollow series, too! BOTH ARE GREAT!!! READ THIS SERIES!!!!!!!!! I'm telling you, READ IT!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars overall it was a fantastic read","review":"I gave it 4 stars because it was fantastic but Bonnie Bryant has written better. I would recommend this book to all horse lovers and girls how love the power of friendship and don't just stop here you should definitely read the whole series!!! I LOVE THE SADDLE CLUB!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Starter to the Series","review":"Horse Crazy is a great book! I own all three cover versions of the book. It starts out with Stevie complaining about the fact that her mother won't pay for the MTO trip and gets the idea to start a odd-job business. Then, Carole meets Lisa who is a new rider. Stevie and Carole are BFFs and Lisa doesn't like Stevie at first, but soon they are best friends and make the Saddle Club. Overall, it's a great book. I recommend it. Like most books, it has a few down points. There are more exciting Saddle Club books (101 books in all!) and some of the facts in the book are a little too outrageous like Veronica riding a stallion and Carole being able to ride it too. As a 12 year old, I don't see them being experienced enough. Still, GET THIS BOOK!I recommend other books in the series like Driving Team, Dude Ranch, Show Horse, Show Jumper ect, too. <^~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems Like So Long Ago.........","review":"That I used to read this series. I'm 24 now. I remember reading this series long into the night, by the light of a flashlight. I LOVE THIS SERIES!

Any horse crazy 9-12 year old would love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Dippy","review":"This book would have been a real let down if I hadn't known from the start it would be Dippy. The plot could not get any shallower, and that is writen form a ten year old's view. The twists were not rollar coaster worthy, more like the merry go round. If you are under eight and 'Horse Crazy' you might very well find it satisfying. Still, for a younger child it is a good gift choice. Buy it for a birthday present for a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Saddle Club series.","review":"I love the Saddle Club series. I think any horse crazy person who likes to read would like this book, and series also.

But Lisa shows herself to be a good rider, and the three girls become best friends. They love horses so much, that they formed The Saddle Club. If I have anything to say about this book: it is the best horsey book in the world! No, I should correct myself, the best book ever published."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for horse lovers!","review":"This is a great book for horse lovers. It is about 3 girls who are all Horse Crazy and they start their very own club the Saddle Club. It's Lisa's first day at Pine Hollow riding stable. Max (the owner and instructor) let's her ride a nice old pony to start out. When the horse goes wild Lisa hangs on and wins Max's approval.This book also gives some tips on riding but don't try them without an instructor! For more details please read the boook! By Horses R.

This book made a huge impression on me, and I could not help but notice some areas where I was going in the wrong direction, based on my parenting style. The author draws from his own experiences and even his own mistakes in relating to children and how they reacted. I saw the same reactions in my own children and it hit me instantly, my eyes were opened.This book is very enjoyable and easy to read, the author comes across as a very caring friend sharing his experiences with you.

I reported the matter to HP the next day and they agreed to collect the unit for warranty repair. Some 10 days later they called me up demanding $650 to replace the screen, saying they were not prepared to honor the warranty for a crack.The lid is totally too flimsy to take the stress of holding the closed unit and lifting it from a carry bag.

Every time I start playing tennis weeks of rest and icing go down the drain; I was getting frustrated. Despite the disclaimer, I'm really excited now that I've seen the video and the pamphlet that comes along with it. The video is not slick nor well produced, but it contains much information and augments the detail in the booklet. I've mapped out a therapy, excerise and massage schedule and hope to be back playing in 3 weeks.

Not only it is the smallest of the Wei Chuan books, it has some nasty Western recipes in there as well. Simple is better. Why didn't they put more vegetable recipes like steamed Chinese brocoli with vegetarian oyster sauce? Instead they have a positively putrid recipe for potato salad and even vegarian hamburger! It's not worth $7.95 or $12 with shipping. They need to redo the recipes, do more things with tofu, and even some brown rice clay pot recipes. I can't find very many recipes which I would make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Very Vegetarian","review":"This cookbook is very, very bad. The recipes are really unappetizing.

Well I haven't got extra to buy another book for essentially the epilogue, so I guess I don't get to find out how this story actually ends.

The characters in this book were poorly written and without much substance. I thought Brittany was more interesting than Alexis even as much as she was written to be the one to hate on for being optimistic, sunny and attractive. Alexis was one obnoxious, caustic, ridiculous and annoying woman from the beginning. Her dialogue was painful to read and that part where she tries to beat up Ethan with her amazing black belt skills was dumb.

Stick to Kresley Cole and Cynthia Eden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun start to a new series","review":"Erin McCarthy has started off a new, fun series that is somewhat imaginative, unrealistic, but packed with lots of romance. I'm not a huge fan of her books, even though I keep buying them, lol.Alexis, the main character, she packs a lot of punch for a little lady, and her lines are quite funny at times.

His touching descriptions of the American Heroes that he encounters during his visit had me weeping more than once within the first ten pages. Zinsmeister is dead-on in his description of who the real enemies in Iraq are, from the elusive guerrillas to the liberal media that goes to great extremes to avoid telling the real stories that Zinsmeister has no trouble finding. While the legions of liberal reporters hang out in the relative safety of the Green Zone in Baghdad and report sound bights from press conferences, Zinsmeister displays his own personal courage in his willingness to put himself at risk to go out into the countryside and get the real stories. This book is for anyone who wants to know what it's really like in Iraq, as opposed to what we are being fed by the six o'clock news and the morning paper in their meager attempts to support their own political agendas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendship of Women With Current Reflections","review":"You may know about the women in the Bible that are written about, but the author brings you up to date with your own personal life...also a good discussion for small groups or a friend...another Chittister winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Freindship of Women","review":"I gave a copy of this book to everyone in a group of women friends I have when we all went away for a weekend.

It scares her-especially the creepy flower played by Caroline Rhea. The moms are annoying, the songs are unimaginative, and it just drags on and on. The worst part is that, everytime the DVD almost succeeds in putting a child to sleep, it screams them back to consciousness! It does this twice, after nice, quiet parts: my least favorite is after the singing of the lullabies, when Caroline Rhea suddenly starts screaming out \\"CAMPTOWN RACETRACK FIVE MILES LONG, DOO DAH, DOO DAH\\"!Homestly, don't waste your money, especially if you're wanting to use it at bedtime.

It is my favorite film."},{"rating":"1","title":"exercise in boredom","review":"I had high hopes for this movie, as it had gotten much praise from reviewers. However, I found it to be intensely dull. It was exactly as if I had followed a small boy around an amusement park for two days as he enjoyed himself, and this film seemed to take 48 hours to run its length. Although the character of the little boy was supposedly running away from a terrible crime he thought he had committed, he shows absolutely no sign of a disturbed conscience once he gets to the park. There is one interminable sequence that shows him earning money by collecting pop bottles, then spending it for pony rides. Whoa, already. The Red Balloon and other movies cited in comparison to this one are in another league. Save some time and skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, poor product","review":"This is an amazing film, having seen it on Turner, BUT the manufacture of this DVD makes it junk.

This 20th Anniversary Concert video does that and more. Seeing Howard here in all his incarnations really gives one an appreciation for his tremendous musical and stylistic talents. Great audience, nice interaction with the crowd, personal touches and strong guest star performances make the video a must for avid Howard Jones' fans or for those who might just be on the periphery of his music. Virtually all of Howard's hits are here, nicely packaged and creatively mixed. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for none","review":"I didn't realize it was possible to make plastic bricks so badly.

There are errors in some of the programs which make it additionally frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done Better by Forta","review":"I was REALLY looking forward to a juicy new book that showed some real-world examples of what CF can do. What I got was a rehash of the CF documentation and the Ben Forta book, \\"The ColdFusion Web Application Construction Kit 4.0\\", which goes into quite a lot more depth. The copy is nice and might be an easier read for the beginner, but I would have to say I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 2 Cents","review":"I'm afraid I was disappointed with this one.Since everyone in the ColdFusion community knows that Ben Forte's The Coldfusion 4.0 Web Application Construction Kit (Cold Fusion 4) is the bible for ColdFusion, I expected this new book, Mastering ColdFusion 4, to have some developers' inside scoops / tricks to better application building. Alas, no... the info in this book is readily found in the \\"bible.\\"Also, many of the examples in this book uses numbers and Xs and Ys (like Algebra!) which doesn't make it very straight-forward to follow and understand. Ben Forte's book uses a fictitious company, A2Z BOOKS, and his examples are of the bookstores employees and book inventories - and it was very simple to comprehend.Hope this helps fellow CF developers."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing . . .","review":"At 846 pages of \\"Mastering\\" ColdFusion one would think that this book would have more on integrating JS or doing complex queries . . . no such luck.

This is definitley for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful resource","review":"I bought the book and found it to be valuable in describing certain concepts that the Forta books were unclear about. The book takes a different approach to writing CF code (at times) and its always useful to see another approach. I like it and would recommend it. There is utility here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Content Lacking A ColdFusion Reference","review":"I really liked the content and how it was structured compared to the Cold Fusion book by Allaire. But with this high praise comes one major problem. This book is written and for beginning-to-intermediate Cold Fusion users but does not contain a Cold Fusion tag or function reference. It is only included on the CD. For someone learning this is very impractical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate & frustrating","review":"I gave up on this book halfway into the second chapter.

Though it does not go into much more detail that the online documentation provided with CF, it tends to offer explanations for the tags and functions in simpler terms.The experienced CF programmer may not find the level of detail they're looking for from this book, but anyone beginning to learn ColdFusion, or coming from a non-programming background will appreciate the straight forward, step-by-step approach of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok intro, lacks depth","review":"I have never used Cold Fusion and was directed to this book as the first to read before others. The book did give me an ok understanding of the general concepts behind CF, but the information is hardly worthy of \\"mastering\\". The book covers many topics but with insufficient depth. Furthermore, I am convinced that the authors were paid by volume considering the annoying excess of repating the same code (when only a few lines hvae changed) or the continual use of redundant \\"Notes\\" (how many times do I have to be told where to get the sample code or that they are using a sample database). There are some minor errors in the book, including a reference in the last chapter to the next three chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent book","review":"This is a pretty good book. I am a mid level CF developer and thought this book was good for learning basics and mid level information. I give it four stars because it covers the basics and also delves into intermediate level info middle and end of book (scheduling, cfmail, custom tags). I would like to see them cover more high end application info in their next book. Custom tagging is only the beginning of what cold fusion can apparently do! A good book for beginners and learners (less than one year experience coldfusion)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many bad code too little explanation.","review":"Despite the good reviews, I thought this book was less than helpful. And definitely not mastering CF. I found this book very frustrating. No topic was talked in depth, leaving the reader with sample code that do not function. The writers' biggest mistake was they assumed too much. They assumed that readers would understand the subjects with a little explanation. They assumed that as long as they included the sample code, readers would figure out eventually. I would recommend Ben Fortafs CF book.

I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Practical Guide to Internet Development with ColdFusion","review":"I have used several ColdFusion books and this is the most practical guide to internet development that I have found. Other books that I have used are better for intranet development or are better for applications which will be used by people with a lot of computer experience. This book, however, touches on error correction and accomodating user error at the same time that it covers functions. It also covers functions in an order that is practical for web development. The examples given are typical internet applications, allowing easy translation to commonly used functions.

Susan discusses 5 stages in the recovery of abandonment which I can identify with. Her advice in dealing with abandonment is exactly what I have concluded through my own experiences. It's nice to read a book that I can connect to so well. Having read this book, I can better understand the trauma I experienced as a child. It also gives me more hope that someday I will overcome the trauma that I've felt and be able to have meaningful relationships without fearing abandonment.

One night he confronts a stranger that had apparently been stalking him. There's a bit of a struggle, an accidental murder, and someone watching with a camera. Ohhh snap, let the mind games begin....FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET is classic Argento stuff--atmospheric, suspenseful, clever camera shots, dark humor, creepy music, plus some stylistic, high-impact violence & blood splatter.

Statistical mechanics is inroduced during the last 1/5 of the book, almost as an afterthought. This section has no redeeming qualities.

It is a great refference.This book takes you through the theory of thermo, but for a more practicle look at thermo see Smith and Van Ess Introduction to thermodymanics for chemical Engineers.The first half of this book is perfect for the begining chemist or Chem Engineer. It is a great book for grad students alsoI give this book five stars for the first half the second half is not all that great. Buy T. Hills Introduction to Statistical Mechanics for the thermostatistic part. It is from dover press and is cheap all Hills books are great and from dover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Made in America","review":"I had high hopes for this saw because I like other Bosch tools I own.The first thing I looked for when the saw came was side to side movement in the arm, it seemed to be a little too much, so I took a closer look. I found when the arm is all the way up and you push up a little more I could see the blade move up and to the left. I then looked at the pivot point and saw what appeared to be slop between the pivot pin and the casting.I also found that when the removable fence was clamped in place with its thumb screw it would tip foward some causing an out of square condition with the table. This not up to Bosch quality that I am used too.I now own a Dewalt 716.Amazon gets 5 Stars for their return policy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Selling What They Don't Have!!","review":"I ordered this saw on March 12, Amazon said that it would ship within a couple weeks, 7 weeks later I received a notice today that it would be delayed another 4 weeks.

For the money, you get a lot of added features that the DeWalts, Rigids, etc. don't have. Everything was dead on right out of the box. Haven't installed the laser yet, so I don't have any comments on that. The first couple of cuts I made had NO tear out on the back of the boards. The saw feels very solid and well built. On the flip side it is very heavy. So I wouldn't buy this thinking you can throw it in and out of your truck from job site to job site. But if you plan on putting it on a nice stand, then the weight is really no big deal. Favorite feature is having the bevel cut adjustement up front with the miter.

I saw this movie back in 1987 with my dad and we loved it. It was funny and exciting. Filled with a notable cast, this movie is also able viewing for the entire family. It is not filled with blood and gore, and does not depend on high budget effects to make it watchable. It is also filled with good music from the 60s and 70s (even Shari Belefonte-Harper gets to sing a song in a music video like montage). For my money, this is one of the better made-for-TV horror flicks. Lots of fun and thrills await you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"Ok this review isn't about the movie its about the ridiculous prices these sellers are charging.

Oh my, what junk it was. The basic story is: a couple of high school students (notice in all horror movies the main characters are never older than 20) find this cursed...I dunno, thing and that just sets off zombies to rise from their graves and run amok during Halloween. Hmm, how convenient. Basically everyone becomes a zombie except for one kid who tries to, like, \\"uncurse\\" it. It's forgettable if you're a die hard horror fan, actually even if you're not it's forgettable.

But when my doc office introduced me to this, I was hooked. It's not exactly like real chocolate, but darn close. With strawberries it's delicious and only 3 calories (each).

And let me just say, I happen to enjoy certain fakely sweetened things. I prefer Diet Pepsi to Pepsi, for instance. I wasn't expecting the taste of a fine chocolate bar or even hershey's syrup.But what I got was such an intensely awful experience that I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for 15 minutes. If I were a diabetic, and some sadistic serial killer of diabetics were holding a gun to my head forcing me to choose either this, or to risk my life and eat the real thing at the expense of sending my blood sugar sky high I would choose the latter.

It actually took me back to high school chemistry lab when we created the fake banana scent out of something that smelled like sweaty feet and baby vomit (butyric acid). The previous reviewer mentioned a chemical taste and this is it.

Out of This World is a comprehensive lexicon of of the life of the infamous St. Mark's in the Bowery Poetry Project. From Ginsberg to Ashberry, from O'Hara to St. Francis, from the down and dirty free verse of Paul Beatty and Jim Carroll to the the luminous prose of Mary Montenegro, this book is finger lickin' good. While it is dissappointing at times not to have more that one or two pieces by each poet, it gives you a scope that few works do. Elegantly edited and sequenced by Anne Waldman, the project's long-time director, Out of This World is a five-pound gem worth dodging library security or the wait for an out of print copy. Dig it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Bloom Shines","review":"Originally airing on television in 1999, Blood Money is a tale of family optimism and secrets. Eye-catching star Brian Bloom stars as Tony Restrelli. Born into a mafia family, Tony seeks a way out but finds that family ties are often too hard to break. In trying to fix some of his family's troubles Tony only sinks more and more into a dark world with more questions than answers. It is only when his brother comes up dead that Tony puts aside some personal issues and becomes determined to find out why. Despite the mafia cliches, I found this movie rather interesting as it weaved in and out of the various mindsets of different cultural mafia organizations. While no Godfather, Blood Money does take on the challange of small time families with big time dreams. Imagine a cut and dry Sopranos movie made for Prime Time network television."},{"rating":"1","title":"No lo recomendo","review":"A no ser de una de esas personas que les gusta tener un disco por UNA SOLA CANCIÓN, algo así como la Macarena, este cd es realmente para el olvido y a pesar que respeto y me encanta la diversidad de gustos, las personas que calificaron este disco con una nota superior a tres estrellas......Por favor!!, escuchen otras cosas ya que la buena música es cultura y este intento de cd dista mucho de estar en esa categoría."},{"rating":"2","title":"A summer cd","review":"One can safely assume that you love the ketchup song because there are 4 servings of it on this cd in multiple versions (karoke? this has to stop).

So why didn't I give it a full 5 stars? Because it doesn't show you how to do each step. They tell you to make a piece, and while visually you think it should be easy, there are actually tricks to getting the fondant to do what you want. And those visual and verbal steps are not shared.Only drawback to this book.However, would I give it back based on that small flaw? Never in a million years!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Cakes For Experienced Cake Artists","review":"The cakes in this book are as beautiful, fun, and creative as you'd expect from Debbie Brown. The author does assume a certain level of experience in cake decorating when she writes the instructions, however, and it takes some artistic talent to make the cakes look like hers; every little detail of how to create that finished product is not included. I'm pretty new to making novelty cakes like these, and this book is a little beyond my skill level right now. Even so, I'm glad I bought it, as it's inspiring and gives me a goal to shoot for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of ideas, must have patience and experience","review":"I have messed about with fondant, but was new to gumpaste when I attempted a cake in this book. Her descriptions are not quite as helpful as I'd would have liked. Especially the figures. Luckily you can alter as needed and it will still be a good cake. There are plenty more that I will be attempting in time. My mother (in her 50s) loved the fairy/waterfall cake (its included in the image list). I still have a lot to learn.Patience, practice and adequate prep are much needed. Not easy to do. But worthy challenges for those who want it.I didn't use her cake mixes or her recipes for fondant/gumpaste etc. I used box cakes (the decoration was enough for me), homemade marshmallow fondant, and wilton's gumpaste mix. Used toothpicks instead of sugar sticks for the figure and some of the mushrooms. Knew they wouldn't be eaten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly talented woman, but this book is not for the faint of heart","review":"Gorgeous designs and variety. Similar to what others have said, the typical beginner who hasn't had training will be totally lost or toally overwhelmed. I found myself saying, \\"Where do I find that item?\\", \\"When do I prepare that part again?\\" --- and that level of detail just isn't here. An experienced cake maker could copy the designs and know when to start different things to minimize bake and design time, but for a creative beginner like me, there is no way I can actually do any of these without spending hours of extra time backtracking steps, rereading, and mixing colors and fondant as I realize I need them rather than having a solid plan or recipe for the entire design ahead of time.5 stars for the designs; 3 stars for the instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and so much fun!","review":"I adore this book and had such a hard time choosing which cake to make first. I am a hobby cake decorator and found the cakes reasonable to do. The directions are very clear, but if you are not familiar with some of the techniques, it will take some practice working with the fondant and cake to get the perfect looking cake.

The CD (Make It Rain) I think is better, but I am more into blues than rock. His vocals and stinging guitar are excellent, but I find the songs to be forgettable. There is something missing and I can't quite put my finger on it, I guess it might be the fact that (Make It Rain) had stronger songs. This is just my opinion, so this review is so you have some more thoughts on this CD before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Target audience too wide","review":"Love the concept of getting mom/dad and baby interacting!

This pattern continued for about a week till I decided to use my mathematical mind and find out what changed in my diet during that week.The main culprit I could point to was this pill. I stopped using the pill and now I am back to normal. I am back to using RoxyLean which is one of the best pills out there. Just remember that body to body is different so whatever you are taking , pay close attention to body, tiredness, fatigue and your moods till you find the right one.

I've never left a review before, but figured I should with this product. I bought the pills mainly for an energy boost. Once my pills came, I couldn't wait to try them out. So that morning I took 2 on an empty stomach, thinking that they would give me some energy. Well they didn't,in about 2 hours I was very drained and fatigued. So I figured maybe because I didn't get much sleep the night before, that was the reason the pills didn't work. Over several weeks I continued to use them hoping that once they got into my bloodstream I would see results. Well it never happened. I finally had to face the fact, that these pills just didn't work for me, like they did for everyone else. So now I'm back to the drawing board on finding some type of energy booster for myself.

But the motorcycle is the reason to get this figure it is based on the Series VII Ghost Rider motor cycle with some additions, and subtractions. But it is still great. Haven't yet found the variant but the bike is supossed to be cleaner and sleeker.Though this brings the Wolverine total up to 5 (Tiger-stripe sIII, Brown costume sVI, Weapon X sVII, Logan sXI, and Astonishing X-Men sXII) for the ML line, it is still a neat figure and behind Iron-Man at 6 figures.

This time I requested a refund, and I plan on ordering the book from my local bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult","review":"This book is written exclusively for the academia and experts. It's a killer. I tried and tried but so many names and references and data and bibliography that when I finished it -yes, I did- I wasn't sure of one single thing about John's life. What was myth, what was true and what is hypothesis.A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order makes no sense","review":"The cart is always before the horse in this book. It constantly covers more advanced topics without covering introductory topics. Example: It covers ions before covering electrons."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Delphi graphics book available","review":"The thing I like about this book is its attention to detail. I purchased it at the same time as I bought John Ayres book on graphics programming. This book puts Ayres' book to shame. It covers the essential topics thoroughly -- no stone is left unturned. Ayres' book, OTOH, covers 2D sprite games only -- what a waste of time! Also, this book is written quite well, if I may say so. The Ayres book isn't. Jacobs' explanations are lucid and to the point. I really liked this one and highly recommend it to anyone who's already familiar with the Win32 API but wants to learn graphics programming. I'd also recommend this book to Mr. Ayres. He could learn alot from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on code, short on explanations","review":"This is hardly a \\"developer's\\" guide. Only the most rudimentary of examples are given, and most of the 450+ pages are reprints of source code listings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless book","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever bougth. The examples are so simple that you can find much better sources of information for free in the Internet. The explanations are so shallow that you must search other sources. Keep your money and buy something else. It is a shame to publish such a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality and poorly written book","review":"Two-thirds of the book are code listings which can be found on CD. Some code does not produce the effect the author described. You poor guys have to bear and grin since this is the only book you can find about this subject. If you are a beginner for both Delphi and OpenGL, this book may be more or less helpful. I strongly recommend you to find useful info on the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for compensation...","review":"Well, a book on OpenGL with Delphi. OpenGL is certainly a good graphics API, but forget about Delphi..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"This is a big surprise to me. By and large I generally dislike country music (this is the only country CD I own). I would rate this in my top 20 CDs (out of 500+). Stand outs are the title track, 'this face', 'won't catch me crying', 'don't fade away', and the interesting version of 'just dropped in' (which some country fans I know hate with a passion!). Oh well, we all have different tastes, which is probably why this CD appeals to so many. There is just about something for everyone in there, such is the variety of the album. Highly recommended to anyone who has a variety of musical tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd- even if you are not a nelson fan","review":"The great divide- a track off the album- but how appropriate a name of this cd which includes duets with members of the rock, and r&b world. My favorite is Mendicino county line which is also a country- 2 country duet.Great songs, and truly a brdige to the music world. A must hear from anyone who claims to be a music guru, definately one of the most interesting comp. of 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Divide","review":"(CD Review)Shows Willie has many stylings! Although he isn't necessarily good at all of them, these are. They are a stray from his popular Country sound, but one should remember Willie started singing before popular Country became the \`Country Sound'. This is reminiscent of his \\"Stardust\\" and \\"Blue Skies\\" days. Good CD. Oh, yeah, interactive too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be time to hang it up","review":"Somebody should have tapped Willie on the shoulder before this one made it to the press. I never thought I would see it but I guess if you've been around as long as Willie and recorded so many fabulous works in all types of musical genres eventually you will exhaust the possibilities. Now Willie has. Its worth one listen only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this album!","review":"Contrary to what some other civilian reviewers have written on this site, this album is not a worthy addition to the Willie collection. I too bought the album because , well, it's Willie. Big disappointment. The duets are uneven, sometimes even impossible to listen to. While there are a few good songs on the album, not enough to reccommend it. And it is definitely not even close to \\"Milk Cow Blues\\" (A great album!)or even to \\"Rainbow Connection.\\" If you are a die-hard fan of Willie, wait a couple of months, and you'll find this one in the used bin at the local cd store. trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am hurt to say this","review":"Let me start by saying I loved Teatro, Red-Headed Stranger, Shotgun Willie, Spirit, and his \\"greatest hits\\" records that I've heard. Unlike a lot of folks, I found plenty to like on Across the Borderline, too. THIS album, however, doesn't measure up. It's thoroughly overproduced, with guitar work and instrumental work utterly overwhelming the subtle joy of Willie's voice and always satisfying guitar playing. The production is like pop country, and I can only say I bought it on my feelings about his other material. He always changes the feel from record to record, which I like, but now and again you're going to fall on your face with that: so here's the tumble, let's hope the next one works. Sorry Willie, but I'd advise people to stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale contrast","review":"in the past two weeks i've procured both this album and willie's live album from the late 70s with the family. perhaps it's due to such a stark contrast with that earlier, energized and authentic performance that i find this album to be so remarkably unfulfiling. depressing, actually.yes, \\"maria\\" is catchy and the title track isn't bad, but the guest stars intrude, the production smothers, and the albums sinks beneath its own bloat. pity, really, as willie and his fans deserve better.to echo another reviewer, \\"across the borderline\\" covers the same concept in an infinitely more creative fashion; direct your attention there. or almost anywhere else in willie's catalog for that matter. and, of course, \\"willie and family live\\" is essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Let This Happen To You!","review":"Ironic, how often reviews make you go out and buy something and bingo it does nothing for you. This time it was the opposite - I gave this collection the swerve based on some of YOUR (!) bad crits. Then finally I get a free listen on Cathay Pacific's new in-flight entertainment system, and I find it's a gem. There has been a few decent releases by Willie since the epic \\"Across The Borderline\\" but personally I've been waiting for this one ever since. Willie leaps into songs from diverse sources like nobody else except maybe Johnny Cash. But Willie suits this full-blown and adventurous production as well as Mr Cash does the opposite. Don't be fooled by a few mysterious reviews - this is Willie at his best for those of us who live in cities. You'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARRGGHH!!!","review":"This is NOT better than rainbow connection or Milk Cow Blues...in fact this is the worst willie record since that last major label travesty \\"Across the Borderline\\" and at least that one had \\"still is still moving\\". None of these songs will become willie classics... Simply put, this record sounds nothing like willie...it is overproduced and sappy...and why one of the greatest songwriters of all time would do a bunch of rob thomas and bernie taupin songs is beyond me...that said, probably one of the better pop releases this year so far, and whatever they play off of this on the radio will still be better than having to listen to clay walker or creed, so at least there's that...Decent pop record, horrible willie record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still relevant at over 70","review":"The Great Divide proves Willie Nelson is still putting out great music at his age. Songs 1,2,and 3 are the best one two three opening punch in recent listening memory in any musical genre. Maria (shut up and kiss me) is great, followed by the best duet that Willie has ever done (with Lee Ann Womack) Mendocino County Line, followed by a great cowboy song with Kid Rock (who I would never buy anything of his on his own). The other songs are solid country fare, but are a drop down from the opening three and thus keeps this record at a respectable four stars. Would also recommend Willie's Across the Borderline for those that are looking into exploring a great country singer, yet can't jump in fully due to musical ignorance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring....and where ... is Alison Krauss on this thing?","review":"Yeah...this album leaves a lot to be desired, and the sticker on the cellophase packaging said Alison Krauss was in the mix. I can't find her. The Time After Time cover is rediculous. Only the Maria and and Just Dropped In (reminded me of the Highway Men)were good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Quincy Jones/Santana thing","review":"oh the Guest Album's how they have changed the Game? Quincy Jones did this Concept for many a Moon but it was Carlos Santana that has gotten all the Juice from it in Big term sales.so Willie Nelson is next in line for the Big Cash Out.but like with Santana the Best Material here just as there to me was when the Artist themselves were showcased.overall you don't get the guest adding anything to the mix instead just a cool Pressence&very Little overall Substance to me.Willie Nelson has created some Great Stuff but this Set is basically going thru the Motions for a Album as to adding any depth to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I bought this album with an open mind. I truely enjoyed the duet with Lee Ann Womack, \\"Mendocino County Line.\\" That was the only good track. I thought that with the likes of Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt and Rob Thomas, this would be as comperable as the Santana compilation. I was sorely disappointed. The other celebrity artists sang back-up. You could barely even hear them. This was a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by \\"bringing in the big guns,\\" but those big guns were nothing more than smoke and mirrors. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM UNLESS YOU WANT TO FLUSH YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this record","review":"I'm a big Willie Nelson fan for 20 years or more and this album is the worst that I can remember. It's so bad it prompted me to write my first review for Amazon after reading them anonymously for the past 4 years. [Bad], overproduced, sad really to put Willie Nelson's soulful voice in the middle of such hokey pop arrangements. These songs would fit best on a soundtrack for a Disney animated film. The same producer who brought real magic to Carlos Santana's SUPERNATURAL has buried Willie Nelson. Buy ACROSS THE BORDERLINE instead, an excellent execution of the same concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Very disappointing follow up to \\"Milk Cow Blues.\\" I could only manage to listen to this CD two times before retiring it. Only two tracks on this CD, \\"the Great Divide\\" and \\"Just Dropped In,\\" are reminiscent of Willie's previous musical stylings. This is apparently Willie's lamentable attempt at achieving the musical mainstream, and only one song was actually written by him. Included in his cover versions is Cyndi Lauper's \\"Time After Time\\" - enough said. If you love Willie for what he has done in the past, this CD is probably not for you. If you hate Willie for what he has done in the past, then this CD may appeal to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcends borders, highly enjoyable","review":"Willie Nelson never fails to amaze me... \\"Teatro\\" was brilliant and daring, last year's \\"Rainbow Connection\\" a pretty simple and weak effort - and now he's back with a \\"big\\" rock album.Sure, the unusual \\"big sound\\" may alienate traditional Willie fans, but hey - this man just rocks. Even though almost all of the twelve selections here were written by others (Elton John's sidekick Bernie Taupin or Cyndi Lauper, to name just two), Willie gives these tunes an awful lot of life.I have played the album over and over since I've had it, and I still love it to bits. I wouldn't say it's better than \\"Teatro\\" but it's just as good - only different. What other veteran artist is really able to do that... re-invent himself with almost each new album?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Willie I know and love!!!","review":"I have almost every Willie Nelson album made. I love him, I love his music, and I play them more than any other music that I have. However, this album is a big disappointment. Rather than singing about broken hearts, drinking too much and generally having too much fun, the underlying theme of this album seems to be getting old and getting wrinkled. Yuk! It's going to happen to all of us -- but do we want to sing about it. Also, I miss the Willie sound of Sister Bobbie on the piano and Mickey on the harmonica. This sounds a little like big band - Lawrence Welk - and who knows? Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuccccccck","review":"I like Willie Nelson...or at least I thought I did. This is truly evidence that there is a time when one should not sing anymore. This is probably the worst cd I have ever heard. It is almost unbearable to listen to. Kid Rock? Bonnie Rait? I wouldn't be surprised if Cyndi Lauper jumps him in a dark alley some day for his rendition of Time after Time.The menagerie of duets should have never happened. It will go down in the books as \\"everybody makes a mistake at least once\\"Willie.....find a day job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't try new things you will surely fail...","review":"That is what makes Willie so great, and what makes Great Divide amazing. Willie is still creating new, interesting and quality music. Yeah, it's not like most his other stuff. But if he played Whisky River on every album who the heck would keep listening? Do yourself a favor and add this one to your collection. The other mucisians make it unique. The songs are very well done. It is incredible!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album Ever","review":"I agree with the Amazon review. I don't mind Rob Thomas or Bernie Taupin. Talented guys. Willie Nelson has no business singing their songs. Ever. That he chose to cover Cyndi Lauper baffles me. This album does not work on any level. I'd have used zero stars were it an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Divide- Willie Nelson","review":"This is my favorite Willie Nelson album, in fact this purchase is a backup for the original one that I bought. Great duets with a list of who's who in music that are not afraid to go outside the lines. It has accompanied my wife and I on numerous vacations to enhance great times."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Lipton Better","review":"Well, I never thought I would say THAT !I've tried multiple brewing methods and so far (about half the bag already)I haven't really enjoyed this product. It is sold as \\"loose tea\\" but, it looks like and behaves like freeze-dried crumblies. It makes dark, brown tea in about 1 1/2 minutes. It's strong, but not flavorful. It has none of the delicacy I drink teas for, in the first place. This is the coffee of teas. Yes, it is better with milk and sugar in it, but it shouldn't have to be added to. No bouquet. Today, I used loose-leaf Lipton (very cheap at the W store). It is absolutely delicious and not flat like the Yorkshire. Reviews are subjective, of course. I must say that Taylor's makes very good teas, especially high-end tea bags (if you must)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it","review":"this product was the worst in the world the lightbulb burned me and went out once or twice a day .

We looked all over to try and find my daughter one and she was heart broken when we could not. I was lucky enough to find one at Amazon and quickly ordered it. Little girls love to play dress up and this is an awesome way for them to design their own line of clothing, so to speak. I cannot wait to see her face when it comes."},{"rating":"2","title":"All In All, A great book","review":"Definitely suspenseful, a very good book! It delves into Michaels' character and relationship with Maria a lot-- Cameron's finally out of the picture! Michael has a lot to deal with in this book, and many times he channels out all his problems thinking about Maria. Max and Liz lovers beware! This book enters the level of unMax-Liznees that makes you want to be sick for a while. It sets up a scene for some real M/L action in book # ten, and you don't get ANY M/L action in this one, really. Has a lot of surprises with Trevor, Dupris, Kyle and Adam-- two people die before the end of the book, and one is sent away to a mental institution. Really a cliffhanger ending-- and not a good one for you Max Evans fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This is yet another great book in the series of Roswell High.

It made me easily want to buy the last book in the series, and I recommend it to everyone or anyone who has even a little interest in the books or the television show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roswell #9","review":"Roswell the dark one was great. It explored more of the charecter relationships while adding a lot of Science fiction to the book. This book helped me to love the charecters even more than I already did.

My daughter owns other Care Bears from mini to ones bigger than her. This one was 13\\" tall when standing, super soft, like a Gund Bear, and also had a light blueberry scent, but not nearly as strong as the Strawberry Shortcake dolls. The DVD was only 24 minutes and contained 2 stories. It was a nice extra bonus. I would highly recommend this quality Care Bear to all fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too cute","review":"I bought these care bears to use as some of my center pieces for a baby shower. The mom to be, loves care bears. They were just as I remembered them when I was younger. Each one is suppose to have a scent (blueberry, flowers...) I couldn't really smell anything...but still so cute. Everyone loved them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully accurate and moving","review":"Like virtually all the others who have reviewed this book, I think it is extarordinarily lovely and historically accurate. It brings a world that is distant in time, location, and values home to the modern reader in a vivid way. It is not always a comfortable book, but it is sharp and thought-provoking. As many others have noted, the love story is moving and emotionally strong. The end of the book, dealing with the reconciliation after adultary, is written lyrically and with power. It probes cultural beliefs about men and women, sexuality, and love in an intensely emotional, personal way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful start to the Trilogy","review":"A mammoth tale well told. SKP brought the characters to life in her 1984 opus. This was early in her career and I gave it 4 stars versus 5 stars due to some parts of the book lagged for me. Her portrayals of King John and Llewelyn were excellent. She concentrates much of the story of Llwewlyn's wife Joanna. Joanna is a very interesting character and Sharon does a great job of telling her life.For me, however, there were times that her story lagged for me. At one point I did put the book down and then resumed in a couple of weeks.I look forward to book 2 and hope for a little less of the touchy-freely and a little more of the sword play. That is probably just me. The book is a masterpiece and worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"One of the best historical fiction book I have ever read!! She is possibly one of the greatest historical authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable.","review":"Its a good story line, with characters that you want to follow and see where the next page takes them.I dont think there is much detail on the day to day lives of people from the 12 century, but I didnt miss that.Some writers have a great deal of detail and if done right it adds to the story. Sharon Penman does need that here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"The story of Joanna, favorite daughter of King John, granddaughter of Eleanor of Aquitane, and her marriage to the Welsh Prince Llelwyn. Set in England and Wales, I am looking forward to seeing Wales myself after this read. Excellent read. I don't want to give anything away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read but lacking substance","review":"I feel compelled to write this review because I feel this book is a good read with an engaging plot. It is a page turner for me but lacks a little bit of \\"something special\\".Firstly, I wish that the story did not focus so much on Joanna's even though, it helps give dimension to Llewelyn's character. I wish the author spoke more of the historical events of the time.Secondly, I wish we had appendices listing all the Welsh words and their translation as well as places. But mostly I wish for a list of characters and their relationship (ala Dorothy Dunnett) as well as a family tree for the Welsh and English royal houses. This would add more depth to the story as the reader could better understand the politics and relationships between states.As is, the book is a good read, but if you wish for some good historical fiction, Dorothy Dunnett is the queen of that domain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Captivating","review":"I absolutely love this book. I ran across this book in the book store one day and just randomly decided to get it. It was one of the best choices I have ever made. Since then, Sharon Kay Penman has become one of my favorite authors. She makes her characters come alive! I love the way in her books no one is a villan, in the classical sense. People do good and bad things, but in the end they are entirely human. I also love the historical detail she puts into her books. She obviously does a lot of reseach. Everyone I know who has since read this book has loved it. I highly recommend this WONDERFUL book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The 13th century comes alive","review":"Sharon Kay Penman's book \\"Here be dragons\\" is a masterpiece whether you like history or not. I first read it when I was twelve and I've reread it many times since because I loved it. It's much more romantic than the next two books in the trilogy, which can be a good or bad thing, depending on what you're looking for. The entire book is like a rich tapestry, filled with mead-guzzling adulterous lords, bawdy jokes, banished wives, and above all portraits of people. The story is about King John's illegitimate daughter Joanna whom he gives in marriage to Llewelyn of Wales for an uneasy peace. Unfortunately, the peace does not hold and Joanna is faced with the choice of choosing between two loves: her love for her father and her love for her husband. The story will keep you enthralled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding read","review":"This book is a very compelling historical novel. It took the first half dozen chapters to get wrapped up into the plot but once there you get invested in the characters. Sharon Kay Penman does an outstanding job of keeping all the characters straight. The storyline is so interesting. She weaves her tales with wonderful writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sensationalized","review":"Too much about the sensationalized personal lives of the nobility and little about what it was like for a broad spectrum of people at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Marvel","review":"Ms. Penman managed to do what any other historian or author can rarely do: she allows us to see her characters not as they were viewed in history's harsh light, but as humans. She shows their good points and their bad, and allows the reader to form his or her own opinion, instead of simply being told if that person were a good king or if that woman were a terrible wife. This Welsh trilogy was fabulous and I recommend it to anyone wishing to learn about medieval Wales and the Plantagenets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much History, Not Enough Fiction","review":"I read historical novels because the history makes a good story even better. For me, this story is weighed down by the historical facts and falls short on the storytelling. I fully expected to love it, but I did not get fully engaged in the characters, and if you don't have that in a novel, you don't have anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable","review":"I usually don't read period novels but I've got to say that this book was one of my favorite books I've read. Ms Penman is a master of story writing and her historical knowledge of the period is second to none. You better get Falls The Shadow and The Reckoning while your at it because you WILL want to read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welsh storytelling at its most beautiful","review":"Here be Dragons is a fautless interweaving of Welsh and English history at it's very best done by none other then Sharon Penman.thirteenth century Wales is unbalanced to say the least and Kinh John is as power hungry as ever. Llewelyn is prince of wales in all but name trying to unite the people and hold King John at bay. Marrying Joanna creates a truce between Wales and England for Llewelyn. In the back ground King John is always constant causing rifts in their relationship. Thier story is beautiful and humbling as they go through life, betrayal, and forgivness together.It's amazing how Penman is able to put into words the emotions of people from so long ago and yet as a reader you feel as if they are a part of you. Everytime I put the book down I felt like a peice of myself was put aside with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating . . .","review":". . . from the very beginning to the very end. Ms. Penman grabs hold of you and never lets go. Her writing is flawless, and both her description of Wales and her characterizations make her story come vividly alive, evoking 13th century England and Wales in all its horror and glory. It's impossible not to fall madly in love with Llewelyn, and Joanna is a heroine for all times. Ms. Penman even makes King John so passionately human that I found myself feeling sorry for him. I wanted the book to never end, but am thrilled that I have yet to read her next 2 books in this series. Ms. Penman has a truly remarkable talent for weaving history and fiction into a brilliant story. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't put it down","review":"I chose this book based on the reviews from other readers.

I enjoy that the books spans lifetimes and it well rounded."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooring","review":"This book was picked for me by Goodreads because I read a lot of historical fiction. I read reviews that said it takes some time to get into. I read 150 pages of this book and was still not into it but I pushed on. At 200 plus pages I was still bored out of my mind. The author jumps from time period to time period and gives no explanation as to where and when he now was writing about. The characters had no depth. I do not recommend it. I am sorry I wasted my money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and almost masterly written","review":"Do you know the feeling you have when you wish you've never read a certatin book? That's how I felt after reading \\"Here be Dragons\\". I just wished I could feel the thrill of discovering a truly marvellous book for the first time. In a year I reread it three times. Then I discovered \\"Falls the Shadow\\" and \\"The Sunne in Splendour\\", and I've only just learnt Penman has written two books about Eleanor! Can't wait to begin with them. After reading Dragons I had a thing about Wales which lasted for two years. Penman's style is fine, and her use of archaic words and phrases makes the scenarios more vivid and engaging"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cymru Am Byth","review":"A beautiful, magical work. The reviewer who compared it to a Harlequin Romance with a bit of history probably isn't used to reading imaginative, historically-based novels like this one. Yes, most of the characters DID exist but Ms. Penman is a WRITER and therefore at liberty to discuss Llewelyn and Joanna as much as she likes without it taking away from the validity of the work. If you want pure dates and events, read historical NON-fiction! Therefore, I don't think one can review this book for what it is and not see the absolute beauty in it. Only one side of my family is Welsh, but I have always felt FAR more pull towards that aspect of my heritage than the other side. It is a beautiful place and Ms. Penman's work brings Welsh history to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here Be Dragons","review":"I was given an old copy of this book as I had run out of things to read on my bookshelf at home.

It's that good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turning, can't-put-down, wish-it-would-never-end epic","review":"I just recently discovered the trilogy that begins with Here Be Dragons. My only regret is that I did not read it sooner. The masterful writing brought the characters to life, hundreds of years after their deaths. And the weaving of history and dramatization is as close to seamless as I've ever encounterd in historical fiction. The only distraction to the storyline is the occasional trite dialoge between Llewelyn and Joanna. I didn't need all of the \\"I love you's\\" to get the point. And I would have liked to seen Llewlyn's earlier years fleshed out a little more. I found myself wondering about those first conquests of his at the young age of 14. But these are very minor criticisms in the face of a well-written, complex story, that keeps your attention long after you've turned the final page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous Trilogy","review":"I fell in love with all the characters/history and miss them now that I have finished all three books in the trilogy. I enjoyed the easy with which the author combined history with fiction within the novels, plus at the end of her books she includes \\"Author's Note\\" explaining the historical facts/fiction. These are books I could not put down and story lines/plots that are so interwoven that I could hardly wait to find out what was coming next. I am looking forward to more wonderful books by this author! Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This book explores a part of history that very little people know about. It is interesting how Penman handles the romances between Joanna and Llewellyn and John and Isabelle, given the age differences between them. But even as teenagers the central characters speak as adults. The romance between John and Isabelle is slightly hard to comprehend as today it would certainly be called paedophilia. What could a 12 year old possibly have that a 32 year old man could be interested in? But in the 12th century such marriages were common and we cannot judge them by todays standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book Penman has written - Unforgetable","review":"This book far outshines her other books (which are great) and shall forever live in my memory as my favorite of her books. The story of Llewelyn Fwar & Joanna is so magnetic. The book draws you into Wales, it gives you views of King John and so many others that were before pictures in a history book, that now are alive and living. People you will never forget. When I go to England it will be more than a trip for me, it will be a meeting of old friends. A chance to walk the streets these people once walked. To that I say - Thanks Ms. Penman for taking me for a visit - how much I enjoyed it! She is a marvelous writer!!! Please read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent beginning to this powerful trilogy","review":"I was taken by surprise at how much I enjoyed this story. The entire trilogy had me so hooked that I would rush home from work every night to read a hundred pages. Don't be intimidated by the length. The stories are so engrossing you'll wish they were longer. If you're a fan of historical fiction - or thinking it might be something you'd like to attempt, give Here Be Dragons a try. Awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you a lover of romance novels or historical fiction or both?","review":"This book was recommended to me because I am a ravenous reader of historical fiction. I found this book more of a romance type novel It seemed to be presented like the \\"history plays\\" we use to put together in elementary school. You would take a time period and each class would take a major or minor event in that time period and act it out. We'd go to the library, get the gist of it and contrive the characters on how we thought they would be at that time. What you got was a play with shallow characters, flat dialogue and dubious accuracy on how it all went down. If you love a good romance novel than this might be for you but if you're more a solid historical fiction person than this may not be the novel for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Susan Kay Penman's \\"Here be Dragons\\". She has an engaging writing style which keeps one riveted to what could otherwise be very dry and boring history. She clearly very carefully selected which characters to follow, and you see their development through the book, while others are given only a cursory mention. This results in ones interest being kept while not being bogged down with facts that take away from the narrative.If you are looking for a history book, this book is not for you. If you are looking to learn some history while being entertained, this book is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good characters and story but too long...","review":"I enjoyed the first half of the book but it just drug on too long. By the end I could not even remember what the disagreement was even about. It had good characters and a good plot it just keep on rehashing the same old thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recording quality disappoints","review":"I realize it's difficult to record such a large orchestra and choruses, but this BD had me examining the settings on my playback system to try to mitigate the flat, almost muffled sound. I could find no fault with my system and had to conclude the recording sadly misses on the dynamics and clarity that is so important to this work.The performance itself is beyond reproach, but this BD falls sadly short in recording skill and effort, and does a great disservice to the recorded material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe everything you read!","review":"I recently purchased a book, \\"Sondheim & Co\\", from this bookseller. I was specifically looking for the 1989 paperback edition of the book as it had information on later Sondheim shows. I'm directing one of his later shows and this was to be a very important piece of research. The only one I found that fit this discription was $50. The other, earlier 1974 editions were plentiful on Amazon and all priced under $10.The shipment came to me very quickly. But when I opened the package, I found a 1974 edition, which is totally useless to me. I contacted the vendor via email to tell them I was shipping back the book and wanted a full refund, including shipping. They advised that they would refund my monies as soon as they received the book. UPS shows it was delivered last Wed, it is now Monday and no credit on my card.I will follow-up and I imagine ultimately obtain my money, but this is a hassel I didn't need and I still don't have the research material I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Coens first major effort: \\"Blood Simple\\"...","review":"Once upon a time, two eager outcasts named Joel and Ethan Coen, strived to be accepted as serious filmmakers...they went on to become two of the most creative filmmakers of all time, but in this (to their own admission) immature movie, the screenplay is likewise--despite what Roger Ebert and all of his followers say. Only for the desperitly curious...its alright to miss out on this Coen experiment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Cute","review":"My 4 year old grandson LOVED this costume! (Especially the muscles!) He has been \\"flying\\" throughout the house for the last few weeks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opens the Heavens","review":"I have recently purchased this book and was dissapointed at first due to it being more of a hypertext based reference, how mistaken I was, the explanations of the terminology are well written and very informative even to a lay man like me. I now have an incredible interest in other related topics thanks to this book and now intend to persue those with vigour. A great book for anybody, you do not need to be a science boffin to comprehend this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"We really like this","review":"This is one of the earlier Berenstain Bear books, and it shows. As you can see by the cover, the bears on the *inside* of this book are less stylized and cutesy than the bears in the newer books, and the story is an early reader instead of a longer read-aloud.It's a cute little story about a cub and his misadventures with his bike. The illustrations make it perfect, as he's constantly getting jumped on, or falling off, or colliding with other bears.There are only a few words per page, with a basic vocabulary, so this one is perfect both for early readers and for little-little ones learning to talk. However, don't expect it to help your child learn to count, it's not really a good book for that. It mentions numbers, but it doesn't really mention counting, or go through the numbers consecutively."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite books about numbers","review":"Every time the English-as-a-second-language textbook gives a lesson on numbers, I use this book as a supplement. The kids enjoy it and find it amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counting with bears","review":"This book is very colorful and is fun for young children. It's color and creativity would attract even the children who don't like to read. It's pictures really help young children learn to count. It helps children learn how to count with pages phrases such as \\"One bear on one wheel.\\" This book is highly recommended for young children learning to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the book, Bears on Wheels.","review":"Hi my names Jerry Main Villines and I'm eight years old and I want to tell you about Bears on Wheels. It's about bears on bikes. Some are in the air, some are in a tree, and some are on the road. There are so many bears that they run into each other. This is the best book I've ever read, and it's the easiest book too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This bear makes riding a unicycle look easy!","review":"In this fun book we follow a bear that is riding a unicycle (\\"One bear on one wheel.\\") as he takes a ride through the countryside. During his ride he keeps managing to pick up passengers, some are hitchhiking, and some just jump out of trees on top of him. Each time he meets another bike on the road there is a collision, but our bear always lands on his feet (or on his unicycle) and rides off alone.This is a really cute book. The bears all have expressive faces, and all the pictures are bold and colorful. The words are never more expressive than \\"Two bears on one wheel.\\" Or \\"Five on one.\\" but yet the book flows and manages to keep my attention. As I said, a very cute book.Loggie-log-log-log"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read","review":"I am going into first grade this year. I really like reading this book. It has a lot of sight words. It helped me learn my number words. I read this book a lot.My favorite part is the five bears. I think it's funny when they hop on each other. I also like the pictures in this book. I like the end because it goes back to one bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why pay for info surfing the web brings free?","review":"I bought this book to help me aid my entry back into school at the ripe old age of 30. I figured, \\"Great! Peterson's is know for good guides, and I can use all the help I need\\". Unfortunately, The information contained in the book is readily available on a wide variety of websites for free, and if you are reading this, you obviously have access to the web! I would save your money on this one. Instead, use the money you would have spent on application fees, and surf the web."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks!","review":"I bought this used (thankfully I did not spend a lot on it) thinking it would provide a decent overview of graduate and undergrad scholarships...not so!! The undergrad and grad sections where the scholarships are listed are just about identical! Nothing is listed easily - for instance English scholarships are under Literature/Communications, for which there are only 3 listings. Don't buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice hat, magnets a bit annoying","review":"This hat is pretty good, it has its advantages and disadvantages.Advantages: Wide brim keeps sun out of face and eyes. Magnets are strong and keep sides up. The flexibility to push sides up is convenient when you desire a bit of sun. Chin strap is nice on windy days. Fairly stylish for outdoorwear. Scrunches up nice and small for packing and storage. Very fast drying (rain and/or sweat).Disadvantages: The wind can blow the sides up and they stay there due to the strong magnets (would recommend a snap for keeping up vs the magnets - although when purchased, I was enamored with the magnets). The plastic slider to adjust the chin strap fell off after a couple of uses, I can still knot it where I need it, just not as convenient. Not very breathable.All in all, it is a great hat, but to do it again, I would probably purchase one with snaps instead of magnets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annoying","review":"Product came quickly and as described. Clock has a lot of non-standard features for such a small package and cheap price. And the actual alarm has a super annoying tone, very hard to sleep through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viewing angle problem spoils nice alarm clock","review":"This clock has a nice design, easy to use and doesn't take up a lot of night stand space. But in order to see the clock at night when you hit the light button you have to be significantly higher than the clock. For some reason the LCD display is not visible when the backlight is on unless you are at least 30 degrees higher than the clock. Since our nightstand is level with the bed, it makes reading the time at night impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alarm does not work.","review":"This is my second one. My first worked for about two years then the alarm stopped working. I ordered a new one from Amazon and it worked for a week. I think I'll try another model."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I really like this alarm clock, it even came with more features than I realized, I definitely would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp LCD clock","review":"This clock is simple to use, and attractive. My only criticism--if you can call it that--is that the backlight only comes on when you touch the bar on top. I understand why--this is cordless and having constant illumination would wear out the batteries too quickly. But if I wake up at night, I'd prefer being able to just glance at the clock rather than rolling over and pushing the bar in order to see what time it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this clock!","review":"I was pleased with the look of this clock when I first got it and happy to have a clock that did not need to be plugged in. That's where my satisfaction ended!! This clock sucks! It resets to 12:00 every time you hit the snooze button! It is no more than a crappy, battery-eating paperweight. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's nice","review":"it has several nice features :- a very good size display (i see it from a realy far place).- i like the features it has & specially the temperature feature.- i also like the idea that it doesn't have wire which makes it easy to put anywhere- it's slim- the back light feature is very nice BUT it stayes for EXREMELY VERY SHORT TIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mar","review":"Pretty good singers...lol..i enjoyed recording this CD..Great times! hope you all enjoy it. It consists of 10 new songs accompanied with tambora...Banda."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY #1 Jazz Music","review":"Ok, I'm not a jazz musician or even someone who you could describe as a jazz fanatic. But I'll guarantee that you will love this.First of all, the music/selections is/are excellent. Then there is the phenomenal execution of Les et al. Once you get over the amazing technique (you can always go back to this), the music itself takes you over like a spiritual, drug ride (or at least what I imagine one would be like in heaven). Anyway, the price of this makes this simply the best value in jazz, period.Joel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I use this pen every day, red and black, and really like the writing quality of this pen.

But the clip on the clip board, is plastic and broke within the first day of use. I actually bought one before at the body worlds exhibit and the same thing happened to both. For the price - its a shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Edition","review":"I have the first Blues tape, and was waiting for the next volume to come out. This is a great series for people like myself who don't have enough time for private lessons. The instructors are fun and informative, not boring like some of these other tapes. Can't wait for the next blues in the series. Thanks !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hand Grips Made of Sticky Plastic","review":"The hand grips are made of some weird sticky plastic that leaves a residue on your hands. I had to speak directly with Invacare to get permission to return it and they asked if \\"maybe I had put on some hand lotion\\". Don't insult my intelligence! I will never order another Invacare product. They also took over 2 months to credit my return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cute and comfy","review":"I got the yellow shoes, and while they are quite bright, I got several compliments on them. They are definitely fun and I was surprised that my feet didn't hurt the first time I wore them (like most new shoes I buy). For $17.50, definitely worth the investment. {Also - they run true to size.}"},{"rating":"1","title":"quite uncomfortable","review":"I bought the red slippers, but maybe the yellow ones might have looked cuter...but overall fit is quite uncomfotable. If you ever tried a pair of any shoes that has an elastic on the back of the shoes(which is a trend these days), you would know they feel like you have a rubber band around your feet, and the elastic pushes your feet forward, inevitably making your toes touch the front part of the shoes, which doesn't have any cushion...i had to cut the elastic somewhat to make it more comfortable....so if you are looking for comfotable shoes to wear, this isn't the shoes for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's the best","review":"This is, like all the other Gloria video's, a great video. And a must to have for the real Glo fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for so I had to return it.","review":"The delivery was swift and the clock was in good condition. But I was looking for a wall clock that lights up. This one doesn't so I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blast These Re-Releases!","review":"Everything about this CD led me to suppose that the performance was fairly recent, with singing one-on-a-part by the six listed soloists. A new ensemble, I blithely thoughT! Instead it's just another re-release of an unsuccessful recording from 1994, sung by a choir of about thirty voices, semi-pro singers at best. It's a wallowing, moaning performance of the sort I despise most consistently, in which the only rhythmic precision is from the conductor's foursquare barline baton.Believe me, I've just saved you some money. The Missa Quatuor Voci has been superbly recorded, along with Domenico Scarlatti's \\"Stabat Mater\\" , by Concerto Italiano. No equally superb performance of Monteverdi's Missa in illo tempore comes to mind, though there are several available. But even if this were the only version, it wouldn't be worth your listening time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and disgusted...","review":"Let me first say that I wanted to like this movie. I liked the main character even though he's a huge puss. I wanted to see him succeed. But there are way too many flaws for this movie to work for me. This poor guy is so down on his luck that he would eat a plate of gravy smothered dung? Do yourself a favor and just watch reruns of Fear Factor. The ending is not shocking nor is it a \\"twist\\". It's just another way for the main character to prove his puss-ness yet again & show us once & for all that he's no hero. C'mon man, really? After butchering a whole gang of bikers, finishing that steaming pile of excrement & executing ur girlfriends dog and u couldn't finish the last task? I call bulls***. Enough with movies trying to go for the total gross-outs. Horror is supposed to be scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The premise is that ''everything begins with a single step', and poses the question, \\"Does everyone have a price?\\" How far will someone go before the moral \\"stop sign\\" kicks in...IF it kicks in.This Thai movie is being remade by Daniel Stamm as \\"Angry Little God\\", which will be out in 2013. Look forward to seeing how he treats the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching","review":"First Thai movie I have ever seen. It is pretty good. The basic premise is a guy who is down on his luck is given the opportunity to make some money, by performing 13 tasks, his reward getting bigger every time but all will be lost if he fails. You watch a good guy become corrupted by money and lose his morals. Not to give away too much, but there is a twist at the end, a dynamic which applies to Thailand if youre familiar with \\"farang\\" and the result of much Western tourism in Thailand. Definitley a decent movie worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Unextreme","review":"Why in the world this is put out under the Dimension Extreme label I will never know. This is the most \\"unextreme\\" movie I have seen from them yet. Easily a PG-13. I really wanted this to work, but I'm sorry, it just did not click for me. The people that are comparing this to \\"Saw\\" have obviously not seen it. I love Thai movies (Alone) and some other Dimension Extreme features (Inside, Storm Warning). Don't expect much from this. The cover is pretty much misleading. Boring, boring, boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psst! It's a GREAT film.

Especally the graphics! Even though there are 2 very light black horazontal lines going accross the screen. You wont notice it. I used it for my IBM Thinkpad X24 when I broke the screen when I must of sat on it! (The laptop was on the arm rest of the couch and must of off onto the seat. It's really hard to see a very small dark black laptop on a black leather couch.)I now use it with an IBM Thinkpad T30 now. The only other problem to me is is the screen doesnt dim very much. Even at 0 0 (AT NIGHT) it is very bright."},{"rating":"2","title":"beutiful monitor","review":"I got one of these monitors at a computer show and have been impressed eversince. the monitor has a beutiful picture,DVD are so clear that you can see every hair on a persons head.

A good friend in Colorado, a thousand miles away, emailed me that her 90 year old father was at deaths's door. I immediately began the long distace healings, using Steve Murray's method. Within a week, my friend's father was out of intensive care, and back at home. I continued the long distace healings on him, and he lived three more years. I have had the Reiki Master attunement, and am reading more of his books. I plan to have him certify me as a Reiki Master.

Did they play just 2 songs?). Soft Machine's Esther's Nose Job performance is long lost since the days of the first issues on VHS (also, where is the rest of their performance?).Just half star thinking as a human being and two stars being extremely nostalgic and deeply hard core.

If you have an opportunity to meet Jane and Phyllip personally it will be a treat. They are gentle and careing with many years of experience in the field. If not, then you may find the video's helpful. I have attended their review/booksigning and workshops and find it benificial to have both the book and video.

B. equal lateral portions. C. equal anterior and posterior portions.

The only bad point is that I tend to write evrything with them so using 1 pen constantly will amke it last about 2 monthes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Weber collectors!","review":"Bruce Weber fans should order this and keep another as a spare.

The current cost of the Kindle version is ridiculous considering the little effort it took to generate and the inconvenience of having to decipher the OCRed mess.Having read the book several times, I believe it to be of sufficient value to have available for reference and reading wherever I may take my Kindle.So if it is worth your time and effort, create your own copy of the book.

But this error might be indicative of the stories I've heard about the UPGRADED DVD of this film, which has been reported to be low quality and chopped up like salad, with some of the tomatoes missing, which is why I never bought it. But, I did see the original version at theaters, and it is excellent, with Delon making a great Zorro. But on the other side of the mask, I think he comes off with too much effeminacy, as though he is gay, but not to the extreme George Hamilton did in the deliberate gay version of the, in that case, fox-tailed coat. If and when I hear that the producers get their act together to put out a version that, if not improved, is at least not cut up and missing segments, I'll buy it. But until then, the below-six or five-dollar price for this is MAYBE what it's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"3D 2009 Edition Review. Cant believe some of these reviews!","review":"Come on...Everyone is talking about the Cinema version....You CANNOT have the cinema version wihout a special system and you cant expect paramount to give you the best if you only spend 10 to 15 dollars on a dvd. Also no extras because you are only getting one DVD and it has both 2D and 3D film so there are actually two full length movies on one dvd so there ends the questions on why no extras....(WONT FIT on dvd)Im sorry for all of the complainers but I really appreciate the fact that paramount has thought of the people who actually wanted to see how the things appears now offscreen vs the old dvd where you just get an idea of what would come out. Please by all means, go out and get it but yes they are all telling the truth about the color being distorted, but what do you expect from (Red and Blue) glasses?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor 3-D Release.","review":"This red/blue 3D version does not work. Period. You get a tiny bit of depth every so often, but its really bad. This is one of the worst 3D presentations I have yet to see, in any format. Like the other standard DVD's that have come out recently, the color is completely washed out. The print of both the 3D and non-3D versions are very grainy. No extras, except for the Trailer. Just a bad release all around. It's a shame that this couldn't be released in the non-red/blue, polarized version...I have that one - from a copy of a copy of a copy on VHS - and the effects are still superior to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Rating for 3-D Portion ONLY","review":"After seeing the imperfect, but decent 3-D treatment that My Bloody Valentine 3-D got on Blu-ray, I excitedly picked up Friday the 13th Part 3 in 3-D. I was in my teens when this series was being made, and I relished the idea of seeing it again in 3-D.What a disappointment! Prior reviews mention a \\"ghosting problem,\\" but that's putting it lightly. The ghosting problems are terrible and pervasive. The ghosting is so bad in some scenes that it gave me a headache. Daytime scenes are the worst -- sometimes the backgrounds are muddled blue-and-red chaos. More headaches.Things that are supposed to \\"pop out\\" of the screen DO NOT. At all. The images ghost into chaos before that ever happens. So, if you were looking forward to seeing Jason fire a speargun at you, don't get your hopes up. It doesn't work.Do not waste you money on this unless you're interested in the 2D copy on the disc. The 2D version is nicely cleaned up.

The picture is filthy, which adds to the atmosphere of the film. This filthy pictured horror atmosphere plays a major role in the film, as an entry into the horror genre. Many '70s and '80s horror flicks carried gritty pictures, which made them wonderful. In the '90s its unfortunate that many horror films have not been made with gritty pictures. The next Friday the 13th film(s) will unlikely have the great gritty stuff. So I'll have to look for the gore, t&a and the presence of Jason, to see its delicious effects. In Part 3, another slew of teenagers go to the woods and get chopped to bits. But one of them has a near-10 minute battle with Jason, which also adds to the film's greatness.

The first real good sequel is part 3, where a girl named chris goes to kick it with her friends at a cabin lodge. Jason shows up of course and kicks ass. My favorite Friday sequels are part 3 and 6 because they have good characters and does not come across as a cheesy b-grade horror movie like the other 7 sequels.Make another Jason movie like this(new Line) because Paramount treated the franchise like a joke but still cranked out better jason movies than you have."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a real 3D blu-ray","review":"I know it was cheesy and I saw it when I was a kid and thought it was so cool when the spear flew out of the screen and almost hit you in the face - but they used polarized 3D glasses back then even - not these cheap red / blue things that come with the disc.

This one is definitely old school, for use with the old style red and blue glasses. However, this movie was highly entertaining. The fact that it is in 3D just makes it all the better. Many of the scenes work very well, as they originally did in the theater as I recall, when i saw it back in 1982. It really brings back memories. If you have a 3D TV and would like to get a preview of what it is like to watch 3 D in the comfort of your own home, this movie does that. It provides a glimpse of what your tv is capable of. With the emitter and digital 3D glasses, the picture and effects will work even better. But, the price and selection of these newer 3 D movies is still cost prohibitive. Do yourself a favor and wait 6 months until the studios start producing more movies for 3 D sets, and get this one in the meantime to hold you over. For under $15 bucks, its a no brainer.

Despite 2 previous bloodbaths at Camp Crystal Lake (chronicled in the first 2 \\"Friday The 13th\\" films), yet another group of less attractive but equally sex-crazed teens travel there intent on reopening it. As you probably suspected, that murderous, non-speaking, zombie-like psycho Jason awaits them (he dons his infamous hockey mask for the first time in this installment) and many gory slayings ensue. The shocks work surprisingly well and the killings are as brutal as ever, but of course the finale degenerates yet again into a one-on-one chase between our antagonist and our heroine where, despite all appearances and no matter how hard she tries, he never seems to actually be dead.

So I bought this movie popped it into my 1080p dvd player and set down with my 3-D glasses (supplied by the dvd maker) to watch it on my 52 inch high definition tv. The quality is pure crap, everything is hazy with blue and red overpowering the picture. The 2-D version I already had was 100 times better quality.

Chris, it seems, is haunted by an earlier encounter with Jason, and her romantic entanglements with local boy Rick (Paul Kratka) do little to ease her nightmares. Meanwhile, the gruesome antics of Shelly (Larry Zerner), a chubby practical joker who just wants to be loved (and get laid), leads to an escalating case of the boy who cried wolf. When he's not incurring the wrath of leather-clad motorcyclists, he's annoying the other guests with his mock mutilations. Soon, stage blood turns to real as guests and bikers alike fall prey to the killer lurking in the barn out back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friday the 3rd time around!","review":"Just when you thought Jason was dead....well he's not in the sequel that started him wearing that creepy hockey mask for the rest of the series.Part 3 is at times slow and annoying ,but the rest of the 3-D effects from the theaters are some points hilarious on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why put this one in the toilet?","review":"Jason's back and hunts down a group of teens on vacation near the sight of the murders from the first two.

They didn't put any of the cool extras on here, banking on the 3D effect being the main drive, and the 3D here stinks. Nowadays, with the advancements in 3D, this cardboard crap is just bad. I too was really looking forward to finally seeing this again in 3D, because I saw it in the movies back when, but to see it this way isn't worth it. The opening credits, for some reason are in 2D. The credits popping out are some of the best 3D effects in the movie and they left it in 2D. The entire movie has heavy duty ghosting throughout. 20 minutes in and you have a major headache. And remember, this disc offers NOTHING except the 3D version of the film. I hear the Blu ray release has ghosting problems as well. Also, the movie is very grainy.

Its the original red/blue 3D, so watch it on a TV not a computer and from at least 10 feet. I watched it on a 32\\" screen from 12' and the only effects that had a double vision were the snake and wooden pole in the first few minutes. The opening credits are shown in 3D but the old stock from part II is in 2D. This movie is much better in 3D than 2D as much of the film is focused on the visuals that can only be seen with the red/blue glasses. The only reason why I rate this a 1 star is that people tend to read the low reviews and make their decision, all of which say the 3D doesn't work. It does but if you sit too close or have a sight problem, like color blind or such it won't work correctly.

I love Harry Mancini's opening and closing theme. The characters are a lot more interetsing. Well, they're the same old horny oversexed teens you get in every film but the addition of the fat prankster and a hostile biker gang makes the difference. This will best be known as the film where big Jason first gets his hockey mask.Alright, this is not Oscar night here but let's be honest if you are the type of person that would watch a FRIDAY THE 13TH movie then this is what you're looking for.

After surviving the events of Part 2, Jason goes to a near by small store and kills a couple. It's sort of odd that he has no hair in this one after he had hair at the end of Part 2. Anyway, Jason makes his way to a cabin in the woods in which teens are staying at. This time he goes after the couple Chris Higgins and Rick, a jokester named Shelly, two girls, two pot smokers, and three bike gangsters. Most of the murders took place in the barn. Even though the climactic chase scene was fairly good, the ending was horrible. In Chris' dream, Jason is alive again with his mask off and runs to out of the barn. At that same time, Mrs. Voorhees pulls Chris under water. How is that possible. Chris didn't even know about Mrs. Voorhees. Not being at Camp Crystal Lake hurt this film.

Plot-wise, that's the only thing differentiating it from the previous entries. There's also the fact that the movie was filmed in 3-D, which explains why there's a lot of dangerous objects waved maniacally in front of the screen. Not much in the way of suspense, and while Dana Kimmell and Catherine Parks are hot, neither get naked. The last twenty minutes, a big stalk and chase sequence, is pretty good, however, and the movie's only real saving grace.

The anemic plot is again at Crystal Lake where those gosh-darn teenagers don't know any better: sex equals death! Better than Part II, this sequel has some bothersome characters you want to be killed at once, but the infamous hockey-goalie mask worn by Jason memorably shows up in this one.

The glasses are cheap looking, which they are indeed, maybe you really need a top notch beamer with a great wall to make this 3-D effect work, but on a smaller screen it just does not look like 3-D, no worse, it gives you a headache and it takes some time to adjust to the lousy effects. Of course Producers have given this typical slasher flick a new twist. Maybe it work in the cinema, but at home you must have some equipment to make this work.I read the other reviews and wasn't worried, now I am, as I would like to get rid of this stinking-picture.Sorry folks, but maybe you can give me some advice how this movie can be enyoyed with his gimmick!?jw"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This For The 3D Version!!","review":"I bought this for the 3D version and can't describe how awful the color looks.

You will watch your cholesterol levels and triglycerides skyrocket (thanks to biosynthesis) while you feel deprived because you are constantly eating BORING, FLAVORLESS, unnatural food and inadequate protein. Your body will eventually (in the face of too little protein) begin to cannibalize other tissues to get the raw material it needs. If you work out, you will notice that you do not look \\"fit\\" so much as emaciated and sickly. If you happen to be insulin resistant, your metabolism/endocrine system will go haywire while it tries to cope with the outrageous sugar burden.McDougall has made a nice living pushing what is essentially a lose-your-health diet based on bad science and improperly manipulated statistics.Buy a copy of Protein Power (Eades) and see true health and long-term weight reduction/management."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Diet Book Ever!","review":"I've only been on the diet for one month and have lost 17 lbs. I feel great and am even starting to exercise again. The key is sticking to the diet exactly. No fatty nuts, avocados, olives or soy. I've discovered my body works much better without that stuff anyway. I feel so good, I don't miss those foods a bit. I'm also sleeping much better now and have more energy throughout the day. People ask me what I'm doing, and when I say I'm on a 100% vegan low fat diet, they always say \\"I could never do that\\". I bet they'd be surprised at how easy it really is.

When fresh vegetables are at a minimum, I use The McDougal plan. This is one of the three best plans anywhere. The Norman Walker Plan is equally good and the Harvey and Marilyn Diamond Plan, Fit for Life is excellent. I do not count calories and have thrown my scales out. Stop eating greasy meat, sugar laden food and slimy dairy products. Don't blame McDougall. He is only the messenger. Also, read the two Fit for Life books, especially Fit for life II . The McDougal cookbooks are excellent. Five stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Austere","review":"I'm happy so many have succeeded at this plan. It sounded really good to me, but after following it for about two weeks, I didn't lose any weight and was very susceptible to refined carbs. Oh and I've been VERY bloated from all the high-residue foods.Now, I've been vegan for some time so that was no problem. But to give up all breads & pastas was too much. Not to mention any nuts or nut butters. Or soy milk & tofu.Ugh. I like T. Colin Campbell's (\\"The China Study\\") approach (though I didn't lose any weight either) of whole foods & plant-based.McDougall's diet, while sounding great, is too austere for me. I'd much rather have fewer calories and include whole-grain breads, nuts, etc. Much more satisfying.I did like the section on sleep-deprivation though and have noticed the depressing effect of normal sleep time. That alone was worth reading most of the book. But I wouldn't pay full price for it (I bought mine used)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Flexible if you have to be","review":"Most people who reviewed this book are quite happy with the book, which is good, but there were a few negative reviews. It seems to me that those negative reviewers saw some benefit to this program, but saw some things in it they did not like. Well, I think too many people are caught up with being \\"perfect\\" and following diets/programs to the T. If you feel you need a bit more fat or oil in your diet, then add it, sparingly. If you want some pasta one night, then have it. I have lost over 80 pounds in 10 months on this program and I have been flexible. I eat vegan about 96% of the time, but I still eat a bit of shrimp once in awhile, or some egg whites. If I am too strict, I will most likely fail. I found a good balance.

It has a lot to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stricter Vegan","review":"The book explains many things that I did not know. I like the stricter diet for loosing, but found some of the ingredients repetitious. So, like the book suggest, I improvise with different allowable items.

What you will get are thunderous beats, growled vocals, and all that anger that gives industrial music such a wonderfull sound. It really doesn't get much more intense. Funker Vogt doesn't screw around. The songs are ruminations about pain, death, war, etc. Basicaly what most other industrial bands sing about.

So far, I've found that if I make a recipe from this book once, it quickly becomes a recipe that I fix regularly, because it's quick and I often have all of the ingredients in my pantry already -- and even when I don't, a quick trip to the convenience store or supermarket is all that's needed, because the recipes don't call for obscure items that require hunting down in specialty stores.

Her reaction to a miracle performed at the church, not to mention a certain thing happening to her at a Women's Prayer Group (I won't spoil it), show that Goldy truly is not a one-dimensional character.

In each volume, Ms. Mott-Davidson's body count rose to an incredible level and left me with serious doubts about wanting to befriend Goldy and her clan.I'm disappointed and will no recommend this series to my readers, no matter the wonderful recipes.

She's written a passable mystery, but I found too much emphasis on food and church. If you enjoy those two things, you would really love the whole series. The author is VERY knowledgeable about church affairs, and calls on that knowledge to write this series. the emphaszis on food is meant to bring humor into the book. But I don't find that mystery and humor mix very well. Also, I just could never come to like the main character (or any of the other characters, either), and therefore, never really got pulled into caring about what happened in the books. I had really looked forward to reading one of the books in this series. This was the first one I came across.

D.M.D. characters don't just investigate murder & mayhem, they get tragically involved in the crimes in very personal ways. It is getting hard to pick up another book, knowing the kind of angst Goldy and her family is in for, and I probably won't. By the way, isn't it kind of hypocritical to base the series around gourmet catering and then harp on the best friend's (& fellow ex-wife's) fatness?

Yet the right boot's footbed is clearly not manufactured correctly, as I can barely go an 8 hour workday wearing them. It feels as though there is a hump under my smaller toes. My foot also seems to pronate markedly. The left boot doesn't seem to suffer from the same defect.

They should of come up with a zip-up or button-up pillow case to make it a whole lot easier to cover the pillow. 2) It's HUGE! For me...the size is fantastic, because it affords me so much comfort.

Being so big, it was hard to reposition in the middle of the night.Besides being big, the filling in this pillow is not nice. It reminds me of the poly fill in cheap pillows.

Also, the case that comes with it began to pill after a couple of weeks which makes it uncomfortable against bare skin.

The sneaker was such a tight fit, that it took several minutes just to insert past the opening whilst fully enlarged. I don't even think his sneakers are extra-bulky, they are a medium width Sketcher low top. I consider these a waste of money as my son will not get much use out of them.

It is perfect for my Japanese archery classes because it is easy to carry around in a small suitcase and fit various lovations such as a school gym and a dance studio. The net is big enough to cover the target area and even beginners don't miss the net. Arrows never go through the net except one rare case.I use s-shape hooks to hang the net from the pole for volley ball net in the gym. I use some trap belt as extension when I hang the net from the high ceiling of a dance studio. I would buy the same product if I have another location for my archery class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish they'd make a better version!","review":"I am a teacher who reads this book to my class every year.

I assumed there would be no better author to delve into SEAL training than Dick Couch based on his earlier work. I didn't get what I expected. What I got was a lot infuriating acronyms, unnecessary minutiae, and God Bless America propoganda. I was hoping to learn a little more about the dudes that becomes SEALS, what they do as SEALS, and what becomes of them after their service. This is NOT that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advertisement for the SEALS","review":"Good book. BUT, do these guys (the candidates, trainers, anyone involved in the program) do anything wrong? It's an advertisement for the Navy SEALS. A Christmas Card version of what goes on in the training of Navy SEALS. I don't think he writes one, honest, critical word about the program. He only writes about the good stuff, and glorifies it beyond that.The Navy SEALS are the toughest, most well-trained, force in the U.S. military. They don't need some over-glorified version of how they qualify for the Teams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

The Finishing School: Earning the Navy Seal Trident, follows SQT (SEAL Qualification Training) students through some of the most challenging and exciting moments of their Navy careers. Anyone with an interest in the military, an aspiring SEAL, family member or friend of one of these amazing warriors should definitly read this book. I must add that it is not necessary for one to read The Warrior Elite: The Forging of SEAL Class 228 to understand The Finishing School: Earning the Navy Seal Trident. There are several pages devoted to explaining the BUD/S process which was the topic of The Warrior Elite: The Forging of SEAL Class 228, although I highly recommend both. Hope this review was helpful to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Warrior Elite","review":"I gave Warrior Elite 5 stars. Finishing School was good but there were so many sections that I glossed over because all they had was Navy-Speak bureaucracy-type stuff that I didn't think was interesting at all. The parts that were great were when they focused on one of the SEALs and gave his background and story, etc, and on the details of the training. Maybe to a Navy insider it might be more interesting but it would have gotten 5 stars from me if he would have concentrated more on the actual trainees and not all the mil-speak departmental stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This was another great book by Dick Couch.

I was more or less pleased with \\"The Warrior Elite\\", but was very disappointed with \\"The Finishing School\\".

It withstands weather--we never find even a drop of water inside after rain. It seems well made & durable, & the hinge works perfectly so that the top doesn't slam down when you open it. It was also very easy to put together. Our only problem with it is getting the bag out once it's full.

Would definitely recommend--it is worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good purchase","review":"As others mentioned the opening of the can is too narrow so if you put in a garbage bag and fill it is impossible to get out without rolling over the can.

Two of the plastic end caps on the legs used to keep from scratching your floor up were totally broken off.

Blink is a great collection of songs she's been working on for a while, and it amounts to one of the best albums of 2005.Practically doing everything herself, Tracy employs a variety of real instruments along with smart production choices that perfectly enhance the songwriting, and never overshadow it. Super-catchy hooks are a plenty, and Tracy's voice is packed with sincere emotion, happily lost in the joy of making her own music.Songs like \\"Something Beautiful\\", \\"Eyes\\" and the gorgeous \\"All Thumbs\\" grabbed me and stuck with me the first time I heard them. Repeated listens just further my love for the album, finding more things to enjoy each time around. It's excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still Tracy","review":"More pop, subdued, introspective and brighter; this album is very different and unexpected, but there are melodic moments in a few songs that allude to previous work and remind me that this is definitely Tracy. After a few listens I am catching the tunes pleasantly running through my head, so I suppose I can honestly say I\`m hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bee has lost her sting","review":"Almost two-thirds of this CD are filled with uninteresting tracks that vary between the inane (Dumbo Sun, which sounds like something Roger Glover could have written) and the insane (Wilting Flower, an irritating exercise in R&B-crooning). Only \\"Eyes\\" stands out above the rest and reminds you of the quality of Tracy Bonham's preceding CDs. Now, \\"Eyes\\" can be had on \\"Bee\\", which was released in 2003. That CD also contains \\"All thumbs\\" and \\"Shine\\", in a less polished (in my opinion: better) version than on \\"Blink\\". Stick to \\"Bee\\" and wait for the next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mature Bonham sound that's still unique","review":"HOOORAY!! Finally a new TB release. After listening, I was a bit surprised...the girl has grown up, matured, but has managed to keep her signature sound. For a little on my favorite tracks, read on:The opening track, Something Beautiful, is just that. Great vocals, great guitar, great everything. What a pleasing opener. Eyes has a very catchy melody and is a well done near-ballad. Dumbo Sun is awesome! A fun tune with fun lyrics. Shine is my second favorite on the disc. I love the inspirational lyrics and smokin' melody. Shine has the best chorus of any song.Bottom Line: TB fans, this is a must buy. You won't be disappointed, in fact, probably very pleased with her mature sound. You can still hear some of the early Bonham influences here, but they are refined and polished. Thanks for the music, Tracy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha? What Happened Here....","review":"Well... Not much apparently! I'm just gonna come right out and say it: the story has gone down the tubes!(as has everything else, save the great music)The animation quality has gone from poor to just downright ugly. This makes shows like Digimon look like Ghost in the Shell. As for the new characters... huge dissapointment! They are all shallow and simply put, very dull in apperance and character. Well, if you've collected the first three videos in this series my advice is stop now or look forward to being let down. A pity, because near the start this series had some potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this one subtitled instead!","review":"Overall, I give it a B-. The story is good, even though it has very little to do with the original Record Of Lodoss War. The problem with this one? Bad dub job.

The team isn't as epic as the last one, but the story is good. The animation is also splendid and the dubbed voices are better than the norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not enjoy this book","review":"Did I enjoy this book: I really didn't enjoy this book. I was expecting so much more after reading the synopsis.This book is not a YA book so much as it is a middle grade book. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy middle grade books but this book just really fell flat and was not intriguing at all. For the most part, the sentences were short and choppy and the story just didn't flow that well in my opinion.I could not connect with Jack, who is eleven and in grade school during this short story (about 80 pages on my Nook). His adventures and actions were not believable. I did like Mr. Fink and Arturo, which is surprising since Arturo was sort of the bully in the book. They were the most believable characters to me.Would I recommend it: No, I would not recommend this book.Will I read it again: No, I will not read this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read Historical Fiction","review":"This is one of those stories that stays with the reader long after they have read it. It is very well written. We get to look through the eyes of a young man who has lost his father to the war. He is like many who lose their way only to find it in a strange turn of events. I look forward to putting this on my shelves at school. It will give my students a look at life during the 1940's for children of that time. There are so many lessons to be learned through this book. There is so much they can compare to today and the war we fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. The book was a look at one life in particular, Jack Dalton. However, we see that not only is he affected by decisions he makes, but his decisions affect others as well. This is a must read for anyone interested in life during this period in time. This is a book for old a young alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"Not gonna lie, the summary and front cover had me thinking this book was going to be YA. However, the main character, Jack, is just eleven years old - which definitely threw me - especially when I sort of expected him to grow older as the story progressed. Again, my mistake.In spite of my surprise, I quickly warmed to Oliver and his young mind. The way he talked about his \\"fiancee\\" was endearing, and you couldn't help but admire his determination. You see, Jack puts 110% into everything he decides to do - and his bravery might even put Harry Potter to shame! :pBack To Bataan was obviously written with a great deal of thought and care. It's impossible not to get caught up in Oliver's story because it is just so believable. Jerome Charyn created a character you want to root for, even when he does something bad, you can't help but cheer him on and hope everything works out for him.If you're looking for a quick read with a good dose of action and humour, it's definitely worth a read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like them","review":"These did not work well for large boat bumpers or hanging from a pontoon.

There's also too much preachy stuff in the middle. I also find it unlikely that a terrorist organisation would take a gay dress designer into its inner councils with little more than a nod and a wink.But the book's main drawback is that Wilson can't really do character. He tries to achieve this by talking psychology, but it doesn't work. Virtually all the men are interchangeable - which is a problem if they have unfamiliar names - and the women are mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing and repeated pages","review":"My paperback version pages go 1-24, 73-104, 57 to I think the end of the book.

Guilty of buying this crappy thing 'cause it looked decent. It has everything wrong that you could possibly design wrong.

It works OK for me as an alarm..it is not very loud but that works for me. Since I have used the alarm function since I bought it not having the instructions have not been an issue but i can see how it could be difficult to learn without them. The biggest drawback is the very dim backlit but I have learned to live with it. This year it did not revert back to CST from DST. I finally pushed the reset button and it reset it self with in 2 minutes with the correct date and time. I don.t think Sharp makes this clock or any clock for that matter, because when you go the the company web site there are no clocks listed anywhere in products or support. I think they just license the name for these products and that is what makes it so hard to find manuals when they are lost. I think Amazon was very nice for scanning the manual and posting in the image section for this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"I just pulled the battery from this piece of junk. The programming is as counter-intuitive as can be and it never picks up the time signal. It was too cumbersome to use as an alarm clock so i moved it to where i only needed it to tell time.

I love the accuracy of atomic clocks so wanted them to keep me on time in bathroom in morning. However, this clock does not seem to be picking up atomic signal because over time it loses minutes. Perhaps a one-battery atomic clock is not good enough for connecting with the signal (from Colorado isn't it?) when one lives in Virginia, as I do. We have two other atomic clocks in the house, both of which require more batteries and have no trouble picking up the daily atomic signal.

The book has a great premise -- ganglife and a new immigrant's experiences in 1880s New York -- but it waffles between a full-fledged historical novel (like Edward Rutherfurd's works) and the second draft of a literary work. If the author had taken on one of the genres, and fully explored that rather than trying to blend the two, perhaps this would have been a more satisfying read for me. It's definitely \\"readable\\" but doesn't live up to the accolades on the jacket.But because I saw some moments of good storytelling and a good handle on the dramatic pace, I have hope the author's next work will be much improved over this piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling read","review":"Unlike one of the other reviewers, I am not familiar with much historical fiction set in New York City. That being said, I think the author of this novel did a great job of painting the picture of post-Civil War New York and filling out the life stories of the main characters. While for me some of the characterizations (the Why-oing) and plot twists (main character's job changes) seemed far-fetched, I was drawn in by the characters' stories and the rich texture of the setting of the story. It did take me several chapters to get into the author's prose, but by the middle of the book, I was flying through the pages and looking forward to the next time I'd be able to sit down with the book. I don't know, if you're an expert on New York history or are more interested in the history part than the fiction, maybe this book is not for you. For me, this was a compelling and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative","review":"I like the notion of violent gangsters chosen for their vocal pitch. I like the idea of the sewermen in the municipal bath house, and their fear of the \\"ghost\\", the very human way they justify its existence even though the truth is painfully self-evident. I like the way the plot hovers just above mystical and supernatural. I like the juxtaposition of song versus gore, bridge versus sewer, poverty versus wealth (and so on- it is a book of extremes). Does it have to be absolutely plausible to be a fascinating story? For my money, this \\"guy gets girl\\" saga is stronger for its whimsical elements. Some concepts in the book will make me pay more attention, now, to the sounds in the city. Is that really a screeching cat? Or could it be a pomaded, red-lipped, axe-blade-booted killer communicating with his lackeys?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"I am generally a sucker for anything about New York City, especially if it is set, as this book is, in a historical New York City. However, while this book's take on the building of the Brooklyn bridge and the gang culture that made up the Five Points was interesting, I felt that it was too long and that the \\"coincidences\\" that continually made things go right for the characters were too on the nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aftermarket Strap Solution","review":"Good sturdy bag. First saw it in Lucky Magazine. Be advised the bottom is vinyl, not leather. Wanted a shoulder strap for hands-free carry. Found a 1/2\\" rawhide Tandy leather belt blank (Ebay) and had my shoe-repair shop add matching buckle, punch holes and finish end. Attached the buckle end to one existing strap, and attached the other buckled strap to the hole end of the belt. Works good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product not as advertised","review":"The product is shown in Canon retail packaging. The Cartridges came in a generic white box with foam and a note saying essentially 'Don't worry, these are genuine Canon Cartridges'. While they may be genuine cartridges, the packaging makes me suspicious. In addition there was ink on the outsides of the shrink wrap for each cartridge and the shrink wrap did not quite match other Canon cartridges I have. The cartridges may be fine, but I won't take the chance. Especially since they aren't any cheaper than buying them elsewhere. I choose to return the cartridges, which fortunately Amazon makes very easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Confused, Gauranteed.","review":"Although the preparation material is decent, the sample practice tests are awful. I just took the verbal tests and more than one third of the questions were either low quality, unclear, or just plain wrong. More than half of the critical reasoning questions have arguably no correct answer or more than one correct answer. The explanations are just a few words more than \\"Answer B is correct because I say so\\". The author seems to be incapable of critical reasoning and logical analysis, let alone teaching you about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best quality prep material, save your money","review":"I got the book a few days before my exam because I wanted more practice. The material in the book is early beginner level. If you rely on this as a primary guide, you're in for a rude awakening on test day. More importantly, the testing software leaves a lot to be desired. Besides being buggy, there are problems with the material as well. Some questions are vague, incorrect and at least one was simply wrong. The level of the questions in the quant section is low and unrealistic. I believe that the same software is packaged with the Peterson guide as well (same publisher) and I looked at that guide too.You could apply any of the reviews written for this book to that book as well.In short, save your money and time. Go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain wrong sample questions","review":"2 out of the first 20 practice questions (quantitative section) are wrong. I don't feel like using it any further, as the remaining questions are ambiguous.Glad that I borrowed the book from a library and did waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong info","review":"This book gives you wrong information about the GMAT. The book claims that each section is scored out of 60 points (it's actually out of 51). Also, the book's practice math questions cover such topics as calculating standard deviation, finding the area of a parallelogram, and analyzing data sets - none of which are actually on the GMAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"MANY STRONG POINTS AND SOME DEFICIENCIES","review":"I am surprised to read all these negative reviews. I own Master the Gmat, the Official Guide 11th edition, and the Kaplan 800. And let me tell you something: none of them give you a comprehensive review of all the aspects tested by the GMAT.Master the GMAT's verbal section is weak but it has by far the best explanations on geometry and coordinate planes, giving you formulas that I have not found anywhere else (like the formula to calculate the area of a rhombus). Also the lesson about exponents is one of the best I have seen and the math exercises are very realistic and similar to the ones you'll encounter in the real test. I have taken it twice so I know what I am talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mistake","review":"I bought this book in a hurry at a local store, since I remembered good things about a different Arco prep book - what a mistake. It doesn't seem like the writers spent too much time putting this together.

Hugely amateurish, and 90% of them are the video equivalent of a high schooler writing an essay about not being able to come up with an essay.

Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resource for Color Combinations","review":"This book is a great tool for finding color combinations. It contains small samples of 2, 3, and 4-color combinations. At the bottom of each combination page is a tip for using colors together. My only quibble is that the samples are VERY small, probably because the footprint of the book is also small.Recommended for getting ideas on color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for Japanese artists?","review":"The primary target audience for this books seems to have been Japanese, with Westerners as an afterthought.The books does contain hundreds of color combinations, but throughout the book the 61 colors used to form different combinations are identified according to the Dai Nippon Inc Color (DIC) System.The book also contains swatches in 61 colors, which you can cut out with scissors, and which are on the back also identified according to DIC system.At the end of the book there is a conversion chart, where you can find what color in DIC system correspondes to what color in CMYK, but it is way less convenient that using color combination books like Color Harmony Workbook by Lisa Sawahata, which I have found to be infinitely better and much more practical and user-friendly for Westerners."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea / bad product","review":"I looked long and hard for this product. I wish now that I had not made this purchase. The cutting blade portion is thicker than a steak knife and it does not cut the butter into paper thin slices (like the add says it does).More like the thickness of a pad of butter. Also you have to chase the butter all over the plate or hold the butter still with your hand to make it cut. I did find if I stood the butter up on one end and cut down toward the plate it worked better but still very thick slices.A few days after I purchased this I found a carrot/potato peeler that does the job perfectly. And it really does cut paper thin slices. The peeler I found has an open blade so the butter falls away nicely. I wanted to do this to get my kids and myself to lay off so much butter when we have pancakes.Sorry for the bad review..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent history, few photos","review":"This is an excellent written history.

The song had nowhere near the impact as Lloyd Banks' \\"On Fire\\", mainly due to its overly simplistic production and cliched hook.

The end result is semantic gymnastics that try and substitute evolutionary complexity for free will. Sorry Dan, it doesn't work. Complex biological processes have not transcended the innate physical causality of neurophysiology and they never will. Paul Churchland does a far better job of articulating these issues without the self-serving bombast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly unimpressed","review":"I didn't learn anything new in this book. The writing is cloudy and arrogant and redundant and inefficient. While I agree with Dennett's basic premise, that questions of ethics and free will should be asked from an evolutionary standpoint (how does this help the species survive?) I closed the book feeling altogether unsatisfied. Dennett always meanders around points and then claims them later. His arguments are not clear and convincing. Some of the main points in the book are:that free will is an evolutionary adaptationthat indeterminism is not made possible by quantum mechanicsthat decisions are processes taking place in the brain over space and time and therefore cannot be pin-pointedbut to me none of these theses are new or surprising, and I just don't see what took him so many pages to say what he said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Quite good, quite readable.

I installed Norton 360 on two computers. It slowed down both of them. Not severely so, until the program started to nag me to renew my subscription. After I did so I lost the use of my laptop for about 4 days. It slowed down so much that it took 4-6 HOURS to boot up and about the same amount of time to shut down!!! After determining that Norton could be the problem it took me almost 18 hours to delete the program. Perhaps the problems have been corrected in Version 2. I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE THE CHANCE!!!

The package has a 60-day money back guarantee with a website for return information. I followed the instructions precisely and after 2 months of nothingness, I contacted the company. They did everything but give me my money back. They gave me the phone run around, tranferring me to several different representatives, and asking me to wait for several weeks. After the phone round, I got another round of email run-around. To show that they are serious about improving their customer service, they contacted me via email to notify me that they closed my account and request to rate their customer service.

A lot of the experiences are based on the sophistication of the user, and it's typically those who can't solve common PC scenarios who complain the loudest. I'm no expert, but I'm far from a novice in this area. With that, I have to say this is some of the worst software I have ever used.It's turned my brand new, very fast and snappy Vista PC into a mess. Boot up's went from a minute or two to 8 to 10 minutes. Existing windows settings were ignored and access to simple things like printers on my network were blocked. Program access was slowed to a crawl. And oh boy does this thing hate iTunes. Just loading the program took 6 to 8 minutes following installation of 360.

When I first was configuring it for my computer, I started having problems with the interface. Although it looks nice, it lacks options. Most notably, 360 doesn't allow you to scan individual files. I didn't believe this at first, but after going through their website, and wasting an hour waiting for online tech support, it was confirmed: if you download a file and want to check it for viruses, you have to perform a full system scan.

What a mistake.The LiveUpdate (upon which the whole anti virus function depends) was broken nearly from the start. After many sessions with tech support (who really seem to be trying - in a losing battle), Live Update was working. Other things stopped working, like backup, and the program became unstable, with random characters scattered in it's dialog boxes.

Support did respond within 12 hours, but wants all kinds of information and screen shots before they will attempt to help.

In order for this type of software to function properly it has to be based on the most complete knowledge and understanding of how the computer, operating system, and software works.

He turns out to be a supervillain.Wesley reacts to his new powers by raping and murdering his way to the top of his supervillain game without a single hesitation. I think there may have a moment or two where he stopped and tried to generate some empathy, but I probably blinked and missed them. Fortunately, he's surrounded by a cast of equally vapid monsters, with nary a bit of depth between them.Wesley is a dweeb as a mundane human, but as a supervillain he's actually one of the most genuinely unlikeable characters in comic history. I imagine that I've missed the post-modern/ironic twist, but I wasn't going to go rooting through it in this pile of nihilistic fanboy trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"unoriginal and uninteresting","review":"This is yet another tale of the painfully average guy who is suddenly given the chance to realize his true destiny through super powers. The difference here is that the main character is to become a 'bad guy', with the potential to be the baddest of the bad guys. It sounds like a good set up for an interesting story, but it disappoints because the only thing the book has to offer is shock value. The main character goes from dead end loser to mass murderer & rapist. There was definite potential for black humor here, but the story never got that clever.

The set-up of how the office drone becomes the super-villan is far too perfunctory and it becomes entirely lost in the sub-plot of the war among the super-villans. I think that if the book is going to pull-off its about-face ending, the reader needs to be significantly more co-opted by Wesley Gibson's transformation, significantly more sympathetic to him despite his abject degredation. Instead of just dropping hints to the depths of perversity in this world, the story should have shown them off. As it is, Millar is in too much of a rush to shove it all back in the reader's face to set his trap sufficiently. Good idea - poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped & gratuitous!","review":"I am going to do my best to separate my views of this and the movie because I saw the movie first.

Being an adult however I got almost no enjoyment out of this book. While some of the characters were interesting, the entire main plot point and characters were all deplorably unwatchable and I now see why the movie changed it so much. The background elements involving an old war between heroes and villains and parallel earths was something I would have liked to read about. Sadly, I got people complaining they're bored of murdering and raping people. This was the definition of gratuitous and Mark Millar is better than this. The art by J.G.

Don't expect a similar story to the movie.I was excited to dig in to Wanted after glancing at some of the elaborate artwork, but was disappointed to find a lack of depth or anything actually interesting. When a book primarily aimed at exploring every carnal desire you could think of can actually be called boring, it's pretty clear that this is a book that misses the mark completely.

But I wasn't a fan of Wanted. It's the basic Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter story, only this time the main character is a supervillain. Interesting premise. But Millar's writing here too consciously influenced by Fight Club and Eminem. There were times when I downright hated this comic. The last page is a perfect example. Millar lays on the nihilism so thick that it doesn't take long to get tedious. The casual attitude towards rape is also disturbing.J.G. Jones is the book's saving grace. While it's annoyingly obvious that Halle Berry and Eminem are visual references for the 2 main characters, the rest of the cast are interesting takes on DC villains. The coloring is often a bit too muddy, though.For a much better take on supervillains check out Brian K.

Often laugh-out-loud funny.

There is a whole backstory that doesn't really get fleshed out that would be a lot of fun.Regardless, if you like more mature comics, you'll probably like this one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Much happier with the movie than the source material. I do not recommend this graphic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted (paperback)","review":"My son saw the movie preview, and thought the book would be something cool to have. I ordered it for him for Christmas and was very disappointed with it. It's contents are vulgar and discusting.I would not recommend this for an adult, let alone a teenager. However, I have had great customer service on my return of this book with Oxworth books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? People like it?","review":"That has to be what Millar had going through his mind as he wrote Wanted. It seems he was caught off-guard that people were really liking his mini-series and he didn't have an ending for it. I think he was hoping people would just stop buying it, like they did with his appropriately titled Unfunnies.The last two very late issues seem so rushed, so tacked on, that they completely ruin the story laid out for us in the previous four.Infinite potential wasted and turned into boring superhero deconstruction with a lot of F-Bombs.Lame"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like it.","review":"I won't join the legion of readers that have been expressing their moral disappointment towards this volume. The author is probably happy that he had generated such level of controversy and attention around his product. I did not get the ultimate message, I found the violence senseless and I did not enjoy the comic. This will also prevent me from watching the upcoming movie. However I am pretty sure that the movie producers have reworked the storyline and the carachters in order to please the general public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just sad","review":"I don't know how old Mr. Miller was when he wrote this thing, but if it was over 14, then the book goes from being laughable to just plain pathetic. The whole idea of a cubicle-working, spineless wimp finding a way to stand up in the world by way of flipping the bird and mindless gun-play is juvenile to say the least. I kept waiting for the book to show its hand as satire, but it held on to its disgruntled seventh-grader sincerity to the last page. The art was never a problem, other than the obvious dream-casting of known celebrities, but it's damn near unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Millar has nothing to say and can not write......","review":"Millar must either be sick or he hates everything in the world. This book is full of racist and bigoted jokes. It has nothing to say and it's audience are geeks who have no life, just like the writer has no life."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT wanted","review":"This piece of rubbish has a clever setup which goes nowhere interesting after Wesley turns into a super-villain (early in the book). The setup posits a world where murder, rape, etc. (on any scale) goes unpunished, and the notions of guilt or remorse never arise. This makes a mockery of the idea that this is an 'adult' story, or even 'edgy'.The artwork is good, there's plenty of violent action, blood, guts, profanity, and dark humour. A cheering adolescent may feel a bit conned however since there's almost no sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This was a waste of my time to read this thing. Its message was that life sucks, and its mode of communicating that was by showing a bunch of people getting raped and shot and dying and whatnot.I hated this piece of garbage and don't recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morally Repugnant","review":"The trade is introduced by Brian Vaughan, ironically he says \\"At their worst, superhero stories are just dopey male power fantasies, but at their best, these myths don't just entertain, they work as powerful allegories that help us understand who we are.\\" In my opinion \\"Wanted\\" falls firmly in the former category... or it would except 'dopey' implies a level of harmlessness that \\"Wanted\\" lacks.This is the story of a thoroughly unlikable loser who gets the sort of life he couldn't even dream about before by picking up a gun and killing everyone he dislikes or who got in his way. Plus some random by-standards just for the heck of it. It's a book about killing lots of people while looking cool and feeling no remorse. It's a glorification of the sort of thinking that leads to high school shootings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"This book was so weak. In reading other reviews I have heard others compare this to Watchmen. The only similarity is that they are both comics. This was such a juvenille read packaged as an adult book and why does the main character look like Eminem? I just didn't get what I was supposed to take away from this book. A lot of pointless violence and profanity, no catchy lines you can walk away with. I've lost a lot of respect in millar as a writer.

The white rapper who made it big in 1999. Yes, that guy! His likeness is that of the star of this book.GIVE ME A BREAK!The action was silly and fantastical beyond that which I find acceptable in graphic novels.

Although I don't use the eye dropper , just a dab with a q-tip. there's no rebound effect like when using sinus sprays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Crap","review":"Buying this book is a waste of good money. I enjoy reading fiction, I love authors like Eric Harry, Richard Herman, Coyle, and Larry Bond. But this guy is none of these. This book is terrible. If you want to read a riviting narrative of how a submarine goes up, down, left, or right, or how such a machine can travel at unheard of speeds under the water, then this is the book for you. I've never been so bored and disappointed by a story supposedly about WWIII in my life. Return to Oz is a more believable tale than this book presents. And the errors in sentence structure, doesn't this man know what an editor is? I mean, \\"He speaks\\" what the heck kind of dialoge is that? Is this a book or a screenplay? And the ending! The only good thing about the ending of this book is that it ENDED!!! The true disaster of this work is that it was actually published. Learn how to write and learn how to tell a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak plot...not overly plausible","review":"Understandably this is an action thriller only type of book and should not be expected to live to the works of Coyle or Clancy, but there is little to zero development of any of the characters. The plot is not one that anyone could take serious...how many Islamic carrier battlegroups were there??? Not to mention the relationship between the CO and XO leads towards an opinion that our Armed Forces are unprofessional.The cover alone should have said something for what I was about to read...a bad digital picture blown-up even worse from some website.Sorry people, I do not recommend this book,. It was a disappointment even for someone who is into books for action alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"No finished","review":"This was strange book. It was short but had some very exciting sequences.

Larry Bond & Patrick Larkin to name just 2 - LB started out as Tom Clancy's writing partner (just not on the cover) and then PL started out as LB's (unacknowledged on the cover) partner.He also needs to go back and re-visit both his area of expertise and the wider military community as well.Essentially it reads like the outlines I did of high school essays - a lot of points loosely coupled, awaiting the \\"fleshing out\\".As it stands, it is just a very large waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Freakin Book","review":"This book spent more time talking about the love affair between the captain and a female subordinate then actual combat. When it finally gets to the combat portion the events, weapons and tactics are absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not good","review":"There is just no way the countries in the middle east can develop the naval assets that are accounted for in this book. It is pretty much a slam-bam action novell, and if made into a film would deserve actors rated somewhere around the Wings Hauser - Steven Segal level. Don't think your going to get another Red Storm Rising here, more like watching FOX and playing battleship at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This book is not a great choice. Weak plot, includes a no-interest romance and basically just stop in the middle.Only if you have nothing else to read imho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap.","review":"Don't buy it.

I would have liked to see what happened to the protagonist after she left her small home village. The change of heart shown by the village leader at the end seemed a bit false to me.

There are decisions to make that would affect the rest of her life. It is a realistic story of people living under a communistic government.

Sure enough, when I looked at the author notes, I saw that Valliant has written for NG. Which is precisely the problem with the book. He has used the story of the Golden Spruce like a hook to hang a number of science articles on. As for madness and mayhem, the actual culprit becomes a ghost in the book, a sketched out caricature used as an excuse to give the reader a geology lesson.Valliant loves facts, and if this was a textbook it would be above average in readability, but it purports to be something more, and in that it fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grandfather Trees and All of Us","review":"This is, as the title says, a book about a tree.

The small black dragon; eldritch giant; and many others are key visual aids for any game that has such creatures, and inspiring enough to make me want to run a game with them!If you intend to run the Savage Tide Adventure Path when it comes out, the cloudreaver pirates and the tavern brawlers are going to be a big help."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it!","review":"this book is not a \\"luxury\\" or a table book. it is much more: is a book to read! it is very well descripted and organized.

After reading volumes 1-5 I can say yes definitely different than the anime. Some differences include: different characters, pairings and events. This is a series defiantly not for children there are several nudity scenes are well as sexual innuendos. If you like action or if you have seen the anime and want to understand more about Scryed I would recommend reading this. Overall I enjoyed the edgy graphic art (though some of the guys look like they have girly eyes), the characters and the odd humor.

If you plan to spend a lot of time in Croatia and or Slovenia, LP's individual country guides for these too countries offer far more depth and detail. For the other countries (Serbia and Montenegro, Macedonia, Bosnia and Albania) you're probably better off with the Bradt guides. (Or buy both.)

However, even with this TV I can see dirt, water spots, and scratches on every episode from the first season. I haven't watched the rest so I'm not sure of the quality for the remaining seasons, but I suspect it will be the same. You can clearly see dirt and water spots on the prints, especially on the faces of each character, due to the color used for their skin. I loved this show when I was a kid, and am disappointed in the poor quality of the prints that were used to create the DVDS.

When I used a paper towel to clean it, it was obvious that the plastic is shedding residue -- big time!I know that The Flintstones will attract a lot of grown-up collectors, but I've got to believe that small children will also love these cartoons and handle the orange box.

I guess you could wait for them to be on sale again or just take your chances with the complete set. Plus theres no new bonus material so the only thing your getting EXTRA is the UGLY ORANGE BOX.

They still play in our old dvd player, but its difficult to read the tiny print on the inner circle of the dvd. In addition to the cheap dvd sleeves, the decal on the front of the orange exterior box has started to curl up on the top and bottom. Its nothing more than a thick sticker.

I think it is great! It has that chunky rock-like Flintstone look to it, is sturdy, and protects the DVD's really well, as well as being water proof (though, not water tight). The only reason I gave this a 4 is because, as stated, the sleeves in the books are tight and it is hard to get the DVD's out without touching them (DVD's should always be handled by the edges), and they are not soft and will cause scratches.I really wanted just some Flintstones videos to watch as I hadn't seen any in so long and thought it would be nice. This was given to me as a gift and I love it! I've enjoyed re-watching these more than I ever thought I would. I get some humor that I didn't get as a kid, and the commentaries are interesting and enlightening. I view these now with a keener eye with a different perspective.

Thompson's writing and Ralph Steadman's art and was drawn to this accounting by Ralph of their relationship. Hunter, not unexpectedly, comes across as a highly creative individual who was difficult to live and work with and not a very sympathetic character. The book is a must-read for those who are interested in them and their relationship but the writing is not of the \\"can't put this book down\\" variety. I feel that it is a good examination of the nature of the creative process, including how Hunter and Ralph stimulated each other's best abilities. It also raises questions about the nature of friendship. Sometimes the people that we are tied to in life may be the result of circumstances rather than the people we would have chosen on our own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"Ralph isn't the greatest writer ever born, but I've always enjoyed his books.

Steadman is no slouch with the written word. His recounting of the Kentucky Derby episode had me LOL. When he does address the dark side of his departed friend, you feel as though there's no axe to grind, merely an attempt to set the record straight.If you've been drawn to HST's work over the years, then this effort by Steadman should take its rightful place on the bookshelf next to Thompson's works. Part memoir, part elegy, it gives another insight into the \\"bad craziness\\" that made Hunter S. Thompson tick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadlly the joke is over. Happily this book is brilliant!","review":"Steadman provides readers with a frank assessment of his times with Hunter S Thompson. The gods were kind to us mortals for throwing Hunter and Ralph together. The Gonzo books and articles, pairing Thompson's words and Steadman's illustrations, resulted in wholes much greater than the sum of the individual parts. This book is a very welcome, very well written and illustrated perspective on Gonzo - bruises and all. Thanks Ralph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intimate and revealing","review":"Thompson's life is difficult to seperate from his gonzo essa, and is often viewed as fiction. Steadman's retelling of their turbulent friendship clears away a great deal of the confusion about this brilliant and difficult icon; twenty-five years of alternating conflict and cameraderie allows a more human and focused view of an explosive and unique man. In the end Thompson's mythical persona is enhanced rather than diminished by the humanizing and honest eye of Ralph Steadman, illustrating the reality of trying to mainttain a friendship with the perverse and explosive Thompson. He does Thompson the honor of addressing him honestly; sugar coating his memory would be an unforgivable offense in the Doctor's own books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Read, Great Intro to Shadowrun","review":"I haven't read any previous Shadowrun novels so I am not biased by that. I have played the game some and read some of the sourcebooks. Born to Run starts off a whole new series with a new cast of characters. The writing is not difficult to read, and the action is fast paced. You get to know some of the shadowrunners in Seattle, and follow the career of a new runner named Kellan Colt. Because the story plays out from Kellan's perspective most of the time, you learn the world of shadowrunning along with her. I consider this book to be light reading, and it won't win any literary awards, but it was a really fun read and I enjoyed it immensely. I recommend it for anyone new to the world of Shadowrun or even to more seasoned Shadowrun fans who want to go back to their roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur reading material","review":"While following the life and times of an up and coming runner can be made into an interesting story, this book is not one of them.The book follows along an acceptable storyline, however it feels like it was written for teenagers, or perhaps pre-teens as it was overly simple to read and felt like someone's first novel...ever.

One of the tires was defective and didn't hold any air. The final straw was that it made too much noise when I tried to jog with it. The bike hitch hangs below and rattles the entire time.

I bought it for my two 15 lb Maltepoos and it is just the right size for them. I was impressed with the sturdiness of the material and also the netting. I was afraid that they would tear it when they jump up but i do not think it can tear. It does real well on turns and feels quite stable. Although it does not feel like you are lugging a lot of weight, i did notice i had to cycle in higher gears than normal, but I assumed that it would be like that. The color of blue, however, was not as depicted on the ads. I received a much darker blue but i am happy because it will not show dirt as much. I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found it!","review":"VERY COLORFUL MOVIE. If you liked speed racer cartoons as a kid, this is a great adult remake for you and your kids. It received poor reviews in the cinema, but there is no accounting for taste. I did not watch speed racer as a kid, nor did I go to the movie theater with my husband, son and his 18yo friends, but they loved it, as does my teenage daughter and her friends. So I bought 2, one for her to take to college and one for our home library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa, Speed Racer!","review":"A big mistake from the Wachowski Brothers. Fans of the Japanese animated series will scratch their heads over this garish big-screen disaster. In theory, most live-action cartoon adaptations represent a ludicrous waste of film. \\"Speed Racer\\" is no exception. The 135-minute running time becomes a cinematic endurance test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Without a doubt, this film is better on Blu-Ray. But nevertheless, this film was everything that was missing in modern action films, most importantly - the emphasis on family. People have complained about the bright colors and fast paced races... this isn't NASCAR, it's Speed Racer!Don't listen to the critics, none of whom compared it to the original cartoon (probably because they had no appreciation for it's significance in animation history). I personally rank this up with Citizen Kane and the Temptress as one of the greatest films ever made. In 10 years, I promise you elements of this film are going to make their way slowly into more and more movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Like I Remembered!!","review":"As a kid, Speed Racer was one of the cartoons that I raced home to see. I absolutely loved it.Is this the best movie I have ever seen? No. I doubt it will win any awards. I take that back. The effects and colors are great. Scary at first. The colors were so bright, they were overwhelming in IMAX. But once I got used to it, WOW.This movie was just plain fun. It was two hours of being a kid again. And the sound effects were exactly the same as they were in the cartoon. That made me laugh out loud.If you are looking for a fun movie to watch with your kids on a Saturday afternoon, this is it.I hope the studios keep making clean, fun, family movies. I'll buy them ever time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie!","review":"Only watched about 25 minutes and had to turn it off. I was a big Speed Racer fan growing up. Big dissapointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont get what you pay for","review":"I purchased the speed racer movie only to find out that the digital download had expired the day before. I could not reach anyone at warner brothers so I sent it back.Do not buy any Warner brother movies unless you find out when the downloads expire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why did they bother?","review":"Really, why bother to make a movie in the odd manner in which someone had the harebrained concept as to make this one? This movie had to have been produced almost entirely in front of a blue screen. There is practically nothing real. It is almost as if the joke is on the viewer who possibly expected to see an actual movie. It is that bad. An as for Susan Sarandon, John Goodman, and Christina Ricci, you can almost see the look on their faces that A. No one they know ever sees this dog, and B. The paycheck doesn't bounce. Frankly, if you like the old Speed Racer cartoon, then watch it, not this. The only reason I gave two stars is for the learning experience. I learned just how badly botched even a simple old cartoon like Speed Racer could turn out modernized in film length. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray = BAD RAY from Warner Bros.","review":"Warner Bros would like you to think you are getting a great DVD set of SPEED RACER, all you get is the movie on a 25GB disc with NO that is RIGHT NO HD Lossless Audio TRACK! All you get is standard DD 5.1 track... how old right esp for an eye and ear candy film. Even the recent release of the classic Eastwood films from WB's (the Gauntlet, Every Which Way But) Loose Got LOSSLESS HD audio!The second disc is a digital copy of the film which I feel digital copies are a waste myself. I could care less.The Third disc is a sort of game based on the film and you can imagine how bad and useless this will be!SO in short you are paying a lot for actually not even a Special Edition and you get not so great audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with Mac or iPods","review":"I love this movie, think it's the most unappreciated film of last year and one of my favorites. The Blu-ray is excellent, this is a film that's made for High-Def. This is a reference disk you show HD newbs, who'll take one look and say \\"I get it now. The picture and audio are stunning.\\" The colors really pop on my Sony Bravia, the audio is amazing, good extra features. This 3 disk version gets 1 star because the Digital Copy isn't compatible with Macs or iPods. It's the first Blu-ray that I've encountered that does this and I specifically purchased this 3 Disc version for the Digital Copy. I travel a lot and like having that ability to watch on the plane and in my hotel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality Blu-ray","review":"I absolutely LOVED Speed Racer when I saw it in the movie theater, though many of my friends didn't know what the fuss was about. I couldn't wait to get it into my blu-ray player when it was released. But unfortunately, Warner isn't giving this movie the proper treatment. They are using compressed video and not lossless audio (BD-25 instead of BD-50, etc.) This should have been a reference disc for Blu-ray, but they are going cheap because it didn't fare that well among the other summer blockbusters. What a shame! The BEST thing about this movie is the audio/visual aspects of it, and they're not going to do it justice. May as well get the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the critics stated...","review":"This was simply a fun filled car racing kind of movie. The critics were most likely looking for a MATRIX home run. No way to make a family movie MATRIX-fied. I really enjoyed this movie, my 11 year old daughter enjoyed the movie too. A couple of cuss words that for a PG family movie that weren't really necessary. That kind of bothered me a little bit. Rent it. Buy it. At least check it out. Worth the viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"I'm gonna give it 4 stars just because it's pretty close to what I expected to see and this is just the kind of movie that they made. So for what it is, a very cartoony story and images, it's right on the spot. My 12 year old son was barely interested, but he opted out of watching it to go play video games instead. My 2 year old son was semi-interested. My daughter and wife wouldn't even watch it. I thought it was alright. I like the picture and sound and it's a good movie to just have on in the background when only the 2-year old is home and he's fiddling around with toys in the room. That's about it, I can't really slam it because it's pretty close to what I expected to see, and also what I'm sure they intended to make."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun with one unnecessary scene","review":"My family, especially my 5 year old, really enjoyed the movie. It's a lot of fun. However, it is short of five stars for a family movie due to one scene that is violent for no real purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Visual Thanksgivings.","review":"It does more for me than look good. I felt the characters, story, and plot devices surprisingly good. But in no way am I exaggerating when I say that the look of this film is masterful and Stills made of moments of this film belong in a Museum of Modern Art. The Flashbacks are fast and sometimes delirious to the moments at hand. The beginning of this movie is stuffed with a lifetime of explanations submerged into a race so handily won by Speed Racer, that indeed no one else can be seen except the ghost of the world record holder in clear doubt of its own reign. There would be little more to the qualifier, yes, besides the chance to rip the record if not for the flashbacks, but the continuum of them all together is confusing to say the least. I enjoyed this movie for all the reasons a good movie deserves to be appreciated. The acting is not superb, but it sure isn't deficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a summer blockbuster...period","review":"I have no idea why \\"Speed Racer\\" was lambasted by critics when it was what it was: a popcorn summer blockbuster when the travesty that was \\"Transformers\\" got a pass and is getting a sequel. The car racing and the machines were great, I though the plotline was accessible and the actors did a decent job making cartoon characters \\"believable\\". What I did find somewhat irritating was the Spritle/ Chim-chim antics which to me became dangerously close to being the \\"Jar-Jar Binks\\" of the film. But all in all I left the theater feeling I watched a summer no-thinker movie that made me feel good for the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm amazed HOW AMAZING THIS MOVIE IS.","review":"I didn't see this when it was released, but I can say I wish I had. It was the most fun and really a well acted movie of this type that I'ld seen in quite a while. It will some day be considered a classic, cult or otherwise. Had the directors realized how great of a job the actors would do, they might have cut back on the excess CGI. Still that's not enough to keep this from rating 5 stars. Speed was outstanding. His little brother and the monkey couldn't have been more on target, and were responsible for some great laughs ( thank you it was needed ). The drama with Racer X was touching. Mom and Pops were of course more involved than ever, and Tixie was a bit, well, out there. I find myself wishing it had made enough for another adventure but this is a enjoyable experience and highly recommended movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated eye-popping flick! BUT Digital Copy doesn't work with iPods.","review":"This film was practically made for Blu-Ray. Eye popping visuals -- the likes you've never seen before! On the down side -- yes, it does run a bit long. And of course, the story is throw-away. Considering the source material, were you expecting Tolkien?Just a couple important notes: The \\"Digital Copy\\" disc is NOT compatible with iPods. It's only runs on Windows and is only compatible with Window Media devices -- which is a real disappointment. Also while this is a \\"three-disc set\\", only the main feature is Blu-Ray. The other two discs are DVDs (one for a DVD \\"game\\", the other for the digital copy). Lastly, the features are pretty light. I hope WB considers a extra-packed re-release. I'd gladly pay for a double dip on this flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your hard earned cash","review":"What a disappointment. Like Alice in wonderland meets Mario Andretti. Bad acting,flashing lights and colors. I'm sorry I spent that much and geeting so little in return. Both young and old in our home agreed."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Too bad...I really didn't appreciate the language in this movie. I wasn't expecting it, so it came as a bit of a shock.What did the movie in the rest of the way (besides the totaly unnecessary piranha routine) was the worse than lame scenes with the littlest brother. This movie had some good elements, but was ruined by...what do I even call it? Watching the boy and monkey spin out of real world into...a pathetic anime attempt? Is that what it was? I don't know. But it totally disrupted the movie's flow and subtracted in general from its likeability... For me, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 2-hour arcade game","review":"I disagree that this is a great film OR a technical feast for anyone except CGI fans. This reviewer is not one of those.Of course movies aren't real, but some realism is expected unless it's a completely animated film. CGI effects look like a GAME rather than quality filmmaking, and that's what \\"Speed Racer\\" really is....a classic tv show repackaged as a two-hour game.The frail storyline just isn't enough to hold interest for the duration of this film, especially for fans of the original. The talents of the fine cast, including John Goodman and Susan Sarandon, are completely wasted.Don't recommend this to anyone but CGI fans and very young kids. Let's hope another director gets it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Style, No Substance","review":"First off, this movie looks amazing on Blu-ray. But everything else about it is a mess. The story is slow and uninteresting, the acting passable. All style and no substance on what could have been a great movie experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible, horrible movie!","review":"This is a shockingly, stunningly, obscenely bad movie. The story and script were apparently written by mushroom eating manatees. The acting was stilted and it was clear that every one of the cast regretted having signed on for this abomination. The visuals are impressive....assuming you're a big fan of Candyland. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie like the plague. Every movie Uwe Boll ever directed looks like Oscar material compared to this astonishing exercise in putridness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Style Over Substance, But That's Okay","review":"There is not much to the plot. And just by picking up the case, you will know whether or not you want to watch it. The Wachowskis do not measure up in terms of value or story in this one, but most people expect that walking in. But the dazzling colors that drench every scene in the most beautiful way will keep your eyes wide open for each frame. Personally, I would recommend the Blu-Ray version. It is a perfect goofy action movie, for kids and those who know how to act like kids.

I received my copy of Speed Racer DVD only to find the disc scratched (yes, it was still on the spindle). So I ordered and recieved a replacement, and it was scratched in exactly the same manner. Perhaps a manufacturing defect?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie. When Are They Going To Make \\"Clutch Cargo\\"?","review":"This one was marketed as a summer blockbuster. It's no better or worse than typical summer fare. It's certainly better than those cynical \\"Transformers\\" movies. Why did it fail to gain an audience on initial release? I can surmise that its audience were probably forty-somethings like myself who didn't go to the movies as much. Flaws in the movie are overlength(2 hours, 15 minutes) and possible preachiness. The movie espouses an anti-corporate bias. Strange because it was distributed by Warner Communications. The Wachowski Brothers don't just deliver the message they bludgeon it. Regardless, if you can overlook the preachiness \\"Speed Racer\\" is a lot of fun. The effects are jaw-dropping and they don't overwhelm the story or performances which are generally good. It's not often that you can call a movie that was probably budgeted over $100,000,000 as a sleeper but this one is worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speed Racer GO","review":"As a child I admit to always hating the original 70's anime. No one two characters were more annoying to me than that boy and his monkey. I refused to watch the live movie adaptation for the longest (3 years?) until recently. To my surprise it was a breath of fresh air.For all its silliness and gross abundance of CGI it is a good film for the entire family to sit through with a little bit of everything for everyone. More so I found the setting of a petrol-free world where the highest stakes are vested on racing machines more believable than the outrageous thuggery of the Fast & Furious franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, Good quality, bad exras","review":"I loved the movie, The video and sound quality of the Blu-Ray is top notch but the extras are very poor. The interactive game is pointless and the short documentaries (Completely Washovski free) not necessary.Anyway a great disk to buy if you want to show your friends your brand new HD TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe the Hype - Fanstastically fun movie","review":"This movie was everything that was enjoyable about watching an old-school Anime in live action.

I realize it's not for everyone, but I thought it was amazing to watch! The colors pop up like 50's faux-modern plastic, the acting is just a stilted as the original cartoon, and the plotline is appropriately silly. I absolutely was enthralled watching it all whiz by like Skittles for the eyes! But here's the thing - I don't think I ever need to see it again. And I also think that if I saw it on a normal screen or on TV, it would lose most of it's punch. So 4-stars for seeing it once in IMAX, but 2-stars for replay."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for the movie, 1 star removed for the packaging ...","review":"This is a marvellous movie. The level of imagination, work and style is breathtaking and as a jaded 44 year old I deeply loved it.However: where's the HD audio, where's the serious extras (if any movie deserves a production analysis documentary then this one does - there IS one on the disc but it's flimsy) and WHY IS MY BOX BROKEN?!The last question is a real bone of contention. Some multi disc Blu-Ray releases are packaged in a standard sized box with a moving section inside to accommodate the extra discs. I've got three of these boxes (Firefly, Speed Racer, When we left the Planet) and two have been broken on arrival. The plastic used is totally inadequate for the hinge mechanism required to move the disc flap and also it will not accept super-glue. It's astonishingly poor quality design and materials and I can guarantee I'm not the only person with broken boxes. Please stop using this design you manufacturing types!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kids love it!!","review":"we saw this at the theater, but they were still excited to get it on dvd. there's plenty of action and cool cars, along with a little plot twist. this movie looks like it will be hit with these guys for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a true fan","review":"Despite being an avid online shopper, I've never reviewed anything online before. I felt compelled to do it now because of the mediocre critical reviews this movie received. To someone who never saw the cartoon series I'm sure this movie was disjointed, confusing, and drawn out. To an adult who sat in front of the TV screen at the age of eight with a homemade cardboard steering wheel, following Speed's every adventure, this movie was sheer heaven. It exceeded every expectation - action, good vs. evil, twists and turns (and spins, flips and crashes) - it never let me down. The subtle nuances gleaned out of the series (the poses, fight scenes, facial expressions, etc.) proved this movie was crafted by people who knew and enjoyed the TV series. My sons are only 5 and 3 - I'll wait a couple of years - but I can't wait until they're old enough to experience it. A sincere 'thank you' to the people who brought one of my favorite childhood memories to life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speed Racer To The Extreme","review":"Thought this was Anima until I watched it and found it to be live action acting, I liked it. Thought it to be a great reproduction of tha cartoon version brought to life. You have to toss out the realistic NASCAR going in circles racing and take it to the extreme. The acting was good and the special effects were excelent. The Blu-Ray DVD also has extra making of content that I liked and found very interesting. I found by talking to others that children also enjoyed it alot and were fond of the chimp.- As a fan of the cartoon version of Speed Racer, I would recommend seeing this on Blu-Ray. It was funny, colorful and full of action with a great storyline. But, if you want to hear the old original Speed Racer song make sure you watch all the credits at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually blinding and kinda stupid","review":"Throughout the whole film the bright, flashy colors made me fear that I would have a seizure or something! The film is kinda slow at first and there is a lot of unnecesary dialogue. Kids will probably leave during those long sequences of talking and hopefully come back during the rare moments of action.

The science fiction aspect of it was neither smart nor believeable. The characters were flat and uninteresting. The love affair was practically non-existant. (After 270 pages they FINALLY come together, in a boring love-scene that is less than a page and a half long.) It makes me wonder if someone else is writing some of these more recent books, with the publishing house using Jayne's name to sell them. If so, they are ruining her good name!!

The ending left so many details unanswered; the set up for the sequel was very obvious. As a reader, who generally purchases all my books, I am quite frustrated by this tactic and not very inclined to buy the next effort.

I have enjoyed many of Jayne Anne Krentz's novels especially the futuristic ones written as Jayne Castle (Crystal Frame, Shield's Lady, etc..) but this one is just awful!!! Poor (tripe) writing, terrible plot (did I say plot was there one???), tried one-dimensional herorine, weak hero,etc... I could go on and on but you get the point. Don't get me wrong, Jayne Ann Krentz is still one of my favorite authors, but this last one is pretty bad. Maybe she should concentrate more on quality instead of quantity. I will continue to read her (she hasn't burnt me out yet) with the hope that the next futuristic is significantly better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTING....","review":"is all I have to say about After Dark. I have read all of Ms. Krentz's novels with great enthusiasm and am rarely disappointed. Unfortunately, After Dark broke that streak. The plot was confusing, the dialogue forced and the ending cliched. After reading Amaryllis and Orchid and some of Ms. Krentz's earlier science fiction, (Sweet Starfire is one of my favorite novels)I couldn't wait to read After Dark. I found myself struggling to finish the book, hoping each chapter would improve. Sadly, I had no such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"I'm a big Jayne Castle fan and thought this would be some sort of continuation or pre-quel to her last sci-fi trilogy. Set in a similar environment, a world created after settlers came through the \\"Curtain,\\" I never did figure out how, of if, this book works in relation to her others. While her characters do possess psyhic powers, the powers are different, and not nearly as interesting. The book was rather lackluster and the chemistry between the hero and heroine never clicked for me. It was a quick, and forgettable, read. Although still a big fan, I'd say this book would make me pause before picking up my next Jayne Castle novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Uninteresting and Not Worth the Price","review":"I have read all of the Jayne Castle books and really enjoyed them; however, this one is sorry. There is no spark between Lydia, para-archeologist and Emmett London, businessman, formerly ghost hunter. They're just blah.The plot, if you can call it that, does not hold your interest. In fact, the further you read the more you'll decide \\"Who cares\\". This is not one of Jayne Castle's best efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"A true disappointment from one of my favorite all time authors. Lets talk chemistry. Their is none between the two main characters lydia and Emmett. The storyline never takes off. I can say that this is the first Jayne Ann Krentz book that I was able to put down. This book lacks all the elements that made Orchid, Amaryliss and Zinnia fanatastic reading which was characters that came alive, chemistry that was so hot you couldnt put down the book for a minuted so you could absorb every delicious detail. After Dark, not a favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not complete","review":"I have read all in the series for Harmony. I found this one lacking in several areas. The characters were not well developed. The overuse of the word \\"rez\\" made me want to white out all references to it. The ending was too abrupt, with no background information on the secret client. The love scenes are, in my opinion, what makes Jayne Castle's books enjoyable. This one falls short. This does not mean that I will stop purchasing her books. On the contrary, I have always enjoyed her style of writing and will continue to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter Disapointment","review":"I have loved all of Jayne Castle's fururistic romances until this one. It was so poorly written I checked to be sure it really was her book. All the things I loved about Harmony in the other three books, are missing from this one and I felt cheated. Part of the enjoyment, for me, was thinking about how things like cof-tea really would have tasted. I realize that remembering and thinking all these things out make it a lot harder to write the book but this most recent effort seemed like it was just thrown together. Those of us who read all your books feel like we know this world you have made, their special talents, moral background, culture. A lot of time was spent designing and explaining this in other books. I am fascinated when you introduce new talents so this book shouldn't have been any different but it was. I felt cheated. Please Jayne go back to your old format, I need your laughter in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"If you're a Jayne Ann Krentz fan like me you might really be looking forward to \\"After Dark\\", but I was really let down. It was very hard to care about the main characters in this story. I kept reading hoping it would get better but it didn't. I've read Krentz's other books writting as Jayne Castle and relly enjoyed them, so my advice is to read one of her Jayne Castle books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this series.","review":"I usually love all of Jayne Castle's work, and Amanda Quick's, too, but I was seriously disappointed in this new series. The entire premise just seemed to convoluted and contrived. I generally like science fiction as well as supernatural romances, but these characters seemed not to be that well thought out. I felt that the whole world with its resonances, crystals, etc. just needed more work. Creating an entire culture from scratch has to be difficult, but she needs to take this one back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another would-be fantasy that's not, really","review":"This is another love fluke set in a sci-fi enviroment for the sake of thrill. It would've been better, maybe, if it would've kept to the normal decor...Humans colonized an alien leftover planet, then were cut off from earth. They managed to survive and develop a sixth sense.Most of them are ghost-hunters or \\"tanglers\\", able to spring psychic traps left in the alien ruins.Lydia Smith is a tangler who has to find an ancient heirloom of Emmet London's. She's ready for a love affair and he's the right guy , in the right place. Love affair unfolds. Some things happen. Emmet is searching for a missing nephew. Lydia stumbles upon him. Then everything ends happily.Stupid book, stupid plot.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love her harmony books!","review":"Was lucky I read After Dark and After Glow at the same time, so I had the whole tale there. I presume there will be another AFTER book, since she does trilogies these days. And I will be eager for it.This is Jayne Anne at her best. She is so fresh and has such power in her writing, much like her writing of about 10 years ago.The characters are so strong and funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was looking forward to this book and it was a struggle to complete it. It was quite confusing in the beginning with the murder and the search for his nephew etc. The bad guys was a stretch and it ended with them making a date, give me a break. Quite a disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"unfortunately this is her worst book ever. Although I have enjoyed almost all of her other books tremendously and she is by far my favorite romance novel, this book is not well put together and leaves the reader lost with many lose ends that are not explained properly. a big disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"After Dark","review":"Let me start by stating that I am a BIG fan of Jayne Ann Krentz and was anxious to read her latest. I was very disappointed. It is not that I am oppossed to futuristic books, have you read JD Robb(Nora Roberts) Death series? I found the plot very difficult to follow, especially if it was not read in one sitting. Each time I came back to it I needed to do a quick review. Too much \\"rez this and rez that\\". Also, I found the interaction of Lydia and Emmett to be very cold . No chemistry here. All in all, a big yawn. Sorry JAK, this one didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"After Dark","review":"A real disappointment. The only thing going for it was it wasn't the same story again ( like Amaryllis, Orchid, and Zinnia were the same story with new characters). The beginning was slow, slow and hard to follow. It picked up as it progressed, but never was particularly interesting, and the ending left you somewhere near the beginning - ie nowhere. She still had the same job, she never got paid, and the romance had no commitment. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't _want_ to like this...but..","review":"I was at the bottom of my pile of library books...I'd checked out After Dark by Jayne Castle mostly because there wasn't a whole lot else that fit my current addiction to urban/modern fantasy. Despite myself, I really enjoyed this book. Okay, I always take issue with authors who describe women as totally turned on merely by looking at a male body (maybe because that hasn't happened to me, laff), but otherwise, the concepts were extremely cool, the characters were likeable and believeable, and the entire story was satisfying. So, if you enjoy the Rachel Caine Weather Warden books, some of the Simon R. Green series, the Kelley Armstrong books, and so on, you will very likely enjoy the two Jayne Castle's in this series... After Dark and After Glow. - Rue, the Meddling Spinster"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jayne Castle contiunes her Curtain series....","review":"Jayne Castle (aka Jayne Ann Krentz, Amanda Quick etc) continues her \\"Curtain\\" series with a new world. The major characters still have hightened psychic senses and these senses play a main part in the story. The action is good and the romanace, of course, is great. The \\"hook\\" in this new world is discovering the archaelogical remains of previous inhabitents' and trying to get around the psychic \\"traps\\" and \\"ghosts\\" they left behind. This looks like it is going to me the first in a new series, with the same two main characters, differing from \\"Amaryllis\\", \\"Zinnia\\", and \\"Orchid\\", which had the somewhat overlapping storylines but had different main characters. I am looking forward to the next installment"},{"rating":"2","title":"My faith is redeemed","review":"I recently picked up After Dark and was completely surprised. I had been losing faith in JAK because the books were becoming repetitive. With this book and Eclipse Bay I see great books in the future. When I first read it I thought someone else must have written it because it was so different from what she had been putting out recently. I am pleased and excited to learn more. The only thing I didn't like was the even pacing that had defned the book being rushed at the end. the ending was just a little too pat for me. Otherwise it was an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of emotion","review":"I enjoyed the premise, but the characters were wooden and predictable. It was about a man who just kept making passes at a woman who continuously fended him off, until in the end she reciprocated. There was no emotion, or heat, or seduction. There did seem like there would have been opportunity for that, but it just never materialized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exposing the Da Vanci Code","review":"A great book exploring many seekers' questions relating to the Bible that the Da Vinci Code raises. A nonbeliever may believe that the Da Vinci Code has revealed some sort of \\"secret truths,\\" but that's simply not true. For more on this, read this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Buried Treasure you'll want to own","review":"I always mention this film when the topic of great old movies comes up. There aren't many made like this anymore, a fascinating blend of drama, comedy and romance...you're dragged into the lowest point of John Savage's character's life abruptly, and follow his rebuilding process from there - you'll feel like you know the people he meets along the way (the cast of veteran supporting actors at the bar will put big smiles on your face). You develop a real interest in Rory and his friends (a wonderful performance from a very young David Morse) without ever knowing the reason that brought them together in the first place - until Rory and Jerry have words towards the end of the story. And you might even reconsider how you view your own best friends. Well worth seeking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Sleepers Ever","review":"Why isn't this tremendous little known gem of a movie on DVD yet? Get with it so all can enjoy.

Then it vanished and never was heard of for many years. Recently I was telling some friends about it and we searched high and low in video stores and libraries, but no luck. Then I started searching the Great Amazon and alas it was there. I ordered it and not only was the product in good condition but the service was rapid and excellent.

It is the coolest, saddest, sweetest and memorable movie ever. Another review called it \\"a classic no one knows about\\"- wish I'd said that...I certainly couldn't have said it better. After all this time, I find myself trying to find the video, replaying the dialogue in my head...you know, the \\"jeeerrry, rrrrorrrry, stuff...and all I can say is, in everyone, there is sometimes the feeling of being the outsider, wanting to learn the inside moves...the movie is better than 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic that no one knows about","review":"I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out, and i uusally dont buy vhs since i have laserdiscs and dvds, but i had to buy this one (and paris texas) the movie is so moving and touching and its about life, the scene that always gets me is when john savage is in the gym and talks to david morse and morse being a cripple, this movie will uplift anyone and give people a feeling that life isnt bad after all"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY","review":"I can hardly wait until 3 Feb....release date for this movie.When we got our first VHS player in 1982, we rented this movie.

So now that we can record even DVDs, \\"Inside Moves\\" is never on TV.No one that I know has ever seen this movie and I always tell them they missed out seeing a great one.It is really worth the time and money.

The story goes...Darwin when out on the Voyage of the Beagle and found all earthly creatures.... The second voyage, The Voyage of the Bassett was to find all of the mythical and fantasy creatures (ie: fairies, trolls, mermaids, winged horses, etc.) I found this book at a children's book sale and was a bit skeptical since I liked the original so much. But...I was hooked after reading the first chapter. The adventures were wonderful and the imagery was beautiful. I highly recommend this book to kids and adults.

The magnificent vocals and beautiful strings, interwoven with the innocent beauty of the children's poetic vocals, is moving beyond words..The Oratorio Terezin is a journey of the heart, in music and poetry, of hope in the darkest of times, and of the power of the deepest of loves in the face of hate.. The spark of the divine and the love of a God who is love and still loves tenderly and forever, in the face of deepest human suffering and sorrow, makes the Oratorio Terezin a masterpiece of art, of poetry, and of Love. The Oratorio addresses (in the beauty of music and poetry) the issues that many of us are afraid to face.. It is like a ray of hope in the darkest night. The violin, the strings, and the orchestra are superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"the truth finally comes out","review":"I lived the al dunlap saga first hand. Breakfasts, luncheons, and diners with the man as well as frequent barbs and threats. I was as close to the story as any outsider could be. But I must confess; John Byrne's account of the Sunbean story was told better and more accurately than either I or any insider could tell it. Byrne is a pro's pro. I would probably read anything he wrote since I would know that it was written with honesty, integrity and passion. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the mind of deception and the evil of greed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chainsaw Al - A predator or scavenger?","review":"I thought I would leisurely read this new book from John Byrne. I resumed eating, sleeping and working after one day finishing \\"Chainsaw\\". I know from experience, this stuff is real. Dunlap and others like him have no relationship to real turnaround managers. He is simply a break-up artist. Rather than his favorite metaphor of a predatory animal ( lion, wolf, etc...) Al Dunlap is really a scavenger - a hyena or vulture, he had no clue as to how to revive an organization, so he might as well just pick on the bones.Once again, it is not so much how you organize people, but how you treat them, that matters. Providing a cause and a vision to achieve something worthwhile is a more powerful incentive for managers than any scavenged loot from artificially and temporarily raising the stock price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Business Morality Play Page Turner","review":"This is one of those books I find myself reading almost obsesessively, dispite knowing how it ends. A tremendous amount of material from a wide variety of inside sources gives a \\"fly on the wall\\" perspective to numerous events. The writing is very readable and makes dry finance issues fairly clear.The book answers a great deal of the who and what, but not so much the how and why? What really drives this ego-maniac? Little insight is really shed on Dunlap the person, other than he is a greedy, mean SOB. Any additional insight there would further flesh out and already meaty read."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, but prefer wireless","review":"After I acqquired this, I switched to the wireless glasses....thus the 4-star rating.

The synopsis given on the box is intentionally inaccurate, and the cover is blatantly false advertising.This movie tries to be a trippy Tarantino-esque flick, and fails miserably.

He is in about 25% of the movie and they show the two main characters BEHIND him on the cover. That is just dishonest, so they do not deserve to be rewarded for trying to deceive us, the customer. I got to see it for free and I overpaid. They didn't even have someone in charge of continuity, there is one scene where a main character is standing up giving a speech and his suit coat keeps going between buttoned and unbuttoned, depending on the camera angle, pretty amateurish.

It's twisted and dark, like Fripp-Wetton-Bruford Crim, but also bizarre and cartoonish like _Lizard_. The instrumental palette gives everything you would expect from metal, with plenty of Frippian angularities, and classical guitar, saxophones, B3 organs, and pianos. The music is dark and gothic sounding, tending to be mid-tempo and heavy, with a range of evil raspy vocals and sung tenor passages. Its uniqueness cannot be denied, and its dark side is probably not enough to offend those who dislike harsh vocals. Dark, weird, and original! Can't ask for much more. Hihgly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"like this album alot","review":"A very unique and a much more mature and progressive effort as compared to their earlier albums like NEONISM.

I was reminded of the Rolling Stones song \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" which is a classic but I digress.It is a story of rags-to-riches told in somewhat candid manner. However, the author doesn't give a glimpse of his past and his psychology other than urging the reader to Jump In (there you go again). His life as a commando as well as his past in England are not told so the story lacks the foundation and thus robs the reader the opportunity to truly discover how Mark's brilliant mind functions.The book is peppered with motivational phrases and if you want to get 'pumped up' (this could be the title of Mark's sequel) then just read the sidebars of the book. It is a forgettable book, overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Jumped In and LOVED it!","review":"This is a fantastic book and a very easy read about a great guy who works hard and deserves all the accolades he gets.

I got it primarily because of the expected insider accounts of \\"Survivor\\". Burnett didn't have anything to say about \\"insider\\" information regarding the first show and very little to say about any of the others. I learned more inside information about the survivors from a three-page interview with Jeff Probst I read recently.Burnett does lather on self-laudatory remarks, and sucks up so obviously to Donald Trump and Martha Stewart it makes one think his lips are shaped like a vacuum cleaner.If you want information about set decorating and negotiating the best deals for shows, this is the book for you. If you want what is promised in the write-up on the book jacket, jump away from this trite little money-maker that showcases an ego that knows few bounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"He can write too???","review":"Even the most skeptical critics can have a field day with a title like JUMP IN!, but Burnett surprisingly stands his ground with his storytelling translating naturally to print. After reading JUMP, Mark Burnett deserves to live this charmed life and has raised the bar of genuine merit for who in Hollywood is the most worthy of success. The man's got it all, done it all and if adventures define a man, then Burnett is a dictionary of character.Throw in Trump, Stallone and Martha Stewart, well yeah, I'd write a book too."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A great 'Rags to Riches' story\\"","review":"I'm a big fan of anything inspiring. Mark Burnett is the father of reality TV. He is a man of vision, and unafraid to take \\"calculated risks\\"--something a lot of people would like to do, but are either afraid of failure, or procrastinate \\"jumping in\\". Though I didn't read his first book, I did scan through it briefly. This book is much more in depth. I do agree with other reviewers; the book does lack detail concerning his earlier life, and some of his failures (1st marriage eg.). All in all, this is a great book, written by someone who has accomplished a great deal in his life. Personally, I am bored to tears with 'Reality TV', but it has played a big part in television entertainment the last decade. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants more from life, and is willing to make the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets tiring","review":"While few can argue Mark's rise to fame and fortune is anything but spectacular, but to believe that virtually every decision he's made in his life has turned out fantastically well is a bit hard to swallow. At every turn (which happens to be accompanied by the phrase...\\"I jumped in...\\") is another remarkable success.If he showed a bit more vulnerability in his stories, it would have been more believable, insightful and inspirational.I also could have done without excruciating detail of every season of survivor...it got a bit old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Budding TV Producers Take Note!","review":"Mark Burnett's ride to fame and fortune has been one of the more unlikely but spectacular success stories in television. As a tv producer myself, I must say that the book has important insights for anyone who wants to venture into television. While there are many biographies out there about TV personalities, what makes Mark Burnett's book worth reading and getting is simply (a) that he is current, (b) he has defined a new chapter in tv filmmaking, and (c) is still riding the wave.I read the previous edition of Mark's book and I enjoyed it. This revised edition includes several more insights into how he's steered his media empire after Survivor and ends with a chapter on Martha Stewart - which was a flop in the ratings, but nonetheless reflects Burnett's business acumen.This book will inspire and inform you - Survivor fans may want more dish behind the show, but those who want to understand how the show came about from the creator will appreciate this readable account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Boys Book Series","review":"I have read four or five books in this series of \\"Augustus\\" books in the 1960's.AT that time: I, as a 10 yr. old boy LOVED this series of books.The title I remember the most: \\"Augustus Hits The Road\\".SO, If, I, can now, at age 54, REMEMBER reading the 'Augustus' Series of Books\\"...well, it says to me, THEY were Great books and stories meant for a boy of age 8-12 to read.

I found the 12.5x eyepiece very dark and difficult to use. The x-y controls works ok while moving slides left to right but does not work well when moving the slide back and forth. Also this microscope doesn't come with a 4x objective which comes in handy when trying to locate your specimum on your slide. The microscope is ok but you can buy a much better microscope for a little more money. I looked around the internet and found a microscope for only 33% more than the Meade 9460 and it has 4 objectives, higher power (1600x), much better x-y controls, binocular eyepieces, variable light control, and the objectives are much much clearer than the Meade. For the money the Meade microscope is not a good value when compared to other microscopes out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best relaxation CD I own!","review":"I use this CD every night to help me drift off into a more peaceful, restful sleep.

The clocks rattled when shaken lightly.Within three weeks one of the hands fell off the second clock.While the alarm that I used for three weeks worked fine and seemed to have a good alarm and snooze system, it didn't keep time very well -- that hand was just waiting for its chance to drop off, I think.I really have nothing positive to say about these clocks.

He assumes that none of his readers will think to go back to the originals to see if he is being honest (and he's probably right about that). Those of us who have studied the texts, however, know that this man is a disgrace to his profession, a person who violates every rule of scholarly integrity, and who simply, unambiguously, and shamelessly tells lies.

I found this book frustrating because the author focuses on his infatuation with pretty girls (he's married and his son is his first mate), the daily trivia of mooring, cooking, and drinking, and how proud he is of his son and the trimaran he built. The prose is poorly edited and hard to parse, mostly due to Heutink's inconsistent nautical jargon, tendency to omit salient details, and failure to include maps with the names of places he visits.

But just a few weeks old is way, way too soon to start forcefully shoehorning a baby into the parents' idea of what makes a good baby.I agree that strategies can be employed to help space out feedings, encourage babies to eat more in the daytime (so they need less at night), etc. But I just cannot agree with the underlying mindset that Baby Needs To Be Brought In Line. Hello, it's a baby, it's not a disobedient or untrained pet.Sure, it would be fantastic if my nine-week-old son would sleep through the night, but I'm not going to ignore the fact that he is a sensitive, confused little human who needs to know he is loved at ALL times, even at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense, not worth an entire book","review":"The book can be summed up in a few sentences...each day extend the space between feedings and pretty soon you will have enough hours so that the baby sleeps through the night.

As soon as I had him stretch out the time between feedings during the day, he started waking up 4-5 times at night. He is now six weeks old and 13 lbs and we are trying to get him back to the way he was before. It seems that this book made things worse. I think it had to do with the fact that my son eats about 30 oz per day and will not eat more than 6 oz at a time when feeding are four hours apart.

The following is a true story:A young mother recently employed this book's method with her then 6-week-old, formula-fed daughter. By the time the baby girl was 2 months old, she was sleeping 8 pm to 5 am, and the mother was ecstatic. However, right after she turned 4 months old, the otherwise completely healthy BABY DIED OF SIDS. Needless to say, the mother is now devastated.No high-level study can ever (ethically) be done to determine if sleep training is truly associated with SIDS. But maybe little babies sleep lightly and wake up frequently for a reason - in order to AVOID dying when they stop breathing for periods of time, which are not uncommon during the first several months.\\"Training\\" your baby to awaken less and sleep longer before he or she is physiologically ready may allow you to get more sleep, but at what cost?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Me Sick","review":"Sleep training is such a disgusting idea. I bought a book about it and never needed it because I had enough sense to allow my baby to lead the way and I always follow his cues. He sleeps GREAT at night... no ignorance needed. If you choose to have a baby you better expect some sleepless nights. Trying to \\"train\\" your baby for your own selfish convenience is NOT a good idea. I hate that these authors try to make a buck by essentially telling you to let your child go hungry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still working on it....","review":"Our little one is 10 weeks old and we are still working on getting her schedule down.

It breaks down to giving your baby 4 feedings a day and night weaning. The main problem I had with the book is that it says to make sure your baby drinks 6 oz every 4 hours. I'm breastfeeding. I stretched my baby's feedings to every four hours and started to try an eliminate night feedings. The big problem came when my supply started dwindling because of this. There was no way to know how much my baby was drinking, and obviously not enough to keep my supply up with only four feedings a day. I went back to feeing on demand, and still working on night eliminating night feedings. My four month old now wakes only once at night. I'm okay with this. The book really isn't for someone who is breastfeeding. I'm sure if you are formula feeding the book works like a charm. Formula fed babies sleep through the night earlier than breastfed babies do... oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really work for us","review":"This book was a very quick read and had some good ideas (so I thought). So, I started to use some of the ideas and my daughter's sleeping habits got worse and worse. The day I finally went back to feeding every 3 hours, she slept through the night the very next night.

No. Do I think its arguments are supported well? No. Do I think that it is worthy to be purchased? Certainly. The reason why this text should be purchased is because it is a cornerstone in the radical feminist debate raging over pornography. MacKinnon is bull-headed in this text (unlike she is in _Feminism Unmodified_ where she actually admits that women can and do enjoy sex... at times), but she is blatantly bull-headed. This text should be purchased if only to refute it, but it is worthy to be shelved on any bookcase that holds any texts of feminist theory. Does this book suck? Yes. Does it deserve one star? Certainly, but its impact grants it another star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written, lousy conclusions, is she really a lawyer?","review":"My definition of radical feminism is Camille Paglia or Susie Bright. They challenge and destroy perceptions of gender. This book is a poorly written rant against heterosexual sex written by someone who believes that tenure means never having to say you're sorry, or checking your facts or talking to real people.The best revelation in this book - porn leads to masturbating. Shocking!Read Rene Denfeld if you want to read a clearthinking feminist with a decent writing style (you'll be hurting for a decent writing style after this thing.) If you are inclined to agree with MacKinnon then read Dworkin. At least Dworkin has some great sex talk in her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even funny!","review":"I think that it is down right wroung for someone to say that in free speech it is moraly right to say one thing and wroung to say another.

In today's world which is so full of worries, God is Good points out the wonderful things in nature and in people that were God's original design.

His chapter on Madison as the father of the Constitution is wonderful, and his phrase \\"The Madisonian Moment\\" is a clever turn on JGA Pockock's famous book.However, there are a few flaws. First off, as others have noted, Rakove is not an especially good writer. He sometimes takes a page to say what could have been said in just a few simpler words. Second, his conclusions about \\"original meanings\\" are not entirely persuasive. He has a point insofar as he argues that finding the original meaning of the Constitution is a difficult quest, because the Constitution was a document produced by compromises. However, it does not follow from this that any meaning can be imputed to the Constitution. There are some interpretations which are simply inconsistent with any reasonable reading of the time and the Philadelphia convention.Nonetheless, a worthwhile book, deserving of its Pulitzer, and a must-read for scholars of the Constitution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the casual history buff","review":"Reading this book is not an easy undertaking. This is not an overview of the formation and acceptance of the Constitution, rather it is an in depth analysis of the goals and purposes behind its creation and those of its creators. A great effort was put into the writing of this book and my rating is based on my ability to absorb the information. It reads like a text book trying to appeal to a wider audience. In my case it did not achieve this goal. For a historian with the background to follow all the references I imagine it would be indispensible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book but not for everyone","review":"This is an excellent book if you really want to understand the Constitution in extreme detail.

Assuming that I had received a bad copy I went to a Barns and Noble store, purchased a second copy, and sent it to her.Upon inspecting the second copy, prior to sending it, I quickly discovered what the problem was. The font size in this book is very tiny; so small I have to struggle to see it and I have intraocular lens implants and read a couple of books a week.

Just like a portrait, it shows the princess at her best. This is not an expose and I'm glad it wasn't. The most poignant sections of the book are the parts dealing with Diana's tragic death. There are copies of Elton John's handwritten lyrics for \\"Good-bye England's Rose\\" as well as many of Diana's own letters. I received this as a gift, right after seeing the Diana exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in Fort Lauderdale. Many aspects of the exhibits are included in the \\"Portrait\\" and I think will be enjoyed by any fan of Diana's. It is a very flattering portrayal, as it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Portrait","review":"Finally a book that doesn't attempt to portray the Princess as some sort of demon.

Not being one for media blitz I have not paid attention to many books of this sort (and there certainly are many of them). However, seeing that this is a compendium of a significant human being's life in pictures and interviews, accolades, and heartfelt memories makes one feel the mighty impact this beautiful woman had on the lives of those she touched. The photography ranges from snapshots to formal portraiture and focuses more on the person behind all the blitz than on the royal facade.Rosalind Coward is to be commended for compiling all of these photographs that literally cover the entire life of the Princess of Wales. But even more so, she is to be lauded for presenting a book that is not mawkish but encourages the Princess' many fans to carry on the work dear to her heart.

This one was even worse. Brother then tried to fix the second machine (same model) but failed. It seems that the interior rollers that pull the pages through to be faxed have to be adjusted so accurately, so as to pull the paper through straight. The faxed sheet (that is received at the other end) is twisted and longer than the origional. This is unacceptable when faxing die drawings and other related small drawings.

Torg blending the settings well, Cityscape, however, does it poorly.I'm not sure \\"old school\\" is a good way to describe the art. Repetitive might be better. You'll see the same pictures over andover agin. They'll be cropped, shrunk, enlarged, or mirrorer, but still the same.The races are unbalanced. There are no ECLs given for the race, even though some should have a very low ECL, and others a much higher one.Do yourself a favor and stay away.

Since I am somewhat mechanically knowledgeable I decided to purchase my own scanner for a Ford OBD I system and see what I could come up with. The Equus 3145 Ford Digital Code Reader made it very easy to track down the problem and get the truck running correctly without having to go through the costly process of replacing part after part until the problem was found, like the two previous shops had wanted for me to do.

Holy Warriors, however, is not one of them. To keep this short, I will just say that much of the film consists of slow-motion scenes of Richard, Saladin, or battles, while the voice over narrator gravely and dramatically intones his explanations of what we are seeing. Even the scholary comments by the academics don't seem to be able to contribute much to the story line. This documentary is a disappointing and rather superficial treatment of a great historical story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good production values but unfortunately bias account","review":"I have watched almost all of PBS's excellant empires series of documentaries. I have not been disappointed, until now.This is such a romanticised account of Richard the Lionheart. The writers were at great pains to paint a picture of a noble and selfless Richard. Filled with so much laughable spin, it excuses him of his cowardice (e.g. his retreat from attacking Jerusalem not once but twice) and his excesses (e.g. the slaughter of the 3000 arab prisioners).Saladin was painted as a ruthless man who did everything to obtain and retain power. The compassion he showed towards the Christian civillians after capturing Jerusalem was viewed with skepticism and negative spin.When an organisation like PBS start producing such an unbashedly bias and jaundiced documentary, it only shows the effect 9/11 has had on society. One can only hope that in the near future, fairer heads will once again prevail in PBS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not High Quality Scholarship","review":"This program is a far cry from the usually high quality scholarship you'd expect from PBS, I didn't even like the actors they cast for saladin and king richard, don't waste your time watching or buying this program other critics on this site have given references to other material on the subject which i plan to look into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious anti-Christian bias","review":"This fanciful tale was barely historical. The muslim scholars they used were obviously going to portray islam and Saladin in the best possible light. The screenwriters relished showing Richard driving a sword in somebody, and twisting it, but not the same of Saladin. They portrayed the muslims as thoughtful, prayerful, and caring, but the Christians as vicious. A total reversal of the attributes of each religion. Simple basics: Mohammed - kill the infidel, Christ - love your enemies.The production value was good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't walk the walk...","review":"What did it in for me in regards to this album, was Amy Grant's personal life testimony. That pretty much made this album really shallow. It lacked the backing of the kind of life that should be behind christian albums.It's \\"ok\\" that she got divorced and remarried, if that's what she chose to do. Personally, I was crushed when I heard. But if you're going to live your life that way, please don't continue to preach and minister through christian songs. The stage that she's on is one that needs personal integrity and earned respect. But unfortunately, she doesn't realize that. I'm not really sure what made her think that she could pick up right where she left off.Life choices carry consequences. Everyone deserves mercy, just as God shows us mercy. But ministry carries a requirement for personal integrity and responsibility. You can't live your life however you want and still maintain your ministry of Godly song. And that's what makes this album so shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Amy. Grant. Album. EVER!","review":"Good Lord. I had high hopes for this album, but Ms. Grant let me down. Probably a result of TMVGS (Too Much Vince Gill Syndrome). Don't buy this one unless you are a die-hard Amy Grant completist. Otherwise, avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"I have been an Amy Grant fan since 1977. This work is not one of my favorites. There is nothing to distinguish this collection of hymns from the literally hundreds of similar recordings by other artists. Amy has a distinctive and pleasant voice when she's in her element; sadly she's out of her element here. This recording has Vince Gill's fingerprints all over it and, although he is extremely talented, I don't care for his style of music; it just doesn't mesh with Amy's style. I am hopefully awaiting her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"This is the worst album Amy has ever done. Worse than House of Love. Worse than Behind the Eyes. Ugh. The songs are lifeless, without conviction, without reverence. Unexcusable for hymns. Instead of shifting around from bluegrass to Chris Isaak-style to who knows what, the album should have been done totally in Amy's trademark acoustic style. The album simply never gains a footing, never gets on track. A poor showing for her first studio album in what, five years? I'm just not sure what to think about her music anymore. I'd get rid of this album except I want a complete Amy collection. I will take it out of my 100-disc changer though, and let it collect dust on the shelf where it belongs. Now I'm going to go listen to Fernando Ortega's \\"Hymns and Meditations\\" to cleanse this CD from my system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Hymns, Cloying Piety","review":"Grant is an interesting performer who might have effectively introduced these wonderful old hymns to a new audience. Instead, her selections are excessively arranged, and her piety is cloying. Please, give us entertainment without the sermons, which are now less convincing than ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did NOTHING for my spiritual side","review":"Not only was this album way below expectation - I felt as though this now old lady was trying to recapture her former glory. it was just .... bad. Very diappointing. I was expecting the old Grant. No real voice behind the music, which by the way is not quite sure just what it wants to be...am I a pop song? a gospel song? a country western song? El Shaddei was my most awaited. It was also my most disappointed listen.Don't waste your money buy it on the clearnace rack in a month or two.The whole CD just struggles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and contrived","review":"This is not an Amy Grant album, it is a Vince Gill album. As others have said, this style is not Amy's, it is his. Further, I don't hear the \\"passion and faith\\" that others do. This album sounds contrived, and she sounds, well, bored.I think it is clear she did this to try and regain footing in the good graces of the CCM community...something I don't understand. She's gone Pop, and after feeling no obligation to be a role model for fans and show any repentance for her poor choices, I don't see why she would try to stay in CCM. Even if she wants to do \\"inspirational\\" pop, why go for a totally foreign style? She should stick to the pop sound, which she is so good at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Ministry?","review":"I couldn't agree more with the review titled \\"You're Missing the Point\\". Ms Grant has a decent voice but this is supposed to be a Christian album and there is no ministry in it whatsoever. 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice work","review":"Amy Grant has an extensive history in the Christian Music business. Most of that history is pretty good, and this CD is no exception. This particular effor is quite well put together and has a very unique flavor to it, probably resulting from the artistic input from her husband Vince Gill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heartfelt, moving album to inspire your faith journey","review":"This album features Amy at her best. I have been an admirer of Amy's music for many years. This album reminds me what drew me towards her music in the beginning...the heart-filled lyrics, the meaningful voice. With each listen I find myself encouraged and inspired to make it a lifelong goal to remain positive and true in my faith journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legacy Hymns and Faith","review":"I could not hear the words of the music. I was disppointed because I do like to listen to Amy grant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing Scheme","review":"Growing up I was a HUGE Amy fan....and stuck with her through all her changes, ups and downs but as for this album I have to give it a big thumbs down. The music itself is very country/bluegrass style. Amy talks about in the album liner notes how this is such a heart felt project for her and yet in listening to the songs I hear no such emotion or heart. It is just Amy going through the motions. All songs seem rushed and sound recorded with little effort or concern. I don't hear or feel the amazing messages that these songs hold.If you ask me and I hate to say it but I must...I believe this album is all part of a big marketing scheme. Get Amy's old Christian audience to accept her again with \\"Legacy\\" and the recently released \\"Her Greatest Inspirational Songs\\" album in hopes that in September when her new \\"pop\\" album hits the shelves it will be a success and she will have mended fences with all her fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer who sees this album as a marketing ploy; it is definitely a \\"test the waters\\" attempt. She lost much of her CCM audience years ago and the country audience isn't interested, yet this album seems to be trying to reach both. The news that her pop album is being delayed (again) until 2003 doesn't surprise me. Why is Amy still trying to sell records?"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMY GRANT'S SOOTHING VOICE","review":"I ENJOY LISTENING TO THIS CD WHEN I NEED PEACE AND COMFORT.

I AM SURE YOU WILL ENJOY THE TRANQUIL AND PEACE WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE MESSAGE AND VOICE OF AMY GRANT.I AM GOING THROUGH SOME MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND THIS CD IS REALLY HELPING ME TO CLEAR MY THOUGHTS AND RELAX."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this one","review":"I was thrilled when I first heard about this album. However, my excitement quickly faded during my first listen to this album. This project had great promise. In the past Amy was second to none at turning songs into classics. The biggest problem with this album is that it sounds DEAD. Amy used to sing with such conviction, passion, and sincerity. I didn't feel those qualities on this album.I think I would of also enjoyed this album more if she didn't incorporate so much country music into it. Several of Amy's previous songs had a touch of country in it (such as \\"Tennessee Christmas\\")and it worked for those songs, however I feel as if she went into blue grass/country overdrive here.I really wanted to like this one.On a side note..... Things did get much better on her second album of hymns \\"Rock of Ages\\", where she appears to have come back to life and move and inspire me with her songs once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like Vince Gill music","review":"I went into the store to buy an Amy Grant CD and I came out with a Vince Gill sounding CD. While it is nice to see an artist expand their horizons, this is too much twang for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy's back on track.","review":"I've never been that much of a fan of Amy Grant's pop music. She's always at her best when she returns to her gospel roots, which is what makes THIS album a standout - and well named, as the song selections reflect the rich legacy of church music in America. It is also, I believe, a reflective and intensely personal album, and a reminder that life is hard and sometimes messy, but also that faith heals.The songs are mostly traditional hymns, tastefully updated, and accented by Vince Gill's understated but well played guitar. My personal favorite on the CD is the medley of \\"It is Well with My Soul\\" and a Vince Gill original, \\"The River's Gonna Keep on Rolling\\".This CD won't be a standard at dance parties; on the other hand, it's one that you'll listen to over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"It's clear this forum is just like Amy's newsgroup -- if you dare to differ from the prevailing opinion, you are castigated and dismissed as irrelevant and mean.It just blows me away though, how people can give this project a 5-star rating. It must be because they are either diehard Amy fans or that they didn't grow up in church singing the old hymns. Truth is that Amy can't sing hymns, several of the ones on this album are butchered beyond recognition. I think she should stick with the light pop tunes that she had on HIM and HOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Luck Next Time","review":"OK, I've got to give Amy a \\"B\\" for effort, but otherwise this CD is a mixed bag. I do like \\"This Is My Father's World\\" (except for Vince's harmonizing) but not much else. On \\"My Jesus I Love Thee\\", the tempo is too fast and Amy seems to be gasping for breath at times. Probably my least favorite track is \\"Softly and Tenderly\\". Many of the reviews praise this song and its so-called \\"haunting drums\\" but I felt the drums were very awkward. Instead of the moving altar-call song it is meant to be, it sounded more like something you would hear in a desert biker bar at 3am.I really didn't like the places where Vince Gill sang harmony. Amy and Vince really don't harmonize too well. To be fair, something about Amy's voice makes it hard for anyone to sing along. I don't care for Vince's influence on Amy's music either. I'm glad that they are happy together but I hope that their future studio collaborations will be limited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great.","review":"I was overjoyed to find a new CD with classic hymns instead of contemporary fluff! Especially a CD with \\"Softly and Tenderly\\" -- my favorite hymn of all time. I like Amy Grant's voice for the most part, so I bought the CD. Bad move. Her voice doesn't suit the music at all, and vice versa. When the music starts out simple and upbeat, Amy's voice is low and drawn out. And speaking of \\"Softly and Tenderly\\", the version of it on this CD was almost enough to make me cry, and not for good reasons. Skip it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAOOO!!!!","review":"Quite an impressive work in just 29 days. I really enjoyed the CD. At first i thought it was rather slow but after listening over again i just fell in love with it. I really enjoyed \\"i can only imagine\\", this is my father's world,nothing but the blood of Jesus,what you already own and infact everything. It is surprising to hear \\"christains\\" refer to past shortcomings of amy without a tint or willingness to forgive. It baffles me that we all love to crucify others but justify ourselves. We have all made nasty mistakes in the past but GODis faithful and just to forgive. Lets all forgive amy for any past mistakes and lets prayerfully support her. This is how we know those who are Gods children, if we love ourselves and not habour resentment. God would bring beauty for ashes.

Would not recommend a product from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"never worked right","review":"I bought this unit after someone was raving about how wonderful it was on a message board. I have never been happy with it.First I tried using it to loosen up wallpaper for removal. The vapor wasn't hot enough to melt the glue nor moist enough to soften the paper.Tried it on tile grout..sure it cleans..if you scrub hard with the wire brush (which was trashed after using once cleaning grout)....but I can use a scrub brush and hot water for free.I felt the vapor coming from the unit was not nearly as hot as the description stated.Being unsatisfied, I called the company, I could pay shipping and repair charges if I wanted them to look at it. No thanks..they have enough of my money.So did I just get stuck with a defective unit? How can the other reviewers be so happy with theirs? The company needs to stand behind their product and be sure all units shipped are in proper working order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heretics show the 'other' truth of Jesus","review":"If history is written by the victors, then it makes sense that the losers would have a different - though equally valid - viewpoint. \\"Heretics\\" provides just this view of the man we call Jesus. After 2000 years you wouldn't think there was much new that could be said on the subject - Gerd Ludemann has proved this wrong! Like the equally contentious, yet inspiring, \\"The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing years\\" by Richard G. Patton, this book does sound true! It does make sense that there would be this power struggle as each of the different 'Christian' Church's wanted their definition of Jesus to be the 'official' version. This book will make you question, but ultimately reaffirm your belief in the Man from Nazareth.

I unplugged my old Altec's 3 way (621) and put this on hoping for better results. All I can say is that Altec has done much better. In fact, I LOVE my old Altec 3 way. So, I am placing the old ones back on and hope it doesn't blow out. The older Altec system is perfectly balanced between the boom and treble. These are just out right unbalanced. I look forward to Altec recreating the unbelieveable sound that comes out of the much cheaper 621 model (which unfortunately has been discontinued for I guess 2 years)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top sound quality","review":"These babies replaced my Full deck 2 column, 3 way pioneer set. Supposedly computer speakers, they do far better.But one thing is very important - if you just plug them in, and listen to them straight away, you may be mistaken that sound has a canned feeling or low quality. You need to adjust the equalizer in your set or playback software to get stunning sound quality. its because these babies dont have equalizers on themselves. Once i set winamp's equalizers to what style i like, i forgot about any other audio set i had.These speakers ARE quality sound. Just put some Bach, Vivaldi on them and get stunned. Modern pieces, pop, rock, they sound also great on this.Buy it without hesitation. You wont regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altec Lansing's customer service is pathetic","review":"I purchased a set of these speakers after carefull consideration for my girlfriend. The controller for the volume both remote and hard wired lasted all of one day before failing. I promptly contacted Altec Lansing and they promised to send me replacement parts. After waiting for over two weeks I called them, only to find out they had not bothered to ship the part out. The agent told me he would try to ship it out overnight, which didn't happen. It is apparent that this is a company that has no consideration for their customers, so if this sounds like a good company to deal with then I encourage you to buy their faulty product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"It might be due to the size of the room and the limited spaces I have to place the subwoofer, but no matter where I put it the bass was very much overpowering. When I finally was able to position it so that the booming/vibrations weren't too distracting, just the volume of the low notes themselves was far too loud (even with the bass turned all the way down). If being used for certain movies or gaming purposes, the bass might be desirable. I was planning to use it primarily for music through an mp3 player, and the bass overpowered the vocals a LOT, pretty much defeating the purpose. I returned it, and am trying a different system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, Toxic Smell","review":"I bought these speakers after repeated rave reviews from a musician friend of mine. When I plugged them in they did sound amazing. However, I immediately noticed a strong chemical smell coming from them. At first, I dismissed it as normal \\"new product smell,\\" but it did not go away. As I used them, I found that if I sat at my computer listening to music for an extened period of time it got so bad I would feel a burning sensation in my throat. I called Altec Lansing and they immediately replaced the product, hoping the problem was with just that unit. Unfortunately it was not. In fact, the new speaker were even worse because they had not had a chance to off-gas yet.I really do like the sound of these speakers, but unless you like breathing toxic chemicals you should not buy these. My 1-star rating is not for sound quality, but for usability."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Buffer did't work","review":"I purchase two sets of speakers and one of the sets was defective the buffer did not work.

If you need it LOUD and dirty, it is Ok, if you need it PRECISE it is not it exactly. For $200 you can get pro studio monitors.

After having read all of the available reviews, I chose this model because it matched Apple's latest aethetics and was loved by so many. The setup was stupid-simple and the sound was surprisingly good! I listen to a relatively wide range of music (electronic to jazz) and these speakers are able to produce great fidelity and a booming bass if needed. Do not underestimate the ability to calibrate the bass and treble separately. It makes all the difference in the listening experience. For computer speakers in the $300.00 range, these are the speakers to get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud, Good Bass, Easy Setup","review":"These speakers are awesome. Setup took 10 minutes and is as easy as hooking the speakers to the sub, the controller to the sub, and a cable from the sub to my computer's audio out. The speakers are very loud, outperforming my DVD 5 speaker setup at 3/5 power. The bass is very, very good but does lack a little bit of firmness and can sound only slightly mushy at high volume. They are also aesthetically pleasing, matching my Powerbook very well. Overall, this was a great purchase. Not sure how it compares to other systems but I have no regrets about spending $220+ on this setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice","review":"I just got these for a sound system at work: if im going to spend my life here why just use the crappy dell speakers? I like these a lot- good response throughout the range with strong bass from the sub (which can thankfully be dialed way down when needed). Could have a stronger mid, but they are not intended to be studio monitors, so it has easily surpassed my expectations. I listen to rock, drum and bass, jazz and house on them.I actually purchased the Soundsticks II but they arrived DOA. Very happy with these as a replacement. Soundsticks are a little fancy for their own good with the design. I didnt even like the design in person, the perrywinkle styrofoam bases were way ugly.Con- why make the base of the desk speaker 6\\" long when 3\\" would keep it upright, especially if you made it a bit wider? Heavy Sub. Neither significant issues for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible Bulk","review":"The case is well designed, but there is no way to use it with the executive belt clip case that comes with the phone. Thus, I have absolutely no use for the item, reducing it to nothing more than an overpriced piece of plastic.

There has been many occasions that I have programmed the address into the Tom Tom Go and it has brought me to the wrong location stating \\"you have reached your destination,\\" instead I am in the middle of a park, or even once, in front of a cemetery (which is everyones destination, but not mine that day). When you call customer service, most of the time you will end up with an answering machine, instead of a live person (the live person has always been pleasant, but difficult to reach and it is not a toll free number).

That is what I did not want. Also, the print on some screens is so small as to be unreadable and direct sunlight totally blanks the screen. I don't know where the reviewers who said the screen was great in sunlight live, but it really cannot be seen in Texas sunlight.I sent mine back at my expense.

This film takes you to Operation Market Garden (the attempted capture of Arhnem) and then abrupty ends. Such compelling events as the Bulge, Operation Bagration, and the defence of Berlin are not covered. Not a bad documentary, for example, the OOB comparisons of the Army of 1940 and 1944 were very interesting, but overall, it could have been so much more.

The movie explains both sides very well with a number of interviews from both sides. The movie does not push either side one the viewer which is very hard to do. The movie gave very accurate information about both theories and did not make one theory seem less than the other. The movie also interviewed many students faced with the decision between the two theories. It showed several interviews of people who attend Wheaton College and are struggling to make the decision. The film also showed students from Jefferson High school that believed that Creationism should be taught along side Evolutionism. The film did not change my mind in what I believe, but it did enlighten me to other ideas and why other people believe those ideas. I would recommend this movie to be shown in the classroom.

Vanessa is not always the most likable of characters, but she is more real than most, despite the unreal situation. Her acceptance of the changes in her life is slow to come but interesting to track.

Jack Byrnes (De Niro) once again doesn't trust his son in-law Greg Focker (Ben Stiller), this time he thinks Greg is cheating on his wife Pam (Teri Polo). While Greg once again tries to prove himself to Jack, but fails miserably. Greg also has to compete with Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson) for the love of Pam....once again.On top of all the old material all over again you have the film trying to get laughs with puke scenes, farting, fingers in butts, needles to penises and Greg cutting his finger with blood squirting all over his family. If a writer has to use any of the above to try and get laughs, it's clear that they are a desperate for laughs. I chuckled like 4 or 5 times and the film is at least a little touching in the end. But still, Little Fockers needs to be the last Focking movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of the 3 meet the parents collection","review":"movie is very slow not very funny at all and looks ike this movie was put together very sloppy hope there done with this movie. i would the 3rd movie is the worst by far and the 2nd one was'nt that good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Word to Live by","review":"I was thumbing through various inspirational books and stumbled upon God's Way for Fathers.

I would recommend it for anyone searching for feel good, inspiring tales about the joys and challenges faced by fathers today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I found that in order to get decent results, you have to cook at least 4 cups of rice. Since it's just my husband and myself, we find that we have to use the warm function frequently. If you keep it on the warm setting for an extended period of time, the rice gets too dry. We've also tried turning it off and them hitting the warm setting right prior to eating and found it to be spotty.We've only have the cooker for less than a year and the seal is no longer functioning properly. The rice doesn't get cooked completely. I've had other cookers that have lasted us for over a decade, so I'm extremely disappointed with this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"Based on the great reviews for this rice cooker, I bought it. The first four times the rice came out perfect and I was elated! No more starch sputtering all over my stove, no clean up, no mess, and perfect rice! At least for the first four times. The fifth and sixth time of use produced what resembled paste. I had used exactly the same quantity of rice, water, using the same type of rice (white basmati) yet the cooker didn't regulate itself and I was left with paste. Such a disappointment as I'm back to the sputtering, clean up and mess, and the rice cooker has since been tossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love this rice cooker! It replaced one I had for many years,and was sure I would never find another I liked as well. I was wrong. This rice cooker is absolutely the best. It has replaced the broken one hands down. The rice is perfect every time whether you make 2 servings or serve a crowd, it keeps it warm without ruining it and it is so easy to clean and store. I would recommend this one to anyone that really likes rice and prepares it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Rice Cooker!","review":"I wanted a new rice cooker because I've had a string of cookers that either broke down, or began to burn or undercook rice. I saw these great reviews and thought I'd make the investment (which is a big one considering I'm a college student). At any rate, it makes rice perfectly, and you can mix and match grains as well. The texture is just great! This is a bargain at around 50$.

It needs to be replaced after being used for one year since the bottom of the non-stick pan is in a really bad condition. Not a good quality product. I have used other rice cookers before and this one has the shortest life span as far as the non-stick coating is concerned.There is also a bug in the delayed timer. If you set it to 1 hour, it is acturally about 15 minutes. The subsequent hours are fine. For example, the cooking begins after 2 hours and 15 minutes if you set it to 3 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do you expect?","review":"Ask yourself what you want of this book. If its an entertaining, reasonably suspenseful timekiller you seek, then this is a great choice. It's an old book experiencing a (slight) renaissance due to the release of the Michael Douglas movie. I would rather pick my own eyes out with a grapefruit spoon than see that movie but the book is the source and introduces a flawed psychiatrist and his small family and then subjects them to psychotics of every stripe. As a parent, I feel compelled to warn adults with children in the house that the novel preys on basic child-kidnapping fears. But you already know that, don't you? The ending is a bit pat and the improbable seems to trump the likely at every turn. Even so, it's a nice little romp, sort of thriller lite. It is particularly effective in its compression of time and its varied perspectives.

Then comes the kidnapping and emotional diarrhea bursts forth. Sorry. But it does. Now come the gasps, the repetitions, the \\"...\\"s, the frenzy of desperation and, for no particular reason, a cop who endlessly emits smelly farts. That joke grows old really quick.At times this story came across as a video game or psychopathic ramblings.

The writing style is awful -ex. \\"the partner agrees on this, that, and the other stuff\\" (pg. 140). The English usage is suspect at best, leaving the reader with impression that a number of writers had their hands on this one, and that many had English as a second language.

If you are among the few lovers of music who are open-minded enough to not merely try but enjoy serious modern music, you will do well to listen to this man's work.

With an uncanny foreshadowing, Mr. Woosley stunned me with a riveting tale that gave me goosebumps coming on the heels of the attacks.

It was especially disappointing as the subject matter is so topical, and it should have been fascinating. Unfortunately, the writing style is so stilted and shallow that I found myself not caring what happened - just let me get to the end.

This book describes the history of China as approved by the party. I would not recommend it to anyone who is not already familiar with China as the line between history and propaganda is impossible to discern. Further, the historical holes are huge. For instance, the book does not contain a single sentence about what happened in Taiwan after World War II, or about Tibet or Xinjiang. On the other hand, for anyone looking for insights into the thinking of the Communist Party, and some background to put in context the often incomprehensible official Chinese pronouncements about current world events, this is an interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived chipped!","review":"I ordered 4 burner covers and upon receipt found two of them to be chipped.

It was only about 70% effective (some of that was due to program incompatibility), but it's biggest sin was the effect it had on the Windows Firewall. Now that could be a Windows problem (no surprise there) but forums talking about this particular issue that disables the firewall showed that many of us had one thing in common, we used PC Mover to migrate.And when I went to fix my old XP system, I used it again to create a \\"moving van\\" which was saved on a removable drive. It was incredibly slow and even restoring it back onto a fresh XP disc volume resulted in bunches of problems with apps.Sure, if you want to transfer data only, no problem.

Some particularly important software, such as my printer drivers, would not work, and would not re-install, even after a full uninstall/clean/re-install cycle. It failed every time with an obscure error in some DLL file. Since it mentioned VC80 libraries, I tried to install the Microsoft VC compiler straight from Microsoft- which wouldn't install either.

The problem was that I was moving from the 32 to a 64 and iTunes got corrupted in the transfer. I couldn't uninstall, reinstall - or do anything - and I need it for my phone. After 3 hours of phone time with tech support (for iTunes, not the software), we all admitted defeat and I had to restore the new computer to factory settings, start completely over, and make the move manually. I'm not saying this was the software's fault, it may have been a function of moving from 32 bit to 64 bit but I will never again use software to move programs. Files yes, programs no.

When you install it, you burn the serial number and it's all over. So, if you are a computer tech, like me, this is not a reusable tool. Oh, you can certainly BUY another license. But that's absurd in my book. This is like buying a word processor that you can only make one document with. Or a hammer you can only build one project with. Laplink, pull your greedy heads out of your @$$!So, I never used the software. I immediately repackaged it and got an RMA to send it back. You have been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money","review":"Bought the product to move all my stuff from a XP computer to a new Vista one. After fooling around for some time I was getting an error message telling me that my operating system was not compatable. I contacted Laplink and they indeed do know that ther software will not work on a Vista computer, so unless you are transfering to an older XP system this software is useless. The line on the box says \\"The Easiest Way to Move into a Windows XP or Vista PC!\\" That is a lie!!! And of course since I have opened and installed the software it is no longer returnable. So let the waste of my $65.00 keep you from wasting yours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry that One Star is as Low as they will let me go.","review":"I loaded PC Mover on my old computer and was actually able to move a program. The next time I tried to use the program it asked to check for updates. After the updates it asked for my serial number. I have never had a program ask for a serial number after an update. I had to call the company and get my serial number. After being told that PC Mover was DESIGNED to be used once, they gave me my serial number which did not work. I just wasted two hours! I never read that the program was designed to be used one time. This is an expensive program. You might want to try a different company. Anybody want some one time software and one time cables?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute disaster","review":"The \\"transfer\\" first stalled halfway through. The second time, it finished -- but nothing worked. Not a single app functioned. Then, when I told it to \\"undo\\" its mess, it left 90% of it behind. Also, settings on my old computer were changed. Buy something else. This thing doesn't do what it promised to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Not As Advertised\\"","review":"I cannot recommend buying this product. It claims to only move what you select, however it appears to move the registry in entirety and moves programs not selected. Half of the programs moved do not work. Some have required much work to reinstall, including registry editing. It cost $75 to pay Sun to get Java to work on the new computer due to errors caused by PC Mover.I moved my documents files via home network, and used PC Mover to move programs. If a person has the possibility to connect old and new computer to same network, I believe better results would be obtained by moving files manually and reinstalling programs rather than use this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"I received this software and ethernet cable bundled with a laptop, so I did not set out to buy it. I followed the (sparse) instructions, and after calling tech support (nowhere did the instructions say to disable antivirus software) the software said it was \\"loading the moving van\\" and it would take 17 hours.The software simply stopped after 10 hours. Not a single file was transferred."},{"rating":"1","title":"An obsolete program","review":"I can't imagine that anyone would buy this program today except to move from an old computer to a new Windows 7 computer--but this program won't do that, unless you buy a special cable in addition to the inadequate cable included in the box. I learned that the hard way, after struggling with PCMover for a day. The manufacturer and amazon.com should not be selling this product as \\"new,\\" but as an obsolete antique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half pcmover","review":"I bought this product to move a pc with quikbooks and word products and i was not happy. It only moved over the documents not the programs like it lead me to believe.I then had to spend more time and money getting everything removed and then install all the products.Finally I then moved the documents over!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away from the software!","review":"MY worst PC move EVER. I thought it would save time to use this product. I got nothing but headaches. It was faster to use an external harddrive to move my data and to reinstall my programs one by one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laplink","review":"This sotware product is pretty poorly designed. You don't get a lot of options on what you can move. Most importantly, it didn't move all of my documents. Some are flat out missing. Very bizarre. The user interface and installation are not poorly organized.Moving settings from one system to another is always a dicey proposition, but I thought this would be a simple way to move documents, favorites, e-mail PST files, etc. It wasn't. I'm now manually moving things. Save your money and just buy an external hard drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of works but crashed 2 different sytems.","review":"I work on computers and have been a head of a department supporting 50 computers. I decided to try this product for moving stuff over to a clients computer. The first had the desktop constantly restart. No one could use the computer. The next computer would not even start after using the program.I had to format the new hard drives and reinstall the software and use other methods to move the data over. This took extra time. The other methods did not move the program over but were faster and did not crash the system. I am out the money for this product and it was horrific. I won't not suggest this product as all."},{"rating":"2","title":"PCMover","review":"Almost There!I'm not a techie, but for the money it was worth the investment. It transferred the majority of the information from the two drives in my old notebook. It did not transfer my Outlook inbox/outbox or the archive files (which I had a lot of) this may have been my fault still working on that issue.Because of a problem with my registry PCMover recommended that I purchase another problem to solve the registry problem. I was able to purchase and down load it over the internet successfully.I would use it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Lap Link Software","review":"I purchased to product after being told by the company that it would be able to move files and key software. My biggest concern was would software that I use every day such as Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Outlook, Power Point and Access) actually function if moved by Lap Link. The company assured me of two things - first - it would work; second - if it did not work there was a money back guarantee.My results - it did not work. Every software program that i use on a day to day basis did not function. I requested a refund immediately back in (December 2012). It is February 2013 and I have never received the refund.My suggestion, save your time and don't buy this software UNLESS you only want to transfer files."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE YOU BUY OR USE THIS","review":"This product was recomended by HP when I purchased a new notebook. What a waste of time, money, and resources. You have to be a PC expert to even figure this out. It requires so many custom settings you need to change on both computers for firewalls, sharing settings, privacy settings, and other things that no average person would know.I spend 45 minutes trying to figure this out, then called their help desk. I spoke to someone in India or Pakistan, does it really matter? They spoke no english, and spent 90 minutes changing settings, and attempting to get this to work.It didnt, and I wasted alot of time and money. I love using my AMEX to buy products like this so I can charge this back right on the people who sold it to me.Save your time, this is not a wonder disc. Go to Bestbuy and have them move it, or better yet buy a flash drive and move the stuff manually. It works, its cheap, and its fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money and time","review":"This software was a waste of money and time. Microsoft Office did not transfer correctly, nothing really worked right. Still had to reformat the hard drive and start from scratch. And I was going from a windows 8 PC to another windows 8 PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Software","review":"I bought this software because I had used it before with great success. However, this time around was terrible. I regret paying money to have my new computer screwed up. Do NOT buy this software! It's loaded with software offers that you don't want and that you cannot opt out of. After installing PCMover, I had to restore my new computer back to its original settings. A huge waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laplink PC Mover - waste of money","review":"I am not new to computers - I have been repairing them since 2001 so when I wanted to upgrade my home PC I thought I would give this a shot instead of the normal way I would since I got it really cheap - but you get what you pay for. The process took all night and then the next day to install windows 7 and transfer files. It doesn't work - none of my programs worked after the transfer because it transferred empty folders. Buyer beware - if you want to upgrade let a professional do it and make sure they don't use this software. Luckily I had a back up that I could go ahead and do it right without the software - but it still took me longer than it should have because of Pcmover and me having to reformat my hard drive after the botched attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted days and wasted nights","review":"Followed directions, engaged PCMover support, using almost two identical computers in Windows 7, turned off all security softwared, turned off power saving, ensured firewalls open, and half the time the sofware would not recognize teh other computer using the cable included in the box. Transfer attended 5 times, and failed every time. Support............ unable to come up with a solution. I've wasted more time with this than it would take me to install new programs and copy files over. Good job PC Mover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Results for IT shop","review":"This is just one mans FYI results:PCMover Ultiamete Pro with Ethernet crossover cable did not transfer the Microsoft Office 2007 Suite from one older XP machine to the new XP machine. Even had same user names, and users folder names in the Documents and Settings folder. That is the single biggest reason I wanted to purchase it. Now I still have to call Microsoft.It transferred my Adobe CS4 license, but not my Acrobat Pro license. Odd. Now I still have to call Adobe.I wonder if I will have any better results if I did an XP to Windows 7 Migration. I will advise if so.Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes patience","review":"I am not a computer wiz by any sense of the word but I know that you will need patience for this program. I thought it worked great. I think that you just have to really read the instructions and what the compatibilities are when transferring from one computer to another. Everything that I wanted transfered transfered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"this product is only good for moving your data files. You can get better results by using the software that comes with Windows 7 and a cheap cable. This used to be a great product and would let you move your applications. Now you will still need to reinstall your applications and reregister them. Not a time saver, but a time waster."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRANSFERRED NOTHING!!! EVEN WITH TECH ASSIST","review":"I'm a Certified Public Accountant with decent computer skills but I employeed a computer tech just to make sure and to save me time. I also successfully made a similar transfer 6 months ago from an XP machine to Windows 7 in my office.THIS TIME IT TRANSFERRED NOTHING!I'm out my money for 7 hours of tech support trying to make it work and also back to square one on setting up the new computer.MY TECH FEELS MICROSOFT IS DEFEATING THE PC MOVER SOFTWARE.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.oh yeah, spent 2 hours with their ON-Line chat, the only tech support offered free with the product.

If I was tech savvy enough to realize that, I could have saved paying the seller price plus purchasing a newer product. What a lesson learned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchasing a Headache","review":"I am happy that other reviewers found this product efficient and user friendly. My experience is different. First, Laplink sent the wrong CD for my OS, Vista. A serial number is required to use but that is not mentioned until you try to download and then you have to hunt for it. Support help is online only, no humans. Ouick Start requires 15 pages of instructions with examples of user screens that are unreadable, type is fuzzy and miniscule. Ordered online an never received an invoice hence no paper trail. After one week I have yet to transfer anything as the prep takes forever. In spite of the advertising claim that one push of a button transfers everything it takes many hours of blood,sweat and tears to get to that button. Well, back to the instructions and my goal of completing the transfer in one month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted My Time & Money","review":"Refused to transfer data from my older XP computer to a new Vista-based laptop.

The initial screen said that the transfer would take 7 hours. It halted after 4 hours with over another 4 hours remaining. Laplink never responded to my support request either. Use the included Migration Wizard utility included in Vista. It's faster, it works and is not limited to a single use! LAplink has this priced as a service, but it is SOFTWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Dangerous Software Ever!","review":"Do NOT buy this product (Laplink PC Mover Moving Kit). I tried to move my settings from a Windows 98SE machine to a brand-new Windows XP machine, and it absolutely trashed the new machine. I had to erase and reformat the hard disk and reinstall the operating system with product disks from the manufacturer to get it to work at all. The only possible safe use of this product (and even then I would recommend it only to professionals) is to move settings from one machine to an IDENTICAL machine -- same manufacturer, same model, same operating system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for XP to Vista dispite what they say","review":"I wasted a whole day transfering from XP to Vista and all the programs that I tried after the transfer said I had to reinstall. Even though I went through and uninstalled all the old programs I didn't want on the old computer there were still many that I missed. I ran my registry cleaner and there were 1500 errors. It may work well transtering XP to XP or Vista to Vista."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many compatibility issues. A complete waste of money!","review":"I bought this software to save time migrating my files and applications to a new laptop. I am a web developer who relies heavily on the Adobe CS3 Suite of applications. If you've ever installed this suite, then you know that it can take hours. Nowhere on laplink's web site does it say that their software isn't compatible with Adobe's. Yet when I tried to migrate everything over, Adobe wouldn't run at all. It just said that I needed to reinstall everything from scratch. In addition there were incompatibilities that caused other software applications to error. After several hours I ended up giving up on trying to use PCMover and just reinstalled everything manually. What a waste of time and money this software was. I can't get my money back and it's unusable on other machines, once installed.The whole idea behind using PCMover was to save valuable time. It turned out to be the opposite. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for complex migrations","review":"I think this product means well, but the fact that it has \\"no competitors\\" speaks to the difficulty of implementing this type of software for Microsoft pcs. I had an absolute nightmare and it would have taken 1/3rd the time to have installed everything from scratch - which I eventiually did. Unless your setup is relatively trivial, I recommend a clean re-install on your new machine from original disks. If yuou don't have original disks, then frtankly its a lottery."},{"rating":"1","title":"PCmover","review":"Using this product was a nightmare. I followed the directions exactly moving from an XP computer to a Vista computer. I ended up having to erase and reformat the hard disk of the Vista machine, and having to resinstall all factory loaded software, then copy over my important files. This was time consuming and the product was a BIG disappointment. A better route is to save all important files and copy them over, forgetting the software. New versions are often needed to run on Vista anyway. I wanted to save time but ended up spending WAY more time using this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time & Money","review":"It transferred the applications and data I requested; and nothing worked. I'd have been better off just doing fresh installs on everything, which is what I'm going to have to do after I undo the mess this highly overrated (in my opinion) and overhyped product made of my new PC.

My kids loved using this resource because it provided conscise answers to their many questions - we continue to use this book to help better understand current events in China.

Any of the dozens of insights he provides could be game changers if applied thoughtfully. There are gems strewn about here that will delight the reader and serve as justification for multiple readings. I bought extra copies and have been giving them to friends--something I've never done before with other books that I have admired. Buy this book; if you are disappointed after having read even half of it, I'd be interested to know whether you have already reached enlightenment or are incapable of appreciating the concept of the well examined life. This is one of those few books that may change the way you live your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A scientific take on the purpose of life","review":"A University of Virginia professor of psychology, Jonathan Haidt certainly has done a ton of research for this book. And it shows. This book is loaded with research data in the area of psychology and philosophy.From Plato to Immanuel Kant and from Buddha to Benjamin Franklin, all the legendary figures will be talking to you about their principles and postulations.Not a light read. You will have to read it with concentration, but you will soon find yourself immersed in the theories put forth and the wonderful real life examples supporting them.The theme of one's mind being a model composed of a rider and an elephant is brilliantly sketched.I did find religious aspect to be slightly monotonous, but author takes a very open approach while discussing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A open door to unfortunately unkown aspects of one's life","review":"This is an excellent book. It has allowed me to view my own life in such a way that it makes me rethink various aspects of my psychology. I believe that today's society forces us to drift away from the beauty of our own person. This book allows us to reclaim the awareness of the beauty in our individuality and it helps us understand ourselves better so that we may live a more conscious and self-revealing life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This is a collection of often old studies that the author has collected (I learned about the Harlow monkey experiments in college 30 yaers ago). His earth shattering conclusions include that we should strike a middle way between spirituality and materialism, and that often after people have bought something that they always wanted they are dissappointed. At the climax of the book he states that in order to be happy we need loving meaningful relationships and a job that provides us with satisfaction. What a shocka!!!!How we establish such relationships and find such jobs is our problem.In short a collection of simplistic drivel. However I give it 2 stars instead of one because it flows along nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too academic, and going nowhere.","review":"Forget this book. It's an interesting premise - exploring the great minds of the past to find a formula for modern happiness (ie. nothing is new under the sun - \\"the ancients understood what really mattered in life\\"). But it drags along making the same point over and over again for almost 300 pages. It could have been written in less than 100! Spend your time on another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An informative, well-written treasure trove","review":"This is a fantastic book. I especially loved chapter 5, where the author pulled together a lot of findings from diverse sources (research, biology, religion, philosophy) to present a compelling case for how those who seek to attain happiness through consumerism and achievement are misguided. Instead, he makes a compelling case for finding happiness in relationships, savoring everyday moments, finding diverse, enjoyable experiences, etc. Chapter 7 is also amazing. Who wouldn't want to erase all stress and misfortune from our loved ones lives? Yet, he makes a strong case for the importance of trauma in defining an identity and thriving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Synthesizer of the Art & Science about Happiness","review":"Haidt has achieved an excellent job in synthesizing various disciplines of wisdom about happiness (from ancient to modern, scientific to religious, Eastern to Western), in a provocative manner. He has also critically presented his view about happiness & the purpose within life, which I find pragmatic & inspiring. The book is beautifully written, with extensive list of reference for readers who are keen to explore further about the topics.For readers who are interested in the topics, I would also recommend Martin Seligman's work, such as 'Authentic Happiness'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good hypothesis","review":"Jonathan Haidt is one of several front-line researchers in the field of Positive Psychology. This book, The Happiness Hypothesis, is a beautifully written, erudite series of lessons about how current research verifies or challenges a host of ancient teachings about happiness ranging from ancient Egypt,Greece, and China and crossing over to Hebrew and New Testament Bible teachings and 20th century psychology. Suitable for lay readers as well as psychology majors both undergraduate and graduate. The goals of this book are very ambitious but skillfully achieved at almost every turn. While the final chapter was somewhat anticlimactic, in my view, the time spent studying the book overall was well worth it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Insightful, but not exactly what I was looking for.","review":"The book was definitely interesting, and I learned many things about myself that I did not know. However, the secret to happiness was not found in here. Not sure if I went in looking for too much, but it seemed to me like just when he might have been going somewhere, it ended.Very interesting facts about human nature and the brain though, and excellent quotes at the beginning of the chapters. I'm definitely glad I read it though. Had a very scientific feel to it, like there was proof for all the ideas.He briefly touches on positive cognitive therapy (replacing unhappy thoughts with happy ones) as one of the ways to be happy, but doesn't go into too much detail. I believe this is the most important. The author Vernon Howard definetely helps out in this department. Guy Finley's another one. All about awareness and enlightenment.But it is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"More than other good authors, Haidt really invests in his topics. The book is pregnant with insights which can only come from someone who by nature observes human beings, and takes joy in it. I also recommend watching Dr. Haidt on bloggingheads.tv where he is interviewed by Will Wilkinson (a favorite blogger of mine)--Dr. Haidt's enthusiasm radiates off of him. I will buy any book this man writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"unable to download","review":"The sample I read was very good; I think the book is likely well worth the read however I'm unable to download so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"First class survey of the field","review":"Jonathon Haidt is a terrifically productive thinker about psychology. This is book is a credo and a guide book to your own happiness via an accomplished romp through the psychological literature which Haidt uses to explore the truths of ancient religion. I'm surprised it's not a wild best seller, but I think I know why - it doesn't have an singular and catchy formula for your salvation which you can learn in your lunchtime and hear about ad nauseam on late night TV infomercials. Just well written, well thought out commentary on the formula for a happy and fulfilled life distilled from the psychological literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most practical life advice book","review":"This book is my all-time favorite book. It contains the most practical advice for daily living I have ever seen. It's not all touchy-feely but intelligently written and offers broad views. It is not a religious book or Christian book. It is a psychology book more than anything. This book is based on human behavior, philosophy and its background. Read this book and understand what drives you and how you can be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife Great Price","review":"My mom used to buy these knives at Walmart years ago and couldn't find them once they were discontinued.

Mine only came with the desktop base.Over all, very pleased with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't do better for the price.","review":"These are not the best fans out there, but for the price, you can't go wrong!

I don't use styling products, blow dry, heat tools, etc. Moved away from a place with softer water (about 4 grains per gallon)where my hair was soft, never tangled, smooth.... to central new york with extremely hard water (9 grains per gallon) and chlorine, and my hair feels dry and crispy even when wet, constantly tangled and breaking. I guess the water is too much for the filter, but they should at least publish some guidelines. I don't want to waste my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book fills a large void in Holocaust literature.","review":"Scholars of the Holocaust tend to focus on the horrors of the concentration camps.

Marion Kaplan provides us with these details, and the Holocaust emerges as far more terrible than most people imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and moving","review":"I read Marion Kaplan's Between Dignity to Despair a number of years ago and am now realizing what a powerful effect it had on me. It was very important to my own research into the 1930s and daily life in Germany. Her approach and scholarship were inspirational for me, and I appreciate her attention to detail and accuracy. I recommend the book for any group, college students or adults, studying the coming of the Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Piece of Fame","review":"I may be biased on saying this book is the greatest book ever written (next to the Bible), partly because I pesonally know the author, and one of the main characters he used,\\"Serge\\", is actually my older brother, real nickname \\"Sarge\\", also, my entire family is mentioned on page 7, (I'm Tony). Anyway, the places mentioned in the book are real existing places in my hometown, and life at that time couldn't be more accurate.

This book, as promised in the title -- Intuition: its power and peril -- lays out a very readable survey of the scientific psychological research on intuition. This is more like an undergraduate survey course than an in-depth discussion of what intuition is and how it can be improved and used more profitably to produce better results in our decision making. On the whole, however, an interesting book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating read","review":"This is an amazing book; it explains how and why we think and respond in ways that we do, and how much of our entire thought process takes place below the surface of our conscious mind. Myers takes the results from dozens of psychological studies and explains them in ways that are interesting and humorous. He also looks at which elements of our intuition we should question, and which are more reliable. His writing style is engaging, and I had a hard time putting the book down. It is a fascinating and relevant read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midget door with wrong instructions","review":"The instructions for shower door 1500D-36S Vista Pivot II are wrong Page 1, illustration 12 shows Pivot block being installed one way (the wrong way) and page 2, Illustrations 22 and 23 show it the right way.

The fill hole is only slightly larger than what you'd find on a soda bottle, so you can't fill it up quickly in the tub. The small opening also means it doesn't dry out quickly.For reasons beyond all understanding, they put in a very bright light you can't turn off.

I haven't replaced the mineralization filter ever, and I do not see any white buildup that other people complained of in other humidifiers. So, overall, a great product.But I gave it only four stars because it is uncomfortable to fill.

Instead, Edna Healey has written a sugar-coated history of the royal family. Some of her sources are linked to the royal family, and the resulting book is so unabashedly fawning that all credibility is lost. Even Edward VIII is described in a sympathetic light.

Sprint, with whom I have my service, also called me a liar and insisted that the phone could not have broken on the hinge simply by closing it. I beg to differ.

The camera takes good pictures in high quality mode. Wireless web is fast and simple. The screen is big, bright, and clear. It will be a while before get rid of this phone. A few minor gripes include the battery, it gets really hot if you use the phone for more than about 30 min. The flash on the camera tends to just screw up the picture instead of helping it out. Also, the camera is very sensitive, you must hold the phone completely still for the clearest picture. These are only minor complaints though, the good far outweighs the bad.

I love all the features; web, camera, IM, text messaging, look & design. However, as a phone, it stinks. It can hold the signal, but the sound quality is horrible. People are always telling me that I sound muffled, which was not the case with my old phone. I have to talk very loudly to have heard at a normal level. Plus, it shorts out quite often causing the phone to power down unexpectedly. Very annoying if you are expecting calls. I am not a tough customer and expect these phones to be disposable - especially with the heavy duty use I give it. However, after having high satisfaction with my motorola, I will go back to them.

The display was nice and clear-- two thumbs up. I tried out the camera of course. The flash option is nice, but doesn't do as much brighting I hoped (I didn't try taking pictures outside, but I'm sure those would be 10 times better) Many of the other pictures stored on the phone seemed a bit dark as well. However, besides that, the quality of the pictures was really good. Also, there are options for different kinds of photos you want to take-- whether you are taking one of someone else, taking a self portrait, or doing a group photo. The phone is cute. Silver, flip phone, camera, color screen. It is by far one of the best in it's class. It is true that Sprint has high prices on service plans, and I've also heard that the customer service is lousy, but as for their phones, Sprint is holding the weight.

We again had the same problem with these. This chirping sound that can last for 10seconds at a time. Regardless of the phone being free, for $260 there is no reason to have this problem. I called Samsung to see if there is something I can do and the 2 people i spoke to were not friendly and said a 3rd person will call me back within 3 days and it has been over a week with no contact.The camera on the phone is terrific, the phone is easy to use and learn.

We all were a little disappointed about the film. I am not sure of the purpose of this movie, but if it is to make travelers wanting to go visit Norway, it is a failure.Most of the movie was filmed in sad weather condition.It looks like the weather in Norway is grey, windy, wet and cold, even in the middle of the summer.I guess he photographer had a tight schedule and could not wait for the weather to improve.The part from Lofoten was nice though.I missed a reportage from the nice southern part of Norway also.All in all a cheap and sad movie.

You know you need to do it but don't know how to start, where to start, or what to do!THIS BOOK is for you! This book breaks it up, of course, into 365 days. How to start? It can be painful at first to do a devotion when many other priorities are screaming your name; or so you think they are priorities. Learn to prioritize GOD first in your life and stop wasting time on trivial activities! Where to start? Just begin on the day you are in.

We get together weekly to discuss what we have learned. Everyone loves the way the Bible is put together with scripture from the Old and New Testament daily along with a writing from Psalms and Proverbs. The writers tied it all together and it flows nicely. Much easier read than reading the KJV or any other version for that matter. The Companion to the One Year Bible is a great addition to this reading plan."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DAILY DEVOTIONAL","review":"I purchased the One year Bible a few weeks ago and LOVE IT!

It is set up in a way that you read some of the Old Testament followed by corresponding chapters in the New Testament and then some passages from Psalms and Proverbs. It's an interesting way to read the Bible. The days of reading are marked with the date to correspond to the date on the calendar. This way you will know exactly what you are supposed to be reading for that day.My only complaint is that I ordered the compact edition in NIV and the print is so small it is harder for me to read. I have good vision but this is the smallest print I think I have ever seen. But other than that, I am greatly enjoying the One Year Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to read the Bible","review":"This is the best way to read the Bible cover to cover.

This Bible breaks down daily readings into managable doses. You are able to learn and meditate upon the daily readings without being overwhelmed. I highly recommend this version for those who have never been able to read the entire Bible, new believers and for those who need a simple plan by which to manage their daily readings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to systematically read the whole Bible in a year.","review":"The Bible is divided into 365 parts, each labeled by the day of the month. Each day contains a passage from the OT, the NT, Psalms, and Proverbs. Each day's readings will take about 15-20 minutes. This method, along with some self-discipline, will help you read through all of God's Word. I think it's a great way to read the Bible. In my opinion the NIV translation is the most readable translation that is consistently accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will get you through it!","review":"Reading the Bible and knowing the Bible enhaces the Chritisan life.

This is pretty much what I was looking for, but I wish the words of Christ were in red (as they are in every other NIV I've ever seen). Plus, there are random passages that are bolded...it took me a awhile, but I found the explanation that these were \\"crucial passages\\" -- okay. Says who, exactly?Update: I am no longer even trying to use it daily -- because although the concept of the Old Testament is okay, the rest of it is too intermittent. It's one thing to read 2 pages of Old Testament every day, but reading one psalm or one single entry from Proverbs is not conducive, for me, to deep study. A great concept for the Old Testament only, but I would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small print","review":"I am no where needing reading glasses yet, but the small size of the print in this bible would have required a magnifying glass.

Over the journey, she helps you to try and understand the relationships of everyone involved and how being in China transforms her own understanding of her herself.

I also found that if you do not have children many of the ideas were not useful. I would not recommend this magazine. There are plenty of other choices that are better for the money.

So since she is not an issue here, I'm here to say that this is a great horror movie soundtrack for a great scary ghost/horror movie. This is one of my favorite movies because it has elements of old and new in it. It's not strictly horror, defined by what horror means in this day and age, it's more a good old fashioned ghost story - with ventriloquist dummies - one of the worst harbringer of nightmares that any small child of any generation could ask for. The score for this movie is atmospheric, spooky, and satisfyingly scary for when you are in that haunted house sort of mood. So enjoy the music, dream of Mary Shaw who had no children, only dolls, and if you should see her in your dreams, be sure you never......ever.......scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Johnette Napolitano?????","review":"When I heard the Johnette Napolitano track in the movie, I automatically wanted to go out and get the soundtrack.

I don't like to think of bands like this or AFI as straight punk music because it really isn't. Either that, or it's a type of punk that I don't hate. Yes, there are some similarities to Blink 182 in this but you can only expect them to sound so different when half the band IS Blink 182! This is the side of Blink that was serious and slower and not poppy (i.e. Adam's Song, Stay Together For The Kids....) with a darker feel to it. Standout tracks on here are \\"All Systems Go\\", \\"I Feel So\\", \\"Watch The World\\", \\"Elevator\\", and \\"My First Punk Song\\" (I think this is an insult for old inexperienced punk artists. That's why I appreciate this.) So, if you're gonna listen to a punk band, I'd listen to this or even better yet AFI. The reason this has 4 stars and not 5, is because it's punk, but this is the best punk is gonna get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, just as good as Blink 182","review":"This is an excellent band and an excellent CD. A darker, harder Blink 182 that contrasts with Blink 182 wonderfully. I have been a long time fan of Blink 182, and resent all accusations of them going pop. but im not going to get into that now, go find my Blink 182 review. And I is my favorite on the CD, and also the closest one to Blink 182's music. Tiny Voices and To The End With You are also great songs. I find Boxcar Racer to be just as good as Blink182, only darker and more serious. I also think Mark Hoppus would be excellent on this CD, but that would make it Blink 182 now, wouldnt it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom should have continued with Box Car Racer not AvA","review":"Box Car Racer is a great cd.

Why am I being so closeed-minded to what could be good music? Because I know crap when I hear it. All summer long, the video for \\"I Feel So\\" has been in heavy rotation on MTV2, drilling that annoying song into my subconcious whenever I channel surf. The band tries to be \\"hardcore\\" on that song by playing adjacent NOTES (not chords) on severely downtuned guitars, it tries to be \\"punk\\" by having a catchy chorus, and the supposedly \\"dark\\" lyrics make it \\"emo.\\" My verdict: listen to Far, Sunny Day Real Estate, or even AFI if you want some \\"hardcore emo.\\" All of those bands write songs with REAL emotion, and don't play any boring riffs. And if you want to hear some downtuned guitars, check out Will Haven, the ONLY band that doesn't abuse alternative tunings. Trust me, all those bands are great.

All the songs talk about grown up topics from seeing someone jump off a building(Elevator) to loving a girl(There is). The only bad thing about this cd is that almost every song seems to end the same way, like Tom used a formula to write the songs. They all end with a long repetition of the chorus, for some songs this is good, but others it kind of sucks and is repetative. Buy this cd if you like punk bands that arent fast, but are more melodic. If you like Tom's voice, buy this cd because on 10 of 13 songs, he is the only one singing.

It's just the next Blink 182 album, minus the singer who's voice is actually tolerable (Mark) and plus more awful, awful lyrics from Tom. Not to mention that the music isn't much of a departure from Blink's usual poppy, 3-chord fare. It's only amusing to think that Box Car Racer are referred to as Tom and Travis' \\"emo\\" band and they compared themselves to Fugazi and Quicksand. If you want to buy something that is good, maybe actually get a Fugazi album or something. Dare to explore.

It's so original and amazing, it blew me away. Tom's songwriting on this record is so far beyond songs he's written for Blink 182 and it's so honest and compelling to listen to. And the guitars are layered and complex and carry everything along. Of course, the record would be no where without the drums from Travis. He's made so many different sounds and textures with the drums that it's hard to imagine the songs without them.This instantly became one of my most favorite CD's of all time and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker will be delighted.","review":"If you buy this album expecting that Box Car Racer will sound just like Blink 182, you'd be right... about the first two songs.After \\"I Feel So\\" and \\"All Systems Go\\", Box Car Racer evolves into something much more than Blink 182. The album is raw, reminiscent of Fugazi, and undefineable. Tom DeLonge explores more with the acoustic guitar, and as usual, delievers with fantastic lyrics. Travis Barker really lets himself go, proving that he is, perhaps, one of the most talented and fastest drumers around.So, if you're buying this self-titled album and expecting Blink 182, don't be dissapointed when you get something much more that defies pop and redefines punk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Congrats Tom & Travis!","review":"This cd kicks! I hope Tom & Travis are pleased, I believe most Blink fans will be. Great job guys! Sounds as if you had a great time recording this. It was great to hear Mark add his trademark \\"F* Yeah!\\" after one track and then on \\"Elevator\\" Tom seamlessly hands off the vocals to Mark & Box Car becomes Blink. Awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite band","review":"Box Car Racer rocks! Their album is great! The only downfall I find with it is they only have 13 tracks which the 12th track I would concider a filler (a song made just to make the cd longer), because ofcourse it sucks. Other then that one song the rest of the album rocks! All amazing songs and could all be great singles! My favorite song on the album is \\"The end with you\\". Go buy the cd! If you like blink182's song \\"Stay together for the kids\\" you will like Box Car RACER!!!!!!!!!!!!!(for those who did not know.. Box Car Racer is 2/3 of blink 182. Travis barker and Tom Delonge are in it with two other guys.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good side project","review":"This almost could have been a Blink album. Almost. The subject matter is more serious and the music a little heavier, but at it's core, this is still pop music. (which is a good thing, because Tom Delonge writes great pop music) The influence of Fugazi, prevalent throughout much of this album, can also be found in Blink material (\\"Please Take Me Home\\", for one). Several reviewers on this site have mentioned the influence of Refused, but I don't hear it. Hopefully, this album can turn some of the MTV crowd on to more serious punk music that they would otherwise never be exposed to.Overall, a good album that's worth having, just don't expect anything radically different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"There are some highlights to this album, certain songs are good, but none are 'punk' i dont know what you people are talking about that refer to this music as punk rock. Check out The Exploited and AFI if you want to claim to punk rock. I hate this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice change of pace","review":"This CD is a very nice change of pace for the guys from Blink 182. Thsi album is much more mature and deeper than anything Blink has ever done. Standout tracks on the album are End With You, There Is, Elevator, and I Feel So. I would recommend anyone who likes Blink or anyone who likes the sound of Blink but wished they were more mature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"OK, this cd is unreal. It's so much better than Blink 182. So what if it's without Mark? I think they sound so much better this way, being that I am not even a fan of Blink (I don't mind some songs but I would not go out and buy their CD's). I'd rate this CD a 5 and anyone who does not agree does not know real music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick CD","review":"From the start to finish of this album Boxcar Racer has some great songs. The only song that even closely resembles Blink is \\"My First Punk Song\\" which is kind of a joke but for anyone who has been in a punk band, the first few songs definately sound like that. Hopefully at some point Boxcar Racer will put out another album, at least in the next few years but there is always Blink-182 and i heard Travis has started an insane punk band with some dudes from Rancid (sick) so this is probably it. So pick it up before everyone else starts throwing stuff at you because you don't own it. later"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top album from the Blink Boys!","review":"Blink 182's Tom and Travis side project Boxcar Racer. I am a big fan of Blink 182 and was a little sceptical of this album. I was pleasantly surprised when I played the CD to find out it was a very good album.It is quite similar to Blink 182 in places but this can only be a good thing. All tracks are good, some stand out as superb including 'I Feel So', 'All Systems Go' and 'Watch The World' (yes the first 3). Just a few more stand out tracks would have earned this album top marks. Still highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Blink","review":"I have to give it to BCR, they definitely take their music seriously. Their songs depress you, and move you, and rock you all in the same album. The single \\"I Feel So\\" shows most of what the album is about, dark and depressing, excluding the song \\"My First Punk Song\\" which is basically 1 minute 4 seconds of Blink 182."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature Blink","review":"With the formation of Box Car Racer, Tom (guitar) and Travis (drums) of the multi-platinum selling straight-edge punk band blink-182 show off a mature side that the adolescent antics of blink never allowed them to. Lyrics, though still covering much of the same ground as blink and every punk band out there (breakups, getting through life, teenage angst), are written with much more aplomb and insight then blink's ever were. Especially evident on tracks like the stunning opener \\"I Feel So\\" and the carefully crafted \\"Letters to God.\\" Travis also really shines on this album, cementing my impression that he is easily the best punk drummer out there. Occasionally, he'll slip into an almost corp style groove, with some obvious marching influences, throwing together things that you'd never expect to hear on a punk CD. But this is no ordinary punk CD, this is a shining collection of what the genre can accomplish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boxcar Racer beats expectations.","review":"This CD is totally rad. It's a different sound than Tom and Travis' usual Blink 182 power pop-punk sound, but it still delivers. This CD starts off with the first single \\"I Feel So\\", with a loud, raw sound, where Tom sings about being a kid wishing his pain away. From then on, every song is incredible. If I were to single out four songs any after listening for only a day, I would say \\"Cat Like Theif\\" \\"There Is\\" \\"Watch the World\\" and \\"Letters To God\\". Tom's voice just sails on every song. I recommend this CD to any punk, Blink, former Blink, or any rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"i miss blink-182","review":"I really didn't understand why two members from Blink-182 came out with an album called Box Car Racer, but the music stills rocks. It's not as good as Blink-182, but the lyrics still rock and the it sounds great. However, I prefer Blink over Box."},{"rating":"1","title":"average stuff here","review":"Well, I used to enjoy Blink182 quite a bit back with the Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch albums. Either I've grown bored with age, or it just really is novel and it gets old (take your pick as to which). Anyway, I gave Boxcar a chance, because I read that the style was going to be different with serious lyrics. Well, yes it is a little different than Blink musically, less pop-punk, and yes the lyrics aren't as juvenile. However, Tom's vocals are just unbearable for an entire album (in fact see him live and see just how unbearable and out of tune they really are). There are plenty of those typical Blink palm muted guitar parts, which has gotten a bit stale too. I'm sure plenty of this stuff will be watering down the airwaves. I'll give this 2 stars, because it is right in the middle, meaning average. Recommended only for those of generic musical tastes, or die-hard Blink fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Delonge is great on this album","review":"Boxcar Racer, a band made up of Tom Delonge and Travis Barker from blink 182, is a mixture of heavy metal/alternative music. The music and lyrics are very different than that of Blink 182, however, I liked the change. There is only one song on the album I would skip through, which is the hardcore punk song. Other than that song, the album is a masterpiece of guitar riffs and vocals. If you're a hardcore punk fan, you may want to go somewhere else. But if you're a loyal fan to Blink 182 and want to hear some great music, try this album out. It's worth the money! Plus, the downloaded versions and the cd versions are different so it is worth it to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Box Car Racer!","review":"I don't have this CD yet, but I'm going to burn it from my friend, Rick as soon as I get more blanks. From what I heard, it's pretty good... \\"I Feel So\\" and \\"There Is\\" are very good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stick with blink","review":"This CD is really dissapointing. I mean, I am a huge blink182 fan, they are one of my favorite bands, but this is nothing like Blinks great stuff. This album has a few good tracks, but the rest is poor, in my opinion. This just shows how crucial Mark Hoppus is to Blink 182. Download the few good songs from Boxcar, and forget buying the CD. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"A wonderful album.Perhapes not completly punk mucis.But maybe that is why I like it alot.It has nice piano music in it sometimes to.I really thought it was a differnt feel then some of the punk music that is out there.1.

If you like Blink 182, Green day, NFG etc, you will be disappointed, I know I was. My First Punk Song is the standout track, at at only one minute long that's saying something. The 30 seconds or so at the start of the intro to I Feel So are pure class, but then the prospect of a decent song is ruined by an over-loud instrumental. Mark Hoppus' input makes Elevator the only decent full-lenth track on the whole album, and here's why. Box Car Racer is a cliched rant by a rich little boy who seems to think his life is terrible. Too many obvious references to 9/11 make it an irritating listen, to anyone outside of the USA anyway. The fact is, if it was anyone else it would be a half-decent effort, but you can't help comparing it to Blink, and it just doesn't match up. Tom and Trav, don't give up the day job yet guys. (See, I can use cliches too!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll be honest...","review":"I haven't listened to this entire album. And you know what? I'm not going to either. With Blink-182, Mark and Tom played pop punk that had nothing I could take seriously anyways. But this?! This is insulting! Amazon.com says that it refferences Fugazi. I disagree. This CD RIPS OFF FUGAZI(although only musical. Mark could never write lyrics like Ian and Guy). The difference? Mark attacks the \\"big issues\\" and does pretty good job of whining about them too. This is inane. You want really punk or hardcore, try some Fugazi, Dead Kennedy's, or Minor Threat. There is nothing credible about bad music. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready to play","review":"They are great for people with trouble seeing to count the dots.

The only suggestion I have is that the manufacturer should play a few games & then analyze the colors. Sixes and nines are too close in color, and several others should be of greater contrast. Aside from that, we like the numbers instead of dots & it helps speed the game up by adding numbers instead of counting dots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy, Wrong Product","review":"My family really enjoys playing with the Domino set. The problem we faced with the set is we received Double 12 instead of the Double 15.

But here is my main gripe with a majority of these kinds of DVD's, including this one: They don't include ANY of the second guitar parts for most of the songs! Let me give you a specific example:On \\"Until It Sleeps\\" there are obviously two guitars playing, along with some overdubbed stuff. So James and Kirk playing (different parts), plus at least one overdub in some parts. In this \\"in depth analysis\\" they ONLY include James' part for the ENTIRE song, except the solo. So that second harmony chord part you hear on the CD is completely absent here.And it's the same for all the other songs as well. You are getting anything BUT an in depth analysis, and if you already have the sheet music for these songs, this adds absolutely NOTHING of value to it, so skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"melted mess","review":"Being diaetic i love this product.

However, this gives much more intense insight into the mind and body of Amelia, her views toward life in the war-torn country, her ambivalent feelings towards family,friends, and sexuality, and her combatting madness--her own and that which permeates her society as a whole.An \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" Ulster-style. Definitely difficult to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and fresh...","review":"I had not known much about Ireland in the latter half of the 20th century. While this is not an historical novel, it really does give a strong impression of what it is like to grow up in a nation rife with conflict. The book is well and imaginatively written and a real page turner. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original and Idiosyncratic","review":"Anna Burns has a highly original, idiosyncratic voice suited to the insane world she depicts. Like James Joyce in Finnegan's Wake, Toni Morrison in The Bluest Eye, and Samuel Beckett in almost anything, she writes \\"crazy\\" in order to represent an insane world. Not many writers can do this, and most don't even rise to the challenge.Lots of books that fall under the rubric of \\"world\\" fiction today are highly worthy as sociology lessons, but mediocre as art -- they read as fables, and are really no more than sermons designed to instruct rather provoke the reader into experiencing life in new ways.For those looking for such easy lessons, No Bones might be rough going. For me it was well worth the effort. Anna Burns is one of the few writers who can take difficult material, throw it up in the air and spin it into something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start then nothing","review":"The first chapter is shocking and I could not put it down.

This isn't it!","review":"I read this book believing the back cover was accurate - a story about the struggles of a young woman growing up in Northern Ireland. It is less than that. It is grossly obscene and there is nothing funny about the demented family relationships. As a person of Irish descent, I found the book to be offensive, scattered, unconscientious, and pointless.

Valentine and company infiltrate a strong group of Quislings and work to get the Southern Company back some of their land that was taken away. There is lots of action in this book, and perhaps the single most horrifying moment I've read about in a book since Stephen King came out with 'Salem's Lot.' The pacing and tension never flag, and the new characters we meet are incredibly well-drawn.This is an excellent addition to the series, and I suspect I'll be reading book 5 before February is over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, I cant wait for the fifth book ...","review":"This is the 4th book in the series of 5 ? 6 ? 20 ?

The book covers many topics in witchcraft, from its origins to witchcraft today. Covers four main schools of thought concerning Witchcraft. Those being the \\"Orthodox\\", \\"Anthropological\\", \\"Psychological\\", and \\"Pharmacological\\" positions or schools. Each is written in the intent to provide a solid foundation for further research, in the area of your interest. Charles A. Hoyt, a descendant of a witch himself, writes with vigorous passion.

Like others I, too, found it useless. I have followed the directions carefully, but found that it has never dispensed the pill with water -- the pill just sits inside the spout where it gets water-soaked and begins to disintegrate. This, needless to say, is not the result that I wanted. I would certainly like to know how those who report satisfaction have managed to have the spout release the pill with water so that it could be swallowed.

When I did get it to work the pill just landed in the front of my mouth and stayed there.

I also think Marin's set has an all-around more even cast, and that would be my choice recording. I know, I've heard all about La Studer and Larmore's onstage gaffes, but in the studio they were just fine. Gruberova of course is phenomenal in the coloratura, but beyond the breath-taking runs her performance still comes up as bland, the dramatic moments are pallid and unconvincing. She has an easier time portraying fear or outright horror, but I can't buy her threats (especially compared to Studer).Florez fans will want to note that this is already an old recording (though only recently released I believe). So expect a beautiful voice that is a work in progress.In short - if you're only getting one Semiramide, this wouldn't be my choice.

No more purchases like this one for me. It will be mailed back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"heart of the system (battery) very poor","review":"The NiCon battery has low power and poor life. I have had my edger for two years now. The first year it worked great, at the end of the summer I drained the battery and set it aside. The following summer I recharged it and went out to use it, I barely have enough power to get my trimming done let alone the edging. In order to use it again I have to clamp the handle down and completely drain the battery (not safe). Then recharge the battery for 24 hours. The Nicon battery in short makes the system completely none usable.Pros:Great ergonomicsFor the 10-20 minutes I have power it does everything I could ever need it for.Cons:POOR battery lifeNeeds to be completely drained to make it functionI consider the battery the heart of the system; poor heart poor system. Its like having a laptop that has to be plugged in to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I purchased one thinking the cordless feature would be a better deal than dealing with a cord. Boy was I wrong. The Worx have very little power to cut grass or weeds in my yard. I was upset that it went through the two or three cord replacements before I could finish a portion of my yard. I was not pleased with its performance overall.

I would only recomend this for small jobs only. I have 2100 sq. ft. of lawn. The battery is adequate. The worx is light and easy to use. However, it is not a good trimmer/edger. I have used a gas trimmer for years and thought this would be a great tool to replace my old one with. What a mistake. You are constantly having to feed line if you want a close cut, because it just wont cut. It has a metal guide on the front of it that is more of a hinderance than guide. And as for using it as an edger, if your taller than 6 ft. be prepared to do alot of stooping. This product is worthless as your main trimmer/edger."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all that strudy","review":"I purchased one of these because it sounded good on the tv ad. Free line for life, sounds great. The length of the handle, after it is extended out, was still very short and uncomfortable to use. The actual edging of the grass took forever.

Edge cutis beautiful if your grass has already been trimmed by a more powerful trimmer. Thus it's not so good on the power side because it does not perform well on serious trimming duties. Would be an excellent product if it had 3 simple things: 1) A 36 Volt Battery for POWER. 2). Real wheels that were made of high grade rubber instead of cheap plastic. Also if it incorporated ball bearing wheels into its design the wheels would not bind easily. 3). The telescoping shaft desperately needs to be at least a foot longer. Then this product would really be ready for the everyday home owner. As it is now, it's for some little old lady who wants to tiddy up a bit. Worx Mfg, if you are reading this, please take this review to heart. You have a great concept, but in practice it truly is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak performance, weak customer service","review":"This trimmer edger is weak, it bogs down too easily. The only benefit is that it is cordless. We had to get our gas powered trimmer to do the real work. We ordered two batteries initially, the second of which never came. We called 3 times and were forced to leave messages. We emailed 3 times as well with an automated response telling us we would be contacted within 24-48 hours. None of our emails were returned, nor were the messages that were left. Finally got through where I learned that emails and voicemails are sent to an unmonitored box in their \\"corporate office\\".

It was nothing but problems. The string did not feed properly and as far as edging if you only have 6 ft or so to edge then maybe it can do the job. The string is not strong enough to cut through grass or dirt. And this is with just moderate up keep. It deffinitely will not work on lawns that have not been kept up. The charge lasted maybe 15 minutes and was not long enough to finish even the basic of jobs. The business end of this weedeater is made from very flimsy plastic and I doubt that it would stand up to normal wear and tear. I purchased it from lowes and returned it the day after purchase.

My wife wanted one that was lighter than my ECHO so I ordered it for her. With a full charge it will in fact trim grass. that's about it. if you get into any weeds it will leave most of them. I did order an additional battery which was a smart choice since the battery only last about 5 minutes with any power. After that it even has trouble with grass.

As a woman, it is so difficult to manage a gas-powered trimmer. When I saw the \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" photos listed here, I decided to write a review. It would probably take me an hour to get the effect shown in these photos! If you have St. Augustine grass, you have to move the trimmer about as slow as a snail in order to cut it.

First year it was OK, next year weak, now no action at all. Won't even cut thin grass.

I won't fall for the commercials any more for new untested stuff like this. I see there are now propane powered trimmers that you can buy only on-line, but nobody has them and no repair shops for them anywhere. Buy something with no service anywhere? Nope, I won't fall for this again. Going back to gas power but this time with 4 stroke no-mix engine. Even though Craftsman is medium grade quality they offer a 3 year end to end warranty for only 49.99. So for three years I can get no-question replacement for the price of ONE battery from Worx.

I tried to use it to edge the ivy that grows into my driveway and the Worx didn't have enough power to cut the ivy off.

The blower is ok for small things but not enough force to blow larger things or an accumilation. It is nice and handy and quick but needs far more blowing power.The trimmer/edger is a piece of junk! The string will NOT advance by itself. When you advance the string manually it tears off right away about an inch from the spool. If the string would advance by itself it would be ok but the string is very weak and tears off way too easy. The edger part is a joke. When trying to edge you have the same issues as when trimming but on top of that it is not strong enough to edge and cut the grass.I have contacted Worx a few times and still no satisfaction.

I quit using it in the vertical position as an edger because the line would constantly break off and I would have to stop and manually feed out more line. Also, the battery didn't keep its charge as long as advertised. I have a small suburban lot (0.2 acres), but the battery would die before I could finish my trimming.

After we had followed the instructions, and charged the battery pack overnight, the next day we tried it in our driveway; a fairly small area, after 45min of frustration we had to give up. The results left our lawn looking uneven. To be generous, I'll say that the trimmer produced mediocre results, and is not effective at all as an edger.

Since the auto line feeder hasn't worked, whenever I hear a high pitch I need to stop, flip over the eater, and press the button to let more line out...something Robyn Harttl promised I'd never have to do again.It is super light and the battery power seems better than I thought it'd be.Maybe my weeds are super powered because the GT Worx couldn't slay my yard.

They have new batteries from another company and so far, it has charged perfectly the 10 times I've used it.As for performance, it will do very well on small to medium sized lots. I have an above average lot (half acre) and the battery holds out fine. If you have close to an acre or more, get two batteries or buy a gas trimmer. But, this is much more convenient than a gas trimmer since it's as easy as popping the battery in and out. Takes several hours to charge it up.

I was looking for an alternative to the gas powered trimmers, but I did not want to go electric and have to drag a cord around. I will be buying an electric trimmer, because the Worx just does not have the power. It take me a lot longer to get my trimming done now and the power is just not there. I like that is it battery operated and it is easy to pull out or small quick trim jobs, but to trim my whole yard it just does not cut it. I am not satisfied with this purhcase."},{"rating":"2","title":"worx gt 150","review":"Lightweight and versatile. Trims and edges as advertised. Auto line feed also works as advertised.

I needed a trimmer so I thought this one sounded great. Well, it certainly isn't all it is cracked up to be. The battery doesn't last very long at all. My front yard is average to small size and it takes two charges to get it done. The string???? OMG! I had to stop every five minutes to adjust new string. There is no auto-matic release. Plus the new spools they sent had to be unwound and rewound because the waxy string was fused together.

Does NOT self feed line","review":"I ordered this product and was very excited due to all the commericials that are ALL OVER the t.v. now. With a fully charged battery, I tried to trim my drive way and it was SO WEAK that I had to go very slow and try to trim a small portion of grass at a time. Also, every 2 minutes I had to stop and pull out the cord of the so called \\"self feeding line\\" that supposedly automatically adjusts to the proper length without manual adjustment...WRONG! It was such a dissappointment! Great idea but they didn't have the product to back up what they were advertising. I lost $18 to ship it back, so bascially I paid $18 dollars for a piece of crap and wasted time.

This trimmer is a gutless wonder and I don't recommend it even to the light user! I mow every 4 days so my trimming is not overgrown! I think a weed w/ a heavy stem would stop it in it's tracks.

Shaft is adjustable to height, but is more for a shorter body.2. Unit is light weight3. Unit is easy to run.4. Easily adjusts from weed whack mode to edging mode.5. Battery is easy to change.6. Handle is easy to adjust.7. Used as a Weed Whacker does a good job.8. Not needing electrical cord is convenient.Cons:1. String does not automatically adjust, has to be pulled to length.2. Battery only lasts about 15 minutes, strong only for the first 8-10 minutes or so.3. Not really made to be a commercial trimmer, best suited for home property use.4. Not a good option to edge along hard surfaces that have not been previously edged, but is good as an upkeep after a real metal blade edger has been used to first cut edges. Unit does not cut into dirt very easy or quickly.5.

I'm an old guy and I should know better but got suckered in on the TV ad. First, it is not a powerful motor and if you're tall, you'll find the handle short which means you need to bend your back through the whole operation. The battery does not last very long. In fact, I've never seen a battery operated device that will work as well as an electric or gas driven motor.

The guard that flips down to guide it around the curb is in the wrong place and will eat your yard up. The guard needs to be in line with the weed eater line, and it is not. It is set back about an inch too far. It works great as a weed eater but I wouldnt recommend using it as an edger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I've had my Worx 150.1 for 3 years. It worked fine for my needs (just trimming \\"volunteer grass\\" & weeds). I love the fact that you don't have to fuel it with ethanol-cursed gas & there's no restraining cord. I even recommended it to friends. BUT NOW it has developed a cronic non-feed problem. It runs fine for about 20 seconds then as the RPMs increase you realize that it failed to auto-feed. I was so ticked off with this ailment that twice I just threw the cursed thing away while uttering things I can't repeat here. I never had a problem with the battery, so it'll probably explode next time I use it. I intend to go back to the folks I had recommended it to and advise them not to waste any money on this piece of trash.

It does a great job on light grass and weeds but not well on heavily congested areas. Tall weeds get wrapped around the spool and bog it down. The battery is a joke. The battery that came with it would only last about 5-10 minutes. I contacted the company via their battery repalcement web page and they send me another one. It only lasts about 20 minutes. Not even long enought to get around my pasture once much less the 3 times around the ball fiels that it advertises. My advice is to check out other brands before spending your money on the WORX trimmer unless all you want to trim around is a flower pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, I guess, but too light","review":"I purchased this item in order to be able to practice with something resembling a tachi. Unfortunately, this was much too light -- not sure why the shipping weight is eight pounds (even with the box, it didn't weigh that much). It is not appreciably heavier than the Cold Steel O-bokken. Also, after the first use there was some splintering on the handle and I had to tape it. The finish could be better, but the wood itself appears to be satisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tru-fire Hurricane MC- EX","review":"I am new to archery and bowhunting. I really like this release. It's easy to adjust. I'm left handed and had to flip trigger mechanism over. The trigger can also be adjusted.

All you have to do is press trigger and the jaws open up and then release the trigger and they close back up. I would recommend this release.

Or you may have done nothing wrong, but many women are just plain fickle.\\" In many cases the book just seems like too much overanalyzing and bellyaching and \\"Why? Why? Why?\\" I found myself saying, as I read it, \\"Get over it and move on already!\\" Marla Paul's book, \\"The Friendship Crisis,\\" was much better in terms of offering useful insights and positive solutions -- not just reminders of how awful women can be to each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps you feel as if you are not alone if you have lost a friend.","review":"Liz Pryor, the author, has definitely done her research. Granted it is not highly technical research where she has conversed with hundreds of psychologists and then spouts a bunch of psychobabble about how women treat women friends in a certain way because of their upbringing. No, it is much more about how women don't even realize they are passive agressive. How no matter how upfront we are with our male partners or friends, we are less than upfront with our girl friends when it comes to letting go. If you have ever experienced \\"a snubbing\\" by a friend, this will definitely help you see that it may not have been about you. Maybe this will help us all end those girl relationships that have grown tired a little more gracefully.

In the case that different terms exist for the same concept, it would be very helpful if the dictionary specified the country or countries that use each specific term.

Vanderbilt is vaccuous, her divorces and even the loss of her son by suicide is glossed over. Some of her lovers are named, some are not, but it doesn't matter.... everything is a short snippet with Gloria always bouncing on to the next romance.

They bend but don't break, hit hard enough to tell you've been struck, but don't leave any lasting injury though they do have a tendency to leave welts with heavy impact where the lighter tanto-style knives do not.

I like raw energy, but I'm not convinced by Krakaer's desperate tone. His ideas start out interesting, even funky, but compositionally, nothing develops. His technique, though accomplished, relies on 1 or 2 tricks (shticks) that become predictable, monotonous, and lack subtlety.

Initially, we did not think the book's content and characters were deep enough, however, we had the opportunity of discussing with the author his view on the different angles/avenues he chose to take in the book and came away with a better understanding of the male perspective.

Though I try to make it a point to finish any book I start, this one wasn't easy for me. Though the characters were interesting enough, I found the writing style and phraseology extremely annoying. It just didn't seem to flow at all.

I was by no means disappointed. This is a wonderful novel about love and friendship, life and death. There were many times in the course of reading that I was cheering, clapping, yelling and crying. The main characters were portrayed vividly from the sweetness of Legacy to the horrendous Simpson. I felt Marshall's grief and Jasmine's betrayal. This book touched on social issues that we all deal with today such as instant wealth from playing sports, unprotected sex and how AIDS impacts on so many people. This book is a must read. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Autumn Leaves: A Book too Good to Leave on the Shelf","review":"I just loved this book!

But I think the readers will understand the overall message. How our lives are so intermingled unwittingly?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful expression of life and relationships","review":"Sometimes a song, a poem, or a book comes along that moves you. This one rocked my foundation. It was refreshing to have a male write for a woman that sounded like a woman. I totally identified with Jasmine and Marshall. I was Jasmine once in my life and I had a Marshall, so they were very real to me. I think we can all identify with one or more of the characters in this well written modern day artwork. I stayed up well past my bedtime for 3 nights because I couldn't wait until the next day to see what was going to become of Rory, Simpson, Kennedy, Legacy, Marshall and Jasmine. I liked the \\"no pantyhose\\". Woman after my own heart. For the author, I think you are to a pen what Legacy was to paint. Keep up the GREAT work and I look forward to reading more of your artwork.

Riddled with misspellings, this book was in dire need of an editor and the ending was purely ridiculous. To top it off, a recording artist was an actual character in the book! It had potential in the beginning to be an interesting time-filler, but \\"Autumn Leaves\\" was much too shallow and lacked a definitive writing style. In short, \\"Autumn Leaves\\" was one of the worst novels I've ever read.

I found the author's story line well thought out and the moral of the story commendable. However, I found the grammar to be horrible. I'm not referring to the language of the characters, I am referring to the grammar of the author. A qualified editor would have never allowed this book to be published without clean up. Incorrect punctuation, run-on sentences, etc., etc. It is difficult to believe the author received a Master's from any legitimate school, but I applaud that accomplishment. I do, however, recommend that the author enroll in writing and English classes so that his future offerings are more acceptable by a wider audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Autumn Leaves - Love So Deep","review":"You've got a great sense of timing, Victor. Heterosexual AIDS and the head-in-the sand attitude by women about male bisexuality is a subject that needs to be addressed today.

Thanks also for Jazz, a strong Sista who refused to compromise her love of self for her man/child, Marshall -- the jock with a misguided itch! I loved the Rory/Marshall storyline. Morris may have been flamboyant and an absolute scream, but he was also a loyal friend. But, ohhhh, Legacy! I look for him everytime i go through a toll booth...smile.

The only concern that I have noticed is the stand can make your TV lean in various ways. My In-Laws TV leans back slightly, mine leaned to the left when I first got it. All I did to fix my problem is un screwed all the screws on the stand and rearrange the stand and put the screws back in. I haven't had any problems since.

There were also issues with the colors - green and red. I had to constantly adjust the colors. With this experience, I decided to stay away from LCDs until the technology matures for larger screens. Seems like all bad LCD stories happen with the larger screens. So, I went and bought a 50\\" Panasonic plasma instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV","review":"It is a great TV very clear imagen with HD or without.

We were easily able to hook it up to an Onkyo receiver for a/v switching. I'll mention some of the negatives, because that's why these reviews are read in the first place.1) There is a fair amount of glare, so make sure you have that issue addressed covered before you buy it.2) it attracts/dust fingerprints easily3) when we return to the main screen from watching DVDs on my xbox 360 the TV reports it is an incompatible video mode and then goes black. Pretty annoying. I'm pretty sure it's not an xbox setting, but maybe it something on the receiver I haven't figured out yet.4) TV buttons are harder to access now, becuase they're on the top of the TVOverall: Excellent buy. Great image quality. Great sound. I wouldn't let the cons mentioned above stop me from buying it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"refurbished lcd tv","review":"This is like my third tv was shipped.1st TV - power goes out after 30 min of watching.2nd TV - damaged on the right coner of the displayed.3rd TV - they sent me a refurbished tv that someone had replace the turner box.

I still think Amazon is great, but now the TV is having the problem common to all Samsung TVs. Takes a long time to turn on, clicks and clicks, and when it does come on it has distortion in picture. Amazon can do nothing for me but suggests I contact Samsung customer service. Samsung customer service(?) writes back and says \\"they don't have a record of problems with this TV\\" (liars!) and suggested it was a bad surge protector. I am not giving up and will pursue Samsung fixing this for free. I don't think I should have to take the risk of opening up the TV and replacing the capacitors myself as many others have done (search internet for Samsung capacitor problems and you will find many links and Utube videos). A $3000 TV should last more than 4 years. It would have been nice if Amazon had offered to pay for getting it fixed.Buyer Beware: Don't buy Samsung products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this Review if You are Thinking of Buying -- Capacitors Fail and Picture Fails","review":"A year after purchasing this tv, it would not start up anymore due to the fact that the capacitors blew. I had to take it apart myself and replace them. Then, the picture started developing these pixelated lines that run vertically on both the left and right side. The fix is too expensive. Do not purchase this tv. Do a little more research and you will find that these problems are a pattern for this tv. I spent $2300 and could have purchased something much better for a lot less. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with the LNT5265F","review":"We bought this LCD in June and we loved it. BUT by September, barely three moths later, we started having an issue with the picture disappearing. Screen would just go BLACK. Sound ok, but absolutly nothing on the screen (including the menu). Next day, it's fine. This has been happening on and of now wvery few weeks. Yeah, try to get service there when the problem is happening... LOLI am thinking I just got stuck with a lemon, and have filed a complaint with Samsung, so we'll see how it goes...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good tv","review":"First the poor: This tv does absolutely nothing to help standard definition signals. With some adjusting you can make it look fair to poor over satellite (I really didn't no how poor the signal was from my satellite until I hooked up this tv). The good: This tv looks good with a 480p DVD player, looks very good with an up-converting dvd player, and looks exceptional with HD DVD (you do need to make adjustments to get the most out of tv, see: \\"avs forum\\" for help as it has a strong following there). Conclusion, very very nice tv but go ahead and upgrade your satellite or cable to HD before your new tv arrives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samsinging a happy tune! LNT5265F","review":"The Samsung 52\\" LNT5265F from Amazon was the same price as the 46\\" same model at the \\"Big Box\\". I know this because I bought one at the \\"Big Box\\" brought it home and it was defective. The \\"Big Box\\" hasseled me over the return (they eventually caved in, but lost a customer) and that's when I started shopping Amazon and found this great deal. Then with Super Saver \\"White Glove\\" shipping and NO sales tax, I saved over $250 when I bought my Wall Mount and HDMI cable from Amazon.The \\"White Glove\\" delivery was days ahead of schedule, they called and made an appointment and then delivered when they said they would! Imagine a delivery service keeping a promise! They helped me set it up too and made sure it was working before I signed the delivery slip too.I forgot to say the TV is awesome too. I had a few questions on the many settings, but eventually got things set up so it is beautiful. Now, I wish there was more HD broadcast available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Picture Says it All","review":"This television has the best picture we could find by shopping all the major brands at Fry's, Circuit City and Best Buy. Once it was delivered and set-up in our home it has lived up to all our expectations and more. Contrast, defintion and color; the only draw back is that older shows really look bad vs. the newer and HD channel shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning - exceeded my expectations of LCD","review":"I've been viewing videos on my Dell LCD, so I had relatively low expectations. All the typical detractions of LCD's worried me: shadowboxing, pixelation, blur/lag, poor black, and lackluster color. Samsung got it right with this model. It's definitely not on par with the best plasma for color and blacks, but it's equivalent to the good ones. And I wanted all the benefits of an LCD, so this made it the best choice.And when it's hooked up to a 1080p source, it's gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly What I Expected","review":"I ordered this TV based on the many great reviews I came across.

The delivery was 7 days early and the white glove was great. The delivery guy set the whole TV and DVD player up for me. All this was at least $500 - $1000 less than the least expensive least trustworthy online store. Not to mention I saved all the taxes ($250) I would have spent at Big Buy. If you are going through the same girations searching for the right place to spend your money go no further. Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made the right choice","review":"Love this TV.

But so far Ive found the defult settings are fine and the picture looks great. Being a gamer I was also was looking for a LCD set and my Xbox360 games look amazing. But if you still have a Playstaion2 you may want to upgrade to Playstation3 or 360 because Playstation2 isnt HD and doesnt look too hot. I had planned on getting this at Circuit City but on the advice of my Dad I ordered it thru Amazon and saved a few hundred dollars. The only reason Im giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because this type of product needs to stand the test of time before accurate review can be given. I dont want to be one of those fools who rave about something than have it go south. but so far samsung has made a believer out of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good!","review":"I decided to purchase this LCD TV after it received a great review from an audiovisual magazine.

I tried to bend one a bit to get it into my pegboard wall and the weld broke and it came apart in my hand. The fourth I ended up using but after doing a bit of damage to the peg holes in my pegboard. Sheesh! When you buy something as simple as wire bent to spec you'd think it would be. You just can't take anything for granted anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Worx WG103 is a fantastic weed trimmer!","review":"Others who have reviewed the Worx WG103 6-amp trimmer have found that the trim line breaks often, BUT if one replaces the weak line that comes with the unit with a .065 line, then the WG103 out performs every weed trimmer. I have used Craftsman, Stihl and others, they all have problems with the line and line spools. With a good line, the WG103 works flawlessly, without once attending to the line, it will keep constant proper length until the line is all used up. That equals about an hour of hassle free weed trimming!The Worx WG103 power is just as good as a gas powered unit and with out the problems of a pull cord, gas fumes, smoke and the inevitable engine breakdown. The unit has adjustable shaft length and wheels for vertical edging, features that I have not seen on any other weed trimmer.The Worxs WG103 is by far the best weed trimmer for those who's trimming job is 150 feet or closer to an electrical outlet (up to 300 feet when using 240V power)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Company to Deal With! Way to Go WORX","review":"I posted earlier after buying the WG103 and had extensive problems with the line breaking. I immediately contacted the company and can't say enough on how I was treated as a customer. I have not seen the fantastic public relations, respect and upmost concern for the customer from a company in a very long time. They worked with me, took my information and eventually resolved the issue. I have tried the new one and now what a string trimmer. With all the wonderful features and design it is honestly an ease to use. No longer am I having to deal with the issue of line breaking. Now it moves right along and I don't have to worry about the trimmer starting. I will never own a gas powered trimmer again after my experience with WORX. Thank you WORX for a great string trimmer and taking the ease out of yard work. Now you have a 5 out of 5 Star Winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Features but can be troublesome.","review":"My main concern about this trimmer is its serious lacking of a safety switch. The user have to be very aware when switching from one cutting position to another, if not, your can easily trigger the unit on and cause serious injuries. I got pass the first flaw and proceed to edge my lawn, I had to stop several times to trigger auto-feed the spool and twice to manually feed due to the fact that the spool completely cut off, so I unplugged, remove the spool head and re-feed, this all happened within the first 10-15 min of usage. Another thing I was willing to get past was the construction; for the price I figured it would be ok... but it all plastic of some sort and the seams come apart (not completely but I saw great amount of separation that told me the thing won't last long) when switching cutting positions. I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"#WG 103 String Trimmer","review":"Purchase of this item was a mistake for me. While the design of the machine is excellent, the nylon line that is provided is worthless. The trimmer works great in an open field, but cannot approach an obstacle without the line breaking. Heavy duty replacement line purchased at a local hardware store lasted longer, but is still unsatisfactory. The time required to replace the line makes this tool unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy line feeder","review":"You will spend all your trimming time removing the line spool to get the line out.

Wouldn't the designers of this product have tested the line feed before releasing it for sale to an unsuspecting public? Apparently not.

Plot is poor, character development is nil. Like the authors, I've wanted a sequel to the original for years but this one was a disappointment. I was surprised at the low quality of the writing. Examples: an assassination attempt in the middle of a play - before the assassin has obtained the information he needs. Or, a sudden switch to first person point of view for a minor character two-thirds of the way through the book.

But even taking into account different writing styles I found this sequel to Witches of Karres to be a clumsy attempt to cash in on Schmitz's work.Going negative is boring and who wants to read nasty rants? I will just say that following on another re-read of much of Schmitz's previous works (put out nicely by Baen) it was like cold water to the face with this book. Sadly, it was a real let down regarding, writing style - clumsy, fidelity to characters - hardly and overall pleasure in reading - none.This book show that James H.

A seamless continuation of the Schmitz classic continues the adventures of Captain Pausert and his traveling companions Goth and the Leewit. And wherever the captain goes, action, trouble and romance follows.
