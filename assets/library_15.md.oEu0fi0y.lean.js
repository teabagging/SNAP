It gives the reader information about the many areas of the country, including prices, popular attractions, and practical information such as how to use the public telephones (not obvious!), etc... My favorite aspect of the book is that it gives detailed listings ofresturants and eateries within a wide price range. I hesitate to give this book a better rating, simply because the introductory history is somewhat biased and maybe unecessary ( unless you have no familiarity with german histoy. ) and the book is narrated in a fashion that I found slightly vague and irritating. ex; the book mentions that there is always plenty going on in Goettingen, but neglects to say what... but thats trivial, really, and it will answer your basic travel concerns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I'm half Hungarian, so I am always on the \\"look-out\\" for anything that will remind me of Hungary. Therefore, I may tend to be more lenient than others when grading Hungarian movies or books...BUT even I can't save this horribly boring, stupid waste of your time \\"movie\\". First, if anyone has been to Hungary or Budapest, you'll see that they clearly don't show any of the places to which trendy Hungarian girls would go to party. I think that probably has to do with budget, i.e., they had to stay away from any recognizable monument/area, to keep the costs down. SO, if you're goal is to visit/re-visit Budapest on film, you won't see any of it here. The actors have silly lines (I felt sorry for them!) and the theme song is played over and over and over until you want to scream!

In the past they have delivered a unique and refreshing sound, such as the fast and aggressive style with slightly distorted lyrics found on their previous release, \\"The Devil You Know\\". Unfortunately, part of that style has been lost on \\"Brand New History\\". The overall tone of this album is much more laid back and slower than before, and that will no doubt be a disappointment to some. Once you get past that however, you'll find that there are some fairly enjoyable tracks on \\"Brand New History\\". Songs like \\"Flamethrower\\", \\"You Don't Know What It's Like\\", and \\"Tomorrow Starts Today\\" all live up to the quality one would expect from Econoline Crush, and will easily become stuck in your head long after you listen to them.

Looking at Buckcherry's website, I noticed they were coming around these parts with a band called Econoline Crush. Being my curious stuff, I picked the album up. Very awesome. The lead singer has a jazzish style to him on a lot of songs. The guitars are typical rock and roll. The drum beats switch from rock to hiphopish type stuff. The presence of a DJ on some tracks really surprised me (for them to be touring with Buckcherry). It's not really my style of music (on most tracks), but you can really feel and hear the rock and roll passion in his voice. I love it. It'll take a while to get used to, but my advice is if you want to find something a little different, go for this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing.","review":"I purchased this CD 'sound unseen', as the previous discs [notably Devil You Know and Affliction] were original, powerful ranges of sound which I kept spinning for days on end.I was incredibly disappointed with Brand New History.

One might expect to hear this CD churned out by any of the top 10 artists on the rock charts - which is the entire problem.

If you like that one, you'll probably like the like the rest.This album has a sort of stylized mid-1970's, kind of Bowie type of feel to it. Actually, the sound that is most similar is the Soundtrack for 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch'.

A handful of the stories have been great, but I think that perhaps this book would have been better off as a phonics Bible--sans the attempt at rhyming.We also purchased the Phonics book of prayers, and found the same problem with words like \\"jerk\\" and \\"stupid.\\" Things I don't really care to have my newly reading children learn how to articulate, let alone spell and read.

If the two are not connected perfectly or things get tweaked over time it leads to the wispy electrical smoke that we got this week.

With regards to maintenance, I think it makes sense that you have to clean filters with a vacuum you expect to suck up dirt and dust, where else would it go?? The cleaning doesnt take all that much time and its kind of cool to see all the black scum that comes off the filters. Overall I would recommend this vacuum to people who want a good vacuum for little money and who need to use it a lot for pets or kids.PROS: cheap, bagless, fairly light, long cord, very user friendly, great suction and cleaning abilityCONS: not much but if I had to guess... plastic parts, maybe heavy, and suction can always be better"},{"rating":"2","title":"This vacuum cleaner is great!","review":"It seems very powerful and gets up dust and pet hair really well.

Mind you, I don't have any animals and I have a very small condo that I live in, so it's not like this vacuum was up to a lot of work. I just repaired it again and yes, it has LOST ALL SUCTION just a couple months later! The only way I can get it to work is to detach it from the main frame and use the attachments.

They're a magnitude better than this one.I'v read Orfali's most books and am pretty happy with them - his Distributed Objects Survival Guide is the best intro book on CORBA I've ever read. Also, Peter van den Linden's Not just Java is also a good introductory book to most topics covered in Nelson's book - except for the vendor-specific subjects, of course - voyagee (sp?) et al.

I discovered them when a waiter at Gary Danko brought me a taster of Hendricks Gin in one a few years back. I immediately set out in search of the glass. Obviously, these are for drinking neat rather than on the rocks. (I tend to add a half of a small ice cube - chills it a wee bit - allows that extra bit of aroma to mingle with the liquid - works for me.)Do they enhance the flavor of scotch over other shapes of glasses? I have no idea. It's probably more marketing than anything else. I still dig 'em anyway.Just a small note: I bought these to replace a few of mine that had been broken over time. These are slightly larger than those I bought the first time around. Not by much, but noticeable. Base is slightly differently shaped. No biggie, really.

I was VERY let down. It's not that it's bad, it's just \\"there\\". I've been a big fan since \\"Speak & Spell\\" and thought Ultra was a wonderful CD from begining to end. While I have no issue with the acoustic guitars (I loved the acoutstic version of \\"Personal Jesus\\"), this just seems boring. If I heard this and they said it was any other band, I'd turn the station. As it is, I now have severe doubts about the new CD, Exciter. Also, the \\"B\\"side, \\"Easy Tiger\\". . what's up with that? Wah-wah guitars? Again, not horrible, not experimental, just kind of \\"7th grade, let's start a band\\" kind of a sound.

I have to say out of Nonphixion, Goretex has to be the sickest one. Don't get me wrong Ill Bill, Necro, and Sabbac are sick too, but Goretex reminds me of early Immortal Technique albums. There is two tracks that the chorus kills the track, but other then that the rest of the album is sick. As for the person who said it sounded too cheap and choreographed wrong, IT'S CALLED UNDERGROUND FOR A REASON! If you want weak lyrics, horrible beats but that are choreographed perfectly buy mainstream hip hop, if you want to listen to sick lyrics, dope beats and aggressive tracks. BUY THIS, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non Phixion MC's bring it","review":"I find that most of the Non Phixion MC's are dope.

If you are a Non Phixion fan, then this album is a good one to add to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"can you say studio punch in?","review":"Don't listen to the fake 5-star reviews for this disaster of an album. Goretex uses studio punch-ins for every single line and has no breath control. Worse yet, most songs are about 2 minutes long and the rest are skits that aren't amusing or original. Goretex rode the success of Ill Bill's expert emceeing on the Non-Phixion albums, but his weakness as an artist shows on this fetid solo attempt. People who gave this tripe a good review are just fanatic losers in their mom's basements who love every Psycho-Logical album released. But anyone with an IQ above 70 or even a modest degree of taste in underground hip hop should run, FAST, from this worthless excuse for a doorstop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psycho+Logical gives another solid debut","review":"In my opinion I think the album would rank third out of the Nonphixion solo albums, I think the first would be Sabac's Sabacalypse: A Change Gon Come, then after that would be Ill Bill's What's Wrong With Bill? Don't get me wrong, this album is sick. Out of all the albums that Necro has produced, Goretex has the illest beats of all. I also think that out of Nonphixion that Goretex is the most talented, and that he is one of the most gifted mc's in all of the underground scene. In a way, I was a little dissapointed, but is still worth buying the album for his ill rhymes and beats.

But frankly, this album sucks.There are maybe 2 decent songs on here (The Art of Dying and Extreme Makeover), while the rest is instantly forgettable. NEcro did a great job producing Ill Bill's album but I guess Bill got all the good tracks because the production here is lacking. As for Goretex, it sounded like he phoned his rhymes in as none of his verses stood out to me.I just don't think there's much here to warrant a purchase unless you're a hardocre Non-Phixion fan and need to complete the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"A B-ALBUM--AS IN BAD MEANING TERRIBLE","review":"WHO THE HELL ARE THESE GUYS GIVIN' THIS WASTE OF PLASTIC A 5-STAR REVIEW?IVE BEEN A NON-PHIXION FAN SINCE 2000 AND I ADMIT GORTEX HAS AN ILL FLOWUNIQUE VOICE AND HE DROPPED ILLN VERSES ON DA NON-PHIXION LP AND DA MIX-TAPES.

Well a majority of his lyrics come off as just uninspired and immature. Lets see, how to describe Gortexx... um... a less lyrical version of Necro comes to mind.So to the consumer, if you purchase this cd consider the fact that the whole album is basicly Goretexx trying to be vulgar to the point it comes off as tasteless, cliche, and phoney.

But I was most disappointed with the performance of it, the older one has a stronger signal....and you can forget about the stereo feature, it's utterly useless!!

Particulary El Perrero, who seems to be there to make Billy question what his own father would have been like if he had lived. The ending is hokey--to the extent that the Mann mansion is a home for unwed mothers.

It reads quickly and is exciting and well-paced throughout. I thought the first person narrative was well-done and was impressed by the lack of typos or errors throughout the book. I've read some of Stephen White's other books but found this one to be one of his more compelling and unconventional novels. The only caveat (which is probably a caveat with a lot of thrillers) is that parts of it seemed a bit farfetched (i.e., you had to have a healthy suspension of disbelief at times...didn't bother me too much though...) Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It started out good....","review":"........then got boring as hell. Until now, I've enjoyed all of Stephen White's books. He really got carried away with tedium and outrageousness with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not half bad...","review":"This is my first book by White and I have to say I wasn't terribly impressed. The premise was good, but the story seemed to meander in attempts to make various statements on life and death, sucking the suspense out of it for me. It must be said that I love a faster-paced read that keeps one guessing. Readers who enjoy a lot of detail and backstory, who are able to embrace the tedium of this book, might have a different take. To sum it up, after reading the last two chapters, I just felt, 'eh'. White is obviously a talented writer, this book just wasn't the right fit for someone looking for words to fly off the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and only by this author","review":"It's strange that I never started this series, living in Colorado, and reading many other local authors. Now that I have read this, I won't be reading others in the series. For 3/4 of the book, the main character, very wealthy, self-involved and completely unlikeable, flies here, flies there, talks about me, me, me, and arranges his own death if he should fall ill. He talks alot about his wife and children, but doesn't spend much time with them. I kept wondering why on earth, Thea, the wife, stayed with the jerk. There wasn't much substance to the story and it was difficult to pick up the book and keep going. Then the last 1/4 of the book got interesting. He was ill, very ill, and the consequences of his death decision becomes very real. Even with the story picking up somewhat at this point, it wasn't enough for me to root for whatshisname, and in the end, it was quite predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and the concept was VERY interesting. I would give this book 3.5 stars though, because although it held my interst I did often find myself \\"skimming\\" to discover the action.

If you enjoy this genre this book is a good place to spend some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite White novel so far!!!","review":"As an avid Stephen White reader, I still find each book better than the last. In Kill Me, Alan Gregory is a minor player in a twisting story of a man literally running for his life. It's a well-woven tale and one I highly recommend to those who are already familiar with White's running characters, and as a stand alone novel that would please any one who loves a great story. Thanks again Mr. White, for a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Satisfying Novel","review":"I have read all of the books in this series and Stephen White has really grown as a writer. As a therapist, I very much appreciate his focus more on the process and problems involved with therapy than on the mystery involved in the story. I find this book not quite as good as Missing Persons, but still quite rewarding. Also, he is not afraid to stretch his literary legs and try new things. I felt the characters were well developed, the writing excellent, and the insights into the work of a therapist brilliant. I highly recommend Missing Persons, the previous entry in this series, to those interested in process, ethics, and law as it pertains to the profession."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Story","review":"I've always read this author and enjoyed the psychological angles for an informative and entertaining read. This is totally different. It's brilliant! It concerns a man who wishes to be protected from a situation where he, by accident or illnesss, is placed in a position of immobilization mentally and/or physically and rendered incapable of having any control over his life and/death. He finds that protection and although complicated, it is comforting. But then, near the irrevocable beginning of the process, he begins to change his mind. I deliberately wrote this review not having quite finished the book, so I don't know what happens but like you, I am very curious as to how it all ends.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not His Best","review":"You'll see very little of Dr. Alan Gregory in this novel because it's written in a the first person narrative of one of his patients. I wouldn't call this a thriller either, though the last quarter of the book made up for it. As another reviewer mentioned, I had very little empathy for the main character. Taking out death insurance seems quite ludicrous to me anyway. Three quarters of the book is basically psychological drama. Even after I was over halfway through I still thought about putting the book down not knowing if it was worth finishing. I'm glad I kept reading though. The first 200 pages layed the foundation for the last 200, which was where the action and suspense was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept but who edited this?","review":"I can't give much of a review of the story as I did not make it past the first 4 pages. I would not bother entering an opinion here except that I seem to be the only one not taken with the writing style, which is what halted my plan to read this book. Was there an editor? Within the first four pages, the author uses far, far too many metaphors in so little space to refer to the car that the main character is driving --including \\"an old lover,\\" \\"my wheeled love,\\" \\"the German girl with the perfect body and the motor to match,\\" the girl from Stuttgart,\\" and \\"my girl.\\" This is in just 4 pages.So my advice is that if cutesy, wordy writing appeals to you, then by all means try this book--the other reviewers seemed to like it (and one even referred to it as being well-written). If you prefer the sharp, concise, far less frilly style of, say, James Patterson, you might want to pass on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a ZERO star option?","review":"I have loved the Alan Gregory series up to this point.....this isn't really an Alan Gregory book. He appears for only a few short pages. This book was outrageous and so far over the top that I had to force myself to complete it just to see how it ended. Not that I cared but I had paid for it and wanted to complete it. I know Stephen White can do better. If you have read only this book and did not like it do not let that deter you from purchasing other Alan Gregory books by Mr. White. They are usually a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a change of pace!!","review":"This was entertaining as heck just because I've never read anything like it. Not even close.

Great Book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Stephen White read","review":"The review for this title encouraged me to read it.Having never read this author before I was a bit skeptical about the subject: suicide/cowardice/euthanasiaThe first 50 pages sets the stage. Then you are grabbed and pulled along like a tumbleweed for a fast, last ride in the life of an \\"anonymous rich white guy\\". It isn't until you have finished that you realize that you don't even know the name of the main character! The variety of twists and turns keeps you on edge and makes for an enjoyable read. This would make a great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Disappointed","review":"I have read all of Stephen White's books and I am grossly disappointed with this book.First of all, if you're looking for Dr. Gregory--DO NOT READ THIS BOOK--he has a minor role in it. In fact, his role is more distracting than anything.Second, the story is too farfetched and isn't believable-even when you suspend your own beliefs.I'm surprised at how high the book is rated on Amazon, it's not one of White's better stories. I suggest you pay close attention to the comments posted on Amazon and make your own judgements, most are accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This was a real disappointment...I have really enjoyed previous novels by this author but this one was a waste...a arrogant guy giving us the lessons of life. Yuk. What has happened to White? I bought this book thinking I would have a story of Alan Gregory and ended up reading about a rich guy worrying about death. Give me a break. A silly, completely unrealistic story. I know most mysteries are a little to the side of reality but this one overdid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just average - had expected more","review":"Title and cover text promised more than the book contained. Author expects you to get through boring shrink sessions, where narrator for no reason choses not to reveal anything, not even what you already know from title and cover text. If you manage to get past this point, about 200 pages, it gets quite interesting, and a real page turner, two stars of five for that. To me as a European, it appears to base on lots of unreflected US American stereotype perceptions about ethics, sex and moral codes, which might be what US readers want, but left me somewhat disappointed. For those who seek an alternative, similar action, shrink and chase involved, check out The Analyst by Katzenbach.The Analyst"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read...","review":"I've read all of Mr. White's previous books and enjoyed them. Sadly, I can't say the same for this book.In order to want to know what happens to the main character in a book, you have to care about that person. The rich, bored, cheating-on-his-wife guy in Kill Me wasn't someone I could relate to or even care about, so I didn't care what happened to him even though I gamely struggled thru the entire book.I hope for a better next effort from Mr. White."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting idea gone wrong","review":"A person may be mistaken in thinking that the words \\"Kill Me\\" on the front cover of this book refer to the title. In fact these are the words (along with \\"please\\" and \\"now\\") that every reader of this book will be screaming by the time they reach page 300.The problem here is that we have a writer with a reasonably good (not great) premise for a book. But by the time he finished the first two thirds, he realized he had nowhere to go with it. What happens is that the plot becomes so preposterous that your disbelief not only must be suspended, it must be tied up, gagged and tossed in a closet.I have read other Steven White books that were pretty good. This is not one of them. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad, dissappointing purchase","review":"This was a sad, dissappointing purchase. From the description, I expected that this would illustrate how to integrate Crystal into reporting applications. While a cursory attempt was made at showing you how the most very basic integration could be accomplished, this title sorely lacked detailed, useful information that could be applied to real-world applications. In addition, it rambled on about material not even related to report integration and was definitely NOT worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives Alternatives to Enterprise........","review":"This book could have had better examples and more screen shots but what I liked about it is that it gave alternative solutions to web enabling reports. Visual Basic and Active Server Page alternatives can save my company a lot of money over the Enterprise solution that Crystal presently offers. I do like the point and click options of Enterprise too. What I liked about this book is that it doesn't limit you to one option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my 6 year old.","review":"Just what I was looking for.

The revenge stories are borken down into easy categories, like \\"Jilted Lovers\\" where you can read about the man who copied photos of his adulterous girlfriend, and stuck them all around London with a sign saying \\"Have you seen this Dog?\\". These chapters are punctuated with quotes about revenge, such as the Ancient Chinese Proverb: \\"If you're in the business of revenge, dig two graves\\".A must buy for anyone looking for a good laugh: It's still circulating around all my friends, as they all want to read or re-read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!","review":"I am a celiac and I loved this book.

The set includes TWO of each of the following taps: M1, M1.1, M1.2, M1.4, M1.6, M1.8, M2, M2.2, M2.5. It also includes a die to match each tap size and two small tap holders that fits into that handle which I normally associate with dies.My only complaint is that these taps are so small that magnifacation is required in order to read the etched markings on each tap.

The following 300 or so pages are devoted to chronicling, among other things, their sexual fantasies, the relative merits of Blur and some other Brit pop band whose name now escapes me, and day-time TV soap opera obsessions; and that's it basically.

I may have been inclined to do that - - the writing and ideas in this book are, on the whole, good. But I'm not going to, because I just don't feel like being jerked around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"This book is poorly edited and boring. At one point when the authors have nothing else to say they waste my time commenting about the amount of grass under pine needles. If you are determined to read this mess then do what I ended up doing...read only the first sentence of every paragraph. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mixed review","review":"On the one hand, this book was certainly a page-turner. It started quickly, it kept me wondering what wha going on (even though the cover of the book and the summary ruins it for you) and it presents some interesting slices of life. The characters are not the young, superhuman, heroic type, and they had some depth to them.On the other hand, it does seem to be a total set-up for a movie and computer game. Furthermore, the plot is a mix of Asimov's \\"Nightfall\\" and \\"Independence Day.\\" Basically, it was not contemplative and artistic Sci-Fi like \\"Dune\\" or Asimov's works, but rather it was more \\"trashy.\\"Still, if you're going to be taking a long plane ride somewhere, this is a good book to take with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainint and quick read.","review":"The Tenth Planet was a good read.

For starters, the book was a great read, and second, it says right on the inside cover that two follow-up books are in the process of being written. I think this world is filling up with way too many people who don't think before they speak. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, faulty execution","review":"The Tenth Planet is the first of a trilogy of books (Tenth Planet: Oblivion & Tenth Planet: Final Assault) that appears to have been written as a tie-in to a video game. The first book is a good light read that raises some interesting plot threads that unfortunately are not followed through with books 2 and 3. It seems as if most of the effort for this series was placed in book one and rest of the series is uninteresting filler written to fulfill the book contact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"The Tenth Planet was an excellent book with an exciting plot, interesting characters, and a creative story.

I got online and did some searching for the specs of the VHS version and it turns out that this DVD version has some 14 minutes of footage removed. The original movie is 106 minutes and this DVD is 92 minutes (NOT 106 minutes like it says on this website). It even has printed on the DVD box that it has an R rating. The movie as it is on this DVD could easily get a PG-13 rating or maybe pass as a PG rated film. If you are in fact looking for a heavily cleaned up version of this film, this release might be your ticket. But, if you think by ordering this you're getting the R rated thriller that you remember, think again, this DVD edition is the watered down TV edit."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLATINUM frauded us and sold us the edited tv version","review":"Wow i am so disapointed with the dvd release that's 92 minutes it really took away from the original vhs version that was 104 minutes long!

After a couple hours I started to smell a little burning smell, you know a burning wire smell. Also I noticed that the coffee was not hot enough. I had to put it in the micro after I put in my cream. Tried to live with it a week or so but no, it's pricy and Bunns are better than that. This was obviously just a defect, it happens in mass production. So I did a return to Amazon. No problems , I sent it back got credit and now looking for another. AMAZON ROCKS. They even covered the postage on the way back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Bunn!","review":"I love my Bunn!

Other than that I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK compared to others","review":"Our last BUNN lasted 16 years. Although this product is superior to what is available now it certainly is not what was replaced. If you have your original coffee pot and coffee filter holder, I would use them with this product and throw away what is sent with the coffee maker. The coffee pot sent with the coffee maker is horrible, and the filter holder is barely recognizable as a BUNN product. Without substituting products from my original BUNN coffee maker, this purchase would have been useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUNN ADDICT","review":"Over the past 25 years I have owned 3 of this same Bunn coffee maker. I love having my coffee within seconds and it makes the greatest coffee. I like the glass carafe since you can see how much coffee is left. The thermal one I gues are good but you can not tell how much you have in the pot. When I went searching for a replacement (they do eventually leak) there was nothing that appealed to me and I kept coming back to my Bunn.

Quick, yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overflow of grounds","review":"I was anxiously brewing my first pot of coffee with my new Bunn only to find that the grinds were overflowing the brew funnel. According to the manual, use of decaffeinated, fine grid coffee and/or softened water may cause an overflow of grounds into your decanter. I have ordered a flow restrictor sprayhead free of charge but now have to wait for it to arrive before I can again try to get my first Bunn pot of decaffeinated coffee. Not a good first impression.Edit - The flow restrictor arrived promptly and after an easy swap out the Bunn is brewing as it should. Would rate product as 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for home use","review":"If you are looking to purchase a machine for home use this is not the right one. The controls are designed for at least daily use. Unplugging the machine when out of town or turning off the \\"vacation switch\\" leads to unexpected results - you never know if the coffee maker will brew hot coffee. Second, the water fill area must remain up when not in use otherwise the machine will turn on. This does not work well as the machine will no longer fit under a cabinet with the lid up.I have tried this machine for about 45 days and still do not know what to expect, despite reading directions several times. It would be great to return the machine but it is too late by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hot enough","review":"I bought this to replace an older Bunn which I loved, but was accidentally ruined by my wife. However, the new model does not heat the water hot enough. I performed several tests and the water conistently comes out at 180 degrees. This is below Bunn's stated temperature of 190. Ten degrees may not sound like much, but it makes a big difference.I usually put a pot of coffee in a thermos after it is brewed. Since the Bunn's brewing temperature is so low, the coffee does not stay warm for very long. I believe that a good coffee maker should heat the water a little above 190 so that the coffee comes out hot.I believe other reviewers have had the same complaint. I sure wish Bunn would go back to their old design. I think this is going to be the last Bunn I will purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the Bunn","review":"I'm a BIG coffee drinker and I thought the Bunn would be a coffee lover's delight. It turned out to be my biggest nightmare. It takes a lot to set it up and get it started. If you make a mistake and close the cover before you have the pot in place, boy what a mess. It leaked out the bottom and was VERY large and heavy. Took up way to much room on my counter. I dumped it after one week and bought a Farberware coffee maker and it is just as good, if not better.

Windows Movie Maker worked fine, but at times dropped frames, where as with PSPremier there have been no problems. My guess on this difference is the settings of the software?

On top of it they used an unusually small power jack so you're unlikely to find an adaptor with the right plug.Fight the man!

While both mortals are attractive and healthy, the situation is rather complex. Phaidra is a commoner, and rather independent. Kain is a rouge, and does not believe in love, or that he should be happy. However, Phaidra has perfected an unusual dye that could make the earl a fortune. Marrying her would fit within his strict guidelines that do not have room for joy or love. Yet, Phaidra believes in love and magic. How can the fairies make these two fall in love? Read it and learn.** Allegro and Largo are winsome facilitators. Phaidra has the hoyden air of a Katherine Hepburn or Julia Roberts heroine, and Kain mixes the tortured hero with the bad boy gentleman character. If you enjoy a Regency with an unusual twist, this will suit you well. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buy","review":"Wonderful purchase!

My only disappointment is that it doesn't control the volume.

But, there is a major design flaw as far as I'm concerned. When you cook something with lots of grease (e.g. bacon), the grease just runs off the sides through the holes (visible in the picture) into the body of the grill with the burners are. It then ignites creating a turbo cook mode! I was able to turn the gas off completely and cook the entire meal off bacon fat. As 'green-friendly' as this maybe, I really didn't care for the approach. What a MESS to clean up!If you only plan to cook eggs or panacakes, it works fine. Just make sure you have it PERFECTLY level. I lost an entire egg through one of the side holes due to a little slant.

The second machine was just as problematic, slow and missed fax copy. The last resort came when the machine light indicator decided it was out of paper when it had paper, was replaced with new paper and never worked again. I also have to add that this machine was lightly used, perhaps a dozen fax copies a week.

Instead, you get an album that, while 'precise' and well-produced, lacks any edge you might expect from such a combo.

Gee, I think I got that idea out of Better Homes and Gardens or House Beautiful, like, ten years ago!) The settings look fussy, busy, cluttery, and old ladyish.

The authors assume an incredible amount of background knowledge on behalf of the reader, in fact the book is more a review of this assumed knowledge rather than a tutorial or exposition of the topics. Equations and symbolic logic are incorporated needlessly to explain many simple concepts, but when applied to complex topics, these same rigorous techniques are given no supporting explanation. If you can follow the non-explanations the authors provide, you likely have already mastered this subject area and don't need to read this book at all. If you are new to the field, you will be stumped by the shallow coverage of complex theory, and this is even for people with graduate level computer science or mathematics.

The lens used, where one chooses to point it, the depth of field chosen, the film used, how digital files are processed, and as you say, \\"cropping,\\" are all subjective interpretations. The only way to purely record nature's beauty is to look at and remember it. The moment it is recorded by an instrument by a human being, the image becomes subjective and interpretive and its purity is gone. It's the nature of the process.And it is a fact that the quality of cameras and lenses used directly affect the quality of the file.

I still have the oportunity to return the PV and did it. I bought a PVx and I don't go out without it.

For the everyday person it's more than enough. I didn't buy it to play games with - I bought it to stay organized. The extreme ease of use is wonderful and syncing to your PC is a breeze. Anybody that needs more than this needs a handheld PC (Which have their own combersome problems!) I have found the OS platform with the Palm V much easier to sync with my desktop - especially with WindowsNT. Too many problems connecting with WindowsCE. The Palm V has far exceeded my needs and is perfect for the everyday user looking for a palm organizer that is just that, an organizer and 24hr assistant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irreplaceable rechargeable battery wears out after 3 years.","review":"My Palm V is about 3 years old and the battery stopped recharging. When I called Palm tech-support they were unhelpful and said that I should try resetting the unit. I was told that in order to find out why the unit was not recharging, I should pay $25 to find out what the problem is, or send the unit in for $100 to repair it (hardly worth it when you consider the price of a new unit). Unfortunately, the battery is factory installed and cannot be replaced (except by Palm.) This is either built-in obsolence or sloppy quality control.

The conventional wisdom said that if you want a PDA, get a Palm V. At first I was excited but then saw that you could only do a few essential items and the screen was impossible to see. Also, the buttons always get mashed when it sits in your suit jacket so that the battery gets wasted. When I saw a friend's CE based PDA with full color and multimedia, I started surfing for one of those.

It included the deadline for a project, that I never recieved, thus I did not make the deadline and was fired! I was completely disorganized for weeks while I tried to get a hold of everything I lost. I think that the people who named this combobulation machine an organizer should read the english dictionary. An Organizer is one that organizes, not one the disorganizer, and deletes my e-mail!

Until Lord Alexander entered the scene you wouldn't have known the story involved vampires at all. Most of the characters are decidedly human-acting, which is not a problem if you're trying to make a realistic character...but come on, this book is about VAMPIRES - the non-realism is already established with the very genre.Also, the main character of Rosamund is unfortunately simpering and weepy - not at all what I was hoping for when I think of a seductive Toreador courtier.

In the beginning of the book, the author himself admitted that Murray's management would not cooperate in the writing of a biography.

What do physical unions between two women have to do with the life of Christ and Mary Magdalene? I've read and loved the Conversations with God books.

The hate he harbors for gay people was readily apparent in his words. I'm a straight woman so his rant wasn't directed at me, and I'm not easily offended by personal opinions that differ from mine, but I found the author's blatant hostility toward homosexuals SO ridiculously hateful that I lost interest in reading any more of the book.

It's amazing that these bands are mostly unsigned, amateur musicians.

I can confirm other reviewers' opinion of its very clear sound quality and nice looking built. Beyond that I want to say that it's very discriminating to the nature of its source material: good recordings sound fabulous while poorly mixed ones sound intolerably muddy. Several shortcomings nevertheless are present: limited A/V connectivity with only 2 video inputs; a merely moderate current output--perhaps not enough to drive large speakers or low-impedence ones well; somewhat flimsy connectors on back panel requiring careful pluggings and unpluggings. But these reservations are secondary for me given its nice balance of costs and benefits. If you want quality more than newest technology (DTS etc.) this is definitely worthy a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"still sterling after 2 years","review":"It would be nice if I could decode the latest digital video standards, but that's about it on complaints. Considering the extremely reasonable price, this is simply the best receiver I've ever had.It offers astonishingly clear sound (with my 5 ohm Magneplaners and a/d/s/ sub), plus plenty of inputs and outputs, and all around versatility. Simply superb. Even more importantly, whenever I want to do something, I just reach for the analogue buttons and dials and it happens. No perusing the manual. Try that with a Yamaha or Denon.Note: this receiver is no longer produced. However, the current Nakamichi AV-7 is almost identical (but with more video inputs), and the AV-8 and AV-10 combine extra features (like a built-in crossover and DTS decoding) with the same amazing usability.The best receiver-family going.

The only major difference is in this game you have to raise your own meat, fruits, and vegetables for food and create your own water supply. Do zoos really do this? It just seems like busy-work to make an already mediocre game even less fun.

Even the beginning one started with a really nice little piece right up front. It certainly wasn't easy, even from the start, but well worth it.

All of the tracks on this album run at the same slow pace, there is not even a single up-tempo tune to act like a mild dose of caffeine amidst the sleepiness.He seems like a decent guitar player, and I know he does have potential, but the subject matter just makes the whole thing rather empty and uninteresting to me.

What I can't figure out is why it works perfectly at home, but is very sporadic on the trail. On a recent weeklong backpacking trip in Utah three of us had these along and all experienced the same problem. It would only work correctly about 25% of the time - meaning that the light would successfully stay on for the required amount of time. The other 75% of the time we would all get the red failure light. I can assure you this was not operator error. It would often take three or four tries of having the light on in order to get it to work.

We waited until later in the day when the batteries were warmer - no improvement. The suggestion made in a comment to another reviewer that water from snowmelt is too pure and he should have added salt is interesting, but if that is the case, there should be a warning in large red letters on the instructions. If you are bringing a water purifier, you need it to be reliable.

I have mostly hardwood floors with a couple of area rugs, and it seemed to do well on both surfaces. I look forward to using this sweeper every day to keep the floor clean between vacuumings.The only con I can see so far is that other reviewers are absolutely right about the handle not staying together. It fell apart almost every time I tried to pick the sweeper up off the floor by the handle.

Can't pick up dirt very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The sweeper is so-so at picking up on carpet and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure on hard floors. Dirt that has been swept up frequently redeposits on the floor, even with frequent emptying. The worst part is the handle. There are no fasteners of any sort to hold the pole segments together. Consequently the handle is constantly separating while in use. I hate this thing. I'm especially disappointed because I expected far better quality from Bissell. If possible I would rate this sweeper with zero stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design","review":"This product was easy to set up but, is very flimsy. We have dark carpet and I just wanted something to quick pick up the light colored bits that seem to appear out of nowhere. This product picks up almost nothing easily on the carpet.By the time I go over it again and again I might as well get out the vacuum. I gave it one star instead of none because it does pick up the hair in my bathroom on the hard floor. I would not recommend this purchase for carpets."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs a better handle!","review":"I can't agree more with the review that said the handle was awful. It works just fine for a brush sweeper - if you can actually get it to go back and forth a couple times without the sweeper pushed away from you and the detached handle in your hand. I actually like the idea of hot glueing the handle and think I will try that on mine. Maybe it will be more useful to me"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea in theory; cheap handle broke the deal for me","review":"I was so excited about ordering this (sad, I know!). I liked the idea that this vac was human-powered, and that it would allow me to do quick clean-ups between regular vacuuming.I was disappointed at how cheap the handle was, and how easily it came apart. Basically, in order to ship the thing in a small box, the handle comes in 3 pieces. You have to put them together -- the round tubes just \\"slide\\" into each other. Unfortunately the pieces are not threaded, and don't stay together terribly well. If I had a really old vac that needed to be held together with duct tape, that's one thing. However, I'm not keen on having to duct tape brand new things.The pickup was okay, but not great. After a few passes, there was still dirt on my tile floor. It occured to me that I had not found the magic vac of my dreams, so I ended up sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you follow the instructions, the handle is fine","review":"I read all the reviews about the handle, gulped, and said, ok, let's try it. Maybe they've improved the handle in the past year, but I've had absolutely no problems with our sweeper. Like a previous poster, I followed the instructions about banging the handle on the floor to seat it properly. The handle also screws on to the sweeper and so I've also never had any problems with the sweeper falling off the handle.As long as you understand that it doesn't have suction, but merely sweeps the surface stuff off your carpet, it does a great job. I love it because it's much lighter and quieter than our vacuum cleaner, which means that I'm more likely to actually use the thing every day. I also like the fact that it runs on \\"human power\\" instead of electricity. It won't replace your vacuum cleaner, but it makes a darn good adjunct for everyday messes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like grandma used to have...","review":"I have found this to be a great inbetween vacuumings tool for quick pickup. We have a cat, but she does not shed enough for me to comment on how well this picks up fur.It seems pretty sturdy, and by pounding the handle together before screwing it on, I have avoided the fall-apart problems that other customers have identified.We are satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This sweeper underperformed. I tried it on my carpet and it didn't pick up much of anything not even scraps of paper. I bought this precisely so I wouldn't have to pull out the vacuum but this does not do the trick. I will be returning it. Waste of money...for me anyway.Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad design","review":"This product falls apart every time it's used. I ended up taping the telescoped handle together to prevent this, but the place where the handle meets the sweeper could not be taped and it falls off every time! The worst is when it's carried from place to place and the sweeper head come crashing down onto the floor pretty hard. This type of action can cause dents in wood floors, cracks in ceramic tiles, or damage to feet. I definitely would not recommend buying this product. I should have gotten my $ back right away, but I thought the pieces would come to fit better after some use, but it only got worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bissell 2680 perfect sweep dual brush sweeper \\"-(","review":"Bought this hand sweeper to use between vacuuming because we have pets.

It picks it all up! No longer do I have to drag out the 12.5 amp Kenmore when the kids drop crumbs on the floor. We have low pile carpet and linoleum and the Bissell works great on both. It fills up fairly quickly if you have a mess to clean, but it only takes a few seconds to empty the machine.My mom had a similar machine 40 years ago and I can see the improvements Bissell has made over the years with dual rotating brushes. Also, I can use it when everyone is sleeping as it makes no noise compared with my old handheld Boss Stick handheld vaccuum. The Boss died and when I tried to find a battery for it, I found it would almost cost the same to replace it. So I checked around for a cleaner without battery or electric power and I found it with the Bissell.I recommend the Bissell to everyone who does not have High Pile carpet. It works well on low carpet and bare floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE HANDLE DESIGN RUINS PRODUCT","review":"The handle for the Bissel Sweeper is made of 3 parts that you push together and come apart everytime you pick the sweeper up. Even a cheap $13 sweeper at Target has a screw-together handle. But neither Bissel, nor Amazon, apparently tried this product out before they made it and sold it. It's practically a crime to advertise you can save space by hanging this sweeper up -- since each time you pick it up the large metal head separates from the handle and crashes right on the floor (leaving dents in wood) or on your foot (and making you curse at it). Should be a ZERO star product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This sweeper neither works on carpeting, rugs or bare floors. It is a complete waste of money.

They work fine on a low carpet - not very well on a hard floor. Your time is better spent with a broom and a dustpan. One strong WARNING: the handles have no way of keeping themselves together so every time you push, the base goes flying across the room. Unless you are willing to invest some time and energy in going to the hardware store for a couple of self-tapping screws and drilling some pilot holes to secure the handle, then don't even bother. This sweeper is an exercise in frustration at best. Don't let the name fool you, the \\"Bissell 2680 PERFECT Sweep\\" is anything BUT \\"perfect.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it should","review":"It's a carpet sweeper. It does what it should. Picks up the little stuff that ends up on the carpet in between \\"real\\" vacuuming. It doesn't require multiple swipes, picks up forward and backward, and the handle stays nicely upright in the closet. We use it at the office, so we can keep our reception area tidy throughout the day, or when a rainy day means more stuff is getting tracked in, without making noise or calling attention to our housekeeping!

I only chose the free shipping method which states it could take 5-7 additional days. It was also very easy to put together, no tools necessary.The only reason I did not give this item 5 stars is because my daughter finds it difficult to stretch the elastic bands over her stuffed toys heads. (small and medium sized toys) I have to help her take them on and off, so it can be a little inconvenient at times. Maybe after using it for a few more weeks it will be easier for her.

We have bought chains, hanging bins, or hammocks, but our kids couldn't access their toys from the ceiling! This puts all their stuffed animals on ground level, with easy elastic loops to which they can attach their stuffed animals. It is perfect for medium-sized stuffed animals (large ones may have to use a single arm, and small ones may have to go two to a loop) and easy enough for young children to understand and use. It also takes up far less room than I thought it would. I was shocked at how many stuffed animals fit on it, and it ends up looking like a Christmas tree.

This renders Yoga a life-affirming and positive philosophy and practice as opposed to Feuerstein's thesis that it is inherently aimed at the destruction of the whole human being who practises it. The translation in this book is still great, but for explanation of the meaning, look somewhere else, e.g. Whicher's \\"The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Sound","review":"This unit can't be beat..great sound & great price.

It was unimous that this movie while pretending to be a re-creation of historical events, often strayed from historical facts in its effort to paint a very extreem picture of the Mormon Church. If you like bashing churches you will like the movie. If you like historical accuracy, a good plot and good acting, you will not find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A play on ignorance fueled by ignorance","review":"Even if this movie was historically accurate, and it was by no means accurate, it still goes down as badly made movie. They make the Mormons look like Jihadist and the Fancher party look like angels. The Mountain Meadows Massacre has been a sore spot for the Mormons for a long time. This movie plays on ignorant beliefs about the Mormons. Three wives for every man, avenging the blood of Joseph Smith, switching wives, and so on. Those are all myths about the Mormons that just aren't true. So wading through all the attempts to make the Mormons look bad we get a lame love story and a historically inaccurate depiction of one of the most shameful things done in history. Its really not worth buying. But if you want to watch it just watch it with a whole barrel full of salt and for heavens sake don't take this as a accurate depiction. Wikipedia does better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting reviews of a religion","review":"Most of the reviewers here are reviewing a religion, not a Hollywood movie. How about reviewing the movie, the script, the directing, the acting, you know, stuff like that. And who in the world with a modicum of intelligence or common sense would expect accurate history to come from Hollywood? Hollywood is a business that focuses on making money for those in the industry and profit for the shareholders; that's it. Even the best historical scripts are \\"based on\\" something historical, and as such are mostly fictionalized so as to be entertaining above all else. Can the reviewers just stick to reviewing movies and not people's faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"Great movie. The writers may have taken some liberties with the historical facts as so much of what was in the movie was never proven, but it did tell the story of a significant American tragedy that most people do not know about."},{"rating":"2","title":"September Dawn - a real tragedy","review":"This was very well done. I really felt anger towards the Morman's.It was such a waste of life especially the slaughtering of allthose innocent children. There was just no excuse for thisbehavior. The acting was very good. I can understand why theMorman church does not want this film to be shown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative drama. Great depiction of an historical event. So sad the tragedy. Frightening to know this evil deed occurred.","review":"The events portrayed were reminders that those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. People seeking truth in religion fail to recognize that truth is in your own heart. The Mormon bible depicts those truths that only were true to one man, Joseph Smith, not mankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be","review":"I like movies based on actual historical events, so was looking forward to September Dawn. I was let down. Not sure exactly what, but something was missing from this movie. Maybe it's the fact too much time was spent on the fictional love story. This movie barely held my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Historical Perspective","review":"This film offered an interesting, fact-based perspective on the westward expansion, as well as the inherent secretiveness of the Mormon cult. It was well researched and performed. Even if you're like my husband, a mere \\"cowboys and Indians\\" genre fan, you will find this film an interesting adventure, and you'll pick up a history lesson as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"September Dawn","review":"I found this movie quite accurate in it's depiction of historial events as my great-grandfather was one of only 17 children that survived the massacre of 120 others in Utah by the Mormans on September 11, 1857."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to my intellect","review":"This movie cannot be called good on cinematic or historical grounds. If you watch this and take what they are portraying as true than do I have something to sell to you. Can't everyone see through this movie? While the atrocities are based on actual event the movie does not portray them in an accurate or fair manner. It is a diatribe and insulting to my intellect."},{"rating":"1","title":"The PAST as judged by the PRESENT","review":"The film takes the anti-Mormon historical accounts of the event as fact. Again, modern Americans use a cinematic event to judge and condemn people of former times with current attitudes. This gives modern Americans the opportunity to feel righteous indignation against other people. YES the event did happen. Did Brigham Young order it or did John D. Lee commit the massacre on his own? Since we can only read what is written by observers of the times we will never know. This will not stop modern bigots who were not there in 1857 from using this film to condemn the Mormon Church of today. Anything to be offended. It provides these hypocrites the same self-satisfaction that Krystalnacht provided the Nazis."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"I like J. Voight and after reading what the film was about, I wanted to see how it would compare with the early writings of Joe Smith and B. Young. It goes side by side with their writings, right down to the band of day-nights that rode the trails committing these acts. Great movie based on true events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie review","review":"DVD came if find shape.Movie was very violent, but unfortunately mostly true. Morman church still makes excuses and cover ups for their brutality today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, But No Cigar","review":"I was slightly offended that the product discription said that it is uncertain whether or not Mormons participated in the massacre at Mountain Meadows. Modern historians do not have any doubt whether or not Mormons participated, there are documented confessions and witness accounts from some of the surviving children. The real standing question is just how aware and supporting was Brigham Young of the massacre. For more information, look up the work done on the subject by Will Bagley or Juanita BrooksI was really excited that someone was willing to address the massacre at mountain meadows in a movie, but unfortunately this one is not historically accurate. I mean, come on! You could at least have John D. Lee as one of the main characters! This movie fell short of my expectations, though I think the subject is powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"WITHOUT QUESTION THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN","review":"I cannot believe that Jon Voight would consent to be in this horribly written, directed, and acted in movie. I must conclude that he and the other actors were blackmailed into doing so. The bigotry against Mormons and the false facts in it are an insult not just to Mormons but to anyone viewing the movie represented as a historic. Do not buy or rent this movie. It is a waste of time and money and it would only encourage the producers and director make more of this type of filth!!

Creating movies based on highly manipulated facts, stretched theories, and very bias opinions just to attack a group of people. Folks, this movie is fiction. Anyone trying to tell you there are facts here is just lying. Historians still debate on what happened, and most accept this as a small group of extremists who were already on edge from being driven out of the United States by bigoted government leaders who went off the deep end. It was not ordered by any church leader and the timing of knowing this group was on the way, getting that information to Salt Lake, then back to the group with hit orders.... There were no cellphones or internet, folks.And all that aside, ask the real question..... WHY would Mormons go killing a group of people for the fun of it?

The longer it takes to get them out, the more distorted they become. The 'MORMONS' want you to believe it is all a falacy, but offered no assistance to investigators at the time, thus they have to depend on literary license of the story teller. The harder you try to cover it up, the more extreme the speculation. This story is one possible side. As long as it is denied, or blown off, the more likely people are to believe it is true.

But, After 2 months of use, it lost some air, and I reinflated it. Unfortunately, I guess the plug area isn't made of good material. It has leak around the plug. Now, the equipment is sitting outside after 2 months of use..., or not even 2 months. I would not recommend this item for anyone to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item! I LOVE IT!","review":"This ball is amazing. You can do so many things with it. I severely broke my ankle a couple years ago and unfortunately never fully healed.

Well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout and useful for balancing","review":"The day after buying the Bosu and using once, it lost a lot of air.

After about an hour, the inflated half ball came out of the plastic rim, and as another reviewer stated there is no way this is going to go back in securely - even if the ball was deflated and the rim was taken apart. There is a horrible smelly chemical residue on the rim and it seems that it wasn't glued correctly or perhaps the inflatable plastic part isn't made correctly. It looks uneven and lopsided around the edges which explains why it popped from the rim. What an expensive disappointment!!!! That said, the workout was really enjoyable and I could definitely see how it would be fun + beneficial.

It was simple enough to inflate and I have been using it regularly. The Bosu came with an instructional DVD that has 4 different workouts. For the workout I was most interested in, Abs, the DVD is all scratched and skipping. Possibly it's my DVD player? I haven't investigated enough, but all 3 other workout sections on the disc, work. So I'm kinda disappointed in that regard. I keep picking up hints and tips from the fitness mags I read though, so I will get the hang of it eventually. It's harder than I thought! Which is a good thing. It amazes me that so many people don't even know what a Bosu is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Balance that Core","review":"I used this item at the gym and loved it. It really makes you focus, and I found that it wasn't that hard to keep my balance as well as also doing squats, tossing a medicine ball or lifting weights.

Due to a fused ankle and some muscle loss in my lower legs, balance is an important element for me to work on. I find the Bosu is great for a lot of different balance and core exercises. I would say that some of the recommended exercises in the book and video are a bit of a stretch, since you don't need a Bosu to do them effectively, but it is still a good addition to a home gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't hold air","review":"After about three months it lost it's air. It will not hold the air after pumping. Not worth $100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same as gym quality","review":"The big thing with the BOSU balls is that the \\"ball\\" portion be made from a durable material.

It has not needed to be re-filled with air in that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This is a very similar product to the BOSU ball I use at the gym. It was fairly easy to set up. The only problem is removing the plug on the bottom if you need to add air. I ended up using a plastic tick removal tool to pry the plug off without damaging it. I have been very pleased with my BOSU ball. It has stayed inflated for several months now without any noticeable air leakage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold air for very long","review":"This is a great exercise tool, unfortunately, it won't hold the air for more than one session. I have to re-inflate it every time I use it. And the cheap plastic pump falls apart. I'm using a electric pump now since I have to fill it up every time I use it. For the money it's not worth the effort. The quality of the product is very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bosu Seperates from Base - Revised","review":"Amazon replaced the item without question (Thank you Amazon), and the new one works fine. It is a useful piece of training equipment.I did contact the Bosu company, and they told me to deflate the thing and try to reattach it. I did, and it's impossible.________________________________________Prior ReviewI inflated the product per the instructions. I then left it overnight. The next morning, the Blue Bosu part had completely detached from the base. You can't fix it on your own.From reading the various reviews, there are few others with the same problem. Quality control appears to be a problem.I will replace it, and then revise the review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with my purchase","review":"I had been using the Bosu Ball at my physical therapy appointments and absolutely loved it. I ordered one from Amazon and received it a short time later. I went to inflate it with the cheap foot pump and it kept deflating. I thought I was doing something wrong until I realized there was a big tear in the plastic right around the inflation ring. Bummer. I did not see all of the negative reviews until now and am really hesitating on buying another ball. Anybody had a good experience with the ball?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonders of Bosu","review":"The Bosu is fun!. It offers new fitness challenges - standing, bouncing, lunging, or squatting off of it requires stabilization and balance in addition to the muscle work these moves require on flat ground.

This is obviously an East or West Coast person's idea of what 'those backward Texans' are like.\\" I checked the book jacket, and sure enough the author was from the East Coast. I was not at all surprised to find user reviews from real Texans who objected to the book. The character of Myrna is so stupid that she is totally unbelievable. We are supposed to be reading Myrna's inner thoughts, but what we get is actually the excuses that she might tell someone else to explain her behavior. It doesn't really get to the heart of what a \\"follower\\" type feels on the inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah....","review":"I found the plot laughable. The characters over the top and over-exaggerated. I know, I know I may be bias being from Dallas and HP, but I truly went into to this book trying to keep an open-mind. It was a waste of my time to read it and to me it seemed that the author was trying a little too hard to make this a novelization of Mean Girls.

But this book took it to another level and completely over the top.Poorly done Ms. Pascal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely untalented writing, awful book","review":"This book was one of the worst books I've ever read, and I am a very avid reader. I am a fan of the Gossip Girl and A-List series, and this book is desperately trying to be like these series, but fails miserabley.

Everything about this book is fabricated. I also resent the reviews published by \\"iloveteenbooks\\" (or whatever) citing Highland Park as the most racist part of Dallas. I honestly think she is racist for considering Highland Park only a white, racist suberb of Dallas.

I am extremely puzzled by the way Pascal chooses to portray our area. Her main character lives in \\"the cheapest house in the area\\", which is $1.2 million, and often complains of how \\"her mother couldn't be prettier so she could have married someone richer\\".

I attended J.J. Pearce High School (after Jessica Simpson), but a considerable amount of my friends were/are Highland Park students; I can certify that the teens there definitely do not behave as those in the slanderous pages of \\"The Ruling Class.\\" Highland Park does not have a problem with cliques or exclusiveness or bullying of any kind. If anyone is excluded it is because they choose to be.

This book could have insulted Highland Park in a ton of ways that ARE accurate and I wouldn't have been insulted at all. But it didn't. It is basically Mean Girls redux, written poorly with a passing wikipedia-level research of the Dallas area around it.The description of what people wear almost made me lose it. It was absurd. If you walk by the student entrance/exit during the school day you'll see girls in Soffee shorts and a tee shirt in the fall and spring and jeans/uggs the rest of the year.

Especially after Paschal writes about somewhere she's never been before. Sure, it's a nice area, but seriously... this book is completely over the top. Anyone who wrote a good review about the book clearly didn't read it from a critical standpoint. It is not just \\"another cutesy teen book\\". Quite the contrary, in my opinion. You like dumb books?

But lacks no details. The bed of the truck. Which is supposed to be wood. Has all ther grain and planks but is painted in the same color as the truck. In real life this bed was wood. I fixed this minor problem. By painting the bed myself with Model Paint wood Brown. I do not know why the makers do not do this? as it just adds that sense of realisem to an already Excvellent Model. The Hood, Doors, Tailgate all open and close with a good tight fit. The Model gleams out at you in the light. I have contibuted some jpegs I have taken of this truck. In the description.This is a well made good weight model. One thats sure to please. And look great in any 1/18th scale collection. The Truck comes in two Colors Burgendy as seen here.

The story is about a girl from Guadeloupe who leaves her feisty, beloved grandmother to live in France with her estranged mother and stepfather. She moves to the Projects, and starts elementary school, where she excels but faces prejudice. All the while, she longs for Guadeloupe and feels isolated in France, until she meets a boy who I think is Algerian, and whose experience in some ways connects with her own.Overall, the novel is rather sad, but it's beautifully written, the dialogue is great, and it's good practice for students of French."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Content Here","review":"Pike packs in the content here.

I bought a fillet at my local grocery chain and enjoyed it greatly, but looked on Amazon for a more cost-effective approach. This salmon is from a reputable company, but I have to say I really don't like it, compared both to the smoked salmon I had in California and from my local grocery. It comes in a broth, and at first feels a little soft when I open the pack, but then when I eat it without the brine, it is actually quite dry. The smoked flavor is even a little too light for my taste. Truly, I have never cared for sockeye; I've always found it dry even when not smoked, and I pay the extra for king when buying my fresh salmon. I notice other reviewers put this salmon in dips and chowders; I think that is a good solution, but I will cancel my subscription and buy smoked salmon locally for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salmon","review":"I did not like the product at all.

Absolutely the worst smoked salmon I have ever had so far, what a waste of $30+ dollar (16oz) and a piece of salmon!On a side note, I also got 5 different flavoured 4oz \\"Echo Falls\\" smoked salmon, all tasted excellent, and pricewise, 4 pack of 4oz \\"Echo Falls\\" salmon is equal to 16oz but cost less than $30, will never buy the \\"Seabear\\" brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakdancer","review":"I thought this cd single is worth buying.

Joe McCain was a shining example of a good cop and an example of the character that can only be developed in Boston. It was interesting all the rogues he would run into that we have come to know through the case of Whitey Bulger. I don't want to give away too much about the story because I highly encourage any true crime fan to read this book. I have reccomended this book to friends and no one was disapointed.

It swings side to side, which is the way a lot of new real baby swings work, but my 3 year old's inclination is to push a swing back and forth, not side to side.This swing is inexpensive and cheap.

They really wanted to play with it because they love their baby dolls so much, but it kept falling apart. The connections at the back legs would come apart as soon as the doll would start to swing. The little items hanging from the mobile are very small and I took them away right away. This toy is a good idea, it just needs to be made a little more durable for the little people who will be using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine toy","review":"If you have a rudimentary background in putting simple things together (like pop beads or lids on tupperware), then you should be able to construct this product so that it is sturdy and realiable.

Too bad she doesn't care about it now. We love the Little Mommy things but they were off when they made this one. This toy constantly falls apart...the legs come unattached as does the actual baby seat from the holder. If u move it it falls apart, if u use it it also falls apart. The tray doesn't slide out very far so it is almost impossible to get the baby in and out and we only use the actual Little mommy doll that they claim fits easily. My now 3 year old still doesn't play with this or even ask for it. Half of it is under our bed and she is just fine with that. It looks very cute but that is about it. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"This toy is terrible. We have alot of the Little Mommy toys and for the price they are all great except for this swing. This is a piece of junk. The swing comes apart when you try to get the doll in and out. The dolls don't go in easily and it swings from side to side and not back to front as my 2 year old thinks it should. I got so sick of putting it back together that I threw it out while she was napping a few weeks ago and she hasn't missed it.

Too hard to take dolls in and out of (even the Little Mommy dolls made to go with it) and its not made very well either, the plastic is flimsy, the top of the swing kept popping off the legs and it would collapse, we just ended up trashing it.

A chamber piece almost entirely on a smallish sailboat between three characters. Most dynamic parts of the movie are the shots, close-ups, camera angles, which do compare favorably with Citizen Kane. There isn't hardly 30 sec. of wasted footage. Very subtle symbolism and building tension in this amoral morality tale that isn't about resolution, but the conflicts we inevitably wade through. Great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great visual story telling","review":"This film should be considered a textbook on how to tell a story through visuals.

In today's society, unfortunately, if you want to live, pass on by...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polanski's Stellar Debut","review":"Knife in the Water, Roman Polanski's first film (1962), is widely considered to be one of the two greatest directorial debuts in film history next to Citizen Kane.An alpha male and his young, voluptuous wife pick up a hitchhiker and invite him for a day of sailing. The two roosters spend the following day and night posturing for the attention of the sumptuous female. A challenging premise for a 94 minute film? Most assuredly but Polanski pulls it off nicely. Leon Niemczyk is superb as the cocksure Andrezej. Jolanta Umecka, in her film debut, is tantalizing as the sexually ripe Krystyna. Zygmunt Malanowicz gives a decent performance as the unsure, young drifter. Not satisfied with Malanowicz's voice, Polanski ended up dubbing over it with his own. Polish jazz legend Krzysztof Komeda's score was cool at the time but rankles today. Jerzy Lipman's cinematography is outstanding. This edition has some great bonus features including several early Polanski shorts."},{"rating":"1","title":"CMON","review":"I am a Roman Polanski fan, but this movie, despite its lingering and sometime elegant photography, has no coherent center -- not sure if it was meant to be an art film or a piece of art, because it does not have any decipherable narrative that pulls you along. Roman would develop his considerable gifts with much more palatable, and I will admit, commercial fare like Rosemary's Baby and the lovely Tess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A subtle study on vanity","review":"Roman Polanski directed his first feature film in a hale mood: we are sure of what's going on but the characters seem to be too anxious to reflect on their own behavior. The competition is based on a woman (Christine) and she lets the two men become more and more dangerous to each other. It's a subtle study on vanity. As we become more and more involved, the characters seem to become more vulnerable: they gain their own complexity never losing a truly human resemblance with each other.

And if you don't like look at the screen, there's plenty of books at less than one-fifth of the price, like Dover's parallel text, or Penguin's, or Mcgraw-hill's 'Easy french reading' and 'Better french reading', non of these is in any way inferior for reading. As for learning, 'French in action' is for superior for pedagogical purpose.

Those stories seemed to pick up in the middle of the character's lives, with no insight into what brought them to the point in their lives where their story starts, or they end so abruptly, you're left wondering what happened. While I had no favorite story, the one that stands out the most in my mind is \\"All These Years\\", which is the story of an elderly couple reminiscing about when they first met and fell in love.Ms. Nailah has the capability to be a great storyteller, and I look forward to a full-length novel where her talents will be better recognized and appreciated.Reviewed by Renee Williamsof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Auburn Review","review":"I am an Auburn graduate and remember when Pat Sullivan quarterbacked the Tigers and won the Heisman Trophy.

Great tape if you love Auburn or the Heisman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a read, but.....","review":"This book was interesting to read, at least. The author joins a strip club to pay off her college loans and then stays on because she can make a lot of money and she likes it. What I don't undertstand how a person who got into Brown could be so stupid. I mean, she joins a strip club and then whines about having people treat her badly. You want to say to her, \\"Well, if you weren't a stripper and would work honestly, people would have a better perception of you!\\" She tries to make stripping seem like harmless, easy fun. I was very disturbed by a review that said that a 19 year old girl read it and wanted to be a stripper. The sad thing is that stripping is demeaning, for both the men and women involved. The men are only seen as a source of money, and the women are seen as sex objects. For any young girl who has read this book or is considering to be a stripper, please don't!! Bottom line: Taking your clothes off for money is sleazy. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a very sugar coated view on dancing","review":"I am an exotic dancer and have been for 4 years. I thought that this book was a very good documentary on heidi's life, but the overall content on dancing is very sugar coated. I have worked in very classy upscale strip bars and hole in the wall bars also. Every bar that i have worked in dancers have issues w/ prostution, drugs, gambling and much more and none of this was included in her book. She made dancing out to be a very ligit job w/ no problems. That is just not true i have not met many dancers like heidi they are like 1 in a millon. Im not saying this wasnt a good book im just saying that i think she left a lot facts on dancing out.In fact i am writing a book now about the hard core reality of an exotic dancer.

I found this book lying around and read it. It was ridiculous!!!! The story of Heidi's life is far too common( A nice girl struggling to get herself through college), YEAH RIGHT!! Haven't these girls ever heard of scholarships?. girls strip at my club and other clubs for EASY and FAST money. Men pay good money for these girls to take it off. The night club industry is not at all like the book describes, there's drugs, affairs and alcohol everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written, Boring, Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This may be the first time I've ever - and I honestly mean EVER - given up in the middle of a book.The title, of course, drew most of us to this sad excuse for a memoir. Don't let it fool you, however. If you're searching for an introspective, insightful, possibly exciting peek into the hidden life of an adult venue, turn elsewhere. This is nothing more than the self-centered, self-aggrandizing, non-self-aware story of a girl who stripped to help pay for college in the 90's. Worse, it's poorly written and unbelievably boring. So boring that I actually stopped halfway through, chastised myself for wasting so much of my own time, and deleted it from my Kindle without a second thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self indulgent - terrible","review":"If she could, she would kiss herself. This story is written poorly and simply. I have never read something so self righteous and self important. \\"Everyone loves her, admires her and thinks she is the greatest\\" - give me a break. If they are making a movie out of this book - it's only because sex sells. If she had looked deeper into herself and not into the mirror so much maybe we could get some insight or at least a story from this woman.

I read this book and have to admit I found her story somewhat interesting, but overall the book was not really worth reading. I have severl friends who work as exotic dancer and they don't dexcribe it at all like Heidi does. Besides, Heidi comes across as if she's the only good girl in the industry.

I bought the book as a joke for one of my friends, a Brown alum, and I couldn't resist reading it before I gave it to him. I marveled at how poor the writing was. Maybe she overscheduled herself at the strip club and had to pull an all nighter to meet her publishing deadline, because that's what the book read like. Brown should be a little more selective in its admission policy. At least if you admit a skank admit a smart, articulate one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing the book was cheap","review":"I just finished reading this book and I was not impressed. The story of heidi might be somewhat interesting. UIt talks about her struggles as a college student and a stripper, but unfortunately too many questions are still left unanswered. The author does nothing to portray the stripping scene, the competition between strippers, the customers. In my opinion, the book lacks any sense of reality. It basically only covers a girls sob story as to why she was forced to strip for a living, nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL WRONG.","review":"Although, I respect Heidi Mattson's tenacity...she wrote a book and got it published -- that is about it. As a woman who has been in and around this business for many years -- I can honestly say that Mattson is still hiding the truth from mom. Her fragmented stories are so \\"sugar coated\\" it is laughable to anyone who knows the truth about this dark world. I don't care if you graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School or if you have no education and grew up in foster homes -- if you have worked as a stripper for more than one night, undoubtably -- you have experienced moments of extreme degradation -- no one girl (dancer) is different in the eyes of a customer than the next in a strip club -- As a writer, if you are going to step up and write a book about this \\"taboo\\" subject -- TELL IT LIKE IT IS -- TAKE THE LEAP. This book is NOT an accurate account by any means of the real world of stripping...."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVERAGE READ","review":"This book is a highly positive and false account of the strip club scene. While Heidi may have been the virgin Mary of go-go this is definitely not the case for most women in the business.

Unfortunately, there is no way to lock down the AMPS end of this mount. While it will hold the radio in position as long as there are no bumps or vibrations, as soon as you encounter any, the radio position will change. I've had this for less than a week and I will be returning it. I don't know how anyone could be happy with this mount. Other than price, there's really no reason to purchase it.

The story adapts an old story, Joseph Conrad's _Lord Jim_ to a science fiction setting. This is a trend seen in other recent novels, such as Michael Flynn's _The Wreck of The River Of Stars_ and Sharon Shinn's _Jenna Starborn_.The prose and plotting are dense and take thought. But a reader who makes the effort will be rewarded. The action develops over time and is not forcefed to the reader. More important is watching the effect of events on the characters. Seeing Jim recover from the actions that made him an outcast among his peers... Seeing Cam Marlow trying to give Jim the help he needs, but won't accept because he feels he doesn't deserve it...

Both are noble idealists with a lot of angst to get through, and both are reasonably believable. As it is, though, they're embroiled in a very slow moving story in which much of the action happens offstage or between chapters.

The clumps that do successfully form, I assume with small urine volumes, are crumbly and must be handled delicately to prevent separation. I filled my box a week ago and it needs to be completely dumped. I can usually go 2-3 weeks between complete changeovers when I use my preferred litter- Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat.

Ever.","review":"Whoever said this smelled like rotten oranges after the first poop is completely correct. This litter is terrible. I think the main problem is that it doesn't dry out the poop, so the smell lingers and mixes with the orange scent to create a horrific odor. Even scooping the litter box twice a day is not enough, and each time is an ordeal as you're forced to face the powerful odor up close. Worse yet, it tracks like crazy. The only one positive this litter has is that there is no dust storm created when pouring into a litter box. I switched to Fresh Step Scoopable Multi-Cat, which does create a dust storm, but it's 100% better at controlling odor (since it does dry out poop). After trying a slew of different cat litters, I think I'll stick with that one. Odor is a huge issue for a small 1BR apartment, and Tidy Cat Small Spaces does NOT live up to its name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely vile scent","review":"I have two indoor cats who eat a low-residue diet and I scoop the litter daily, so there's never much waste in the cat box to begin with. I agree with others who say that it is great at deodorizing litter box odors; I haven't smelled cat waste since I started using this. However, I won't be purchasing the product again because the deodorant in the litter smells absolutely disgusting. The best way I can describe it is overripe or rotting fruit; to me there is nothing \\"fresh\\" or natural in the odor - just a cloying, overly sweet chemical smell (kind of like when oranges go moldy). Not only is the scent very bad it is also very strong. I keep the litter box in the downstairs bathroom and I can smell the litter throughout the entire house. I just poured the last of the litter into the cat box tonight and am looking forward to buying my regular litter again this weekend; it doesn't contol cat waste odors as well, but frankly, cat waste smells less offensive than this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy customer","review":"Needed book for a reference for an English term paper.

Joe Mantegna is amazing as Spenser on the audio books and he outdid himself here.This is rather unusual as a Spenser novel because Susan is gone and Hawk is not in the book. Spenser takes on what appears to be an open-and-shut case involving two teenaged students shooting up a school--outside Boston.As always, Parker's books are particularly enjoyable for their spare style combined with a real mastery of dialogue. Mantegna's presentation acts as a true partner to Parker's writing. I think Parker has more chapters for fewer lines than any other author.It appears that most Spenser readers are like me--looking forward to new installments of familiar characters. Even though Susan and Hawk are not factors in this book, it won't disappoint Spenser fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Satisfying Read","review":"In this latest outing of the likable, wise-cracking Boston gumshoe, we find him being gently persuaded to delve into the case of a boy who stands accused of a horrible crime. To the delight of many Spenser fans, Susan's presence is minimal throughout the tale, but to the dismay of those very same fans, Hawk is nowhere to be found (though there is a brief reference to Hawk by Spenser when he seeks to enlist the aid of a local hood).In spite of the lingering presence of Susan throughout (she's attending a professional conference out of state while the gumshoe is on the case), I found myself laughing at key points in the tale. I enjoyed reading Parker's clipped, sharp 'prose'. He certainly has nailed the dialog thing.In fact, I think I will pick up the next tale in the Spenser series and give it a slow, careful read. I am amazed at all the life lessons Parker drops here and there. Every book he writes is a true intellectual treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spenser Lite","review":"A Columbine shooting at a private school provides the setting for this story. Spenser is hired to prove the innocence of one of the shooters.I enjoyed the book but it seemed like it was Robert Parker Light, less taste and less filling. It had a good story line and the plot was good but it just didn't seem to have enough meat on the bones. I've noticed that when I'm hungry my analogies all seem food related. One of my favorite aspects of Parker's Spenser novels is the verbal repartee between Hawk and Spenser. Since Hawk was not a participant in this story that was missing. This is not a beach book, this more like finish it in one sitting while waiting in the dentist's office. This was a very short, very quick read, too light and too quick to be satisfying.Cold Service (Spenser)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this the handwriting on the wall for Susan?","review":"I truly hope that this is setting us up for the disappearance of Susan. I have never liked her character, and despite all their protestations, I just don't feel a close bond between them. Spenser seems besotted with her, but I never get the feeling that she loves him as much. She's very high maintenance and actually redundant, as he has the same basic relationship with Hawk, except for the sex.Their banter can be light, give insight into them, or be incredibly menacing, depending on the situation.Sooo please Mr Parker...Lose Susan, keep Hawk. Oh and Spenser gets custody of Pearl."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can tell a good author by how easy it looks","review":"You can tell a good author by how easy it looks. It isn't,but it looks that way. This book just flows. The dialogue is intelligent, acerbic, humorous and understated.But before you know it, you are deeply involved in a very good mystery.Others have commented on the plot, but the book is so well-written in the now-classic Parker style that it is a worthy addition to the series. A fine book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of His Best","review":"I really enjoy Spenser and the Spenser cast of characters. I didn't care for this one, though. Really predictable and not very exciting.Spenser features Pearl way too much. The ending was weak. I'd recommend many other Parker books, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"School Days is a satisfying morsel","review":"While not the most convoluted of Spenser adventures this book is clean, sparse, and refreshingly Spenser through and through. I didn't mind the exclusion of some of my favorite characters when Spenser shines like he does in this outing. Spenser at his wisecracking best digging away like Pearl with a bone, impervious to all obstacles when he's on the case.And what a case. No shining happy ending here, but a satisfying conclusion nonetheless. Poor, poor Jared.I don't understand why so many reviewers were glad Susan was gone for the entire book. She's not my favorite character but I certainly don't wish her gone. Spenser's mature certainty that she is the one for him and not ashamed to announce it to all and everyone is one of the things I admire most about him. I loved it when Mrs. Ellsworth asked if he would put her grandson's interests above all else and Spenser unashamedly replied that he put Susan Silverman's interests above all else. Ahhhh. My hero. What a guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Spenser Winner","review":"This book kept you guessing all the way through. The question was never who, but WHY. Our hero has his principles and wanted to answer this question. The only thing I missed in this novel was the presence of Susan and Hawk. Otherwise I'd have given it a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Low for Spenser","review":"Almost no action, no Hawk and very little Susan. I yearned for something to hapen for far too many pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an Ok book","review":"I have bought and read all of Robert Parkers books. I dont know why I do because they are getting tiring. The story line is weak. He spends more time having Spenser make comments about all the women that pass by then he does on the plot. If you take out all the sexual parts and the wisecracks he does... there is very little to the main story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished Business","review":"The book was a typical Spenser novel, however without Hawk, and Susan.The plot was a little weak, and it ended with a lot of \\"loose strings\\".I wanted to know what happened to many of the characters that were prevelant in this novel. Parker should have completed the book. It left me empty, and wanting to see some justice. I won't say more because the people who have not read the book would pick up on clues that should be left up to the reader.All in all to be quite fair, it was a page turner, entertaining, just lacking in the conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"This is a solid, though not particularly original entry in the series, but then, how original could it be after 30 some books? The usual snappy prose, an intriguing mystery involving a school shooting by two young men who appear to have no discernible motive. Spenser quickly comes the conclusion that his client is guilty, but feels that extenuating circumstances might to some extent ameliorate his guilt. How he tracks down those circumstances makes for a very satisfying entry in this long running series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Right Amount of Sarcasm","review":"I've always loved the Spenser stories. However, Burt Reynolds' reading of thisnovel makes Spenser come to life. Burt is, in real life, sarcastic & glib (or hetries to be). In playing Spenser that way, and with his unique voice, he makes Spensersound like a hard-nosed detective as well as a unique paramour for Susan. I've listenedto other Parker books read by Joe Mantegna and some dude named Stefan Rudnicki.While Mantegna was pretty good (he's good at acting like a detective anyway),this Rudnicki guy sounded like a 12-year old. These publishers ought to hire Reynoldsto read all of the Spenser books. Now, when I actually read a Spenser book,all I can hear is Reynolds' voice, he really does a terrific job - even if you don'tgenerally like the guy as an actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read but not the same without Hawk","review":"Where did Hawk go in this story? There's barely a mention of him. Playing upon some frightening headlines this case is brought to Spenser by Lily Ellsworth, grandmother of Jared Clark. She believes her grandson is innocent in a school shooting. She wants Spenser to find the evidence needed to free Jared from prison. He uncovers Jared's sad story. Susan Silverman is barely in this book as well. You see much more of Pearl, the wonder dog, than in any other Spenser novel. The dialogue at times seems a little rough around the edges but overall this book was a first-rate addition to this longtime series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon overcharged me on this item","review":"I have not listened the audiobook yet. So my rating refers just to its price.I want to caution other potential buyers since Amazon charged me 21.86, and when the product arrived I found a label on it saying \\"Now only $14.99$.Please search for lower prices on new items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to agree with Stuart (form Aug 10 2006 review)","review":"While I jumped into the character sporadically (I think this is the second one I read with him as the main character) it flowed fast and his smart remarks I always find humorous. While the plot is quite weak and I actually guessed part of it, it was a fun read. It went quick and should have built more into the red herring that the cover leads you to believe. Even the school principal lacked some Ooommmph if you know what I mean. The grandmother was a good role, but the parents coud have been much more important.So overall, let's call it a quick read, funny and enjoyable, but not one of his best. I picked it up at the airport and read it on the very same trip. Not one I would keep, so back it went with the 50% return offer the airport here has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull writing","review":"There must be a secret to Parker's success of mass publishing books. However, I was not able to find it.First of all this was my first book by Robert B. Parker and certainly it was the last one. I just can't be friend with dull writing and sentences that rarely contain more than 10 words.Here's a short excerpt:\\"It had been a wet summer. Outside my office window, it was raining again. I was watching it. Pearl was resting om her couch. Later, wgen the excitement died down, I might read the paper. My phone rang. Pearl had no reaction. She didn't care about phones. I didn't either, but somebody had to abswer, so I picked it up.\\"I rarely write bad reviews but this book deserved one. The story itself could have been a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"One\\" Dimensional","review":"My primary question after reading this book is \\"What was Parker Thinking?\\" In my opinion to write a Spenser book without Hawke or Susan is a waste of time for the author in writing it and a waste of time for the reader in reading it.The only reason I even finished School Days is that I was hoping Hawke would appear somewhere - I was doomed to disappointment - (and also I have a thing about finishing every book I start no matter what).At least some excuse was given for Susan's absence - Hawke however was barely mentioned.Unfortunately - no pun intended - Spenser alone is completely \\"One Dimensional\\".RWNew York"},{"rating":"1","title":"School Days Not So Good","review":"I didn't care for this novel. There no real suspense or surprise . I have read better Spensers books. This is lightweight reading wait for the next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryan Ferry's Frantic","review":"This album is sheer perfection. It reaches out and graps hold of yourheart and doesn't let go until the, all to short end. How luckywe are to have Bryan Ferry's genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ferry's Best Since \\"Boys and Girls\\"","review":"Nice interpretations of Leadbelly's \\"Goodnight Irene\\" and Dylan's \\"Don't Think Twice (It's Alright)\\" and \\"It's All Over Now Baby Blue\\". Also includes contributions from Eurythmics' Dave Stewart and Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood. Collaboration with former bandmate Eno (\\"I Thought\\") best original tune on album. Would have liked a few more with Eno."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"I bought this CD thinking Ferry had finally returned to material found on Boys and Girls and Bete Noire. Also, since so many other reviewers gave it 5 stars I figured it must be a winner.It is not. It's kind of hard to classify this CD but it is not the Bryan Ferry style I favor. Ferry does a couple of Dylan covers and one thing is clear, Ferry and Dylan do not mix. Only a couple of tracks are worth noting: Goddess of Love and Nobody Loves Me. Both tunes kind of bring the sense of older Ferry material but its not enough to justify the CD purchase.The recording is lacking as well. Both Bete Noire and Boys and Girls were released over 15 years ago yet they sound much more fresh and modern compared to Frantic. Frantic sounds as if it was recorded in someone's (Dave Stewart?) basement with 16 track analog equipment. I recommend you borrow a copy and rip or tape from that and save your money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Bryan lose a lung somewhere along the line?","review":"-sure sounds so...and there he is posed smoking in most of the MANY booklet pictures of his airbrushed, hairdyed visage...We sold the cd back after a day or 2 of trying.Ah well, old heroes... go to ROXY albums 1-2-3, orBF solo 1-2-3 for some great work...Vive obscurity/dying young!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"But then I don't know what I expected. I originaly wanted to buy the remaster of Avalon and decided to buy this instead. Cd opens as a rocker and after a few tracks he does a Dylan cover which is quite good. His voice piano and harmonica is excellent showing he still has his voice in fine form although more mature sounding. The rest of the cd sounds more like Ferry of the past. Initially I wasn't taken with this cd but after listening to it through a few times it has really started to grow on me and have to say it is quite good. Best cd of 2002 or his best effort yet, I doubt it but still an excellent listen and one cd I am sure I will keep coming back to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frantastic!","review":"I don't know how you can 'expect' Bryan Ferry to be anything but Bryan Ferry. The man has pursued his singular romantic vision from the very first Roxy album with varying degrees of success. At his best, he delivers great pop songs in a lush setting, and here, he is definitely firing on all cylinders. Perhaps the title is an allusion to the frantic creative energy that seems to burst from every track. Bryan sounds engaged and enthused here and that counts for a great deal in my book. Compare this to the stultifyingly dull new Bowie album and you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ferry turns full circle, and hits every spot on the way","review":"Frantic, Bryan Ferry's first album to feature original material in 9 years, features Ferry in a much more rootsy, rock n' roll mood then has been seen in any of his albums since leaving Roxy Music. In fact, the first songs on the record had me thinking that these were actually lost sessions from The Bride Stripped Bare. But Ferry smartly keeps all fans something to cheer for. Seeing that critics and fans were growing tired of the urban chic jazz-funk-pop that he'd been making since Avalon, Ferry churnsd in a highly varied album that's many styles are off=putting at first, but consistantly strong performances and songs make it a record that grows stronger with each listen. Highlights include the single Goddess of Love, It's All Over Now Baby Blue, and my personal favorite, A Fool For Love, which is an absolute classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very worthwhile investment advice!","review":"I've been a Fabian follower for the past 25 years, following Dick Fabian's newsletter until Doug Fabian took over his father's newsletter business in 1991. They both share the same investment philosophy, and I'm thrilled to be out of the market right now, as a result of Fabian's plan. Having read both books, Maverick Investing is very different from his father's \\"Mutual Fund Wealth Builder,\\" particularly in the areas of Exchange Traded funds, which is definitely worth the price of the book. Also, the in-depth information on 401(k) investing is probably the most useful advice you'll receive in the marketplace today, answering virtually all the questions you have about 401(k)'s, and explaining how the use of tax-deferred vehicles can make you wealthy at retirement.

Very dissappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it half a star if I could","review":"As a big fan of the Ashes series, I've been disappointed of late with the last few books. Other reviewers have said that Mr. Johnstone is dead. I don't know if that is a fact or not. What I do know is that this book absolutely sucks. Poorly edited. No real plot. Survive plague, drive around, find dog, kill bad guys, find and fall in love with incredibly hot woman, kill more bad guys, girl gets kidnapped, hunt down kidnappers, kill them, and oh yeah, a big plot twist, this time the hero isn't quite in time, and the girl gets horribly disfigured. Those are the good points of the book. In an attempt to tie into the Ashes series, the new hero was with Raines when he died, and there are some Rebels left. However, there are no longer any women in the Rebel army, AND the timeline has been completely rewritten. The only positive thing to come out of this for was that I bought this waste of perfectly good paper USED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub Par","review":"I've read all previous Ashes series books when they were originally published. This book was terrible. It was poorly written, contained numerous mistakes both in form and substance. If this is Johnstone's work then its time he retires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful storytelling","review":"This was a great story with rich, detailed character development. It's not often that I really connect with a character, but I found Nancy to be so forthcoming and thoughtful with her emotions, motives, and reactions that I couldn't help but want to know more about her. So often I feel that authors will grow tired of their own characters and simply get lazy with them, but not this one. She really wanted to flesh these people out and make you relate to them. I'm not a lesbian, but her ongoing struggle with her feelings for Kitty, even years after walking away, were so very understandable for me as simply a woman. I'm not sure if the graphic sexual depictions would be to the liking of everyone, but undoubtedly any fan of historic fiction would be roped into this engaging, vibrant tale anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I finished the book in one sleepless night.

The two become partners in business and love until Kitty betrays Nan for her career. From there, Nan becomes a rent boy, then a kept girl in lesbian high society, until she is thrown back into the streets. Meeting a woman from her past, Nan heals her heart and finds true love. Winner of a Lambda Literary Award, Waters's gorgeous story is equal parts historical novel and bawdy lesbian epic. My only regret is that I waited so long to read this book! I felt a bit distant at times from the characters, so I am hesitant to give it 5 of 5, but I'm quite on the border."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't get enough...","review":"I really liked this book, it takes you on a journey that most of us have been on in one form of another. The sting and obsession of your first love. The wreckless and poor decisions we make as we are trying to find our place in the world. And ultimately the glory that comes with growing up, knowing who you are, and being able to make better choices.Of course trying to do this in the late 1800's in England and being a lesbian makes this path a little more challanging then most of us will ever have to endure, but Sarah Waters writiing style is so detailed and engrossing that you are right there cheering on, or in some cases yelling at, our dear Nancy.This book can be very erotic and steamy in some spots, so a mature reader that is good with girl on girl action will appreciate those juicy tidbits as well.

I have to agree with all the other 1 and 2-star reviews on this site: save your money! If you really must get this book, be warned; it starts out as a deceptively fun, light read before quickly getting bogged down by ridiculous plots, offensively stereotypical characters and the least sexy erotic passages I've read in a while.

I must disagree. There were more phallic descriptions in this book than I've ever seen in any heterosexual book. The constant association of lesbians to men made me frown. It's something true lesbians fight on a daily basis. There was nothing in this book that turned me on. I hope that people exploring a lesbian lifestyle do not point to this book as a sole example of what lesbians find erotic. There are out lesbians that simply enjoy being women and loving women. If you are someone into \\"phallic writing\\" then this is the book for you. I for one had enough phallic imagry after reading this book to last a lifetime. While the book created detailed imagry and history it did not provide the erotica I had hoped. A true disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just becasue it's erotica, doesn't mean it's good","review":"I am amazed by all the hype surrounding this book. I found it boring and a chore to get through. I really enjoyed the descriptions at the beginning of the book, but it fell apart very soon after. The main character was very unlikable and selfish. I didn't care what happened to her. The \\"erotic\\" scenes were poorly written and not enjoyable. I also found the series of events that Nan went through to be totally over-the-top and unbelievable. People in the story often acted out of character to suit situations and move the story forward. I can only guess that people are so taken with the idea of reading lesbian erotica that they fail to pay attention to the actual book.

An extra amount of detail for characters, a true to story speed of events, allows for easy suspension of disbelief. Rather, the historic detail mixes into plausible invention. Whatever isn't true in the book has undoubtedly occurred outside of it, and if not it is hoped for so hardheartedly by the reader, truth is of little relevance.

It's a fantastically written book, descriptive, with a very intimate view of real life in Victorian England, including several well written love stories, and very strong, memorable and likeable characters! I picked up the book based on the cover and my interest in the Victorian Era. Not only was I very impressed with the novel itself, I was completely drawn in and couldn't put it down! Certainly it's an excellent piece of Lesbian Fiction, but I think it's so much more than that alone - it's a wonderful piece of literature and a great example of fine writing!I think Affinity was very good as well, but it didn't have exactly the same kind of pull that Tipping the Velvet did.

Very imaginative, and I felt quite dizzy when the novel had ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title was the only good thing about this book","review":"TTV began with promise, but soon turned into a disappointment. The story quickly bogged down and wallowed in its own self pity along with Nancy. Love scenes were a bit heavy handed... The ending was too rushed and packaged too neatly. But by that time, I didn't care about these self-centered characters or what happened to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"It took me awhile to get into this book, but once I did it was a great read. Good escape novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I have read in ages!","review":"I was really looking forward to this after reading the fine reviews this book has received from other readers. Unfortunately, this book has turned out to be the worst I have come across in a long time, and was extremely hard to finish. I had no sympathy for the main character, found her attitude towards other people callous and selfish, and did not care what happened to her next. I also found her \\"renting\\" period ridiculous and quite out of character for someone so resolutely butch. Give me a writer like Jeanette Winterson any day, at least the people in her books seem human! Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and well written","review":"This is the second of Ms. Waters' books I read. The tale takes many twists and turns, which seems typical of her storytelling. It's not for the faint of heart, as some of the story is quite dreary, and some of it involved things that some people probably don't like to think much about. But it's worth the effort.Ms. Waters is a great writer and pulls you immediately into the era in which the story takes place. If you love historical fiction, then you will be very pleased with the amount of detail and how the book makes those times come alive in your imagination. If you don't care much about historical settings, the tale is still interesting enough to keep you constantly involved in wanting to know what happens next.I rated it a four mostly because of the darker aspects in the book that won't appeal to everyone. But if you feel like taking a bit of a risk, you won't be disappointed, and the ending makes it all worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasteful erotica","review":"I've never before read such well written, tasteful lesbian erotica as this. I was surprised to find such a great book set in 1890's England -- one that I couldn't put down until it was finished! The characters were incredibly believable, and the story is entrancing. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Walters writes an amazing tale","review":"Very good writing. Nice view into the sexuality of those living in a previous period. I would read other books by her. Very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a book!","review":"Like no lesbian fiction you have read before, this story evokes the whole range of emotions from your spirit, which is what a good book should do isn't it?Totally unpredictable, racey and classy, this is a harsh, but touching tale that leads you through the streets of London, with every turn a different outcome.Truly enjoyed that the author was not afraid to enter the realm of darker emotions and desires that most people keep to themselves.The writing is top notch, not your ordinary \\"see Spot run\\" style that so many of the lesbian love stories seem to use.This is one for the \\"Classic Lesbian Novels\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A day and a half...","review":"YES, a day and half is all it took me to read this book-- I could literally not put it down. Well, that is somewhat of a lie: I forced myself to put it by the wayside for a few moments in order to prolong the pleasure of reading it. Tipping the Velvet is exquisite and a perfect read for the summer. The novel is so rich with details from life at the turn of century that it is possible to forget where you are. Everyone should read this book, regardless of orientation. The story of (supposed?) love and loss are universal, and I believe any feeling person can understand that! You will find yourself craving oysters by the end-- Treat yourself! Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Novel Will Spoil You!","review":"Valley Gay Press Book Reviewer: Liz Bradbury (Author of Angel Food and Devil Dogs - A Maggie Gale Mystery)Read Tipping The Velvet and your enjoyment of \\"straight\\" novels may be spoiled forever. Sarah Waters' captivating, literate story of a young lesbian's adventures finding love and herself in late Victorian England is fast paced, personal, historically interesting and very gay. This is the book you should have been able to read when you were a teenager. It not only affirms there are and always have been \\"people like us\\" but that the discovery and affirmation of our identities is essential. The story is full of fascinating scenes and characters, bawdy and romantic moments, and a storyline that draws you in and hold you to the last word. You may want to read Tipping the Velvet several times, but be careful when lending it to friends, you may never get it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful","review":"this is not the original oi the dvd (or movie). some of the tracklistings are different, and some of the best bands and songs are not here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooper Vapor tight lights","review":"Great lights.

Amazing insight that tells us what becomes of all the aborted babies. Actually, Songs of the Morning Stars is probably better, because it talks about more than just abortion, such as unintended miscarriage or still birth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly written","review":"I loved this novel. Alice is rendered so sympathetically, and her plight (getting over the death of Matthew Swan) so very moving. I must admit I read this both with a reader's eye (getting lost in the terrific story) and with a writer's eye (admiring the grace, clarity, and briliance of the writing.) A superlative read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"By looking at the other reviews, it appears I am in the minority, but I did not enjoy this book at all. In fact, I had a hard time finishing it. (Very syrupy ending..)The main character, Alice, is very self absorbed and I found it difficult to like her and therefore empathize with her in various situations. I also never got a feel for what Matthew, the victim was really like which made it harder to care. Also, the whole sub-theme about volunteering in the prison was extremely unrealistic. The relationship she supposedly develops with the prisoners would never really happen. First, that a 17 yr. old girl would inspire all of them to write poetry, second, that they would all confide in her and third, that this group of hard core murderers would act like a bunch of girls all excited for Alice's prom plans. I have never written a negative review before, but I though maybe someone would appreciate an honest opinion. Very superficial read."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Hated this book! I thought the first quarter of the book showed promise, but it quickly disintegrated into a novel so unbelievable, trite, and repetitive that I was literally rolling my eyes.First of all, the prison scenario, that a teenage girl would be allowed to interact and form relationships with these murderers as close as Alice did, got more and more unbelievable as the book went on.The dialog between characters is made up of total non-sequiturs for one thing, and every character sounds the same; there is no distinction between characters. plus, no one ever says things like, \\"I'm sorry I'm such a bad brother. I'm sorry your heart is broken.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing novel!","review":"When I heard that Molly Moynahan's novel was going to be on the NYTimes list of Notable Books for the year, I immediately moved it to the top of my TBR stack and, oh, am I glad I did. Seventeen-year-old Alice McGuire finds herself in the wrong kind of wonderland when Matthew Swan, her soul mate since very early childhood, vanishes while in Mexico. While coping with the grief of a loss that never should have happened, Alice becomes involved with tutoring prisoners in writing for her senior class project. I don't want to give anything away, but this is such a strong and sensitive novel, smart and sad, the best part of it being that the reader goes away feeling as though Ms. Moynahan will have a lot more good stories to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"I knon't recomend this","review":"I Got this camera one year ago.

The labels look best on silver or pure white topped CDr blanks. Silver with silver printing is acceptable, but the lettering will still be visible through the labels in good light.In addition to the two circular labels there are four other labels per sheet. Skinny ones for the edge of jewel cases, and larger rectangular ones.Had to edit my review and remove stars. Some labels are cut differently.

When you create a label and print it, it is off center, and you are left with a bunch of white space on your label. The adheisive is fine, so is the cheap plastic device usually included with any label maker in this price range. But the software is what really defeats the purpose.

Only after VERY CAREFULLY unfolding the individual sheets, and \\"unbending\\" the several creases, folds and \\"curly-cues\\" are you able to put them through your laser printer.

I was surprised with how they turned out. I can put virtually anything I want on them, and the program prints them fine without any problem.

Gregory whines endlessly about her childhood but remains incapable of giving insight to why she thinks this was abuse. Is it possible she was a child who constantly complained she felt sick. The medical records are provided without adding an understanding of why she thought this was abusive. It just doesn't add up. It is a poorly written account of imagined abuse for monetary gain. The pills her mother gave her under her tongue could have been homeopathic pellets."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting story not so interestingly written","review":"While the story Julie Gregory tells is certainly interesting, she could have used the help of a strong editor to improve her writing. Her shifting verb tenses and clich��d healing terminology only weaken the impact of her tale.

Maybe not as the sole criteria, but I found myself distracted by poor writing. This book could have benefited from a more straightforward storytelling approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Did The Doctors Allow This Disgrace To Go On?","review":"This is sick child abuse and very sad. You can look at the mother and say you are a child abuser and must be punished. However, I prefer to look at the medical system and the individual doctors who abused the child in this way. It may be that the medical system is more culpable than the mother as they ignored the girl's cry for help. The book is an eye opener to many problems in the medical system. It is a quick read in about 24 hours or less and the reader will gain valuable knowledge of the medical system and of MBP."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story","review":"This story of a weird form of child abuse is both sickening and amazing.

This book will more than likely make you cry, on more than one occasion! Even though it is a very sad and depressing book I highly recommend it, before reading this book I had never heard of Munchausen by proxy disease. It will leave you wanting to know more about Munchausen by proxy disease.This book is very fast paced. You could easily read this book in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reality of Abuse","review":"This book, wonderfully written, captivated my heart and troubled my soul. The author, Julie Gregory, pulled from her triumph the pain and suffering she experienced as a little girl at the hands of her mother and and exposed the reader to all the mind bending realities of an abused child in America. She brings the reader through many of the experiences and trials of her life and shows how this innocent little girl found beauty in the world that had given her only suffering. She takes us through her steps of being abused, then escaping that abuse and beginning the long search to find herself over many countries and many miles then eventually to the healing strength she so beautifully reveals. This book is awesome and has given me incredible insight into the strength bred of facing our deepest fears and pain. Julie Gregory has inspired me to overcome and prevail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mid-range headphones","review":"I bought these to use with my Ipod, especially on long haul flights.

The hinge in the middle of the top rubs against the top of my head. May not be a problem if you have a lot of hair.The human factors is not too good. The retractable cord is a great idea, but it doesn't work reliably, the rewind slider is difficult to work (it sticks and is in an awkward place), and it gets hidden underneath the support flange.

There is one category of sound that these headphones will cancel: low rumble. If you would like to eliminate or reduce any other frequency, you are out of luck with these.

They may or may not work on an airplane, but the noise-canceling is poor on the bus. The fan on the bus was 75% blocked out but the low rumbling of the bus engine forced me to turn up the volume anyway. I might have kept these despite the inadequacies but they are perhaps the most uncomfortable pair of headphones i have ever worn. The pain around my ears was noticeable after 15 minutes and unbearable at 30.I do not recommend buying these headphones. If you need more persuasion, the quality of product is extremely low. Its almost expected, for the cheap price, that they would be poorly made, but I'm positive there are better products for the same price available elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cheap","review":"I've come to enjoy JVC products over the years, but this one comes up short. Though the sound is quite good, and the sound cancelling does a pretty decent job, there are some real quality shortcomings:- I lost the sound in one ear after less than a year; was inside the headphone and not a jack issue and there was no way I could get at it to make a repair. I attribute the problem of a very thin and flimsy cord.- the retractable cord mechanism was a moose to operate, often I had to pry it with a knife or screwdriver to get it working- the battery cover frequently fell offThe phones are also a bit large, though they do fold up somewhat compactly. I only used mine on planes when traveling so I do not feel as though I abused the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"This JVC almost has it right... almost.","review":"This JVC almost has it right... almost.

I had the Sony MDR-NC6, but they were stolen and I opted for the JVC on price, the retractable cord and the Amazon reviews. The first time I put them on during a flight I noticed how poorly they did canceling out the noise. The Sony were much better. This is the most important feature and the JVC scores poorly here. I would not buy the JVC again, nor do I recommend the Sony MDR-NC6; they are uncomfortable and a hassle to use. Now, in hind sight, I would pay the extra $$$ and get me a pair of the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheapest yet one of the best noise canceling ear phones you will buy","review":"I bought a refurbished model of these ear phones and i simply love it. I can't imagine listening to music now without it. Though the ear pads are slightly small for my ear, i think it was worth the money. It generally does a good job of blocking noise, but during active noise cancellation mode it cuts low frequency sounds such as an engine or people talking on the phone.

In any case, I have headphones on for long periods of time and have found that they really hurt the top of my head after awhile. I tried adjusting them but that never works. As long as they're hanging from my head, they hurt. And the headphones part itself starts to hurt my ears as it presses down on my ear cartilage. It's not like I have huge ears.

In fact, I am thinking about getting some extra pairs to sell to the people I sit next to when I go to Asia later this month. I know I could have sold several pairs to people who tried them on this last trip because they were so impressed by the quality. The retracting cord is also wonderful.One negative is that I flew on Cathay Pacific and they use a 1/4\\" jack for their sound. These do not come with one that size. So, you might want to pick up a converter to the larger plug in case you are on an airplane that uses this size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noice cancellation helps","review":"I found the headphones to be worth the money I spent.

I also ride an extremely noisy bus that makes it difficult to hear anything. These headphones do their job in that they do drown out a significant amount of noise in the background. Sound quality is rather good. But, they lasted about as long as my iPod headphones. The left earphone is slightly blown. Other than that this product does what it promises and works rather well. If I could go back I would still probably buy these headphones over some $300 BOSE or something.

At my previous job location I had the luxury of an office where I could shut the door if things got noisy. Needless to say a cube in a sales office is very noisy. I began researching Noise Cancelling headphones and settled on the JVC HANC100 model. I've had these a month now and am extremely satisfied. While they don't eliminate all noise, they significantly reduce the volume. I find the 'over-the-ear' format effective and comfortable. Even after a two hour flight there was no discomfort. I estimate I've had the noise cancelling feature on for at least 12 hours on a fresh battery, so it may be too early to say how quickly they eat up a single AAA battery. Another great feature is the retractable cord.Connected to my Ipod, whether I'm in the office or on a plane, they work great. Well worth the price ($50)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable, small ear cups, poor noise cancellation","review":"I use headphones when mowing the lawn.

The hums of everyday life disappeared. The noises on the train were mostly gone although not quite as gone as I had hoped. Still, pretty nice.I like how they fold up. I like how the cord feeds back in automatically. And the sound quality is fine.The problem with these headphones is that unless you have very small ears the ear pads will press uncomfortably on your ears instead of surrounding them. My ears always hurt once I take these off. It's probably worse if you have glasses. I've never had this problem with any other pair of headphones.If you're interested in these headphones try them on for 10 minutes before you buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price, nice on long flights","review":"These work great for the price.

These headphones are not even worth the $40 or $50 I paid for them. At this cheap you would be better off buting a regular pair of over-ear studio headphones. And the retractable cable is the first thing that will break then will come the cheap plastic headrest. The sound itself is horrible.

The noise canceling electronics are nearly useless, compared to, for example, the Audio Technica ATH-ANC7 headset. There is little discernible reduction in ambient noise with the electronics switched on vs off. The electronics also adds quite a bit of hiss to the background. The yoke that spans the top of your head is uniquely uncomfortable. To round out the deal, the cord retracts into the left earpiece. While a nice idea, I've already had to disassemble this earpiece twice to untangle the mechanism. Buy something else.

I use them probably 4 hours per day attached to my MP3 player and placed in a smock pocket. After about 6 months one side of the headphones became intermittent. I continued to live with it for a while with the idea that I'd solder a new connector on. After a few more months the noise reduction appears to have died somewhat. I tried to solder on a new connector, but found that the problem existed higher up on the retractable cord making it nearly impossible to repair.Also, my hair kept getting caught in the hinge of the headphones pulling it out on occasion. The comfort level for extended periods of time is not very good either.Next time I'm going with the Maxell NC-II pair that my wife has: cheap, very comfortable and going strong after 3 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value and performance.","review":"I have several different pairs of noise-cancelling headphones, including the Bose QuiteComfort 2 (and 1, which I gave away) and Sennheiser PX300 (and 250, again which I gave away). I purchased the JVC Hanc100 for my kids, who I didn't expect would care for my other sets the way I wanted them to.The initial reaction to the JVCs is favorable; they are comfortable, the noise-cancelling works well, and we all particularly like that the cord retracts into the headset, meaning one less thing to flop around when they get put them away.Of the three, the QuiteComfort are the best, but at a significant price differential (and they are pretty big). I tend to travel with the Sennheisers because they are the smallest of the lot and still work well. That said, these JVC headphones, particularly at their sale price, were a very good value and I would purchase them again (hopefully, they don't get left on a plane by the kids)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value overall.

After experimenting with more sophisticated measures, I settled on an old fashioned rubber-band (see photo posted in the share section). Works great! No cords hanging down. Perfect for cleaning or yard work. The retractable cord is so useful it makes me wonder why there aren't more products like this. Noise cancelation seems subtle but adequate. On the minus side, the bass response could be a bit better, and they can be uncomfortable unless you find the sweet spot when putting them on.

At first there's a noticeable squeaking when a cd is playing but thankfully it went away. If looks is what you are looking for then this is the one to get, but performance wise i don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Executive Stereo (Maybe for their companie's Executives...)","review":"Considering this radio comes in a box marked \\"Executive Microsystem\\" you might expect a little quality. Well, your expectations will not be met...they won't even come close to the poor performance and awful look of this radio. The pictures here don't let you see just how \\"China made\\" this plastic, molded, seems everywhere stereo is really composed of.I would be estatic if all of Fishers Executives actually had to use this on THEIR desks, I think they would quickly change the design and more so the sound production.I have returned this item and will never by from Fisher again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor sound quality, looks only...","review":"What a disappointment. This system looks great on your desk but sounds and performs horribly, no exaggeration. The volume knob is extremely fickle and inconsistent, it works when it wants to, and the speakers distort and only minimum volumes. I opened the box, set it up, popped in a cd, and no sooner had it back in the box ready to ship back. Sorry Fisher, it's nothing personal, but unless you are going strictly for looks this is just not a very good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it looks good (in the picture)","review":"The picture of the SLIM 1500 looks good; sadly the complimentary aspects of the stereo end there. If you are unfortunate enough to purchase one of these or receive it as a gift and for some reason do not want to take it back, here is a tip. IF you can get a CD to load properly and the speakers are not detached, do not turn the volume up above a whisper. The vibration makes the CD skip. That is if you can get the CD to start playing at all. The sound \\"quality\\" is terrible, a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fisher disappointment","review":"after recieving the Fisher SLIM-1500 the first thing I noticed was how \\"plasticy\\" the product is ,overall the system seems to be very weakly made , and I'm worried the if I turn the volume dial too fast it may in fact just come loose.

That's about all it had going for it. The tuner has completely gone out already--we can't get reception anywhere--even outside. I tried buying a new antenna for it and it still won't work. I would definitely steer clear of this item and I think I will stay away from Fisher products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendously poor product","review":"Don't waste your money on this so-called stereo system. The sound is horrendous, even for background music. It only looks nice. It sounds like a tin box. The sound on my laptop computer is far superior to this sound system. The only thing I use this product for is listening to AM radio such as news, and the clock feature. It takes too long for the stereo to read a CD when it is put in. Changing CD's requires you to touch the readable surface of the disc. This one's heading for the bargain table at my next garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Looks, Bad Performance","review":"I've had the Fisher SLIM-1500 for almost a year now, the first thing that was wrong was that some cds would skip, seemed to be caused by the vibration it makes when spinning. I remedied this by shaving some of the plastic off from the top spinner (I wouldn't recommend doing it for yourself, could render your CD player useless). I thought the stereo would look professional in my office, but without the base and hung from the wall, it looks ugly. The sound quality is quite poor as well, and it is hard to position the antenna to recieve stations that I was previously able to listen to with a different stereo and the same type of antenna (wire). I see that this item wasn't available at the time this review was written, maybe Fisher got the idea and stopped production, hopefully improving it. I like the looks, but it doesn't perform as well as I would hope for the money. I'd stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice package -- poor quality","review":"Looks great but the controls are almost impossible to master.

The sound was horrible - it did not hit any highs or lows so anything besides monoaural sound sounded horrible. Some features did not work logically or did not work at all. Though it is a nice looking system, the quality is too bad to even consider this system. My recommendation - spend for the Bang and Olufsen or just buy a bigger system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice System","review":"I have read through the other reviews and agree with few and disagree with most. Here is how:Disagree: It was said that the CD's wont load or they will skip. I have played 3 different home burned CD's in it in the last hour since I got it, no bad loads, no skips. The sound quality is great as long as you dont want to rattle the windows. It wont let you which I think is a great quality. (No, I'm not old and grey, I'm 21 and loud music is obnoxious). It has a very stylish look, and the plastic looks very nice.Agree: When manually changing tracks, the CD DOES skip the intro to songs. Only real bad thing I have notice thus far. And I have played everything from Country to Classical to Heavy Metal on it now, no problems other than this.I would have to recommend this product. It's not a party system, its a good home stereo that won't have the neighbors calling the police on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good short-term stereo","review":"I had this stereo for about 2 years before it started giving me problems. 2 years after I had purchased it, it stopped playing CD's (even brand new ones straight out of the cases) and it began to skip.

Otherwise, I would advise you to keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"If I could rate this system as 0 stars I would, but the review form doesn't give that option.The sound quality is very low, speakers have sounded tinny and crackly since I took it out of the box. It also skips badly, to the point of being unlistenable... even on brand-new CDs fresh out of the jewel case.The only pluses are its thin design and accessibility of RCA input/output plugs. This gives you the option to either input from a better sound source, or output to a better speaker... but of course it then begs the question of why you'd want this system in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this stereo","review":"I needed a slim, unobtrusive stereo for my kitchen and thought this fit the bill. It hangs nicely on the wall, and looks great. Problem is, you can't play CD's in it without having them skip repeatedly. I have tried everything.

I wanted something cheap and easy to set up. The cheap thing was a given but I did not expect it to be so wobbly. Also the easy to set up was untrue. Granted it is easy to cut some lumber and screw it together but it took way too much time. Also, after I used the horses a few times, the metal began to bow out and made them even more wobbly.If you are looking for a one time use cheap item, this is it.

Once you insert the board, the tabs on the bracket which would somehow have to dig horizontally into the 2X4's.My hats off to those reviewers who actually got it to stand up and notice it wobbling, I never got that far. I got a refund, but wasted an hour of my life fighting them as well as a couple 2X4s. I don't know if they'd be any better, considering it's the same manufacturer, but the cheaper ones seem to have much better reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought four of these brackets at a small hardware store where I live. I didn't buy them via Amazon but I felt I needed to give a review since I'm so disappointed. The package that the sawhorse brackets came in say they're made in the USA so I opted for this brand as I like to support workers here at home. Unfortunately, the sawhorse brackets were pretty much unusable. Very difficult to assemble and, once assembled, very wobbly and unstable. The metal used to manufacture these is something about like a tuna can. Also, the instructions should include one step and that would be to get a tetanus shot beforehand. The edges to the various parts are all sharp and will cut you while you toil to put the stupid things together.I strongly advise NOT buying these pieces of junk. Put out a few extra bucks for a good set of brackets or build some sawhorses from scratch using plywood and 2X4's.I give this item a zero-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"There could not be a better time for this book!","review":"A friend gave me a copy of Hard Won Wisdom and I haven't been able to put it down.

It kept me interested throughout the whole movie in wanting to know \\"what happens next?\\"And, as with limited budget films there are uneven acting performances. Unfortunately, the actress who plays the mother cannot act to save her life. This is unfortunate as it is such a key role in the movie. Actually, with the exception of the actor who played \\"the uncle,\\" I thought all the adult performances could have been much better.I did think the acting from all the young actors playing the teenagers was quite good, especially the actor who plays the son.There were a few scenes in the movie that didn't really make sense like the huge long table used for the dining scenes where the mother sat at one end and the son the other end. Plus, I really don't think lit candles would be used for regular family dinners - very strange.All in all I do recommend seeing this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even with a limited budget","review":"Lee Whitman delivers a fascinating story that rarely goes where you expect it to.

The story develops the characters of Aki and Shazam the most, leading up to their confrontation in the game. Wolff makes Aki into a very sympathetic victim, but also creates a sympathetic and complex protagoinst with Shazam. The story exposes shortcomings in religion and in the USA. It provides a great introduction into the Japanese internment during WW2 and racism towards Asian-Americans. It makes a profound statement about the absurdity of war and the need for peace.

I have always found myself intrigued by the post WWII era.Although I was hooked from the beginning I was pleasantly surprised at the underlying complexity of the plot.

One character that was interesting to me is Shazam. Shazam is a girl who is on one of the baseball teams. She was interesting to me because of how much racism she had towards Japanese people.I did not like this book very much. I did not like it because the author had too much dialogue and not enough action. The author did a good job of describing the feelings of Shazam and how she hated Japanese people.

However, Andre never say about the born of the Jesus. Furthermore, he never celebrate the born of jesus. Maybe, he don't go to the church longtime. He also forget the spirt of chistmas. Everyone know that only 1% of japanese go the church. Most japanese go to the private shrine. Why did Andre enter the stage the japnese chidren? They don't understand the language(german & english), and also the christmas spirit. It was awkward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andre Rieu Christmas around the world","review":"What more can any one say about Andre and his orchestra what a wonderful DVD.

Great inspirational entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst computer accessory on the Market","review":"This Memorex Labelmaker is a joke. There should be a law against products like this being sold on the open market. It is virtually impossible to use for the average computer fan. The confusion is overwhelming. I note that other reviewers are far more knowledgeable than I am, yet they had similar problems. The print calibration does not work. In trying to align the printer with correction inputs shown on the vertical and horizontal axis form, it does not come close to aligning the printer. The next time I try to align the printer I get the same correction inputs even though I previously changed them considerably. The instructions are totally insufficient - not enough details. Not enough step by step instructions. I am going to have to try another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"The only thing good about this product is the applicator. The software that comes with it is horrible. First of all, the printer alignment feature doesn't work, so it is impossible to align you graphics onto the paper so they will never be centered. And even the neat feature (which I thought) of having the words in circlular pattern around the outer edge of the CD looks fine on the screen but is \\"squashed\\" on the paper and looks horrible next to the unaligned picture graphic. Do NOT buy this product until a new version is out without all these bugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very intuiative...","review":"This product is difficult to use.

Bad enough that the software was very difficult to figure out (and I have used Photoshop and others), but it just wouldn't print anything on my Epson printer.

As if ! Solution: returned the kit and bought Fellowes Neato CD Labeller kit. It works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless waste of materials","review":"This thing is a piece of junk. Not only is the program a pain to use, but it is impossible to get the printer to line up with the templates. It didn't even print in the right shape. Calibrating the printer did nothing.

This one seemed sturdy and was priced right, but some purchasers had complained about flimsy packaging that had led to parts being lost along the way. Well, I'm here to tell you that the manufacturer listened: My bed frame arrived in a cardboard box that was plastic shrink-wrapped, ensuring that the admittedly flimsy cardboard stayed together and nothing was lost. After slitting the packaging, assembly was a breeze -- no tools required. We're had it for several months now, and it's very sturdy. I also purchased a set of 1\\" risers for the casters, which keeps the bed in place and allows for underbed storage. A great product; buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Missing Parts/Damaged","review":"This bed frame seems to be very sturdy and good quality, but I was unable to keep it. The first frame arrived bent and missing all four caster/rollers. Amazon quickly and efficiently picked up the item and had another frame delivered. This second one arrived today, the box was damaged and torn, part the frame was sticking out of the box. The torn box had been poorly taped together. Really quite a mess.The frame itself was bent as both ends and had been scraped up. The casters were in the box though. Anyway. This one is going back and I requested a refund. Very disappointed it turned out that way. Amazon seems good about returns and refunds though. I appreciate that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frame is poor, but merchant is mis-advertising it","review":"The photo for this frame shows a double width center bar and sturdier legs than the actual bed frame shipped. For the bed frame I got, the wheels bent under the weight of the king bed.

After about 6 months, the video started flickering. Within a few more weeks, the visual aspect of the TV stopped working at all. Because it is an uncommon brand, most TV repair places wouldn't take it. Shipping it in out of pocket would have been extremely expensive. I finally found a place that would take it and found out this TV is a lemon. The repair guy said many flat screens have overheating problems, which is what destroyed my video board. $350 to fix.

The lyrics and orchestration are perfect compliments to Babbie's extraordinary voice. One continually expects to hear Nat King Cole and/or Ella Fitzgerald join in on several of the songs.

It's certainly the most in-depth and detailed book I've read on the subject - and I've read a lot. It's a perfect combination of Bentley's mental and physical approach to racing. While I'm not planning on making a career driving race cars, I now know exactly what it takes to do so. The chapter on the \\"complete driver\\" is fasinating, and like he says, it's almost a \\"job description\\" for a modern-day professional driver.

It was pretty easy to set up (for someone who can't seem to program the VCR) after I briefly looked at the manual and simple to use even in the car, driving. The 20-sec ESP is satisfactory, although it seems to lose bits and pieces of the song when I go over bumpy roads. (Had to check if the ESP was on couple of times and it was on.) The \\"resume\\" feature is really handy, starting off where I left off. But it seems to remember that last CD's place when I pop in a new CD. Which can be kind of annoying because I have to turn it off and on again. But the sound quality is excellent and it never skips.

I knew who the killers were even before the serial killer was executed; and for that I'm thankful because the writing style of Hailey is clunky, and his sentences are (for the most part) poorly constructed or plain dull. I found the whole idea of the protagonist being an ex-priest to be a gratuitous vessal for Hailey's anti-Christian/liberal beliefs. Maybe his police research was commendable, but his theological research was seemingly nonexistent. The questions that caused the priest to \\"lose his faith\\" are so transparent that a first year theology student would blow them out of the water, much less a PHD.I'm all for differing points of view, but only as long as they are cogent and sensical.

Why can't Cristians just take in the fact that some of what was said is true. The book isn't being biased toward christians. Its just a novel. Why does every novel have to be so perfect. He has an affair so what. Not everybody is perfect. I thought this book was great and would recommend to any one. Even though going into the past sometimes bothered me but that was okay. Some of them were good. I liked how would remind you of certain items so you don't have to flip back the pages. The book wasn't that descriptive but it was close enough. Again this book was great and i highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a classic thriller i have never read before","review":"The Novel is really classy and has covered entire picture about the Miami police. More important is it represents about the ethics of bible. The suspense is really breathtaking and interests any newcomers to thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simpley the best novel I have read in the dectective sense.","review":"As a huge fan of Haley, this is one of his best books yet. \\"Airport\\" and \\"Hotel\\" were very good books, but this far surpasses both of these. Kept you on your toes and kept you thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 or 4 short stories in one book.","review":"Having read Hailey's work many years ago (Airport, Hotel) I was dissapointed by how poorly this book flowed together. It appears Hailey tried to take many short storys, tie them together, and assemble it into a quality narrative. Though the concept of the book was a good one I would have enjoyed it better if I would have had more sense as to where the story was going. The pieces just didn't fit well together."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time and last time....","review":"....I read an Arthur Hailey book. This book was boring. It was totally predictable and shallow with far too many unimportant details. This guy should write history books instead of novels. The only reason he gets the second star is because I finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and infantile. I cannot believe Hailey wrote it.","review":"I am guessing that the author had promised the publisher a book and was not prepared to write one so hd just dashed something off without doing any research. I wonder if he used a ghost writer since I felt that this book was so far below any of his other works. As has been previously mentioned the book does not indicate any knowledge of police procedures. It also frequently talks down to the reader, assuming a third grade education apparently. I hope that this book will brove to be unique and that the author will return to the fairly high quality standard that he has observed in the past. His past works such as Hotel and Airport taught me a lot about the subject. This one is very misleading, in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Dull and boring","review":"This is my first Arthur Hailey book and I doubt that I'll be reading any more if this is representive of his body of work. I gave it 2 stars only because of the police procedural research. To read good detective fiction turn to Lawrence Block, Dennis Lehane, Raymond Chandler etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"I had to give up on this book, it was just too boring! I thought it started out pretty good, but I didn't like how the book would go back in time, and it would go into too much detail over & over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I expected alot better from Arthur Hailey. He clearly has never been in police work and did little research with those who are. I literally put the book down at times because I was laughing so hard at the \\"police procedures\\" and supposed radio dispatches and 911 calls. I am a police dispatcher and have read many books that are fictional but were very real and true to form about the law enforcement world. This was a comdey, not a mystery. I think the overall concept of the book (story line) was good, but the author should have done a lot more research and spent some time with real homicide detectives."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read....................","review":"With Detective, Arthur Hailey has pulled together a very entertaining story. As the book opens, Detective-Sergeant Malcolm Ainslie must meet with convicted serial killer Elroy Doil only hours prior to Doil's execution. Their converstation sets the wheels in motion for the intriguing twists and turns that face Ainslie - challenging his analytical skills and personal character. Hailey effectively uses flashback chapters throughout the book to set the context for current events, provide depth for the numerous characters, and to sew the seeds of numerous threads that come together at the end. Having read Airport and Hotel many years ago, it has been quite a while since I had picked up a novel by Hailey. Like those two novels, Detective was a compelling read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the mark.","review":"The book tried to give a lot of information on the working of the Detective Dept which is mostly well known. The story was carrying on well till the author deviated to other sub-plots. The characters of the story are not impressive. The details on the movements and the methodology of the Detective Dept. is boring. To a reader who is a fan of the author this will be disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never guessed the killer in a mystery, until now!","review":"The set up of a death row inmate (serial killer) claiming innocence of one particular crime is not new. Mary Willis Walker handled this sort of plot superbly in \\"Red Scream.\\" Arthur Hailey fumbles his chance. The characters are flat. A homicide detective who is an ex-priest would seem to be intrinsically fascinating. This hero is boring. His motivations for both entering and leaving the priesthood are shallow and unconvincing. The supporting police officers are so poorly drawn that they are nearly indistinguishable. The flashbacks are obtrusive and unilluminating. And I spotted the supplemental killer long before the hero did.With George, Lehane, Parker, Kellerman, Burke, and others turning out excellent new mysteries, pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Mr.Hailey uses this novel to express every left of center shibboleth to the detriment of the story,which is average. The \\"suprises\\" are telegraphed well in advance, the \\"hero's\\" lack of morals detracts from the yarn. To a reader that has read the author for twenty years this was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable with an unworthy hero.","review":"I had a difficult time with the primary character of this book. I did not like him. In a single paragraph he discusses his disdain of unethical investigative methods used by some police officers and his adulterous affair with one of his subordinates of which he is without remorse. I finished this book anyway and even though the plot had several twists it seemed that there were many warnings before each turn. There were no surprises.

While it does sharpen a dull knife, it does not do nearly as good of a job as having your knives professionally sharpened. I also fear it takes off much more metal than is necessary to achieve a new edge. Buy this only if you are exceedingly lazy about getting your knives sharpened and it won't happen any other way. Otherwise get your knives sharpened professionally. Shun will sharpen them for free if you don't mind shipping them to Japan (rolls eyes).

The front panel has all the essential buttons to navigate the player without grabbing for the remote. It's a big plus. Originally, I was waiting for Panasonic to release the DVD-A320, but Panasonic delayed their shipping date until the fall quarter. I also checked out the Toshiba SD-3109 and Sony 550. I didn't like Toshiba's dual tray design. It tookforever to pop out a disc. Since it had more gears involved, it would have greater chance of disc jam. In addition, the remote is too big. I then turned to the Sony 550. It's quite user friendly, but it still has the lip sync problem many owners talked about even though a few revision of the fireware had been released. I decided not to take the chance. My final winner is the JVC 701."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great player-User friendly-Reasonably priced","review":"I bought this player several months back and have been happy ever since.

They gave me a reset procedure that worked, but only temporarily. My player continued to have this same problem on other disks as well. I also encountered some MAJOR audio and video distortion while watching \\"Notting Hill\\". I took that disk to a friends house and it played perfectly with no prblems whatsoever on his RCA player.

I am curious if the unit has major malfunction problems and just how many other people are having the same problems? Do not buy this machine. JVC refuses to stand behind the warranty and is giving some excuse about the manufacturers date being the date their warranty starts. This is one to keep clear of.

Neatly summarizing line choices, fly styles, and presentations, this book will quickly and informatively prepare you to face almost any situation you can expect on a stillwater fishery.

Recipes are inspiring to read but must be tinkered with to succeed. Usually cooking time and temperature are the culprits but occasionally even ingredient quantities are off. But this has been our experience with most Martha Stewart recipes (they don't seem carefully tested before publication). Try all recipes before planning your dinner party and take notes. Analyze what happens and note how to fix method for next attempt. You will learn from this process but will probably throw your first results down the disposal.

But, anyhow, they just don't work.However, there is a bright side to her books (hence, the extra star) they are very entertaining to read. You can certainly gain some inspiration and creativity from her books, but just look for a receipe elsewhere.Her books are NOT for the everyday cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring but impractical for everyday use","review":"I really enjoy browsing through this cookbook, however, I've found it impractical for everyday use. Many of the recipes call for unusual and hard to find (translation-expensive) items. For example, about 85-90% of the hors d'ouvre recipes call for caviar, at least as a garnish. My warning to you is expect to spend extra money on groceries to make most of these recipes. Also, as many of the gourmet recipes take many steps to prepare, expect to spend awhile in the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"<sigh>","review":"This is a book for the hungry.

These blessed men are long gone now and we still enjoy their great comic acts. I would be sick to read lies about them and assume they were true.

It is interesting to identify Healy's many other stooges, but claiming them as unknown integral members of the Three Stooges stretches the imagination too far. 3rd party recollections and rumors are relied to report medical histories and homicide conspiracies.

Anna Fang was one of my favourite characters. She was brave and daring, and tried to do whatever she could for the Anti-Traction league. Hester's story is sad. Tom is scared and brave at the same time. They all have lots of adventures and the sequels get even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"mortal engines","review":"Mortal Engines by Philip Reeve is a book about a boy named Tom. He lives in the future when towns move, and eat each other. Tom's hero Theodore Valentine comes on board and a girl tries to kill him. Tom chases her and she jumps down the rubbish chute, then Valentine comes and pushes Tom over, afraid that Tom knows his secret. This book is meant for teens and young adults and definitely fantasy readers. The cover will pull you to the book because of the town and the two characters standing on the side of the cover. The best part of the book was when Tom was on the pirate town because he was thought of as a well respected person, but he was a third apprentice, that's pretty funny. The worst part of the book was the ending because it left you hanging. I liked the whole book because I like fantasies in the future. The copyright of the book is 2001. The publisher is scholastic. 2-2-05"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll never see a book like this again","review":"Mortal Engines is one of those books that creates a world that is so fantastical that you can't beleive it but somehow it feels at if it is real. I love the way the several story lines weave together and you see diferent characters from totally diferent points of view. I also enjoy how there is a sort of 16 century flare to a book set far into the future.

The plot fits better with a comic book series than with a novel.Only 2 major characters (and maybe one minor one) survive the book. Everyone else (including bit players) dies, generally without advancing the plot much.I was also offended that the 2-dimensional comic-book villians were called \\"Engineers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! 5 Stars all the way...","review":"You have to hear it to believe it.

I long ago lost my copy when I loaned it out to someone. I recently found a copy of Vaughan's second book, Brandywine's War: Back In Country. Reading this inspired me to find Brandywine's War on Amazon as fast as I could. If you were there, you'll recognize the antics such as the \\"Vector Control Officer\\" (which my unit did at Fort Campbell after our return from Vietnam).

The neo-psych \\"Time Seller\\" is worth the price of admission alone. It is a shame that Cherry Red didn't not see fit to include the classic \\"After Tea\\" single side on this release, like previuos issues of this record.It is really cool to have a look back at the group and the times (1968) with the CD ROM.

George Stone thoughtfully and economically reviews centuries of Celtic and Nordic cultural development, touching on the emergence of these \\"barbarian\\" peoples and tracking their countless accomplishments as they made their way across Europe and around the world. Celts in Iceland? Vikings in the Middle East? America discovered ages before Columbus? Warp spasms, silver hoards, Tolkien? The breadth of this book is simply astonishing. The author's use of literary genius, from Greek and Roman records (including notes by Strabo and Caesar) to Celtic and Nordic epics and sagas adds richness and incomparable depth to this wondrously illustrated volume. The National Geographic Society-and the title's young author-are to be commended. This is the best book I've read all year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quilter from Texas","review":"Great book!

I didn't see a way to mess with the LEDs themselves, they seem permanently in place. After hanging the lights, that section would occasionally light up. Then a section on another string went out. I haven't been able to get that section going again.

I loved that song, full of pride in his nation and tongue-in-cheek jabs at his homeland. So 24 1/2 years later I decided to buy his Greatest Hits CD. I wish I hadn't. It destroyed a lot of memories. L'Italiano is still what it was when I first heard him sing it. The rest of the album is almost a throwaway. There are one or two other bright spots, but by and large, all the songs blend into a techno mush, none of them really standing out from the other. If you really want to own a copy of the song L'Italiano, maybe there's a less expensive way, or a collection with other artists that makes it a better investment.

Since five years ago when they started on this journey, they have graced the stages of such local hot spots as Newby's, B.B King's Blues Bar and The Flying saucer, just to mention a few. Their roots rock but mostly pop feel draws packed houses and sold out shows. Notice I said the words \\"roots rock.\\" and \\"pop\\" That's just my opinion of their music. you can sense lot's of Tom Petty in their melodies, then in \\"I don't think she knows\\" it has obvious influences of John Cougar Mellencamp. Blues can also be found intertwined into this creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix of Rock and Blues. Excellent CD!","review":"This CD rocks! You can really feel the Memphis sound. My favorites are \\"I don't think she knows\\", \\"The secret world of Charles Kuralt\\" and \\"All Because of You\\".This band has great harmony and acustisics.

I have had no problem with them falling apart but then I don't pile them with huge amounts of food; I simply use a thin spread like goat cheese, baba ganoush or hummus w/ veggies, cheese, salmon, or faux poultry products.

It was so annoying, I couldn't believe Dinah would let the \\"hijackers\\" of the storyline lead her around. I mean, if she was really as intent on finding her \\"yellow-bellied snake\\" of a fiance, then she wouldn't be going on wild goose chaces all over the country. I was mostly on Seth's side throughout the book. Get the storyline moving in a different direction. And all the people jumping in to give soooooo much opinions at the same time was soooooo annoying.

I have been doing Yoga from TV and Sara Bates's DVD for several years now and wanted to hook my son to it but this DVD grossly underperformed despite the positive reviews I read here on Amazon on it. I wished the teacher would have gone more slowly introducing every one of the poses instead of rushing through them, going from basic poses to some very challenging ones without proper education of them in sequence and labeling them within 20-30 minutes. This was unlike any of the good programs I've been involved in whether in real life or in DVD form. A big disappointment to both my son and me. We used my DVDs instead to do Yoga together and enjoyed my DVDs a lot more than this one which was supposed to have been geared towards children being introduced to Yoga!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake reviews","review":"Some of the reviews on here are fake, just a heads up.

We watched it as a family and I laughed until the tears started. It is a goofy show about taking a chance to find romance. We later invited some close friends to watch it with us and got the same response. In fact it was even funnier to watch my buddy laugh until he could scarcely breathe. The two boys are brothers from Texas. Their Dad has an accident hitting two boys on their bikes. While they are healing at the house, they are all just sitting around chatting and one of the boys shows a picture of his family so every one can see. Elliot, the one in the gray tee, looks at the picture and falls head over heals for this guys sister. He figures out a plan to meet her, so he and his brother go to Idaho to meet her. The plan is quite unique, they pretend to be the family's exchange students from Hungary, and it gets very funny from there on. They eventually get figured out but the ending is good. I love this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Title","review":"I \\"took a chance\\" on this movie.

It attributes to Sanger quotes from other sources, as though they were her words.Amazon should be ashamed to sell this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killer Lies","review":"The only thing worse than this book, is someone actually believing it to be based on facts. It is a wicked defamation of Ms Sanger's character for the author to express a pro-life platform.\\"No woman can call herself free who does not own and control her own body. No woman can call herself free until she can choose conscientiously whether she will or will not be a mother.\\" --Margaret Sanger"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much here","review":"There's no original research here; as is clear from the footnotes, the author has just taken material from standard biographies of Sanger and used it to present her in the most negative light possible. Sanger did favor eugenics (as did most people in her era), and she was a socialist, and she had a rather unorthodox family life. There isn't much argument about the facts. But to use these facts to portray her as a monster of iniquity (and a worse murderer than Stalin or Hitler) is just silly. Actually, Sanger's work has almost certainly reduced the incidence of abortion by making birth control more accessible and reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just more anti-birth control bias!","review":"From the first words it is obvious that the author has his own agenda--just as he says Margaret did! And since his agenda is to deny the basic human right to control one's life, naturally he thinks she was a \\"bad person.\\" He is very confused & illogical in that he thinks birth control is a religious issue, not the freedom issue it is. I do not care if he wishes not to use birth control--that is his right. However, I do not want him telling me I can not. He further confuses the issue by painting Planned Parenthood as only an abortion provider. Whereas, 95% of their work is preventing abortions! Yes Mr Grant, using birth control \\"religiously\\" is the surest way to prevent abortions, like it or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I load of crap","review":"This author has no clue what he is taking about. He is continuing to spread a lie that is only confusing people. Margaret Sanger was a great woman who fought for other women to have the right to have control over their own body.His rant on birth control is mind numbing. Birth control prevents abortions and Planned Parenthood wants to prevent abortions. Yes they provide abortions, but they also provide health services to uninsured women, fight for women to have a say to what happens to their bodies, and educates all on proper sex education. Margaret Sanger would be proud of what Planned Parenthood has become. There are much better and truthful books on Margaret then this one.

Some are quite beautiful (We In Music's track is perfection), and all are keeping with the overdone glitz and cheesy angst that define the electro genre.I don't know what the other reviewers are complaining about. The mixing is fine. It's electroclash, it's meant to be dirty, fuzzy, lo-fi, what have you. But make no mistake, these tracks FLOW tightly and impeccably into one another. For how different they are, that's a feat that not many could pull off, but Felix does it.A gorgeous blend with the usual suspects (no surprises here: Ladytron, Miss Kittin, Zoot Woman, and even an appearance from Felix's alter-ago, Aphrohead) that's perfect for chilling or dancing or driving. I own every single Felix album released and this one is definitely one of his best, especially for those wanting some less abrasive electroclash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers","review":"This episode is about when jealousy spreads on between the hot yellow ranger and the sexy pink ranger.Theirs a club competition going on at angel grove and Kimberely gets no one to sign up for her club but Trini's club is off the walls so theirs a little bit of jealousy going on.Uh oh.It looks like theirs a cat fight.Plus Lord zedd has created a flower monster to send the pink ranger to her doom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go MMPR!","review":"i realllly like Kimberly and in Bloom of Doom she is not herself. it's new club week in Angel Grove and everybody signs of for Trini's vollyball club, but not for Kimberly's flower club!

The last section of the book was the best, since, to me it seemed more relevant than the rest. I read this book last summer, along with several other books concerning the same subject material, and I don't think Wang Hui is the best, but he is not the worst either, but most of the problems with this book are due to the translation.

It's a pity she couldn't have put some that energy into a coherent story.From what I understand, this novel has its roots in a roleplaying game. Being a gamer myself, the influences are obvious. One can almost *hear* the dice rattling as plot points are decided.The characterization is... much like what one would expecct from characters inspired by tabletop roleplay. The language is anachronistic, not at ll in keeping with the high fantasy aim of the book. There's a lot of gratuitious sexual situations, or sex-motivated situations, and Big Evily Things that are... Evil! Because!This book was so bad, the bookstore owner tried to talk me out of buying it! Honestly, it makes Eragon look like the pinnacle of craftsmanship.

But any self-respecting human being that does not enjoy the excruciating pain of lifeless characters and awkward sentence structure probably wouldn't. I returned it. I got through chapter 5. This book is supposed to be some sort of horror/fantasy novel. I suspect that at some point in the book, some sort of undead villian would appear.

Look, if that works for you, more power to you, but what I want out of a juice book is two things - great recipes and some fun. This book has both. The recipes are outstanding - you'll find some drinks in here that at first glance seem a little strange, maybe even disturbing, but give them a try and you'll never go back to just fresh squeezed orange juice.

Two of them are EXACTLY the same, and the third is exactly like the others but with wheatgrass added.) It would only be helpful if you're so uncertain of juicing that you don't know what you like and are unwilling to experiment without a book telling you what to do.

(Maybe that enhances the review.) This book is a sad, mournful dirge, with broken and corrupted characters, expertly portrayed and set against each other on an unnamed Caribbean island (though it is assumed by all to be Trinidad). The book gives the reader a palpable sense of foreboding, tension and despair: you know from the get-go there will be no happy ending. If this is not considered to be amongst Naipaul's best efforts, then that says much about him, since this book is reflective of a great talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't compare to Naipaul's best.","review":"There are some great descriptions of the island in this book but the plot seems labored and the action too slow.

Attenborough is the ultimate ecology teacher - he guides the viewer through the various biomes of the earth, picking out a variety of amazing phenomena to show us, and he lets us soak in the beauty of each realm. Rather than focusing on birds or mammals, we learn about the whole spectrum of the natural world, from fish to fungi, insects to people.

We all agreed the hard limit for sisters is no poaching under any circumstances. If you are so competitive or self-centered or dumb that you cross the line, don't expect to be forgiven.

Ms. McInerney saved the characters from stereotype quite nicely by allowing them their flaws...the grandmother is a bit of a compulsive liar, the eldest sister a society climber, the youngest too certain of her own charm. The only flaw was the ending...when the main storyline ends and the sisters have resolved their conflicts and there's still 40 pages yet to go, you just know something bad's about to happen. And while the author hints at this throughout the book, the ending felt a bit unnecessary. I would've liked it better if it ended when the plot had been resolved, rather than where it actually does. Still, well worth a read if you like quirky families, lovely romances and memorable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Disagree.....","review":"It has taken me a month to read this book and I'm still not quite done.

As it was, I became less and less interested and finally bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most manipulative grandmother ever?","review":"I've enjoyed all McInerney's novels to date except this one.

Sad to see that her next book is Lola's Secret - enough with Lola already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Although slow to begin with, this was easy enough to read, but did fall into that category of \\"a bit of a waste of reading time\\", unless you had a particular reason for reading it. The basic idea (the story of three sisters from a small town in South Australia who all end up back in that town together as adults after years of avoiding one another, and rediscover that closeness) and the setting appealed, but the story itself is very simplistic to the point that it makes you cringe at times. And the book is not particularly \\"true to label\\" - in an attempt to pack a punch and give the exploration of the sisters' relationships a real focus, it adds a storyline which takes the book into very different territory and which seems at odds with its brief and promise. Presumably this is intended to either shock you or engage your emotions - but for me, it just came across as a cheap trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not better than OK","review":"Not deep enough to work through, and not \\"grabbing\\" enough to keep you reading. Then, finally, as the book is wrapping up, a \\"twist\\" that just doesn't bring anything to the book. The author has much potential, the characters were wonderful, but next time hopefully a better end product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do it for me","review":"I love chick lit but this book just didn't do it for me. I didn't like any of the sisters and struggled to relate to them. They did some horrible things to each other - I can understand why they weren't talking! I understand its a book about forgiveness and the strength of the family bond but I didn't buy into the making up. This isn't a light, fluffy read. I struggled to finish it. If you are after something a bit more serious and thought provoking then you might like it more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND & MONEY W/THIS!!!!!","review":"I bought this CD because of all the great reviews. Unfortunatly this thing turned out to be useless and was surprised how amateur this thing is. Besides the fact of poor recording and static noises poping here and there while you're trying to 'tune out' the steps and suggestions to help you deepen your state are laughable and become quite annoying.Guided meditation just like hypnosis differs from meditation by having someone gradually guide you through the process. There's nothing gradual here or anything close of resemblance of a \\"guided\\" meditation.I think you have to be on some serious drugs in order to find this even slightly effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meditations by a Valley Girl","review":"The narrator's voice was so sing-song I thought I was listening to a Valley Girl.

This might be good if you are four years of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective in Stopping the Mind","review":"I have been practicing meditation and yoga for many years and yet found this CD very effective in stopping the mind. Mary gently reminds us to witness our thoughts, calm our spirit and let ourselves glide naturally into a relaxed state. Richard's beautiful music supports her words by nurturing and soothing us. Surrendering to their loving coaxing allows me to really let all thoughts go and experience an \\"ease of being\\".The mind can be very stubborn and is drawn by our thoughts into an agitated state. With the assistance from the CD my mind truly relaxes and becomes peaceful and merges with my heart. Then my mind becomes my friend. The Ease of Being fills a need at a time when we are challenged more than ever to find time to relax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the sample before you buy!","review":"I was so excited over the reviews this CD got that I went ahead and bought it w/o listening to the sample. Boy, was that a mistake! This woman's voice is so annoying! She hesitates and pauses so frequently and sounds very uncomfortable. This in turn makes me uncomfortable and I can't relax. I've tried using it several times because of the money I paid, but I just end up agitated and turning it off.

In this case, either the positive reviews come from people trying to promote the item or from people who have extremely low expectations regarding the quality of the item. It's very poorly made, both in terms of content and production quality (and I say that as someone who doesn't tend to nitpick about such things). It gives the impression that someone thought it was a good idea to spontaneously create some meditations and record them with amateur recording equipment. If this woman had used these meditations as rough drafts and honed them until their quality was greatly improved and then used professional equipment to record them, she might have come up with a five star product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am good at meditation and I only bought this CD because I wanted to experience what it is like to get into guided meditation, feeling the \\"company\\" of someone else's voice.I was very disappointed. The author uses endless sentences, very long phrases that, instead of helping, keep the listener waiting for her next words, wondering what she is going to say next or when she is going to finally put a semi-colon or a stop. More than guided meditation this looks like a lecture on how to meditate, a lecture one should have to *listen to* and *think about*. Though her voice and tone are correct, at times, the author seems to be looking for the right word, which rather than helping the listener keeps him wondering what is coming next... and hoping it comes soon.In my opinion, short and repetitive phrases should be used in meditation- most specially with beginners- and that is precisely what the author has failed to provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed","review":"I have numberous meditation CDs and with all the good reviews I was very disappointed in this one. I listened to the first track - centering, and the third track - emotions, and thought both sounded more like a talk on the concept rather than a guided meditation.

I was very disappointed in this one. I found myself totally distracted throughout by the background noises that keep you from getting to a place of deep relaxation. My first thought was that it was made in someone's kitchen while they were making dinner, or doing the dishes. I also felt the imagery did not flow in a manner that was soothing at all. It is too wordy and you find yourself struggling with it instead of relaxing. I'm sorry to say I actually found this CD to be stressful. I would totally not recommend this one - there are some terrific ones out there. Keep looking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Calming","review":"This was the first guided meditation CD I ever bought.

I find her voice to be extremely annoying. as some other reviewers mention, she pauses in a very irritating manner. She doesn't pause where you should have silence to encourage relaxation or visualization but just in a constant halting manner and you want to scream just talk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"In this crazy and pressurized world, we all could use some of the great relaxation provided by The Ease of Being. This is a great audio resource for getting back to a more restful, balanced place after a bad day at work, or just overload, as in my case with two jobs and more. The Maddux's CDs are all such wonderful balms for the soul. The music is soft and ethereal, not rhythmic or intrusive. The narration is simple and easy to follow and very, very comforting. This is not guided imagery but just gentle reminders to stop trying so hard. Each of the 3 Tracks is different and effective in its own way, my favorite is the Healing Meditation.I highly recommend the Ease of Being as well as these other great CDs:The Soul of Healing Meditations by Deepak ChopraYour Present by Susie MantellGuided Meditations for Developing Calmness, Awareness, and Love by BodhipaksaAll of these will help to get through the hard times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD on Centering and Healing","review":"The soothing voice and beautiful, gentle music blend together to bring peace and stress relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Relaxation CD","review":"This was the first guided meditation CD I ever tried, and years later it is still the best.

I didn't give five stars because the knob to adjust the grind on top loosens every now and then-no biggie-just tighten it up again. This doesn't happy often so I'm still very happy with my super cute pepper mill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little gadget","review":"Attractive-looking. Clever design. The handle is very easy to turn. The different options (fine to coarse) for grind are nice. It's hard to get it to stay on \\"fine\\", since the direction the handle twists pushes the dial towards \\"coarse\\", but I like coarsely-ground pepper, so I don't mind. The handle looks a little cheaply made, but it isn't a problem (it's pretty durable). Conclusion: this is a good small-size pepper grinder. Included peppercorns are nice, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous product, but doesn't last long","review":"I bought this in January with a gift certificate I got to a cooking store.

However, just now, as I was making salsa, the bottom of it cracked, a chunk of plastic fell out and peppercorns fell in my salsa... I had to pick peppercorns & fish a piece of plastic out of my salsa. I am so disappointed. I haven't even owned it a year and it's broken already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but nice","review":"Wider than it looks, this pepper mill holds a good 2-3 oz. of peppercorns and puts out a fine stream of ground pepper with very little effort. My wife and I got tired of twisting a round grinder top. The style is OK, if uninspired, and if results are what you want in the kitchen, this clear acrylic and chrome grinder does a good job.

I mixed just enough for 3 to 4 LEDs at a time and on the 4th the stuff is barely spreadable.

There are 10 million photos in this collection! If you like English historical romances, this is one presented in a very unique way.

That being said, I feel that this album is more modern sounding than the other two. They have added some horns into the mix (ie. \\"Suits and Ski Masks\\") that add a jazzier feel as well as losing a bit of that really rootsy studio sound that they have captured so well in the past.

Perry and Perdita leave their home in the states to go to Scotland where Perry has a grant to study the marine life along the shores of Loch Ness. But the reader will pick up on clues that all is not what it seems. At times the dark elements had me guessing at Perry's true nature and gave the tale a sort of \\"What Lies Beneath\\" feel.

Don't bother. Phyllis Reynolds takes her traumatized 8 year old daughter, Celia, to the Lakeside clinic for treatment. She, nor I, knew what she was getting into. The Doctors put scary thoughts into her head, there are creepy noises which they made her listen to and terrifying things came to life at her command. Celia's daddy has just gotten out of prison for abusing her and is on his way to get them. PHyllis has a relationship with Paul Welch and also with Dr. John at the clinic. If this is disconnected, that is what the book is. I doubt I will read another George unless it is given to me, free and clear and I have nothing else to read.

You may have seen him on DATELINE NBC regarding his \\"snake handling\\" Sand Mountain topic. Regarding Lizard, if you're familiar with Birmingham, AL many of the landmarks will be familiar to you.

This mill is the perfect size and grinds fast and effortlessly unlike the mills that you have to turn a small knob or the top or squeeze two pieces together making you almost decide not to use a mill. The fine, meduim and course adjustments are quick and easy to choose and a great idea for cooking when you may need different size grinds.

The main flaw with the guide is the index which is inadequate. For example, if you want to find the opening hours of one of the museums in Vienna, you have the skim through the entire Vienna section of the book in hopes that the name of the museum will jump out at you because the museum will most likely not be in the index.

It's not that it has any bugs or anything, it's just that the gameplay is that bad.On a positive note, it does have great graphics and an excellent musical soundtrack. But, I spent $30 for a game, not a screen saver and some MP3s. Overall, it's a bad game, and one that I have no desire to finish.

The characters were utterly shallow and cartoonish, especially the men. Instead of giving the men names, the author could have just called 'em The Rapist, The Bad Father, The Bad Man, and The Good Man. Or he could have collectively named them The Straw Men. How much more interesting it would have been if Dante and what's his name -- The Good Man -- had been a single character. That would have given some heft to Dolores' decision to stay or go. Although Dolores was better sketched, she was still only allowed (by the author) to have one defining trait at any giving time.There was simply nothing creative about this book. Anyone could have written it.For all the reviewers out there who can't believe a man could have written such a great female character, check out Norman Rush's \\"Mating.\\" A much, much better example."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a waste of time or paper?","review":"Yuck.

And all the declorations I'd heard about how \\"insightful\\" Wally Lamb was when it came to chronicalling the difficulties of growing up fat for girls fell totally flat. I thought the entire thing was dreadful. The only even slight redemption at all was the very, very end. Tip for Mr. Lamb: next time, make your main character at least a LITTLE bit likeable if you expect us to have any sympathy for her. Heaping trauma on someone does not make them likeable if they have a basically distasteful personality/disposition to begin with. Men writing female characters always seem to be a problem -- there's rarely any real depth or insight -- and Wally Lamb doesn't seem to be the exception to that rule at ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is he thinking?","review":"I admit that I read every word...mainly because I was waiting for something redeeming to happen.

I hated her vulnerablility, her disappointment. The events that happened in her life that were not of her doing. Thats just to name a few of her experiances in this book. I hated her with every essence of my being. I thought she was stupid and self-destructive. I continued to read even though she disgusted me out of pure spite because I paid for the book and I was not going to waste my money. But, at the end of the book, after following this girl through her formative years and early adulthood, I realized why I hated her so much. She reminded me of me. I was not suicidal, but I had a couple of life events that altered my self image and made me lose me. Read this book, it may hurt a little, but it helps alot.

Thank you Mr.Lamb for forever changing my outlook on life.-Nicole Bec"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grow up and quit whining!","review":"At least that is what I kept thinking through thefirst two-thirds of this book! And yet, hereI am suggesting that reading this book is worthsomebody's while! Now, for a last third of a bookto accomplish such a feat makes it worth muckingthrough the first two-thirds! I can't personallyimagine a better review!I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Lamb's writing style andoften found it somewhat witty but that would befar from calling this book hilarious! It is anenjoyable read, just make sure you don't give upuntil you have at least read three-fourths of theway through!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"how could this book get a better rating than a classic","review":"it had it's good points. but i don't see how this book was better than any of the others i have read. the title and cover art were good."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I kept waiting for Dolores to finally take control of her life and instead was \\"treated\\" to a book full of constant whining of how terrible life was. HATED THE BOOK. Reinforced the belief if Oprah recommends it I want nothing to do with it. Life is too short to waste on books like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"This book came highly recommended from a friend of mine. When I picked up the book at the store, I noticed that it was an Oprah selection. This should have been warning enough to put it back. I managed to finish the book but it was quite a struggle. I found the characters shallow, annoying and I had absolutely no sympathy for Dolores. The only reason why I kept on reading was that my friend insisted that I would come to love the main character.This is a great book to read when travelling - it is simple, uncomplicated, does not require any thinking on the reader's part, and it is in no way difficult to put down should you decide to pursue other activities"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and uninteresting.","review":"I REALLY tried to like this book. I put it down and picked it up at least a dozen times (still trying to finish it and over half way through). The main character is SO HORRENDOUS! She makes me insane. You know, I've loved books about unsympathetic crazy people in the past, but this one misses the mark. Maybe they've got to be written by women to make that emotional connection. It wasn't that Wally Lamb's writing style was bad even. He's a very good writer - it's the people he chooses to create that are so miserable."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRID!","review":"This was, by far, the worst book I have ever read. This book has absolutely no redeeming qualities and does little more than glorify spite and immaturity. The male characters are absolutely horrific - narcissistic adulterers and rapists - while the \\"heroine\\" is a emotional black hole. The story is full of tired cliches and stereotypes. I sincerely hope that men don't turn to this book for insight into the female psyche. \\"She's Come Undone\\" is an insult to any intelligent woman. It certainly shouldn't appeal to any discerning man either. I am ashamed I wasted my time reading it. I would have given it 0 stars but that wasn't an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"It ripped scabs off of old wounds.","review":"I was a fat child and fat teen. This book brought back all the horror, pain and alienation of being different, of not being socially acceptable. Though my life has been considerably happier (thankfully) than Dolores', we traveled many of the same emotional paths. I couldn't put the book down. I cried through much of it. How Mr. Lamb could know all the interwoven emotions of a girl overcoming these problems is beyond me. Cudos to Wally Lamb."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This book is absolutely amazing! Could NOT put it down! I finished it in only 3 days. Amazing. Brilliant writing style. You really pull for the main character and want to see her succeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Story","review":"This book was very intriguing, the story winds through this woman's life while she goes through some devastating events. It keeps you interested throughout the book and her life and you end up pulling for her until the end of the story. The descriptions and writing is very good which makes you even more interested in a wanting to see what happens way."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really hated this book","review":"I read this book almost two decades ago, when I was still very young, and I found it trite even then. How this book received such a grand response is beyond me. I suppose it's the novelty of an overweight heroine. I absolutely hated everything about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Come Undone....","review":"I thought this was a revelation. I have not been able to put this down once I started. It was an emotional journey through the stages of one Dolores Price. At times I could identify with the protagonist in regards to her sense of false-security, self-deprication and fear of abandonment. I became so emotionally involved in this book that I was almost relieved when I finished so I could \\"let go\\" and continue with the journey of my own life. I highly recommend this book. But be prepared to experience an abundance of emotions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an amazing book!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I could not wait for every second I could steal away to read it. (No skimming pages in this one!) I cannot believe that this book is written by a man, as he just KNOWS every thought realistically that a young girl, then woman, Dolores, has in this book! Doesn't that sound funny? It IS his character, after all. I totally connected with the girl in this book. We had SO many similarites in life, I found it astounding. I cannot recommend this book enough, it holds your interest from page one, and there is not one single boring word in it...no downtime. Very interesting, it was like I was carrying around my own comfortable, and oftentimes UNcomfortable memoirs. Thank you, Mr. Lamb. I can't wait to read the rest of your books, as this was my first."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to put it down","review":"I read this book in one sitting, staying up all night to finish it. I wasn't going to leave Dolores Price until I knew she was going to be alright. A born survivor, she will become a heroine of your heart as you come to know and love her. This is one of the most amazing novels I have ever read. I also read Mr. Lamb's \\"I Know This Much is True\\" and found that too left an impact on me. Mr. Lamb has a gift for making people come alive off the page. You will remember Dolores Price long after you finish her story. This book is a definite must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful, insightful, introspective","review":"this book makes you think...makes you think about your own inner demons, and finding your own place in this world. i'm only halfway through and it's stirred up so much emotion in me. i want to cheer Dolores on and other times I want to kill her for her choices!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needless suffering","review":"Sometimes beautiful writing elevates a sad story to universality and dignity. In this book, the writing is like a butterfuly being crushed again and again by a pointlessly depressing mallet of a storyline. The heroine goes through hell, and I still hated her. That should not be! What makes readers want to moil around in the darkness this book creates and stay there for the days and days it takes to read it? If free-floating sadness is your bag, I guess this is the book for you. Otherwise, run."},{"rating":"1","title":"A depressing read","review":"The book cover say that this book is \\"hilarious\\" and touchingly funny. I would say this book is neither and is merely depressing. If you are looking for an entertaining, fun, up-lifting read, do not read this book. The book includes themes of divorce, rape, nervous breakdowns, institutionalization, dealth of just about every loved one that exists, HIV/AIDS . . . . At about 3/4's of the way through it, I began to wonder if ANYTHING good was EVER going to happen to the main character. Finally about 25 pgs. before the end, it brightened up a bit but with still very weighty material mixed in.I think the author is very talented. He DID make me feel he had a great idea of what it is like to be a woman. His style is great too. But that is the best part of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually liked it!","review":"I was expecting this book to be really lame, but I just finished it a few hours ago, and I must say that Wally Lamb is actually a very talented writer. Sure, the book is not perfect. There are flaws- overly simplified characters, sentimental plot wrap-ups at the end. But nonetheless, the story itself is captivating. It's nice to know Lamb was successful in creating a character who you could both be angry with, and ultimately care about.. I really got a sense of who Dolores Price was and why she made the choices she did. That in itself, is enough to recommend this book. On a side note, Lamb did manage to capture what it feels like to be a young woman, at least for *some* of us young women.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Dolores Price is one of the most intriguing characters that I have ever encountered. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, though some parts were difficult (emotionally) to read. After I finished reading it, I passed it along to my older sister. Many ages and types of people can enjoy this book. However, some parts are graphic and can be disturbing, so be careful. I hope you enjoy She's Come Undone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming full circle to the real you","review":"This book was great each chapter brought a new suprise in Dolore's life. From rape, death and mental illness Dolore's has alot to go through before she discovers the real her. I'm glad Dante wasn't a permanent fixture in her life. He was self absorbed and used Dolores to make himself feel superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a must read!!!","review":"Some of the reviews state that Wally Lamb has no connection to a woman's psyche. Well I must disagree...as I am a woman. I kept having to look at the cover to double check that yes, a man wrote this book. I saw many reminders of my own fights with weight and other issues one faces while growing up. This was a wonderfully written book, I highly, highly recommend it to anyone...Male, Female, young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A disturbing yet suprisingly vivid portrayel of a girl.","review":"Wally Lamb uses a combonation of descriptive writing style and realistic charecters to foretell the rite of passage for a young insecure female. This is one of the best books written about women because of the fact it was written by a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"His story was extraordinary","review":"I was amazed at how well he can convincingly write from a woman's point of view. Specific feelings and certain motivations that women can understand and identify with. One of the best books I've read in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely absorbing - loved it.","review":"I really, really enjoyed this book. It's very well-written and moves quickly. One of the best things about this book is that it's written by a man. I was amazed at how well Wally Lamb was able to handle a female main character and portray her in a believable manner. I was moved to tears several times and found Dolores Price to be an unforgettable character. She's not your typical protagonist --- as much as I liked this book I'm not quite sure if I liked her or not. Some friends who've also read this book found her extremely frustrating because they felt like she wallowed in her misery. I disagree and found her reactions to be very touching. But, even if you don't quite get Dolores it's still a good read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"As other reviewers have noted, I did find this book rather depressing. I did notice a dip in my mood as I was reading it. However, not all good books are feel-good tomes full of sunshine and rainbows.It is a testament to the skill of Wally Lamb that I cannot forget Delores Price. In many ways, her story is haunting. She deals poorly with immense obstacles throughout most of the book. She often makes the wrong choices. She struggles with food addictions, abuse, abandonment issues, and attachment problems. She is flawed as hell. But, by the end of the novel, her story is oddly redemptive. Although it did dampen my mood for a week or so, I'm glad I read She's Come Undone. I will definitely read more novels by Lamb; he's on to something."},{"rating":"2","title":"You go, Delores!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I loved Delores and was cheering for her throughout the novel. Wally Lamb captured Delores' coming-of-age, and her tragedies and triumphs better than many female authors could! I'm anxiously awaiting future novels from this talented writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try it, you'll like it","review":"If you like People Magazine and Entertainment Tonight, you'll like She's Come Undone. There's nothing wrong with People or ET, in fact they can often be informative, funny and thought provoking. They stand, however, on a certain intellectual level, one that doesn't rise too high, but is worth taking a look at, nonetheless. This novel is compelling, heart wrenching, hilarious, and poignent. It is also cliche, easy, and light. Bring it on a plane, bring it to the beach. Read it, so you can talk about it with everyone else who has read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the absolute best book I've ever read. Fabulous.","review":"This is the absolute best book I've ever read. The book is written in the simplest terms, and it grabs you when you start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!!!","review":"I read this book about a year ago. I thought it was one of the best books I have ever read. It took me about 4 days to read it. I could not put it down. I am always checking to see when his next book is comming out. I loved this book so much I gave it to my mom to read and she loved it so much she recommended it to people to read and so on!! The life of Dolores was very interesting and the feelings were so real. What a great book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Mediocrity","review":"Mr. Lamb managed to capture my attention by promising a smart, funny, slighly cynical coming of age novel-but really let me down with Delores. She is the product of the first thought of a fat abused woman that comes to the most unimaginitive of minds. This book made me feel as if all humankind has some dirty motive behind it's every action. There are thousands of books out there so much more worth my while, and worth the while of all those people who read this book at Oprah's bidding. Kudos to her for bringing forth unknown authors, but there is a reason some should remain unknown......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Distasteful.","review":"My husband's cousin loaned me this book while the family was on a cruise together celebrating my mother-in-law's 60th birthday. I had already gone through my stack of reading material and looked forward to this book, which I had considered purchasing, but which hadn't made the final cut. Overall I found it distasteful. The characters were unsympathetic. The situations were unrealistic. The only deep feeling this book invoked was disgust. Why be miserable ? Avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those with depression","review":"this is an excellent book that really resonated with me as someone who suffers from depressionHide & Seek: How I Laughed at Depression, Conquered My Fears and Found Happiness"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I could NOT put this book down. It's now one of my top recommendations to friends and family. One of my favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I am 13 years old. i saw this book in a book club cataloug once and the name stuck in my head. i saw it on sale at a book sale and bought it excitidely. then i sat down at home with some snacks, and read the whole book. i was entranced through the whole thing. Lamb's ability to captivate exactly how Dolores wouuld feel, and get you to feel for her. How everything came together at the end. This book is one of many, which i will read again and again. i read all the time, books which my mom tells me i am too young for, but gives to me in abundance anyway. reading is my passion, and Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone\\" made it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"If you ever thought your life was \\"bad\\" or not going the way you wanted it to...you should try walking in Doloris's shoes. If anything bad in the world could happen--it was going to happen to Doloris Price. This book is a must read. It is about not only personal triumphs, but about the spirit of a woman that cannot settle for what life has chosen to give her."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better","review":"A friend of mine advised me not to read this book, but I was curious as to what all of the hoopla was about so I picked it up. Unfortunately, I should have listened to my friend's advice. Dolores irritated me. She is a character that you want to try to love, but her actions make that impossible. True, she had a terrible childhood which haunts her throughout her life, but I never really connected with her. The one thing I did find it interesting was the fact that the novel was written by a man. I'm curious as to why Wally Lamb chose to write a story from a woman's point of view, but he writes about an overweight woman at that. I'm surprised Oprah has this book in her club--when is she going to discover The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put this book down!- & I never liked reading before","review":"All through my life, I never saw the use in reading. The only Literature I ever cared to see was strictly for school purposes. This book gripped me from the beginning, took me through Dolores' tumultuous years and at the end, I was sad to leave her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I will always keep on my night stand.","review":"Lamb does an exquisite job of telling a heart-breaking story with such compassion. This book evolked a large range of emotions in me. It was hard for me to look at food when she was in her severely obese stages and shoving down an 18 lb roast. Although I found some topics in here a little far-fetched, she always found a way to surprise me. An OUTSTANDING character that I can relate to, as will most other women."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book.","review":"So many people told me it was \\"depressing,\\" but it actually had a very positive message. Dolores was forced to learn for herself how to \\"move on\\" when life deals you a devastating blow. For me, she was a fascinating character to \\"watch\\" over the years. And even when she was at her worse, I still found myself rooting for her. She was a sympathetic character all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"good story, but some unrealistic happenings.","review":"It was a hard story to put down but some things were bogus. Delores is easy to feel sorry for and had an interesting life.All in all it was really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic melodrama","review":"How many horrible things can happen to one person? I think that's the question that this novel sets out to answer. Instead of having the heroine deal with one, two, or maybe three, major traumas of her life, every chapter of Dolores Price's life is filled with tragedy, cruelty, and let's face it, felonies! The local police agency should really talk to her, because she can implicate lots of people as she is the victim of at least 3 felonies.The story isn't boring, and I read the whole thing in one night, but about half way through, it was a stubborn determination that drove me. I kept on thinking \\"Surely nothing else terrible can happen to this woman\\", and I kept on being proven wrong.If you like to read a story of someone who went through hell and made it out alive, you might like to read this book. Because Dante would have placed her journey somewhere between 4th and 5th level of hell. Personally, I found the whole exercise preposterous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and annoying","review":"The only reason I gave She's Come Undone 2 stars instead of 1 is because I actually read the entire thing (usually I stop anywhere from 20 to 100 pages into a book I don't like), and I also laughed at Roberta's radio show. I can't believe it took that annoying little brat forty-some years to get over herself. She was sarcastic, but she wasn't funny. I enjoy wit, puns, and sarcasm, but Dolores was just annoying. She should have just went under in the middle of the book, and the rest of the story could have been about Roberta -- now there's an interesting character! I understand that people go through many tragedies and don't immediately get over them, but this was just too much for a work of fiction. Her story didn't even come across as that tragic. What's \\"tragic\\" is that some readers are appalled at some of the \\"disturbing\\" scenes in the book. I guess all of the Disney movies were rented the day they decided to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars","review":"I found this book so presumptuous, so insidious and so infuriating that the minute I was finished with it, I took it outside and set fire to it in my backyard. I've never burned a book before or since but She's Come Undone made me so angry that I couldn't stand the thought of having it in my home. I also didn't want to give it away or donate it anywhere because I didn't want anyone else to have to read it.I think that my real issue with this book was appropriation of voice. Having lived through a similar experience to Dolores, I was initially amazed by Lamb's insight into the situation but as the story went on, I started to see that he didn't really get it at all. In the end, there's no joy, no recovery, no true self-discovery, just sighing acceptance of Dolores' crappy lot in life. What does this say to other survivors of rape? It says \\"Why bother trying to make yourself better if this is where you end up?\\" Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Delores is memorable, the story itself is too overdone","review":"This is a page turner for sure - but that does not equate to great writing my any means. Yes, the story has lots of unexpected twists and turns, but then it has several overly predictable \\"oh-I-can't-believe-he-just-went-there\\" moments.You become quite fond of Dolores, the main character - and you cheer for her on and off. However, there is such an overwhelming artificial grittyness to her, which makes her little more than the tired stereotype of the \\"self-destructing fat girl\\".Furthermore, the \\"in-your-face-sybmbolism\\" such as the beached whale scenario is so cheesy it almost hurts...Overall, a decent book for the beach or the stair master - but great literature it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I found myself feeling lost after I finished this book. I kept wanting to learn what was going on now in Doloreses life! This book will make you laugh, whince, shake your head, and most of all...it will make you cry. I think the most fascinating thing about it, is that it was written by a man! EXCELLENT read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah's Approval = Nothing","review":"I should have known that if Oprah recommends it, it won't be worth my time. The main character in this book is one of the most unlikeable characters I have ever read about in my life. Not only did I not like her, I kept hoping she would get what was coming to her for blaming every single person in her life for who she was. Was she a victim? Early on, yes. Of course she was. But come on, the assault early in her life was something she blamed on every other person she ever met. By the time she killed the fish, I found myself just wanting someone to slap her. A tremendous waste of my reading time. From now on, Oprah's recommendation on a book cover will make me just move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book! Looking forward to reading more by this author","review":"I loved this book, I couldn't put it down. It was such an easy and enjoyable read. Even though the character is not the nicest person you can't help but feel for her and connect with her. I was so sad to finish this book. One of my favorite books of all time. A must read!!!! I can't wait to read more of Wally Lamb's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not even sure why I picked this book up.","review":"I thought, perhaps I could finally identify with someone, nothave to read about model-thin girls with their perfect lives andmates, or my usual heavy load of psych books. Boy, was I wrong. Oh,it started off okay. I even sort of pitied poor Dolores. Then, it just got incredibly annoying. There's a point where you just have to suck it in and try to change a life of shambles, and I don't believe she ever did that. Also, the plot was unrealistic. Honestly, how many people get to meet and have sex with a crush from afar on a first date? I was rooting for Dante when he dumped her. Heh. The only character I liked was little Mr. Pucci--he's the only one who seemed to have a little development to him. Take my advice: if you want to read this book, get it from a library. It isn't worth $11.20 (plus shipping and handling)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time and money","review":"It is not in the least hyperbolic to state that this is the worst book I have ever read. Lamb completely fails to make his heroine even remotely likeable; she is not even tolerable. Nothing about her story is interesting or compelling. The book is just an interminably long list of bad things that happen to this (eventually incredibly annoying) girl, who fails to learn anything or change in any way.She's Come Undone is complete, unmitigated drivel. The greatest value of this book is as a firestarter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah, you disappoint me...","review":"It amazes me that Oprah can put her stamp of approval on \\"Beloved\\" and on this book in the same lifetime. Uninspired, unengaging, this book takes family dysfunction to an all-time new level of cliche. Sad, because Lamb's prose not bad on the whole. This book is perfect for those of us who don't think that independent thought is a prerequisite for reading -- or for writing, I suppose. People who enjoy self-help books and think that Good Will Hunting is an original and provocative movie will absolutely love this. Oprah, salutes to you for dumbing down your standards and convincing millions of American women to pay money for mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'll never get this time back","review":"this was possibly one of the worst books i have ever read. somebody recommended it to me as a great book so i gave it my very best shot. as i read through every single depressing, graphic and ugly detail of delores' life, i kept reading - thinking it HAD to get better at some point, thinking there HAD to be some redeeming quality somewhere. about 3/4 of the way through, i quit reading and just scanned my way through the rest of it. believe me, i didn't miss anything. this book was absolutely, positively sickening - so disgusting in places, i feel like my brain needs to be scraped of all the filth and ugliness it picked up. i really don't understand what on earth there is to recommend about this book. seriously? life is ugly enough at times without our having to glorify it in print. this is a HORRIBLE book. i threw it in the garbage. i couldn't even bring myself to sell it or give it away. nobody else needs this trash. i wish i could give it less than 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful.","review":"This book ranks right up there with the two worst books I've ever read. It deserves no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Read, truly White Trash","review":"One of the worst books I've ever read. Completely uninspiring, in fact much less inspiring than my real life. I think people read to somehow rise above their daily routine and be transplanted to a world that would give them a different perspective on life. All the characters in this book have NOTHING interesting about them: there's no internal conflict to learn from, it's like watching one of the trashiest TV shows. I read the book to the end because I was anticipating that.... now something will change and we'll get to the crux of the story; well... that moment never came."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I read this book after my mom told me too and I'm glad I did. The characters and the sotry is brilliantly and movingly told. I've read some review that say this is way too depressing and it's trashy. To me this is a realistic book because the main character Delores doesn't always make the right choices. But it is uplifting you just have to keep reading until the end. This is definately one of my favourite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Came Back Together Again!","review":"I could hardly believe that this book was written by a man! Wally Lamb captured some of the most intimate details that women go through. This is a must read for anyone who thinks that he or she cannot go on with the way that their lives are going. This is truly inspirational ficton at its ultimate best. I think that Wally Lamb is sure to develop new stories that will continue to touch our hearts and our souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the depths of the dumpster!","review":"I am an avid reader and have read hundreds and hundreds of books in my lifetime. In this time there have only been a handful that i have classified as truly horrible. This is one of them. True that it is a journey of a women against all odds. Well written in the sense of the feeling of being there, yet that doesn't override the disgusting and low self-esteem factor. It portrays largers women as pigs and 'beached whales'. Truely horrible to the fact that i couldn't read it at points and had to put it away. I make it a habit to never leave a book unfinished so i can i give it an honest review, and i did finally finish this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's Come Undone","review":"Very disappointing! I read this book AFTER I read Lamb's I Know This Much Is True, which is one of the BEST books I have ever read. I was so impressed that I had to read his first book. I found the story to be depressing and without a clear point. The struggles of the main character seemed senseless. This book is in no way comparable to his second book - thank goodness! if you want a good read, get a copy of I Know This Much Is True. I can guarantee that you will devour it - it is truly amazing. I cannot say the same for She's Come Undone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid.","review":"Horrid. Dreadful. By the middle of the book, I just wanted the main character to shut up and stop whining, already. Ugh! And the author evidently has some serious issue with fat women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"Very well written, entertaining and intriguing. Perhaps a bit dramatic a times.The author is quite talented, and very convincing as a woman. Moreover, he creates this character that represents somebody who many would write off as a fly on the wall, yet you want to know so much about this person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, unique, and it will leave you wanting more.","review":"I am a big fan of Ian Mcewan, but was looking for more good literary books when I stumbled upon this in Borders. Never heard of Wally Lamb or this book before then. Once I began reading I was hooked. If you can't take literature, if you need fast action and very little descriptiong to hold your attention, then don't buy this. I alway judge a book by how long I think about it afterwards: Harry Potter, about 2 days. This book, over 2 months and counting.Wally Lamb is an excellent writer. The story is painful and enjoyable. I read the book in less than a week. Lamb's books make you think, make you feel. They give you a look into human nature, into our souls.I highly recommend this book,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Undoing Talent... as close as you can get","review":"Not to mention a sharp sense of story telling, it is a facination to experience Lamb's ability to write in a place of the opposite gender. Not even a page of boredom, and the revealing of vivid detials of the heroine of the plot... what more can a reader ask for intriging commitment to a book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Profoundly touched and moved","review":"Of all the novels I've read in my lifetime, this one was by far the most captivating and inspiring. It has made me want to be a better person and make the most out of life. Delores Price is someone to identify with and learn from. I want to personally thank Wally Lamb for writing this beautiful story. And if Delores wasn't fictional (which in a way, I feel she isn't) I would thank her also. I can't wait to read \\"I Know This Much is True\\" !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written!","review":"The book She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. The life of the characters feel so real. They were faced with real life problems, and showed the reader a way to deal with them appropriately. This book has enhanced my spiritual self-being through all the glorifying, as well as depressing sequences of this young girl's life into woman-hood."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"There is a reason WHY this book was on the $1 table at the discount book store a couple of years ago. It should've stayed there. I'm aghast so many people will run out and relish a book just because a talk show host says to do so. I read this LONG before Ophah gave her review, and I would discourage anyone from reading it now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money.","review":"As I was reading the book, I kept wondering whyOprah would recommend such trash. I'm stillwondering. I've bought several books she hasrecommended. This is the only one I've managedto finish. I won't buy any more books that sherecommends. I expected Oprah to recommend bookswith SOME value. Now I know why I've never beeninterested in reading fiction. I'll stick tonon-fiction from now on.This book was very depressing and disgusting.I want my money back! And my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The character in this book is so pathetic","review":"Guess I'm in the minority here. I hated this book. The author seemed to just keep throwing awful things at the main character to keep the story going. I could literally picture him saying to himself, \\"Now what should I do to her next?\\" Delores is so pathetic--at no point did she rise up out of the squalor of her life and make something of herself. Compared to other hard-knock life stories, such as Angela's Ashes (which is a TRUE story), the character in this book merely plods along, never making anything of herself, and never showing and strength or ingenuity.Instead of making a point by showing how people can overcome difficulty, this character stayed flat, lifeless, and boring throughout her horribly difficult life. I really have to wonder how much experience or insight Mr. Lamb has into a troubled woman's soul after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of all time.","review":"This book has no redeeming value. Just when you think the main character may escape from her abusive environment, she is placed in another one. Although I am extremely sympathetic to the plight of abused women, I see no reason to read a book about the continued abuse of an individual.This was the book that put me in the \\"no Oprah book club\\". I pretty much know if Oprah recommends a book, it will focus on abuse. Although Oprah herself has certainly managed to overcome her abusive background, she does not seem to select books where the characters even have a hope of overcoming their abusive backgrounds. While I do not want to only read books with happy endings, neither do I want to read books that leave me feeling that there is no hope in this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"writing style and content flat and simplistic","review":"This book was truly an easy read in that it was simplistic. Wally Lamb's writing style is so flat! He doesn't utilize the senses whatsoever. He simply tells a story. One thing he is very good at is using cliches and drawing upon stereotypes. I think that the book starts out fairly good, but the more you read on the more bizarre it gets. Perhaps Lamb is trying to compensate for lack of imagination?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Over-Hyped","review":"Ridiculous plot, poorly written, uninteresting characters. With all the millions of GOOD books out there, don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the masterpiece I expected","review":"A friend of mine heard that this was the first man who was able to effectively write as an overweight woman. I expected someone I could at least understand, if not with whom I could completely empathize. I found neither.Dolores was an embarrasment to both women and overweight people. She, like so many others, makes overweight women look out of control, tattered, tormented, and hateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and silly","review":"This book really got on my nerves. One thing that bugged me is that before Doloras loses weight shes outspoken and wickedly funny (I didnt really find her very amusing but I got the feeling that Lamb meant her to be anyway)and then after she loses weight shes really weak and lets her boyfriend boss her around. Its like Wally Lamb cant see a sexy desirable female as being strong minded, only an \\"undesirable fat girl\\" can have a sharp edge. Maybe he doesnt see overweight women as being \\"real females\\" since they arent desirable to him so that made it easier for him to write about a woman. Its odd that when Doloras gets some sex appeal she also becomes weak and dumb. Not that she was so great a character in the first place. I found this plot silly and soap operaish. If you want to read a \\"realistic\\" story about depression, then read the Bell Jar and leave this shallow crap alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure soap opera - or should that be soap-Oprah?","review":"That critics have dared to compare Mr Lamb to the likes of Messrs Irving and Updike only confirms Joe Queenan's assertion that \\"critics are basically stupid.\\" \\"She's Come Undone\\" is a shallow, sentimental and superficial piece of nonsense that purports to speak authoritatively about Big Issues That Affect Women. It is no surprise that it is written by a man - it would have been more surprising if it had been written by a woman. This is the sort of twaddle that appeals to the hand-wringing hordes who inhabit Ms Winfrey's television universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING...","review":"Ugh! What a tediously dull story! I think I actually hate this book.Dolores is a bore and a cry-baby. She continuously lets people victimize her, while she knows that she has the power to stop them, yet she doesn't. Are we actually supposed to believe that she is this inept, stupid, and ludicrous?Don't waste your time with \\"She's Come Undone,\\" unless you find the \\"Jerry Springer Show\\" high-brow entertainment..."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGG! Dolores get over it","review":"My major problem with this book is I did not like the main character she annoyed me. Her constant self pity drove me up a wall. Although Lamb hopes to make her a sympathtic character he makes her an annoying one. Skip this book and read I Know This Much is True, it is a much better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite book. period.","review":"I am currently on my 3rd copy of this book. Ive read my first 2 over and over resulting in the need for a new copy due to cracked bindings and loose pages.I remember the day my mom came home with the book (just as dolores' mom brings her books, so does mine.) and told me she thought I might like it. I started immediately and finished that night. Dolores is such a compelling character and the rollercoaster of emotions this book takes you through are unlike any other I have ever read. Ive read and re-read this book and fallen in love with Dolores more and more each time. Certain aspects of her personality remind me so much of myself when I was younger. My only wish is that they could make this into a movie. I LOVE this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read...","review":"This was a well written story. It is a woman's story written by a man, which in itself is interesting. Although I did find it distubing (a sign of a good book LOL) and thought about it for days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't help myself....","review":"Having read \\"I Know This Much is True,\\" and finding it rather long-winded, I picked this up in the hope that this would redeem Lamb for me as an author. It did. I couldn't put it down. It's one of the most tragic novels I've read, but I also found it strangely inspiring. Lamb creates a terrific tragic character in young Dolores, and I fell for it. Dolores commanded my pity, but also my occasional laughter. I've been looking for this book for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Come Undone","review":"The book She's Come Undone changed my life and was probably the best book that I have ever read. It is a story of love, hate, and everything in between. The story of Dolores is touching and real and I think at some point we can all relate to this emotionally unstable young woman. I was brought into her life and while reading it I somewhat became Dolores. When she cried I cried, and when she laughed I laughed. I felt truly sorry for her as a character. But through all of that, I only know that I will never forget Dolores Price."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Done Nicely","review":"In She Comes Undone, Wally Lamb creates a most memorable and damaged character with Dolores Price. The sheer pain and humilation this woman goes through from rape to obesity, a fractured family life and divorce tends to push the character and reader over the edge into depression and despair. Yet this is were Lamb gets his awards, the writing transitions smoothly as you see Delores progress from victim to a scared, jaded survivor. The book is written so well in first person one finds it hard to believe that the author is a man. The only drawback of the book was that the author throws every terrible possible scenerio at Delores to overcome which almost makes this a drama fest, however strong character development, a tight plot and keen details prevent She's Come Undone from being overdone."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"First off, don't dis Oprah. We all have diffrent opinions but don't blame others.Anyway, I'm 13 years old. I read this 465 page book in 2 days. No joke. It was wonderful. People who hate it don't understand the book. They evedently don't like normal characters. Who likes perfect people. I don't. Dolores was me. She's everyone in a way. Read it again and never throw out a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the GREATEST book I have ever read!","review":"I am only 14 years old, but I truly loved this book! I couldn't put it down, and read it only in a couple of days. It is unbelievable that a man could write so well in the eyes of a woman. Where's the 2nd book? I have to have more! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"she's come undone puts me together","review":"Once I picked up this book there was no putting it down. A friend lent me the book and when she asked what I thought of it so far I could not stop praising it!! I kept talking about the female author and how she had this tremendous insight into our minds as women. My friend laughed and said 'look on the back cover' I did the author is a man. Then this man is a genius. I have been undone and his insight and ability to tell a GOOD story are topnotch! This should be a classic respected with the names of those few authors that truly write the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is the best book I have read. Easy reading, couldn't wait to turn the pages, was so sad that there was not more to read. Who would believe a man wrote this book?

Until this one... What a labored, dismal tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful book!! Just amazing!","review":"This is such a well written book - about a little girl - and written by a man. Wally Lamb has some how captured the feelings of this little girl and then even as she grows up. It is witty/funny, sad, and triumphant!!! Read it, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"This book is an amazing journey through the life of the main character, Delores. This book tackles serious issues such as rape, divorce, body image problems, and more. I think the most important message one could gather from this novel is the affect of childhood events on an adult. We see in this book that Delores' troubled childhood leads her to an even more troubled adulthood."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot, no reality, no good.","review":"This unbelievable life of an obese young girl was a waste of money as well as time. By the time you are 100 pages into the book, you feel obligated to finish it, just because you've read so much trash that you dare Wally Lamb to feed you even more, which he does. The only worthy aspect of this book is Lamb's cunning ability to speak as a woman... but 300 pages of unsubstantial text far outweighs even this feat"},{"rating":"1","title":"How much did Mr. Lamb have to pay to have this published?","review":"This simply was the worst book I have ever read. I felt Dolores' pain only because I was in agony myself (due, of course, to the fact I was reading a horribly written book). I spend most of my reading time reading classics and if this is all that authors of this century are doing than all I can say is thank Orn there are still many classicsI have yet to read! Truly this is one baaaaaa-d book Mr. Lamb. Do us all a favor next time inspiration (or lack there of) strikes and don't write!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely moving!","review":"She's Come Undone is depressing yet funny all in one novel. Delores Price is a character that every woman can relate to in some way, shape or form and while reading the book, you will think about her every day and wonder what she will experience next. It's hard to believe that a man wrote this book - Wally Lamb is so intuitive to how women think and feel! Everyone should read about Delores Price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - couldn't put it down","review":"Though I have never had a weight problem such as the heroine in this book, I'll bet that most women can relate to the self-doubt that Dolores felt -- you know the feeling when things are going wrong around you and you often will blame yourself? I would highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Officially Number 1!","review":"She's Come Undone is officially one of my most favorite books. It's the only book that I have felt the urge to read and reread, very well written and holds an incredibly inspiring message. Delores Price becomes more than just a character in a story. She becomes true and real, and you can't help but strain your eyes at 3am to read the next chapter and the next. There are often times when I found myself flipping to the front cover to make sure that a man really wrote this awesome story. Definitely a 5 star novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"This book is a wonderful story. Dolores Price has the bad qualities that all of us keep hidden. I have read it twice, and each time I am amazed that a book can be so heartbreaking and so funny at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book well written that is not very uplifting","review":"I enjoyed this book but not as much as Wally Lamb's 2nd book \\"This Much I Know is True\\". It's a depressing story of a girl's life that starts out bad and continues that way all her life. Wally Lamb's books are all \\"page turners\\" and extremely well written so it's not a book you wouldn't finish even though you didn't like the subject. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wally Lamb has won my attention!","review":"This is a touching story. I found myself drawn in as Dolores evolved clumsily from being a bruised and battered child into a cautiously optimistic, loving, more confident woman. The story of Dolores is not a unique one. Many women face the same trials that Dolores stumbles through. This is a story about real life - a life of secrets and pain - a life that many women live and keep hidden in the dark. Lamb does a successful job of allowing us to share Dolores' pain and triumps. Arguably, however, I don't feel that Lamb was completely effective writing from a woman's prespective. In my opininion, Dolores' character (especially adolescence) had male persona. Maybe this was intentional by Lamb to emphasize Dolores' feeling of uniqueness and lonliness. This read requires a little patience and an empathetic heart. I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Irvings John Irving","review":"I am a devoted reader of John Irving. Lamb has achieved with this work a feminine voice far more real than Irving's recent \\"A Widow for A Year\\". I loved both books, but this one really stayed with me. Though his characters are presented with difficult and strange circumstances they win out and emerge with a human touch not seen in most popular fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"This book was so entretaining that I carried it around with me everywhere. I even lent it to my 14 year-old niece and she loved it to. The author did ann excellent job writing from the eyes of a girl; it was unimaginable that the author was actually a man! This book is a MUST."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I thought that this book was excellent because people can relate to Delores's struggles and experiences. I think that Wally Lamb did an excellent job of portraying a woman going through life. I have reccomended this book to all of my friends and they have all enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's depressing all right!","review":"I found this book as depressing as everyone else who's written a review. I also couldn't put it down, but that's only because I kept thinking it was going to get better, that Dolores' life couldn't get any worse. Boy was I surprised. Now that I've finished it, the characters and their problems keep coming to mind. This is definitely one I wouldn't recommend to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have read yet.","review":"I love this book. Its sad funny and amazing. I could not wait to see what was going to happen next in this book evreyfelling evrey thought was something new for her and for me too. A couple times I felt like I was her. She is a hard carictor not to relate to and even harder to hate and to not understand. Evreyword in this book just inraps you into the book even more. I say once you read this book you will never feel the same about anything agin and you will think twice about critizizing people no more or at least less if you do critisize people. But besides that this is the best book you will ever read at least the second best book"},{"rating":"1","title":"When WASN'T she undone?","review":"I am a big reader, and when I picked this up I expected it to be a beautifully written, charming story... considering how captivated I am with Oprah. However the characters in this novel have all gone to hell in back. Without a loveable character in the bunch, and most of them with broken, miserable lives it just leaves you with a feeling of remorse for the entire human race! Looking at other reviews written by others on this same page, they refer to this book as 'real', and 'tells it like it is'. Now that's down right depressing! This book is definetly different... but for me, that 'different is not the kind I prefer, or consider interesting. Go ahead and read it, just know that it's not a happy, fun, book. If I would compare it to another book I've read I'd have to say it would be another Oprah Books club book, \\"What looks like crazy on an ordinary day\\". Come on Oprah, enough of the downers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever. Who cares? I didn't. Oprah strikes out...again!","review":"Trivial, boring work from a writer who obviously writes well. I hated this book. I didn't care about the heroine, didn't like her but didn't care enough to hate her. Weak characters. Dull plot. Blah, blah, blah... Does anyone at Oprah's book club really know how to read? What can they be thinking? How about promoting some really fine writers from the back shelves who are seldom noticed, Oprah? This isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book for one with manic-depression like myself...","review":"A friend told me I just had to read this book... all I have to say is that true friends don't let friends read Wally Lamb. I think the main problem with this book is that you have to hate the main character. Everytime anything really bad happens to Dolores (the MC) she just does something completely evil as a reaction to make you despise her. Liiike... she decides to have a gay encounter with some woman (I believe her name was Dottie). And throughout the book all Dottie talks about is how much she looooves her little fish. Anyhow, after Dolores has her *encounter* she gets up and poisons all of Dottie's fish because she's 'depressed'. Yeah, bite me, you're depressed... so go and kill some defenseless animals. Really, don't read this book if you fight depression yourself and don't read it if you actually expect some good material."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whale's were odd","review":"I really loved this story although it was a bit disturbing. I suppose the whales were symbolic somehow but I really didn't get it. Despite my confusion about the whales I loved the story and I found myself cheering for the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Come Undone","review":"Interesting to read a fictional book that takes place in an area that I am living in. Good book, Wally Lamb is very good about telling a story through the eyes of a woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED it","review":"I couldn't stand this book, it was slow moving and depressing. I did not enjoy the book at all, I don't know why I kept reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotional, interesting but disturbing","review":"Although it is amazing that Lamb could emotionally write a women so well he also completely dismisses the power of women's spirit. The story of girl constantly beaten down by life and victimized. She not once tries to better herself or situation. At times just unrealistic how everyone she meets tries to hurt her. Its not real life. I keep wanting her to pick herself up and get better and it doesn't happen. Lamb's story of Dolores is like a train wreck you just can't stop looking at it for some glimmer of hope. Well I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bore-fest","review":"Plodding plot, lack of insight and sensitivity. Some of the most boring fiction dialogue i've seen in a long time. Figures that Oprah liked it because it deals with a fat woman, but other than that it is terrible story telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you people thinking? SERIOUSLY! What?","review":"You people should be ashamed for enjoying this book any level. This trash is inspired by countless terrible romantic comedies, terrible pulp fiction, and terrible soap opera. I don't feel like I'm speaking with hyperbole when I indict everyone who enjoys this terrible, terrible piece of instant disasterpiece as someone who needs to revise their definition of taste. For shame, you gullible cheesecake-eating stay-at-home inhuman groupthinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly awful book","review":"This book is a disaster.The blurb on the back of this book promises us humour. It has none. The so called heroine Dolores is an uninspiring character who allows a torrent of depressing things to happen. The plot is utterly contrived and I really hated the tedious way it cycled through events (depressing event followed a bit later by discussion of said event with the psychiatrist followed even later by more disscusion of it with granny).There is no point to this book at all. I took it to the beach as one of my vacation reads and I feel like I have had my time stolen from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too depressing","review":"Yes, Wally Lamb is talented. He somehow managed to jam about everything wrong with our society into the life of one woman. The only reason I kept reading it was in the hopes that her life would get better. It didn't. She went whale watching. This book is very well-written, but that doesn't help because it just makes you more depressed because you feel like you're there with her. So... read this book if you want punishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undone, well done","review":"I picked this up after having had my copy for several years. It was a little slow to start, but \\"She's Come Undone\\" is the kind of book that becomes very addictive. It is tragic, fascinating reading. I am, however, mystified by reviews that characterize this as funny, though, because while wild, warped, sometimes amusing and totally absorbing, it's not really funny.The detail with which Mr. Lamb writes is so vivid, this books plays like a movie in your head as you read. You can almost taste the curtains Delores chews on and visualize the \\"flying leg\\" painting her mother gives her. And you can feel her sadness, her desire to connect, her longing for love and acceptance. He has created a character I know, and when we part ways at the end, I really care about her and hope that her future is happy at last.I gave this book to my 18-year-old stepdaughter and now she's equally mesmerized."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of us know a Dolores Price","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Lamb. The best part about this book is that you would NEVER be able to tell that it has been written by a man. All of us (women) know a Dolores Price. She's the girl at school that is overweight, the one with low self-esteem, the one that needs a friend. She is the girl at college that you dread to have as a roommate. She is the woman in your office that you don't want next to your cubicule. But most importantly, you will find a piece of yourself in Dolores. In this novel, that will keep you reading long after you have told yourself to go to bed, deals with everything from childhood bullies to adult romance. I enjoyed this book so much that I bought a copy for all of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's Come Undone","review":"Miss Price is an amazing woman who shares her struggles with the world. Enduring rap, abuse, and a mentally ill mother, she can't help but rapidly gain weight. This book is by far one of the most depressing books I have read and instantly made me hate all men. I'm still not sure if this is appropriate to file under the \\"favorite\\" catagory. Dolores Price is not unforgettable but definatley worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"I read this book because of its great reviews, however I am greatly disappointed. It only made me dislike the main character and feel depressed. I continued through the entire book waiting for something worthwhile to come out of it but it never did. I feel that when Dolores finally changed for the better, it was like she was a totally different character. My advice to you is, don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"Unlikeable main character - she achieves a measure of happiness by the end of this very long book, but by then, you don't care about her or the outcome, you are simply forcing yourself to finish it hoping to find some glimpse of a reason why your precious Oprah would tell you to read such a horrible book. Every time I heard it described as a 'coming of age story' I cringed. Whose miserable coming of age was this? She was so unlikeable, so twisted and perverted at such a young age and throughout her life. I have no trouble believing that this was written by a man because no woman would write such a horribly perverted female character of that age. Sorry Oprah, but I just can't believe this made it to your book club and I honestly believe that is the ONLY reason it was a success. I hope Wally Lamb appreciates all you have done for him because his success is all due to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Book!","review":"I really like this book, if only because it was so bizarre. There are so many adult situations that I would suggest only an adult read it,and I don't mean because lascivious or obsene. It's just such a deeply emotional account of Dolores Prices' life from childhood- and how she eventually perseveres and finds inner happiness. Along the way, there's a loss of her parents, a stay in a mental institution, a lesbian experience,a marriage that ends in divorce, a start of a new one. That's just a taste of main events. Dolores is cocky, humourous, and insanely loveable. I liked this book and thinking of reading something else by Wally Lamb."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an unfailingly annoying character","review":"I am generally an easily pleased reader, but I could not wait to finish this book. I found Dolores so annoying that she actually put me into a bad mood. She is dramatic, whiny, and self-absorbed. She never really improved, she just expressed the crazy in slightly different ways. If I had the ability to put a book down once I started, I would have done it with this book. Instead, I trudged through to the end, becoming more and more irritated with her character. The only redeeming quality of the book is that it does capture the long-felt impacts of traumatizing events, rather than having the main character go through a brief and trite journey to happiness as so many other books do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read if you are depressed or have anxiety!!","review":"I started this book months ago, put it down, read all my other books, and finally read it out of desperation. Once I got past the first few chapters it was hard to put down. I kept hoping that Delores's life would perk up, but when it seemed to be getting better everything would fall apart again. There are TOO many depressing events to process. Unfortunately this book has left me with a ton of anxiety and a lump in my throat. I do like the author's style of writing and this is why I give this a two star. I can't imagine why anyone would say this book is \\"hilarious.\\" Obviously, that individual didn't read this book cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck...hated it!","review":"I had heard that people really liked this book or really hated it...I'm glad I got mine from the local library because I did not like it at all, in fact I didn't even bother to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I could not get into this book at all.

After awhile I became very annoyed with the main character. I DO NOT RECOMMNED THIS NOVEL!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"Oh, please. I did not read this book because it was on Oprah's list. I read it because I heard that it was so good. Well, it wasn't. Lamb thinks he can write from a woman's point of view but he just can't. I doubt that he experienced any of the things that the main character did. He has no idea how one might express these feelings and deal with them. I must admit that I can see why Oprah reccomended it. (the whole bit with losing weight seems very fimilar) I thought that Oprah had better taste, I guess I was wrong. Next time Wally \\"write what you know.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG LET DOWN!","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I was told by many people how wonderful Wally Lamb is, but I could not find anything great about this novel. The characters are lacking the realness that would make the story believable. I could care less what happened to these people and I was more intrested in getting to the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"I don't expect all books to have a happy ending. What I do expect is that at the end I will have the feeling that I read this book for a reason. \\"She's Come Undone\\" left me wondering why Wally Lamb even bothered writing it. I could not identify a single signigicant purpose for this book. It was disgusting and pointless and I recommend that if you would like to read something by Wally Lamb that you go with \\"I Know This Much Is True.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, misogynistic drivel","review":"How very sad that this book is held up in such high regard. I read this for a book club and had to force myself through it with great difficulty. Not a single character in the book is likeable, not a single scene realistic.On top of that, it is the most misogynistic book I have read in a long time. the author piles horrible incident upon horrible incident on the hapless Dolores. While some may view this as empathetic, in fact it's horribly cruel-- it's as if the (male) author is continually saying-- \\"watch what I'm going to do to her next.\\"It's poorly written, obvious, drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely HATED this book","review":"I HATED this book along with Dolores. This book was a total waste of my time and money. It's a shame that the \\"heroine\\"(certainly not someone I'd want my daughters to look up to) was someone who blamed society for the outcome of her life instead of herself, I tried to like Dolores but couldn't- heck, I even tried to pity her. This book left me depressed. I didn't even save it to pass it along to a friend (wouldn't do that to a friend) I threw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP THE SELF-PITY!","review":"Delores Price doesn't learn a thing and chooses to wallow in her self-pity. She is one of the worst representatives of the \\"plus-size\\" population I've ever read about. Grow up, Delores! Deal with it! Get a grip! (don't buy it!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most depressing book I have ever read","review":"How can one person's life be so horrible? It was like a soap opera with one tragedy after another. While everyone endures their own personal tragedies, this book appeared to be competing for a guiness record. The book was given to me by my niece who never finished it. Being a masochist, I did finish the book in order to have closure of the worst reading experience in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man wrote this????","review":"He must have followed me around during the early part of my adult life!!!. I identified with so many areas of this book. Thank you Mr. Lamb for one of the most insightful , moving, and funniest books I've read in a long time. There were times I wanted to scream at Delores and other times I cried with her. I smiled a lot while reading this book. It brought back so many memories.I can see why Oprah recommended it, we grew up in the same era. A great read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"if this book were anymore real, you'd be dying right now.","review":"the little twit who said this book was depressing because it was real, is just that, a twit.this girl is REAL. her voice, her thoughts.. they're real. dolores price leaps off of the page and into one's heart because she is real.i read this book while incarcerated in a mental hospital myself and i cried through every page. feelings previously unable to be explained were suddenly there in the words i could never make come out write. he wrote them. childhood bullying, parental neglect, self abuse, bingeing, purging, lying, suicide, death.. everything was there.the book is funny and it's sad. it brings one both up and down.if you have not read this book, you need to.if you have read it.. read it again.<321mareeee!na"},{"rating":"2","title":"After the 18th time, I still love it!!","review":"I read this book long before it became an Oprah's book club choice and apparently forgot that I had, because it wasn't until I purchased my second copy and got to the third page that I remembered falling in love with this book a few years prior. There is something about Dolores that reels you in - I wish I could put it aptly into words to make this review more helpful but out of all the books I have read, only this one and To Kill A Mockingbird have ever provoked me to reread them countless times. Wally Lamb is a genius at conveying the thoughts, dreams, feelings and wishes of a woman - if I hadn't have seen him on TV I would have sworn he was one. It's a remarkable book with fluid writing, and as it seems with most of Oprah's dandies, you find yourself rooting for the main character when no one else around them appears to be. An A+ effort all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, depressing, waste of an evening","review":"I was fascinated by the book reviews on the cover. Being overweight myself, I thought the character was someone I could relate to. However, Dolores gives overweight people, and women in general a bad name. Her character is Judy Blooms Blubber meets Steven King. She is mean, hateful and vicious before she was raped and even before her parents fought. I was disgusted with her in the first chapter, and the feeling did not die. The author has no sense of what is like to be an adolescent girl. Lamb seemed to use Dolores's weight as the avenue for the reader pity. His use of language was pathetic and his characterization were cookie cutter of a dysfunction home. This novel was outlined carefully to pull at heart strings, yet it pushes every ounce of sympathy for the main character out the door along with my respect for Oprah for recommending this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's come unread","review":"It's hard to tell if this author dislikes men or women more. From a painful portrayal of a astonishingly dysfunctional family to the sputtering end this book grinds on and on. Almost no-one is likable in this story, especially the heroine. There should be a truth in advertising clause for book jackets that state: \\"...often stirring and hilarious book\\" What's hilarious? A self-destructive teenager whose every adult influence betrays her with their selfishness? And so it goes. I did finish the book, in the vain hopes that there would be some redeeming grace in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah's come undone","review":"I laughed (at the idea that this was a good book). I cried (over the time and money wasted on this garbage). I hurled (over every facet of this book).The story and the characters were stupid and offensive. Let's see, the lead character is fat, therefore she must be a dysfunctional, messed-up, whiny compulsive eater. God forbid a woman of size be shown as intelligent and emotionally secure. Wally Lamb's writing and storytelling is awful. I will never read anything he writes again, and I will doubt Oprah's recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's Come Undone","review":"It is obvious that this is Lamb's first novel. I had a hard time identifying with Dolores, the main character. Although her childhood into early adulthood went through many phases, each phase was severely fragmented and her persona was disconnected. Lamb made a valient effort, but it was painfully evident that this woman's character was written by a man. Characters came into the plot, would play a substantial part, and then just disappear. I made myself finish the book, but overall it was difficult to get through. I do not doubt that Lamb has improved as a writer, as his books have generally gotten good reviews - for me, however, his first effort just fell too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for...","review":"Wally Lamb is a talented writer, and as I read this book, I really couldn't believe a man wrote this and wrote with the raw emotion of a female writer. But the second I finished the book, I knew I am not a fan of \\"coming of age\\" types of books, maybe its because I'm young, I'm not sure, but the whole thing was so depressing for me, thats it, depressing. Not the kind of book that really changes your outlook on anything, it was empty and left no lasting impression on me except the sad-sorry feeling I felt for the protagonist. I thought leaving a lasting impression was the whole point of having \\"coming of age\\" books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable...too long...too depressing","review":"I read this book expecting the central character to overcome her trials of youth (isolation, obesity, rape, addition to television, etc...)and blossom into a strong, motivational character. Instead I got one tragedy after another. I tossed this book into the wall when I finished. I found it a little unbelievable that so many tragic events could happen to one girl before she was even 20 years old. There were too many characters that had minimal importance to the story. The part that really upset me was her turbulent marriage to Dante where she apologized for everything he said and did to her. Then in the last 2 chapters marries Thayer based on convenience in effort to have a baby. Whatever! The book ultimately dragged on and on to a very anti-climactic ending. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delores Price: At Once Pathetic and Familiar","review":"The story of Delores Price is at once pathetic and familiar.There are several honestly and realistically presented occurances inher life story with which anyone would be able to identify. Countless times while reading this book I wished I could grab Delores and steer her on the right path, the frustration eminating from life lessons from which I wish I had been spared.She's Come Undone forces the reader, in a roundabout way, to examine her own life and mistakes. By relating a personal situation to a similar one Delores finds herself in, we are able to view it objectively. Anyone who reads this story may become Delores' therapist in a sense and as an end result, develop the ability to view personal problems more effectively.She's Come Undone is pathetic because at times it is all too familiar."},{"rating":"2","title":"A woman's emergence from beneath the fat that strangles her","review":"A poignant story interestingly written, from the perspective ofa young woman coming of age in the midst of fast food, television, anda not so \\"Brady Bunch\\" family life. Dolores Price's pain is one shared by millions of people, however hers is uniquely traumatic in the fact that she is not only obese, but rage filled at her father who abandoned the family, and her mother who took a mental leave of absence. The story unfolds, revealing Dolores post-destructive period in a slightly unrealistic manner considering the destruction she faced in her life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good up until the very end.","review":"With the exception of the deus ex machina at the end, the book was very real. It's hard to believe that a man wrote this story that was so realistically seen through the eyes of it's woman characters. Wonderful, a much recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"She's Come Undone is one of the best novels I have ever read (and I read quite a bit). For the record, I read this book long before Mr. Lamb became associated with (Oprah's Book Club). Mr. Lamb requires no endorsement from anyone - his talented writing speaks for itself. While reading this novel, I became so engrossed with the character and her life that I felt as if I were inside the book. For years, I couldn't believe that Wally Lamb was a man because I couldn't believe that a man could understand a woman so well. I just can't say enough...read the book! You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment.","review":"On the cover, the NY Times says this book is hilarious. It's about as hilarious as a trauma center. I was happy when Part I ended because I thought \\"Now, it will get better\\". Felt the same way at the end of Part II. It was sad and depressing from beginning to end. Yes, the author writes like a woman, but that's a pretty weak way to market a book. If it had been written by a woman, I doubt that this book would have received much acclaim. I was thoroughly disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart warming....","review":"This is a fantastic book to read. It follows a life of a character name Dolores Price from childhood to adulthood. You will follow her traumas through her life wondering when she will find love and happiness. The ending is heartwarming that makes you want to cry. Read this book and you will find a book that has touched your heart. I would recommend this book to anyone to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books I Have Ever Read","review":"This was my first purchase recommended by Oprah and I am so glad I read it. The entire time I was reading it, I kept forgetting it was written by a man. Wally Lamb had such insight into the character of Delores, you would swear it was written by a woman. The agony of this girl was almost more than I could bear, my pain coming out in her words. It was a moving, realistic look at how women feel and what some of us have had to endure to become stronger. I could never recommend this novel highly enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever!","review":"This is probably one of my favorite books of all time. It was uncanny, how I could identify with Dolores and her problems. More unbelievable was that this was written by a man. Used and abused, Dolores was a disaster, a pitiable human being, and she found the strength and courage to rise up, to have hope in the future! I love this book and have recommended it to many people. I found it inspiring, heartbreaking, laugh-out-loud funny and real. So many times I would be reading, and say to myself \\"so true!\\" If you don't read this book, you are missing an opportunity to get to know a great character, and a great writer. Yes, life is not always beautiful, but we have to survive, one way or another. Wally Lamb is a genius!Kathleen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expect a period of grief when you have finished this book!","review":"One of the best books I have read recently.The characters are so well developed that they become ones' own acquaintances.I find myself wondering how Delores is today, and then realize that sadly I can no longer be a part of her life. In part, it was an opportunity to relive my own life, review it,and come to terms with it"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE BOOKS THAT TOUCHED MY SOUL. I FELT SO STRONGLY FOR THE CHARACTER IN THIS BOOK THAT IT SEEMED THAT MY OWN LIFE WAS PUT ASIDE WHILE I WAS ENGROSSED IN THIS BOOK. MY POOR FAMILY COULD ONLY GAZE AT MY UNMOVING SHELL AS I WAS LIVING ALONG WITH DELORIS. THANK GOODNESS THE BOOK WASN'T ANY LONGER- THE FAMILY WOULD HAVE STARVED FOR SURE! BRAVO FOR WALLY LAMB. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE HE IS A MAN"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story, that is worth the read","review":"This was the most incredible story I have read. I was so engrossed in it from chapter one, I could not put it down. I, like many others, can hardly believe that a story so poignant and touching and personal could have been written by a man. It is written with such a feminine touch, so much so that you can feel and understand events in Dolores's life. I am anxiously awaiting Wally Lamb's next novel. He will definitly be on my favorite author's lists"},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended for thoughtful readers","review":"Lamb's book reminded me of the line from the Langston Hughes poem, \\"Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.\\" Those who can relate to this metaphor in their own lives will be able to relate to Dolores and the trials she endures. But if you can't tolerate weakness, despair, and the sadder side of life, then this book is not for you. As a work of popular fiction, it is very good. Lamb creates a flow with his writing that doesn't let up."},{"rating":"2","title":"She came undone, then she overcame!","review":"Dolores Price is a beautiful character, not your typical \\"heroine\\" but so real. \\"She's come Undone\\" is a painful and beautiful novel about a teen girl that harbors childhood pain and fears and struggles through her youth.The ending is by no means a \\"story book\\" ending but through her journey I learned alot about myself as a young women.Throught her pain Dolores came undone but, with time and a whole lot of courage she bacame whole again...I recommend this novel to all women!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldnt put it down!","review":"Very easy read. Could not put this book down. Didn't realize it was a male author until half way through book. Very surprising."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that will stick with you for a long tim","review":"I believe this is Wally Lamb's first book, but I found it after 'this much' and 'the hour'. While I did not like it as much as those two, it is still a wonderful book. I cannot recommend it enough. I was happy to see this book was different than the other two (which I thought were to similar in main character) in that it was a female main character. I might not have related to the character as much, but I felt no less attached to her. Like his other books, this will stick with you a long time, which is all you could ask for in a book.No one captures the beauty of someone broken like Wally Lamb. I have no idea where he gets this power, but I hope it never goes away and we get a few more books from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it so much i quit halfway through","review":"so disturbing and depressing. i like stories that have a dark side and aren't all fluff. but, good lord. stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart felt and Funny","review":"Very funny, compassionate story. Loved the characters. I would probably read She's come undone again.I will definenty read more of wally lambs books."},{"rating":"2","title":"very moving","review":"I just finished reading this book and I found myself crying, laughing, and wanting to reach out to poor Dolores as if she were my own child. I really loved the way this was written and look foward to reading more by Wally Lamb. He showed incredible insight into the mind of this young woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have trouble putting this book down!","review":"When reading the other reviews on this book, I can't believe that it got any poor reviews at all. It's a true page turner. Even though the bad times never end for Dolores, it's a very believable story. I still haven't finished it, and am dying to see how it ends yet at the same time willl be sad when it's all over. I too cannot believe that the author of this book is a male. He hits all of the female emotions right on the head. Good job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre at best","review":"Reading this book is like rubbernecking: you know you shouldn't, but you just can't help it. Everything terrible that can happen to one person happens to the narrator of this book. It is unrealisitic, barely mediocre in terms of writing style, and reminds me of a soap opera at times, which is the reason I finished it. It propells you, open-mouthed, to keep reading and see what other wretched things this woman will endure. If lightweight reading is what you're looking for, this would be a good choice. I was dissapointed with Oprah for recommending this; she must be friends with Wally Lamb."},{"rating":"2","title":"so realistic","review":"This is a really realistic book, some of the things that happen happen to everyone as they're growing up. While I was reading this book I wanted to scream at Dolores because she did some really stupid things, but at the same time I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps my attention","review":"I am really enjoying \\"She's Come Undone\\". The most important quality that I look for in a book is that it keeps my atttention. It does not really matter about the story, but it matters how it is written. I chose it because it is on the Oprah's Book Club. I have not been disappointed with her choices yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Come Undone is the most touching book anyone can read","review":"In the novel 'She's Come Undone' Wally Lamb offers a life-altering story about a girl from age four to forty. If I had to pick only one book to recommend for somebody to read, there would be no contest, I would pick She's Come Undone. It is easy to understand so anyone can enjoy it. Dolores Price becomes almost part of your family. She will remind you of yourself while searching the many depths of the human soul. Dolores is an idol to many. She will fill any empty feeling in your heart with warm fuzzies from head to toe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, painful at times but wonderfully written !","review":"I first read this book back in 1992 and still love to read it every year or so. It reminds me that life does go on (if sometimes painfully) and that anything that has come undone can always be woven back towards wholeness. Dolores Is Great!!! Wally Lamb's writing is fabulous!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engulfing","review":"Dolores' compulsive tendancies and desire to bury the pain that has been heaped on her most of her life, draws the reader in. I found myself talking to her in my head as I read. Wanting to reach out to her and direct her onto a path of healing. I found myself frustrated that I was mearly an observer of her life. That is how a reader should feel. Wally Lamb is able to get you involved in the story without making you aware that it is happening. I would definately recommend both this book as well as his other book, \\"I Know This Much is True.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling book from a great author!","review":"I found \\"She's Come Undone\\", by Wally Lamb, to be an exciting piece of literature that really captivated my interest from page one. As a teenager, that's pretty hard to find! I went on to pass my copy onto all of my friends, who enjoy it just as much as I do. I believe this book is a product of a high quality author, and I find his other work, \\"I Know This Much is True\\", to follow in \\"She's Come Undone\\"s footsteps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as _I Know This Much Is True_","review":"I was disappointed by this novel. It didn't fit together as well as _I Know This Much Is True_. I kept wanting Delores to be happy but instead the story dragged on and got depressing. Delores came across as a weakling in the middle of the novel; she lost some of her sass. I would suggest reading Wally Lamb's second novel, _I Know This Much Is True_ instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet expectations","review":"Now that I've read it (admittedly only skimming the last 40 or so pages) I can't understand what all the hoopla was about. This book is nothing more than a soap opera with all the usual twists of fate - bad marriages, affairs, rape, death (lots of deaths, all perfectly timed). I was expecting a lot more from this book, but it's constant barrage of \\"incidents\\" left me yawning. It was like a movie where you already know beforehand how everything's going to turn out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dug it-BIG TIME.","review":"I must admit that in the space of 3 years, I have read this book 3 times. Sometimes if I have nothing better to read, I just read over certain parts that I especially enjoyed. This book is a timeless classic. Believe it or not, I found it in a bargain bin in Colorado before it became popular. Best money I ever spent. Delores is an interesting heroine and even though at times she can be thick in her personal life, I can relate to her implicitly. I see alot of foreshadowing and intersting literary looping. Wally Lamb is obviously a very intelligent and well actualized man. (You don't find many of those!) Well, all I can say is that if you haven't read this book-READ IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wally Lamb's \\"Shes Come Undone\\" is an amazing read","review":"If anyone has every felt mass amounts of heartache then they can easily relate to this book. Lamb expresses a female's point of view in a way that I didn't think a male was capable of. The rashness of Dolores's actions in this book are spell binding. The story keeps you wrapped into it tightly untill you can no longer stand to put it down because you can't wait to find out what the conclusion is. I think that everyone should read this(atleast every female) because this book is one amazing eye opener and will change your perspective on amny things when you have finished it. It's a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"This book will make you laugh and cry, but it will also stay with you long after you read it. It is intense and tragic, so you have to have a palette for this type of fiction. Wally Lamb is an AMAZING author and you may find it hard to believe that a man wrote this book from a woman's perspective. Positively one of my favorite books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book embodies all that reading should be","review":"This book is pure, can't-put-it-down pleasure. It is an incredible journey. When you finish you feel like you have lived the experiences of the characters yourself. There are no words to express how wonderful this book is. You must pick it up for yourself and enjoy the beautiful ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Come undone...","review":"\\"She's come undone\\" was a very good book. It was recommended to me from a friend who thought it was the greatest book so i'll admit, my expectations were probably set higher than normal. I found this book to be extremly truthful but would probably be alittle harsh for younger teenagers. \\"She's come undone\\" was an excellent portration of an obese girl. I was shocked when I turned over the book and discovered that the author was a man. The way he described the details of a girls life as she transfers into a women was remarkable. The tortured life of Doloris Price is one that I don't think i'll ever forget. She went through just about every aspect of life that any women could face. Between rape, bi-sexual intercourse, marriage, divorce, love, and what some people think is love, she went through it all and i can't believe how well Wally Lamb described it. I highly recommend this book to anyone going through troubled times, and to those who aren't."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books i have ever read!","review":"This book is so good and captures the inner workings of it main female character that at times i could swear that wally lamb was a woman.READ THIS BOOK, YOU WONT REGRET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an extraordinary book!","review":"What an extraordinary book! Wally Lamb really understands the female mind (right down to the enjoyment of food on the tongue.) I laughed at Doleres' ever present sense of humor and cried with her traumas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but not compelling","review":"I just finished reading She's Come Undone. I finished it because I wanted to find out if the main character had any redeeming qualities. I couldn't believe that anyone or any character in a book could constantly make such poor choices or continue to view situations in the worst possible way. I read to the end because I had to believe that Dolores does something positive about her life and her situation. She does begin to develop a backbone and improve her lot in life. For that reason I think the ending is the best part of the book as she becomes a more realistic character. The one truly positive thing about the book is that it gives the reader a true glimpse of what it is to live with mental illness. I developed more empathy for those who suffer with depression and other mental problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sucks you in..especially if you're educated and/or relate","review":"As a graduate student at an Ivy League college, most of what I read is pretentious, wordy, and a so-called \\"masterpiece\\". So picking up a \\"paper soap\\" like this takes a little adjustment. But after accepting such an easy read, you get into the person. I laughed and cried SEVERAL times. I could identify with Delores. It's funny how I identify with her because I'm heavy, yet my friend identified her due to her being sexually assaulted. We both agree that Wally Lamb has sufficiently captured the psychological consequences of these issues.Delores IS a heroine. And she even admits that it takes her quite awhile to \\"come undone\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!!!!","review":"I think that this is one of the best books I have ever read!

I began to think less of Delorse towords the end of the book. She seemed sneeky but alone. At the end though I relized she needed help and it made her a better person. I would not recomend this book though I didn't find it worth while reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book. Very realistic, too.","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, an' it brought on quite a few of different emotionz. At timez it waz funny an' light hearted, while at otherz, it waz depressing an' deep. The author wrote this book very well, an' you couldn't even tell it waz written by the opposite sex. You could picture almost every scene in your head, cuz the wording waz so descriptive. It'z the kind of book you can get right into, an' it iz hard to put down. My friend let me borrow the book at school, an' I gave it back the next day. I read it almost straight thru. It waz that good. There really are people in the world like Doloris, an' the book seemz to give us the courage to keep going no matter how bad thingz get. So don't give up an' keep on trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's Come Undone is not worth the read.","review":"I firsted noticed She's Come Undone listed in the Quality Paperback Book Club. It was recommended as a great book demonstrating a woman's strength to overcome adversity. Now I see it is listed as an Oprah recommendation -- too bad. I found the book tiring and depressing. The heroine, Dolores, is self-involved and her life spirals down into mental illness. While some may enjoy the book's quirky style, I was too disturbed by the book's content and negativity to enjoy the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written","review":"This book was wonderfully written. While I don't identify with Delores, I empathized with her. This book is not good for people who get offended easily. It should also come with a warning that it has sexual content which some may find distasteful (I did)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most depressing book I have ever read","review":"This book made me depressed for days. I could not believe that everything that could go wrong for the main charcter did. The character endured every mality known to man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some strong points, but a lot of shortcomings","review":"The first few chapters of this book were interesting. Then it slowly declined. Wally Lamb went from poignant to trashy in a matter of six chapters. He portrays Delores Price as a weak, stupid boar who has nothing better to do than eat and fall in love with the wrong people. Delores makes the female gender look weak and easy to take advantage of. I thought that whole lesbian scenario was a waste of paper and words. Mr. Lamb, you can use your talent in better places"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but depressing","review":"This story was good but just a little too sad for me. I LOVED THE ENDING and it made up for some of the sad parts. I really would not recommend this book unless you are just in one of those psychoanalyzing moods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"This book was a selection picked for our neighborhood book club. The person who chose it, warned me that a lot happens, but that it was an easy read. She was right on the money. I don't want to rehash the plot, since I find that annoying when reading reviews. But lets just say that I don't know that I could have endured all that Dolores went through without just throwing up my hands and giving up on life. She is definitely a strong person (although she seemed to always be surrounded by losers). It was a very enjoyable book and a quick read. I would not hesitate to recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read. Very entertaining","review":"There are a lot of sad events in this book. Rape, divorce, death, mental illness. And even though it was a bit depressing, I liked the book. I don't know if I was marvelling at Dolores' resilence, or just amazed that she survived so many sad events. (Maybe I was happy to read about someone who suffered so much and looked at my life and realized, \\"Wow...my life could be a lot worse\\".)Wally Lamb creates complex characters and certainly moved the story along at a decent pace. (This is my first Lamb read).I read into the wee hours to see how Dolores would handle the adversity thrown her way, so I have to give this book 4 stars out of 5. It was a well-written story, that kept me interested to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Real!","review":"I was so amazed to read a novel, by a man, about a female that was so full of real emotions. Great Book, I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still My Favorite Book!","review":"I read this when it first came out and again many many times since. Every time I read it, I feel like it is the first time and I get so wrapped up in Dolores Price again. I read this book when I need to see that life could be worse. I read it when I need a laugh. I read it when I need a cry. I keep waiting for another new one from Wally Lamb. Soon, I hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the fifth time i read this","review":"i read this book when it first came out....every once in a while i'll re read it. i learned alot from dolores price. great book to be enjoyed over and over again....not only a \\"chick\\" book...my husband was moved by the story as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It's nice to see a male writer capture a woman's voice so well that it's hard to believe a man wrote the words that Lamb did. Still, Dolores' feistiness doesn't make up for the book's other faults. The writing lacks any sort of subtlety: every time Dolores makes a realization, the narration kind of hits you over the head with it until even a six-year-old could get it. It was kind of insulting. Then there was the constant victimization of Dolores by man after man; it got really really annoying watching Dolores hang on to the men victimizing her. She seems feisty, but at times she was so pathetic I winced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart in the second half...","review":"The book is initially gripping, and certainly keeps you hungry for more- but about half way thru is moves from the sublime to the ridiculous. The character is so strongly crafted you develop a strong sense of who she is- but that person eventually just vanishes. This is not to say that people don't change, but all the points about Dolores that we come to love or hate or pity move too far into the background. At this same time, the ludicrous story line takes over and is pasted together with unplausable \\"coincidences\\", i.e. 'just happens' to recieve pictures of Dante, 'just happens' tere is a vacant apartment across from his, 'just happens' this gigolo doesn't have a girlfriend, on and on... I think this is a book for adolecent girls, not mature women. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't wait to be finished with it","review":"So far I have only seen one bad review for this book; so here is another. It was too far-fetched. It was recommended by a friend with similar taste in books as mine. She finished it in 3 days she liked it so much. It had always looked like it might be good, so I thought I'd try it. I read it through to the end hoping it would get better, but it never seemed to. It was a complete waste of time. The main character was very hard to relate to, and her life was too unrealistic. This made it very hard to get pulled into the book enough to really enjoy it. All in all, don't waste your time, or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"Read this book several years ago - and now I see it's in everyone's hand (thanks to Oprah?). One of the few book I quit after three chapters - no redeeming value that I could perceive then or now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Depressing","review":"This book is so depressing, I will never read another Oprah selected book again. I thought it was terrible, but I actually read it through to the end. I wonder why the man who wrote this book thinks he can write as a woman?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"When I read this book was being compared to World According To Garp- I was taken. There is no connection- There is nothing hilarious in this depressing book. Dolores was so weak I was convinced she was never going to improve. The revelation of why she suffered so much because of her mother's behaviour was anti-climactic. At the end of the novel I still had not figured out why she improved- What had changed in her life. After leaving the hospital she continued to make wrong choices- why was she suddenly able to make right choices???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every teen Should be made to read it","review":"I loved this book! I am 13 year old, and I have never read anything more deep and profound. Every teen my age should be made to read this book in school, it will teach them what can happen when you tease someone and how their life will be. This book made me laugh, it made me cry, and I passed around copies to all my friends and teachers. Everyone should read She's Come Undone. I've just started his new book, and I cam't wait to finish it. Please email me with any book suggestions that you have, I want to read more this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"What a pitiful group of characters!! I don't get why people loved this book so much. I love Oprah, but I don't get why most of the books she picks are so full of dysfunctional people. The book centered too much on sex and bad language. Why is it that authors these days have to use this kind of language to get their point across? (What was Wally Lamb's point anyway?) Dolores was the hero, yet she was noone to admire. She was a lot like people today. A lot of what happened to her was her fault, yet she didn't take responsibility for much. I'm left wondering why I wasted the time. What an insult to read the last chapter. After such a dysfunctional life, we're supposed to believe that everything's ok and she lives happily ever after?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry","review":"I give this book a 2 instead of a 1 because it kept me interested enough to finish it. Dolores was the most unsympathetic character I've encountered in some time. Mr. Lamb's portrayal of a self-pitying, whiny, disillusioned, spineless woman who never faces reality just left me angry. I could not identify with any of her emotions throughout the book...when I found out that the author was a man it all made sense. The man/woman, Mars/Venus theory applies here. Some stories are better told by a member of the same sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done With She's Come Undone","review":"Can you say sucked? I am sorry to come across as crude but this book was absolutely ridiculous. I have never read such trash in my life. I, like many others, was strung along by all the raving reviews this book received. However, to be quite honest not only is the book depressing, it's depressing that so many people could find the tremendous amount of sorrow the character faces entertaining, let alone someone to be placed on a pedalstool for inspiration. Horror after horror does not make for a very interesting plot as far as I am concerned and the book could have easily be made shorter. I only finished because I owed myself that much. I certainly echo another reader's sentiments. A waste of time, money and energy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous sexual assaults -- Enough already!","review":"I get so peeved at the way authors use sexual assault as a best-seller formula. Enough hurt woman books! I found this book soooo unbelievable, so madening. Here is a MAN writing about periods, masterbation and sexual assault. I've got to say, having experienced all three, what Lamb writes isnt' even close to the truth.I'm tired of formula hurt-woman books: 1) she gets her period all over the place, 2) endless masterbation to \\"wet underpants,\\" and 3) let's not forget to throw in there getting assaulted sexually by someone she knows. Could we have a best seller without it??! \\"Poor girl. Look at her. What a good book.\\"Argh! Enough! I actually chucked the book across the room. Why must I be subjected to this stuff in everything I read these days? How insensitve!! Popular literature seems to involve nothing else these days. Give me a break. Have we lost all imagination?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I expected to love this book. It was recommended to me by my AP english teacher. I had enjoyed most of the titles I'd chosen from his list of recommendations, so I expected to love this book too. This \\"heroine\\" was unforgettable as most reviewers have claimed but not because of her uniqueness but rather because of her overwhelming life. Most stories focus on a character overcoming a siginificant obstacle in thier life but Dolores had to overcome at least a dozen obstacles, all of which were run of the mill dramatic issues. I never felt connected with Dolores or concerned for her. There was nothing entertaining, enlightening,or admirable about her. She had a seriously depressing life and I found her journey not in the least worthwhile. Sorry for trashing on this book that so many people love but i really just found it to be quite ordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: CLICHE'!!!!!","review":"Wally Lamb has a knack for taking other people's problems, finding all of the stereo-typical character traits that go with said problem, and writing a depressing, unimaginative and quite uninspiring story. I threw the book away. Something I never do no matter how bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Came so highly recommended","review":"The best words I can use to describe this book are: trite, derivative, schlocky, corney, poorly conceived, poorly written, pandering, and all around not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and crude, indeed.","review":"I agree with what another reviewer said about this book being simply depressing and the character crude. Her life is so bleak and her personality isn't in the slightest bit feminine - which makes me wonder why others are impressed that this is written by a man. Her speech, thoughts, approach and lack of (unfortunately true in this society) a more typical oppressed persona makes it clear right away that this is not written from the mind, heart and knowledge of a female. I was unable to identify or sympathize with her because she didn't think like a girl. Aside from that distraction, the character was just so unlikable! Most of her actions made no sense in the context of this story and I didn't believe this writer knew anything about being overweight either. Unhappy overweight girls do not bring up their weight constantly! They hide from it. This man was doing the same thing men always do - making a joke of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much can I hate Dolores???","review":"I picked this book up in an airport on the way to Hawaii thinking it would be a good plane/beach read--and in a sense, it was: totally mindless and unengaging reading involving a heroine whom I couldn't care less about and tasteless material that made me pray no one was reading over my shoulder. It's been my experience that Oprah's reads tend to be these pseudo-politically-correct works that are conniving and manipulative, and \\"She's Come Undone\\" certainly falls into this category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Page-turner Nonetheless Disappointing","review":"Competent writing and a titilating premise (raped girl gets obese) crumble into an unrealistic ending.What is this - an infomercial for psychological therapy? Lamb creates a fascinating protagonist with a complicated life, then sends her to an unlikely cure. Life after mental institutionalization just ain't like this.It's a cinderella story with plenty of interesting details, but the denouement is an enormous let-down.Munching my way through this fat best-seller was like Dolores (the narrator) gorging herself on a whole, day-old cream cake... I couldn't stop myself, but when I got to the end I'd degraded myself for wasting time on it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious? I don't think so.","review":"Why is the word \\"hilarious\\" even mentioned when describing the character Dolores Price? She is a troubled, twisted individual who is mean not only to the people around her but to herself as well. There is nothing even remotely \\"hilarious\\" or comical about the characters or the book's plot. It is a depressing, downtrodden look at self-loathing, self-pity, self-indulgence, mental illness, abuse and sadness. It is NOT an enjoyable read at all; it is depressing from start to finish. (And some of the plot turns are so highly implausible, like finding the guy whose photos Dolores intercepted from her college roommate on a random roll of film - please.) Yes, Wally Lamb is an excellent writer, but - man - this book is just an overall downer. I need something like and fruity to cleanse my palate after this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottomline...I feel better about myself","review":"Overall it was a well written book (the author can tell a story and the editors did their jobs). However the content was a little hard to take in. I often found myself having faith that the next page will have something good for Dolores but I was left disappointed. It was sad and slow with no real closure of every tragedy in her life unless it ended up in death. I often heard that this was a great book and was waiting to see where it was so great. It wasn't so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my most-favorite books","review":"I keep very few fiction books, prefering to pass them along either by giving to fellow readers, selling at yard sales or donating to charities. This one has been on my bookshelf for so long now I can't remember.I loved this story enough to re-read it several times (another thing I do rarely).One of my favorite lines in the book is \\"My whole life still hurts.\\" (I may be misquoting--recently loaned the book to my daughter!) But, that's the idea, and if you've lived through loss and pain and heartbreak and crazy, you'll love that line, too.I hope you'll also love the rest of the book. Wally Lamb is a terrific writer and his characters are so well-developed you'll think you surely already know them. Or, maybe are them.Highly recommended--this one's a keeper and worth the reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Good God, Come On People.......","review":"Did Oprah really read this book? For God's sake..... I think she just saw \\" unfortunate overweight girl\\" and put it on the list....I have seen better character development in Curious George books. Okay, let's talk about it. Fat girl eats raw meat, sits down beside whale, ( I feel you pain), eats a lot of food, battles all kinds of stuff that normal people never even think about, loses weight, has sex, and does okay...and through it all, manages to have a rather annoying personality and overall bad attitude. So, she is pretty much the girl that gets picked up at last call. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly dissapointing","review":"im sorry but wally lamb tries to portay this side of womanhood that he obviously knows nothing about. he has a complete lack of insight. he tries to show all these problems women can have except he does it to ONE woman and its unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read.","review":"I just have to say that I literally threw this book across the room when I was done! I'm not a violent person, and it shocked my husband ;)It was just so depressing, and such a waste!If you love to be depressed and hate the world, this would be your book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through this one, too much whining","review":"I found this book very difficult to get through. The main character -- who has obvious mental instability -- has a life that gets worse page by page. Then, not only does she whine about it, continuously I might add, she does increasingly stupid things so that her life only ends up even more pathetic. Finally, when I got to the point where I thought.... \\"Okay, she's hit rock bottom, she can't do anything else stupid,\\" she starts getting too conceited to treat decently the ONE person in the whole book who reaches out to love her and wants a life with her. Amazing. I had been recommended this book by a few friends, and was very, very disappointed. I kept thinking this woman should have been put in a mental institution -- which happens -- but never let out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of my time!","review":"I read this book when it was first published several years ago. I was intrigued by the cover art and the title in addition to the plotline. Thank god I didn't waste my money on a hard cover version as so many of you have. I thought this story to be one of the dumbest books I have ever read"},{"rating":"1","title":"She's Come Undone","review":"Did Wally Lamb write every depressing situation he could think of for poor Dolores? I found this book very disturbing. I continued to read this only because Oprah's Book Club recommended it. I won't make that mistake again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Book","review":"I purchased a first edition of this book when it was first released but never read it. Since Wally Lamb has come out with his newest long \\"dark\\" novel, I decided to finally pluck it off the shelf.I won't go into detail about how ridiculous this book is because there are plenty of reviews to atest to this. Simply put, its a silly novel, more like \\"chick lit\\", and one should best spend their time between the covers of good literature. There are too many good books to read and very little time. Skip this one as I did for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"I read Wally Lamb's book, Couldn't Keep It To Myself, and found most of the stories barable. I, however, absolutly despise She's Come Undone. I believe this is bound to be one of the least interesting books I have ever read. I reached a point in the book where the main character, Delores, was faced with many different problems and had many different options and I had no idea what to expect. In most books this would be a climax where I would not want to put the book down. But frankly I didn't care. I was not interested at all in what might happen throughout the rest of the book. I put the book down out of pure boredom. After I forced my self to finish the book my opinion did not change. She's Come Undone is about as interseting as watching paint that has already dried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"Definitely one of the most overrated books I've ever read. Not a bad book, really, but I expected it to be a lighhearted story about a teenage girl coping with her family and her obesity. That's how it seems to be advertised, anyway. While I liked Dolores, she didn't come across as a lovable and unforgettable character. And I felt I didn't really get to know the other characters that well. Also, situations in the story just seem to happen out of the blue, and are over before I understood what was happening to Dolores. I had to re-read certain parts a couple of times to figure out what was happening. It does get more interesting towards the end, but not much more interesting. All in all, it's an okay book, but not the memorable pageturner I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it....","review":"It went no where fast. Why are so many people crazy about a character that turns her life around only to become a stalker? Lame..... lame... and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrelatable...","review":"Although I think Wally Lamb can write, I found his voice as the female heroine unconvincing. This book came highly recommended from many people, but I just couldn't relate. If you are looking for an inspirational story about a resilient lady...I'd recommend looking else where."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a boring main character","review":"This book started out okay but quickly deteriorated - I couldn't read past her mother's death. The main character is unpleasant and self-centered: her only goal in life is to make the people close to her miserable. She uses her parents' divorce as an excuse to be obnoxious and anti-social while refusing to take any responsibility for her life. She skips school, lies to her grandmother, and torments her long-suffering mother. Yuck. Being a victim seems her only goal in life - it's not surprising the other kids don't want to be her friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"Although its recieved much hoopla from Oprah & the fact that its written by a man, 'She's Come Undone' remains a stellar novel & Dolores Price--one of the most passionately written characters in contemporary literature. Her life story swings in lots (sometimes unrealistic) of unnerving directions, but the storyline is always involving & uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece.","review":"This book was so touching and real that I could not put it down. I read this book for a reading group I am a part of and all of us felt the same way...We found a little bit of ourselves in Dolores. I believe every woman could possibly find a bit of herself in Dolores as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a very boring read!","review":"I was forced to read this book for my high school class novel. Some people thought this book was to be very entertaining. However, I found the book to be in poor taste. The events in Dolores' life are portrayed in a manner that causes the reader to feel sorry for Dolores. At times I did feel sorry for her, but during most of the novel I wasn't. I wanted her to take control of her life. She allows others to rule her life. I wouldn't suggest this book to people who don't like to read depressing novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big non-event","review":"Despite the enormous hype over this book, it was, in my opinion, a huge bore! I did not find the lead character (Dolores) to be interesting or likeable. I found very little in this novel to relate to -- despite the fact that people kept telling me how effective Wally Lamb was writing in the \\"women's voice\\" for this novel. Sorry, Wally. When last I checked, I was a woman, and I found very little to relate to or of interest in this novel. Also, despite all of Dolores's life lessons, it was astounding to me to see how she continually made poor choices. I personally did not find this to be enjoyable or interesting reading. Just one big bore that I couldn't wait to put down. This is the 2nd selection from Oprah's book club that I have read. Strike two..."},{"rating":"1","title":"sheer disappointment","review":"I loved \\"I know this much is true\\" by Wally Lamb. This book, however, was terrible. It was difficult to read such a depressing, frustrating account of someone who I could not relate to at all. In fact, I have about 50 pages left, and no motivation to finish. If you enjoy reading about someone's miserable existance, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book exploits the emotions of gullible people.","review":"This book was a sappy, cheesy story which does not deserve any credit. It is similar to his other books, like \\"I know this much is true.\\" The only reason anyone gives it any respect is because it was on Oprah's Book Club and people are too afraid to say anything bad about it because they think people will make fun of them or something. The content really was not that great, and I feel it is time someone spoke up and denied Oprah her instant bestseller powers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it 0 stars","review":"This guy can write, but what he wrote was trash. Thinly veiled lesbian pornography was the WORST. If you have any moral fiber I do not suggest you even open this book.

Be careful who's advice you take on book reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's Come Undone (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Do they teach the lessons of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" anymore? This book was garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"I first read this book when I was 14 years old and recently re-read it (more than 10 years later). I can't imagine not owning this book.Wally Lamb is a genius and extent to which his main character, a woman, is believable is almost disturbing. I have never seen a man write with such accuracy the complexity of any female character. Dolores isn't a \\"romantic\\", a \\"sporty tom boy\\", a \\"psycho\\", popular, a nerd, or any other label normally applied to the heroine in a male author's book.She is a \\"good guy\\", a heinous monster, a hero, mentally ill, incredibly intelligent, etc. The situations are real, even when they are painfully graphic. The motif of the whale is powerful...All around, this is a great book and quite possibly my favorite novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Like a Lion, Out Like a...","review":"At first, I was excited to get this book (in retrospect, it was all hype). I took it with me everywhere to read...on vacation, at the beach, etc. The setting was by the town I grew up in, so that was an added bonus. The story seemed to be leading somewhere so I kept turning the page, not able to close it.But, if you are a good writer, why waste the reader's time by making a terrible story? What was the point of this book? I felt like it was one big tickle that was leading up to a \\"sneeze\\" for pages and pages, only to reach a sniffle (or in Dolores' case, a \\"burp\\") at the end. I threw this book out with the recyclables. Even after that, I had a sort of \\"residual depression\\" for a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb","review":"This is the absolute worst book ever written, and I usually love reading pretty much any kind of book. It was actually painful to read. The main character just complains and makes life miserable for everyone around her until the very end. I hate saying that I dislike books, but this one was just not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted time and energy","review":"very, very depressing; i too felt violated.....esp since it was written by a man!!! read it for book club read..only 2 people liked the book; one person checked her book out from the local library and i gave her my new copy(since i wasted my money on it) to replace the old copy.....would never, ever recommend this read;"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"The main flaw of this book was that the author was unconvincing in his efforts to write from the standpoint of a woman. I was never able to forget that the author was a man (as I was with Roddy Doyle's \\"The Woman Who Walked Into Doors\\"). The main character's language and thought process were dictinctly male in many instances. The plot was not credible. It almost seems that this book was a trial run for his later novel \\" I Know This Much Is True,\\" which is an amazing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"I have to agree w/ another reviewer that this book was definatly depressing.

For the second time in my life I actually put a book down, not out of boredom which was the reason for the first, but out of repulsion. I only read about fifty pages but found the main character so detestable I had to put it down. My friend who made it though the book informed me I hadn't missed out on anything. I am only greatful I did not purchase the book. The author should have wrote about a boy then he might have had more insight"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you read while walking?","review":"I learned I could! Walking to my bus, catching the elevator; I could not put this book down. I got so caught up in Dolores and the way she stumbled through life. I pitied her, felt sorry for her, was disgusted with her, but constantly rooted for her. Wally Lamb does a pretty amazing job of capturing the \\"she-thing\\" and I could visualize each and every bizarre scenario poor Dolores was put in. You'll want to see if she pulls through, too"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't put it down, but wished I could....","review":"On a table of books recommended by Oprah, I found \\"She's Come Undone.\\" I read the back and was immediately interested... a man who writes like a woman....hmmm....a coming of age story....sounds good! I began reading this book and couldn't put it down... waiting, wondering if this book would ever live up to my expectations... It didn't. I could tell it was a man who wrote it, and was greatly disappointed. I enjoy reading women's stories, not men who think they know women's stories... he was way off... I'm just frustrated that I wasted my time and money.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A character made up of pieces of all of us","review":"I was amazed at how many times throughout this book that I said \\"omygosh..I felt that way, too.\\" Though I haven't experienced half the trauma Delores did, she represented pieces of me, and I recognized pieces of just about everyone I know in her. Reading her story has given me several key insights into my own personality. I saw how impatient I can be with people when I started yelling at Delores to leave Dante when he encouraged her to get the abortion (\\"You know better you idiot! You deserve better! Remember what Dr. Shaw told you!)I was glued to it for the weekend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Living the Life You Were Given","review":"This book really touched me. It made me remember that we can only live the life we are given. In this book, Dolores Price is a young women who takes a lot of hits in life but keeps surviving. I really don't want to give away the whole book like other reviewers because you must experience the anger, the shock, the outrage, the sadness, the happiness, the anxiety, and the triumph without being forewarned. Some of the themes in this book include family, community, self esteem, love, acceptance, forgiveness, and friendship. You can't spend your life hating who you are and sacrificing yourself and your dignity to get others to accept you. It is hard to believe a man is behind the wonderful voice of Dolores Price, but Wally Lamb is very talented. Please pick this up, please read it, and please apply it to your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read...Best when you're depressed.","review":"I could NOT put this book down.

This book takes the reader on a depressing journey through the life of one of the most dysfunctional characters I've ever met! Abandoned by her father, neglected by a neurotic mother & grandmother, massive weight gain, virtually friendless; I could go on and on, but you get the idea! Yes, the writer does share a few entertaining moments and poignant memories; thankfully they were interspersed at just the right moments to keep this reader moderately interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dolores Price..","review":"I have heard numerous good things about this book. When reading it I constantly found myself wondering if I had gotten the titles confused with something else. This book is depressing and is seen through the eyes of a character that cannot be described as anything more than a self indulgent and tragic victim. I have never hated a character or person more than I grew to loathe Dolores Price. I found her to be the most irritating presence to ever come into my life. I kept wanting to scream at her to get off her behind, pick herself up, stop treating others horribly, and for the love of God stop being a victim! Stay away unless you happen to like characters that are completely not understanding of others, chronically incapable of happiness, vengeful, and completely wrapped up in themselves. I would have given this book no stars if I could have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, if slightly exhausting","review":"This is an emotional odyssey of a book, and a worthwhile read. However, you deserve to be forewarned: there are scenes in the book which are extremely painful, at times, even brutal. I loved Lamb's authentic characters, and cheered for Dolores, and yet the girl couldn't seem to catch a break in a novel that spanned decades. An enjoyable read that felt almost shockingly authentic and real, but I was ready to finish when I got to page 700+, and, to be honest, start on something a little less heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Come Undone","review":"I was looking for a book for my Book Club meeting in the next several months - and had ordered several from Amazon (one of my favorite web sites!!)...

Guess I need to find someone else to recommend reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, screwed up characters, disappointing","review":"If you read the different reviews, you read some glowing reviews...But read on, and you find some one stars -- I didn't like this book. I find the characters hard to relate to, and depressing. I keep looking for joy in the book, and I can't find any..I am struggling to finish it and I am half way through. I will not pass it on to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unbelievable story line.","review":"Dolores Price is such an unbelievable and unlovable character, it was hard to finish this book. When I did finish, I put it directly in the trash, rather than lose any friends by passing it on! I was truly disappointed, as the reviews for the book were so good. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done. Don't read it.","review":"I found the novel terribly dry and unappealing. I am shocked at the overwhelming positive response. Though the social issues addressed do deserve some attention, the novel was poorly done. I felt no attachment to the characters; they all seem totally unrealistic. I kept hoping the storyline would improve, but it didn't! Optimism kept me reading, but I hated this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say depressing?","review":"I've never been one to stop reading a book after I've started it - I wish I had this one. This book was very interesting, yet depressing. I kept thinking it would get better, but......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read it unless you have a fondness for 4-letter words!","review":"I chose to read She's Come Undone because the cover fascinated me and because Oprah recommended it. Well, the cover is the best part of the book, and I will be forever hesitant to trust Oprah's recommendations after this dreadful read. I did finish it, thinking the language would improve, and I must admit that the story is interestingly told. I honestly think that,were it not for the foul language(f-word, f-word, f-word), it could have been a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED!!!","review":"Lamb has got to be the luckiest man alive. This weak piece of writing flops along for two-thirds and then falls painfully apart. There is little style, and meager insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worse books I have read!!!","review":"This book started off fairly well, but alas it very quickly lapses into a journey of tedium. I can't remember when last I was so irritated by a main character and it was only sheer willpower that got me through to the last boring page. Having read some of the reviews of this book I was unaware that it was a talk-show host's recommended read. I really don't understand why every second person in America rushes out to buy such a book on someone's recommendation. As one reviewer so aptly puts it - WAKE UP AMERICA!! I sometimes wonder why an author takes the time out to write such a load of rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is the ONLY book in the bookstore... OK...","review":"It was a disappointment for me. After all the reviews I had read and everything I had come to expect from this book, it let me down. It was a book that I couldnt leave until I finished it, but it was WAY too long! It took me longer than many other books I've read to finish it. It is not enjoyable. If anything it is a depressing story. The main character Dolores lives through so much catastrophe that by the end of the book you start saying \\"oh, no not a-gain!...\\" It was interesting only in the respect that it was written by a male writer.In short, if you are left to choose... this shouldn't be the one you pick... If you don't have a choice and you have a lot of time on your hands.. well then ok... you should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read","review":"This book was amazing. It has the power to inspire all women, no matter who they are or who they think they are. It was uplifting because the struggles described in this book so commonly conquer people, but but they didn't conquer Delores, who seems so incredibly hopless. It certainly gave me hope! Also, I couldn't believe that a man wrote it, I had to keep looking at the picture of him on the back sleeve to make sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed by a Skeptic of Modern Literature","review":"I don't usually enjoy modern books by writers who have not earned a place in the cannon of 20th Century literature, but Wally Lamb seemed to be on his way there with this book (however, I did not enjoy I Know This Much is True nearly as much).I agree with other reviewers that I could not believe that this book was written by a man. Lamb has an insight into women and I loved the depth of the characters, and yet I never once had to struggle through droll paragraphs of narrative. Lamb does a good job of \\"showing and not telling\\" throughout the novel.What kept me from giving this book five stars is that I was so disappointed with I Know This Much is True, which might not be fair to Lamb, but having read She's Come Undone first, I expected more from Lamb. This book is an entertaining and thought-provoking read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't start, unless you have time to finish!!","review":"I absolutely could not put this book down, and was upset when I did finish, because I wanted to follow the characters further. An excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dolores Price, with the strength of a true heroine.","review":"This novel was the most enjoyable book. With a cast of colorful characters and topping the list is Dolores Price. She is a cross between Daisy Clover and Mama Cass. She comes across so honestly in her pursuit of happiness. A character you are not afraid to dissagree with and definetly one you will come to love. Any young women can relate to her feelings of loneliness, rage, insanity, joy and euphoria. By the end of the book she has become a very real part of you. She shines through each devastating experience with such admirable strength, she is a female to respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwhelmingly depressing!!!","review":"One sad slam after another - I was waiting and suffering through 400+ pages just to get a glimpse of some happiness in this poor young woman's life - none to be found! I regret spending a Club Med vacation reading this ugly story. Lamb is articulate and creative with words but don't read this unless you enjoy dwelling on life's negativity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This wonderful novel is definetely one that should be on your summer reading list! It's about a girl, Delores, and the decades of trouble in her life. Wally Lamb puts you in her shoes as you see all the problems she has to deal. You begin to hate those who hurt her, and love those who care for her. The amazing thing about this novel is that it's written by a man, but it is definetely from a woman's point of view. I think that mostly women would enjoy this novel, however, I have known some men to like it, too! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unbelievable Read","review":"This was my first Wally Lamb experience and I'm glad that I had it. \\"She's Come Undone\\" is an utterly unbelievable novel. Lamb tells the story of Dolores Price from childhood to adulthood without missing a single emotion. I was surprised when I looked at the back cover and saw that the book had been written my a man! It would even have been difficult for a woman to write such an honest story from a woman's perspective!I HIGHLY recommend this book to young women, or females in general, because I guarentee that you'll be able to relate to Dolores in some way or another. Now, I don't mean to sound corny, but if you think you're in rough times and you don't think you'll ever be able to make it through, read \\"She's Come Undone\\" and I bet you'll be touched and inspired to make changes for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Television knobs and whales","review":"Tactile imagery is what caught my attention. Pain is what kept me reading. The will to survive is what got me through the last chapter. And, hope is what I felt when I closed the book for the last time. She did come undone. And, many women do. Before Oprah noticed this lonely, vulnerable, artistic, yet love-able character....I felt part of her sisterhood. For men, it may give an inside look at the \\"fatty's\\" they make fun of in school, and, for women, it proves that coming undone is not the last straw. My advice? Read it....but, in one sitting, or you'll be miserable and elated along with her. You'll come undone...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!!!!","review":"As a first time mother with newborn, I needed a good book to relax with. This was it. I had a hard time putting it down and tending to my motherly duties!!! I'm looking forward to reading more of Wally Lambs works. I found myself a new favorite author!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better books I've read in a long time...","review":"I couldn't put it down - I was reading by the headlights on a long car trip just to get more of it. Wally Lamb's portrayal of a young girl finding herself was honest and deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good book","review":"I thought that this was a good book. It shows that if you have enough inner strength you can do anything. Sometimes I got mad because it was like Dolores got so far and then she fell back. Overall I thought this was a really good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in my life!","review":"In a time where I was struggling with \\"coming of age\\" and accepting myself, Wally Lamb delivered a book of brilliance which would forever change my outlook on life. Dolores Price is a character anyone can relate to, yet living proof that no matter how bad life gets, you can always turn things around. Lamb's intelligence and phenomenal insights on growing up as a teenage female are astonishing and I give him my highest regards for developing a book that finally made me feel good about myself and my trials. She's Come Undone should be prescribed for any individual who has struggled with depression or self-acceptance. It will alter their paradigm dramatically. This is a book of power that can not be put down; leaving one nearly dizzy with excitement, pity, rejoicing and biting reality. I have never read a more exhilirating book, and anxiously await the arrival of more Wally Lamb treasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I heard friends rave about this book so I thought I'd better read it. To my surprise, I didn't enjoy it very much. The heroine is wild and I tried to like her; but she did some really outrageous things. I hope I don't meet anyone like her in my life. The writing is good; the plot is very far-fetched. When I finished the book, I felt like I had wasted my time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone\\" is a masterpiece","review":"I have never felt this way about any book I have ever read. This book is a character masterpiece. If you have ever been overweight, read this book. If you have ever been hurt by your parents, read this book. If you have ever been hurt by a lover, read this book. If you have any human feelings at all, read this book. Lamb's main character, Doloris Price will grab a hold of your heart, and she will never let go. You will love her, you will hate her, you will pity her and you will cheer for her. You will become her"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting and Tragic","review":"My mum made me read this book and I was completely absorbed from beginning to end. The story of Dolores Price is so incredibly tragic and depressing, yet like the scene of a car crash, it is morbidly fascinating and you cdon't want to tear your eyes away for a second in case you miss something. At time I felt like it was all over for the protagonist but make sure you PERSERVERE because it is worth it in the end.This book really supports the \\"nurture\\" argument for human nature and makes you think about how our pasts can shape us into the people we are today.This book will want to make you scream at times because you really believe that Dolores is a real person...you are made to watch her life unfold tragically but you can't do anything to help her.Don't give up on this book, the ending is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"One of the best novels I've ever read. I couldn't put it down - and I CAN'T believe it was written by a man! A must read for young and old. READ THIS BOOK! IT IS WONDERFUL! It can change the way you look at life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have nothing nice to say....","review":"I will not go into a lengthy diatribe about why I did not enjoy this book. To do so would be to reveal all of the quirks it has and include a lot of spoilers for those who have not read it yet. What I will say is that this is one of those \\"Oh come on, no one is going to believe that!\\" kind of books. I found myself rolling my eyes, shaking my head and asking myself why I was even bothering. I got 2/3rds of the way through and realized these were moments of my life I was never going to get back. I moved on to another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read this book 5 times","review":"A good friend of mine recommended this book to me and I immediatly fell inlove with the main character. Its the kind of book that pulls at your heart strings and makes you want to change the outcome and make her life better. She is an amazing character, who at times tries to make you hate her because she hates herself but loving her is so much easier. The day I got my first Kindle I immediatly searched this book, but didnt find it. So when it was recommended to me I immedialty bought it....although I have 2 copies of the Paper Back version already. Everytime I find myself searching for a good read, I always go back to this. The corners of my PaperBack are folded and I am sure there is a coffee stain on the cover but its been opened and closed many many times"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"I really liked this book alot! Someone else reviewing this book earlier said it reminded them of an older, more mature Judy Blume book- like Blubber. Well- I loved Judy Blume growing up, and I thought this book was insightful and well written. It is unbelieveable that a man wrote this book, he has so much insight to be able to write from a woman's perspective like that. Delores was mean, but can you blame her, after all that has happened to her. At least she finally came to grips with things (we hope). The whole thing about the whale I could have lived without- I don't see why a big, dead bloated whale would cause such a transformation- I mean I like whales, but it was a bit strange is all. I truly did love this book- best book I have read in a long, long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books Lamb has written","review":"She's Come Undone is so realistically written that Dolores and I became friends.

After reading it I am glad that I did not buy it. It was so depressing through most of it. I wanted to scream but mostly I just wanted to finish it. I should have known, most of Oprah's books have not been worth my time. They are so overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Depressing","review":"This book traveled from the life every kid wants to the most horrific events that left me feeling numb. I thought it was the most depressing book I've ever read. Never again will I buy a book just because Oprah thought it was good!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not relate at all!","review":"Wow! I thought I was the only person who thought this book was disgusting and depressing until I read some of the 735 reviews! I guess the only redeeming quality about this book is it really got people talking about it! I read it in a weekend - continually hoping that things were going to get better for this wretched woman (no way will I call her a heroine) and it only got worse. I was reluctant to even read it when I saw it was an \\"Oprah\\" pick and afterwards I kicked myself for going on with it. I'm a 32 year old young woman who lives an average, middle-class life and I have no empathy for this idiot woman who could never be optimistic or look at the bright side of life. The book is only fiction, yet what really bothers me are the real women who think this is a good book because they \\"feel the pain\\" of what boils down to massive SELF PITY!! It's so '90s! Wally, you have no clue - this is an insult to all young women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding. Surprising ending.","review":"An exceptional book. I never once left her side. I understood her wrath, guilt and very short happiness. It is my opinion that any person reading this book will, in some way, associate with Dolores. It's a fabulous non-fiction, however, it could be true to someone on this planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Originality","review":"I think I've figured out the formula for a best-seller that people can \\"really relate\\" to. 1. The main character must be overweight and angst-ridden. 2. A disfunctional family. The more problems, the better. 3. Rape or some sort of sexual abuse, preferably when the main character is still young. 4.Toss in a trip to a psychiatric institution. Voila-there you have it. If you haven't read any books of this sort before, try it. If you have read others like it, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a roller coaster of delicious literature","review":"I literally laughed and cried for the characters here.

One of my favorite authors of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AudioBook- She's Come Undone","review":"Great Audio Book. I would recommend for mature/adult readers as it can be quite emotional and sensitive subjects. Audio CDs received in excellent condition! Thank You. Would recommend as buyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, must read","review":"This is a must read. Althought many review it as sad and depressing it is real. Delores teaches us to survive. Whales are symbolic of her emotional, spiritual desire to commit suicide in her twenties and later they symbolize rebirth and life in her 40's. As a psychotherapist, I have recommend the book to students who want to learn more of how their clients may have started out in early life, In a quasi functional family yet internally dsyfunctional. Mr. Lamb has been able to campture deep feelings of what it is like to be female, to be a regular American girl and woman with out owning the culturaly encouraged thinness and cheerleader personality with picture perfect family. Delores, as her name implies, has many growing pains, but she does not allow them to knock her down.This is one of the few books that has touched my soul"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Tired Topic","review":"Quite frankly, I am a little tired of stories about a woman's quest to find her \\"true self.\\" I found this book on a sale table about two years ago. It was $2 (hardback!!). Though I finished the novel, I found it boring and filled with cliches. I learned from my experience with it that books on the sale table are usually there for a reason. When I recently saw it on the bestseller's list I was stunned. It's great that Oprah is encouraging thousands of people to read, but I hope that next time she picks a better book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST FOR ALL WOMEN","review":"As an avid reader, I often come across wonderful (and terrible!) novels. Of all of the books I have read in my life, very few deserve a five star rating--She's Come Undone is definitely deserving of this honor. Mr. Lamb tells us the story of Delores Price through her eyes, and does her story justice through incredible imagery and convincing emotional intensity. I have read this book four times, and each time, it's magesty and beauty never cease to amaze me. The only thing I wish I could change? I wish I could go back and erase all of my memory of the novel so I could experience my first reading all over again. This story changed my life. Thank you Mr. Lamb!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is truly a page turner!","review":"I loved this book, it fully held my attention and I wanted the outcome to be good for the characters. However, I must say that I did think that at some points the characters were more like caricatures. Granted this may be intentional on the part of the author, but I didn't care for that aspect of the book. The heroine, Dolores is not really a standard heroine as at some points you feel that she really is her own worst enemy, but it is because of this that the author successfully conveys her humanity to the reader. She is a poor broken soul looking for a peaceful life, whatever she considers to be enough just to keep her balanced. Finally, all I want to say is, read this book, it is a swift read because you DO want to find out what the eventual outcome will be!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"this book isn't necassarily bad. It's fairly well written and is funny and insightful in places. While reading it i just felt like I had read it all before and did not really address anything new or interesting. The secondary characters seem to come and go so quickly it's hard to really get to know any of them. It gets a little tiring as Dolores makes bad decision after bad decision so she can finally \\"triumph in the end\\". Again it's not a bad book, it's just a little too stereotypical."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL!!!","review":"This book tackles sensational issues without making a big fuss out of it... the writer wrote about a woman who got raped and obese and insane and healed like she could've been anyone... even me. And to think that the author is a man!!! Wally Lamb, thank you for this experience... you've changed my life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down!!!","review":"It is hard to believe a man wrote is Dolores. Wally really understands a woman better than I can.The more you read the book, the more you become Dolores.Oprah, you made a great choice. On to the next book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming and uplifting read.","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Dolores Price is a wonderful character, destroyed by the breakup of her parents marriage--carried along by the whirls and eddies of the changing social mores of the 50's, 60's and 70's. Dolores is my contemporary and part of my enthusiasm for this book is due to the loving portrayal of a young woman growing up in the 50's and 60's. I emphasized with her pain, her loneliness, her awkwardness. However, from page one I knew that Dolores was a survivor. No matter how bad things got for Dolores, I just KNEW that somehow she was going to get through and make it. Thank you Wally Lamb for this lovely story of a survivor---I do not know how a man could so totally tap into the psyche of an adolescent female. But, Mr. Lamb, you hit the nail right on the head! Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Study of a Dysfunctional Family","review":"A tough book to read, but insightful to see how interactions of family members affect one another. Delores' problems certainly were extreme but her background didn't give her much to fall back on when she was asked to try to \\"get a grip\\" on her life.I liked the book but will not recommend it to young readers because of its rather raw treatment of the sexual episodes. (I find that many male authors seem to enjoy writing in this manner while many female authors can cover the same events in a less harsh way.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hours Undone","review":"Though it was well written, there was not a character within this book to care about. I found the \\"heroine\\" to be a pathetic wimp who wasted years of her life trying to get over her self pity. Sure, she has plenty to feel sorry about, but much of it she brought on herself! I appreciate that the author (a man) can sympathize with the plight of women (girls), but he overdoes it here, leaving his protaganist a spineless, self-destructive, unreasonable recluse. I tried to care, but wound up disliking this character more and more.Kudos must be given for delving into women's issues such as self-destructive eating habits and low self-esteem. Unfortunately, the process is both frustrating and predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"So, So good!","review":"I love this book! It so well written and so engaging. The author writes with such a clear, authentic voice that I had a hard time believing that a man actually wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most depressing books I have ever read!","review":"I couldn't force myself to finish the book. I got about 3/4 of the way. I kept skipping ahead to see if anything positive or uplifting ever happened to this woman. I don't understand why some people raved about this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He's Come Undone","review":"As one of Mr. Lamb's former students in his early days of teaching, I just couldn't wait to read his debut novel. It was a book that was as cliche and nostalgic as he was as a teacher. It read like one of his lessons in creative writing, using poetry and song as a backdrop for setting, plot, outcome. All very cute, somewhat juvenile and sophomoric. Please, Mr. Lamb, don't try out your female voice on us again, male perspective cannot be masked. Sometimes you were as unfeeling as Dolores, how could you not be sensitive to the plight of a young person in trouble? Mental illness should never be made humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Reading This Book - Major Disappointment","review":"Another reviewer says, \\"I never felt connected with Dolores or concerned for her. There was nothing entertaining, enlightening,or admirable about her. She had a seriously depressing life and I found her journey not in the least worthwhile.\\" I read this book in 2001 as well, and these were my sentiments exactly. Dolores makes such poor, poor decisions throughout this book. You cannot cheer for her as she becomes her own undoing, despite her poor beginnings. At the end of this book I felt nothing but gyped out of my time and hopeful emotional involvement. In fact, I did not pick up another novel for quite a while - this book was such a disappointment, and I just didn't want to go through that again. Thankfully I have begin reading again and have loved everything from The Kite Runner to A Million Little Pieces to The Reading Group to The Good Earth. I am not a picky reader. This book was just really terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy this book for someone you hate","review":"Oprah made how many people read this book? Those who watch things like Fear Factor and other reality shows to derive leisure pleasure out of the misery and degradation of others, this is your book. If you enjoy degradation and misery, jackpot. This is one pit of your stomach depression you can do without. The sad part is Lamb's writing is good, all the more reason it is so violating. Just because one can write doesn't mean one should."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like it","review":"Everyone that I have talked to about this book says that they loved it. I hated it. I did not like the character I hated how she treated her mother and I hated how she wallowed in self pity. I was told to read this because it was written by a man which was suppose to be a big deal that he \\"knew how to write like a woman thinks\\" I guess that everyone agreed with that statement, but I didn't. I don't think that women as a whole think like Dolores."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"This was an airport purchase,based on the jacket notes stating it was \\"comical...hilarious...a heroine to cheer for\\". I waded through this absolutely dreadful book over the next several days out of sheer determination to find the redeeming qualities. There were none. There is not one single positive quality in the heroine, any other characters, or the book itself. If you're not already clinically depressed, this book may help you get there. It reeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap opera and nothing more","review":"This book proved disappointing to me. It reeks more of primetime soap opera than any serious, searching literary effort. The props are all there - the father who ups and leaves, the mother who cracks up, the childhood rape by a neighbour, being a social outcast, an unhappy first marriage etc. There is no believable turning point in the novel, only a requisite happy ending tacked on four-fifths of the way through.Dolores as a character was difficult to sympathise with; she didn't become real for me. Her reasons for eating so much never became clear; how she lost that *amazing* amount of weight eventually didn't either.Ultimately, I think the reason why this falls short is because it's all melodrama and no insight. It brings nothing to light for the reader; I learnt nothing, discovered no new truth, did not stop to wonder at any turn of phrase or beautiful description."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Come Undone Audio Book","review":"I read this book before I listened to the audio version. I was very disappointed in the audio version. They left out what I thought were important parts of the book. It seemed like pages and pages of information that would key you into how and why Dolores acted the way she did. The print version I thought was very good. Really descript in that you really felt what Dolores felt and almost could relate to what she was feeling. I would advise anyone interested in this book to read it and not listen to the audio version because they leave out a lot of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for those who love tragedy!","review":"Even though at times I found the events to be \\"unbelievable\\", I couldn't put the book down. At the end of each chapter I had to read just a \\"little bit\\" of the next chapter to see what Delores was going to do next, and found myself reading the whole chapter and so on through the entire book. I love tragic stories and Delores' life is nothing less than tragic. Hard to believe that such thorough emotional detail could have come from a MALE author. I have recommended this book to all of my friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Oprah crazy?","review":"I bought this book based on Oprah's recommendation and I was completely disappointed. This book failed on so many levels. First of all, the in-depth narration of Dolores' childhood was not necessary. I know this sets the tone and it gives the reader the background of the character but I immediately took a disliking to the protagonist of the story. As an author Lamb did a poor of job getting me to sympathize with this young woman named Dolores. Second, with all the attention given to the character's childhood and adolescence, the recovery period was minute and not as thorough as it should have been. This should have been the most significant aspect of the book. I do love Dolores' transformation at the end of the book. That was the most powerful section. Overall, the book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly real and inspiring! Triumphant!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Some of the reasons that I liked it: The main character is so real; every reader can find part of him or herself in Dolores. It kept me interested from the moment I started reading it; I couldn't put it down. It shows how hateful people can be, but also how wonderful they can be. It will change your opinions about certain types of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was excellent","review":"I recently read this book for a school assignment, never having heard of it before. I wasn't sure how much I would really enjoy it. Once reading the book, I couldn't stop. I ate throught it. I couldn't believe how honest and frank it was. Some sections were somewhat unappealing, however, I found myself relating to Dolores. I have none of the problems she did, yet, because it was such a powerful story, I felt as if I were Dolores! I definately recommend this book to a mature reader. It is refreshing to see how well a man understands a woman and her feelings. I would love to meet the author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply incredible!","review":"Dolores Price is a remarkable character, and Lamb a remarkable writer. Dolores' journey is a long and complicated one, spanning thirty years of her tumultuous life. With Lamb's impeccable storytelling skill, the reader is invited to share in her ups and downs, living Dolores' incredible life right alongside her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for anyone who ever felt less than worthy .","review":"This book touches base for anyone who ever felt that they were \\"less than worthy\\". It is a realistic, albeit exaggerated, story of onw young girls bizarre reality. It made me feel lucky!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book would touch any woman's heart","review":"I thought this book was very heart warming. Some was very depressing, but it was a great book. I haven't read many books from front to back, but I did with this one in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I found she come undone to be a great book it reminds me of myself how you can be happy in life no matter what you go through in life. Even though she went through hard ship, I like it at the end that she got to see what she was waiting for at the ending make me feel good that she finally find peace within her self. If you haven't read this book as yet go and get it trust me you will think it's a great book too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner That You Need to Bring to the Beach!","review":"I read this book and it is absolutely fantastic! I literally read it in a day because I could not put it down. The story follows a rather depressing life of trials and tribulations but you can not help to cheer for her throughout the story. The book is quite depressing if you are not one to bounce back from books easily, I would recommend reading it by the sea. Also there is a tie into the sea which will be symbolic if you are reading it in a beach chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating story","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It was almost impossible to put down. I read right through it. It shows inside this young girl's life as she grows into an adult. You see her at her weakest and strongest points in life. It was a great book and I'd recommend reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big fuss?","review":"I was very disappointed. My niece recommended it to me and since we have similar tastes in a lot of things, I thought I would enjoy it. Perhaps it was all the hype. But Dolores was so angry at everyone and all the time. Until the last 20 or so pages of the book, she never matured beyond the angry 12-year old. I didn't like her and wasn't surprised that few people did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PRICELESS TREASURE!","review":"Dolores is actually believable! Wally Lamb gives you an intimate view on a person's troubled life. The characters and story line seemed so real I kept thinking on what the rest would turn out to be. I'm dying for a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"She's Come Undone is without a doubt my favorite book, it portrays the struggles many teens face. Dolores underwent amazing hardships, and in the end, she found her true self and did what was necessary to make her happy. I'm amazed the author was a man because he identified so well with the emotions of a young girl coming of age despite her troubled past. I'd recommend this book highly to anyone, but give yourself ample time because I couldn't quit reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic and beautifully written modern romance.","review":"She's Come Undone is a realistic and beautifully written modern romance interpreted through the diverse mind of Wally Lamb. Dolores Price is a wonderful character with charm and pride who won't let anyone/anything take her down. This story documents her life from Dolores's pre-teen years to 21+. It is an easily readable book, takes from 4 days to a week to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"This from a man?","review":"If Wally Lamb's picture wasn't on the book, I would never believe it was written by a man! What an amazing book! Lamb's take on the travails of a fat, abused, semi-crazy female will blow you away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through","review":"While I think Wally Lamb is a great writer, I also think he tends to overwrite, and in turn his books are much longer than they need to be. I had difficulty getting through this book and that doesn't happen to me a lot. The book grabbed me in the beginning, however it didn't take long for me to lose interest. The story was predictable, and the main character made me start hating her less than half way through the story. It's hard to empathize with someone so hateful, and with really no redeeming qualities at all. I understand self-loathing and personal conflict, but Dolores took this to a new high. I want to like the protagonists in the stories I read, and in this one, I just couldn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"9- (But, also one very depressing book!)","review":"If you can make it through the ups and (mostly) downs of this book, you will find that it was a worthwile read. This novel was so sad, and Dolores's character so tragic that I almost could'nt bear to continue reading at times. It seemed that with every few pages I turned a new tragedy was awaiting Dolores. The author painstakingly chronicles Dolores's life, and in doing so he creates a character towards whom the reader is compelled to develop some sort of feelings. Disgust, hatred, pity, admiration - these are all feelings that I felt for Dolores at some point in the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was very interesting.","review":"This book although it started out slow was one I would recommend to other readers. It tells the life in detail of a young girl who became a woman before her time. Anyone who thinks he/she has a burden that you will never over come just read this book, after hearing about Delorise life yor problems will feel much lighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about being a victim of your environment.","review":"I gave this book a 3 only because I was interested enough to finish it. The book epitomizes the current thinking in our society today : We are a victim of our past - because we could not control what happened to us, we cannot control where we will go, and who we will be. I kept waiting for Dolores to realize that the future truly is in her own hands, and she can chose to live whatever life she wants. Unfortunately, I'm not sure she ever really figured it out. The popularity of the book makes me think that a surprising number of people haven't figured it out either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just One More Doughnut!","review":"Well, after all the hype I finally read this book. I gave it one star because Lamb is a good writer, but this is one of the most maudlin, self-pitying, annoying characters that has ever been created in the history of literature. I just wanted to reach into the pages and poke Delores in the eye. Hateful, an animal abuser, mother and grandmother abuser and ultimately a self-abuser. Aside from the unfortunate rape incident, all of her misery was chosen, not inflicted. If there was one point of perfection in this book is that it was perfectly disgusting in the graphic details. One more mentioning of doughnut consumption and I was likely to hurl. Delores deserved her misery, however, I did not. The fact that other reviewers here can use words like \\"inspiring\\" and \\"uplifting\\" is ludicrous. Just goes to show you how easily Oprah can market this meaningless drivel as literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Interesting","review":"I have to admit that I was surprised to find that the author was a man. I didn't know it was possible for a man to involve himself so much and know so much... I hated the book when I started it, but I couldn't stop for two reasons: it was required reading for AP English and I wanted to know how her life would turn out. At the end of the book, I felt a sense of perfect peace settle over me. I was so relieved that Dolores had overcome her trials and horrid past. It almost made me forget the vulgarity of the previous four hundred pages. All in all, I am glad I had the opportunity to read the book. I really misjudged it and next time, I will be more open minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop thinking and raving about She's Come Undone!","review":"This book was so enjoyable that I endured a four hour delay on a runway without complaint. The pages turned so quickly as I was totally immersed in Dolores' life. I told my husband, who is currently litigating a child custoday case, that he absolutely must read segments of this book so that he can understand the impact of a bad divorce on children.I loved the way Wally Lamb described the totally silly things that all girls worry about when growing up, and how the littlest events can seem monumental. He reminded me of things I had forgotten, but thouroughly enjoyed remembering."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Come Undone","review":"I found \\"She Comes Undone\\" great reading. In fact I find Wally Lamb keeps me entertained and guessing where he will next take the story. From the very first line he had me hooked. I also purchased \\"I Know This Much Is True\\" and \\"The Hour I First Believed\\" by Wally Lamb because this one was so absorbing. I highly recommend \\"She Comes Undone\\", especially for women. Men could learn from it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not forgotten about after all of these years","review":"I read this book many years ago, and I still remember it. To me, the character in this book was like the female version of Holden Caufield in \\"Catcher in the Rye\\"...This book is excellent. What I have a hard time believing, however, is that the author is a male! It is amazing to me that Wally Lamb has such incredible insight into the female mind. I can't tell you how many times I would look at his name on the front of the cover and ask myself it maybe it was a female author using a male pen name. I laughed, cried, and at times felt like this book was about me. Great job - and this book is well worth the read. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Must Not Read\\" for the already depressed","review":"My aunt recommended this book, praising Wally Lamb for being able to write from a woman's point of view. I personally could not relate to Delores or the way she thought of herself or the world around her. Even though she goes through a lot, I did not find myself caring about this character. The romantic relationship she had with Dante was too pat. I couldn't buy his falling for her so soon (or at all.) If Delores had had an ounce of personality and I had words to describe her other than fat, mean, and crude, I could've believed that Dante could fall in love with her. I was disappointed in this book. Looks like Oprah can't always pick them. If you want a good read about someone whose life is pitiful and how they handle it, read \\"Angela's Ashes\\" by Frank McCourt (nonfiction.) I picked it out myself, and the only regret I have is that the book ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest book read this year!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put it down. She's Come Undone tells a little something about all of us. You can learn a lot from this book. People are not always what they seem . It shows you what it is like to be in someone elses shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perverted but Interensting","review":"This book is very graphic in detail. The main character, which is a young woman named Dolores, is put through a major ordeal. She has very bad childhood experiances, being raped which was more traumatizing to her than any other, and getting overweight. I highly recommend this book. I also advice you to get some sleep the night before you start reading it because you won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"facinating","review":"this book is incredibly well written. as the pages evaporate, the reader developes a relationship with dolores. we've seen her life portrayed through the eyes of her, and we root and cheer her on throughout the final pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL YOU'LL WANT TO DO IS TURN TO NEXT THE PAGE.","review":"THIS BOOK FAR EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. DOLORES IS A YOUNG WOMEN WHO SEEMED TO WANT MORE THEN ANYTHING TO BE ACCEPTED INTO A WORLD THAT HAS A PRECONCEIVED IDEA OF WHO SOMEONE SHOULD BE. WITH THAT SHE ACHIEVES MORE BY THE END OF THE BOOK THEN YOU EVER THOUGHT SHE COULD CONSIDERING WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Author, Plot, Character","review":"I love the way Wally Lamb writes and the plot of his novel. The reader will pity, love, hate, boo, and cheer for Delores at different times- and sometimes at the same time!- throughout the novel. I have found a new favorite author and I really recommend this book to any modern fiction lover. A+++++++++++++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman With an Unbreakable Spirit","review":"Dolores Price is the heroine in this novel. She has had a difficult life in that her father is a liar who eventually deserts the family, her mother has a nervous breakdown and her grandmother never knew how to show her any love. Dolores moves on with her life despite the mishaps of her home life but she encounters a lot of users and abusers...especially when it comes to the men in her life.Fortunately she is not a quitter and refuses to give up hope that her life will turn out to be the best it can be for her. She never loses her sense of humor throughout all of the ordeals. She inspires all of us to never give up on life or love.This is the first book I've read by Wally Lamb but it will not be my last. I have \\"I Know This Much Is True\\" on my To Be Read list."},{"rating":"1","title":"sensationalistic, at best.","review":"A decent story, but overly sensationalistic. I would like to see bestselling fiction stand more on well crafted writing & good story telling and less on terror-out-to-grab-you events."},{"rating":"1","title":"My expectations were too high and therefore unmet.","review":"This was the first of the Oprah's Book Club titles that I chose to read. The story had the potential for greatness, but the story teller dropped the ball. Depressing and lacking that \\"can't put it down feeling.\\" I read long novels in a matter of hours, I am glad that this one was short and took little of my time. ON to bigger and better tales!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful story that hit close to my heart.","review":"\\"She's Come Undone\\", is a wonderfu story that opens the eyes of the reader to the life of an overweight child who develops into a young woman scared of attaching to someone.

I however, loved the book... totally different than most quick reads!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good debut novel based on relentless string of tragedies","review":"...but in spite of one disaster following close upon the heels of another throughout 7/8 of the book, you end us hooked, rooting for loser Dolores Price to find a way out of her miserable life. Already deeply disturbed by the time she enters grade school, things continue to go downhill for Dolores as her father walks out, her mother has a nervous breakdown, and Dolores is shipped to her rigidly conservative grandmother in Rhode Island. Rape, obesity, self-hate, attempted suicide, a mental institution - what more could happen to this woman? But it's the good writing, the first person POV that somehow maintains a wry, bleak, self-deprecating sense of humor, that keeps us reading through this loooong book. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start reading again with this book","review":"Recommended by a dear friend. Touches your heart as you share in the emotional rollercoaster ride of Dolores Price in her long struggle to the books triumphant ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!!!! The Dumbing down of America continues","review":"Although I read this book without putting it down, it was only because I was waiting for something insightful to occur. The lack of insight and depth of the characters in this book is incredible. I have witnessed first hand disfunctional family issues (including a suicide) and have personnally been in therapy. The superficiality of this book's handling of these issues is astounding. After 20 years of working in corporate America and taking an early retirement, this book has reminded me of why, when I first viewed daytime TV after all those years I felt like I had just entered a \\"stupidity warp\\". Knowing this book was recommended by Oprah reinforces my impressions of current daytime television and the pervasive superficiality of many of our societies views regarding relationships. WAKE UP AMERICA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best book that I have ever read!","review":"I loved this book! I always had to look at the authors picture to remember that it was a man writing this book! He did an awesome job! I can't wait for his new book to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Entertaining!","review":"I was so very impressed that a male could climb into the essence of a female and portray her so vividly. Yet, Wally Lamb did so with great accuracy and entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book left me wanting more,","review":"Somebody tell Wally Lamb we want to know what else happens to Dolores, Thayer, Roberta and \\"Chilly J.\\" Just because she got her life together I can't believe that Dolores' life would get boring! I want to know what happens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!","review":"I was expecting this book to be fantastic--the reviews had been great, the story sounded touching, and even the cover was cool. Once I started it, I kept waiting and waiting for it to become interesting. It didn't. This book was a cover-to-cover yawn-a-thon. It was nothing like an Anne Tyler novel. The protagonist was annoying and unsympathetic, the secondary characters were lifeless, and the only thing I learned at the end of it was that I need to curb my instinct to buy books reviewed by Oprah. Thumbs-down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by \\"She's come undone\\"","review":"While Lamb's story was interesting, I was expecting a mature story of coming-of age, instead I found the material to be more offensive and disturbing. I feel Lambs need to include graphic language, lesbian experiences and the strecthed grasp of female masturbation a sad, dark novel that left me very un-inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"PAINFULL TO READ BUT WELL WORTH THE TROUBLE","review":"READING THIS BOOK MADE ME UNCOMFORATABLE ONLY BECAUSE I SAW SO MUCH OF MYSELF IN DOLORES. WALLY LAMB WAS ABLE TO WRITE ABOUT A WOMAN'S LIFE AND EMOTIONS WITH SUCH DEPTH THAT I FORGOT THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN BY A MAN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"For some reason I absolutely love this book. It is extremely well written and hard to believe that it was written by a man. I laughed and cried, I routed for Dolores the whole way. It gave me a whole new insight on the life of an overweight girl, the depression and judgement that the world casts upon her. She was a real hero, someone who had a hard life an overcame it. Life threw her some hard curves and she cracked up a bit but came together at the end. I loved this book and would read it again and recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"This is one of the best book I've ever read. It is so hard to believe a man wrote this. When I read it, I could not put it down. Highly reccomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not my favorite for sure!","review":"This book intrigued me when I read the cover, but I was disappointed. I think the descriptive techniques are excellent, but the book is very dark and long. It did not keep my interest consistently. I read a lot of books which are deep and deal with similar issues, but there has to be some transitions, some comic relief, or a way to grip every now and then. By halfway through the book, I felt like this book was just continuing down the same sad path. Just not my style. Maybe if it was condensed a little it would flow better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I'm not sure who Wally Lamb thinks he is. Writing from a woman's point of view and being a man is an interseting idea, but he doesn't execute it. The characters were typical and boring and the plot dull. As if I didn't know she was going to end up with the man of her dreams. Next time Wally, \\"write what you know.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars really... I dispised the part of the book I read.","review":"This is the worst book I have ever begun. It shows how men have exploited and still are exploiting women by making them into pitiful, silly, and utterly stupid characters that never have the opportunity, disire or hutzpa to learn from their mistakes. This book is a clear example why women are still being exploited by men. It was so predictable, I couldn't read any more after chapter 10. Perhaps Mr. Lamb should write a book about a male character, that is exploited beyond belief and try to make it a best seller. It seems that most men writing about men make the characters appear to be heros."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Oprah's choice!","review":"Pure GARBAGE! Didn't even waste time reading second half. Hung on through first half hoping for improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get off the pitty potty","review":"I was totally disappointed in what I had read as being THE BOOK to read. All I could see was that she had made terrible choices and didn't see any reason to change. I tried hard to feel pity for her, but lost that ability rather quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is uncomfortable writing in the voice of a woman.","review":"Wally Lamb is a mystery to me. I found his writing in the voice of a woman to be forced and unnatural. As for his story, I was unable to work up sympathy for his much maligned protagonist. This story has none of the rich texture of a Pat Conroy novel, whom I felt Wally Lamb was trying to emulate. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"story of a heavy set young woman growing up","review":"I didn't like this book. It was depressing and at the same time kind of gross. I didn't sympathize with the charachter and I didn't like reading about the problems she went through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Depressing","review":"I am in the middle of this book and am not really sure if I will be able to finish it. I have become so depressed reading about this girl's life. She causes her own problems and blames others. I can't relate to her in any way. This is not a good story. I do have to say that it is written very well though. I am almost engaged by the writing alone. It's too bad the story is so awful. Mr. Lamb, please write something uplifting in the future. I would definitely buy that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This has to be the most depressing and awful book I have ever read! I give Wally credit for writing about a fat girl, but somethings are just stretched too far. This book does not give you hope for anything. It makes you want to go to the basement and hang yourself! This book left a bad feeling with me that hoovers like a black cloud. I can't believe Oprah recommends it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETIC! This book made me angry!","review":"After reading this book I was SO angry I considered writing a letter to Mr. Lamb. He OBVIOUSLY has some unresolved issues regarding overweight, chunky...FAT women. This poor young woman had myriad problems, the least of which was her weight. To lump all of these problems into one symbol (her size) and then to harp on the problems that resulted from her unattractiveness (due, of course to her weight) was an insult to the millions of beautiful, well adjusted, overweight women everywhere. Shame on Oprah...Shame on Mr. Lamb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"Yes, I am one of the masses who read this book based on Oprah's recommendation. I think this book is the literary equivalent of \\"People\\" magazine. I recognize that this novel attempts to touch on the many issues facing women, but I found Lamb's manipulation of Dolores Price to be patronizing and false. If I am going to read trash, I would rather it not be packaged as pseudo-literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want those hours of my life back!","review":"Rarely have I finished a book and regretted ever picking it up to begin with. This book is so horribly depressing, I'm amazed the national suicide rate didn't go up after it was published. Under normal circumstances, I have no problem with depressing literature. It usually has some sort of literary or moral value, and as I read, I kept waiting for that to be the case with this book. It never came. I picked up this book because a friend told me what an amazing writer Lamb is, and how he writes women like no one else, not even a woman. I couldn't disagree more. Neither I nor any other woman I know thinks like Dolores. Usually, when I read a book, I can retain something of value from the experience. This is the only book I have ever read where I honestly wish I had never even opened the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, not my cup of tea...","review":"First off, I have to say I found this book very depressing. I found it hard to enjoy because I became so impatient with the main character. Yes, she was handed a raw deal in life, but so much of her pain and anguish seemed to come from her own doing. I found I didn't pity her at all and became angry with her constant bad decisions. I got tired of being depressed along with the main character and was glad when the book was finished.That said, I do want to say that the author's writing style made this a fast read. The pages turned effortlessly really, it's just I couldn't get into the story or characters. It was not a boring book by any means, just depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful, but Miserable","review":"The only positive thing I can say about this book is that Wally Lamb definitely paints a picture. Unfortunately, the picture he paints is one of depression, angst and dysfunction. The publisher should provide complimentary prozac with every purchase. It was the most depressing piece of writing I've ever read. I kept thinking that this girl's life couldn't possibly get any worse, but was wrong time and time again. The heroine is utterly stomped on, beaten and tossed about by life in ways that one couldn't possibly imagine. A tiny glimmer of hope in the end was not enough of a reward for enduring the misery of this poor woman's life. It was too deep, disturbing and depressing for my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be the only one...","review":"...but I hated this book. The main character was unlikeable, mean, self centered then she goes through some strange transformation (that happens when she loses weight, hmmmm) and becomes endearing, considerate and altruistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"If you want to read about almost everything bad that can happen to a person, pick up this one. Another one of Oprah's books which is totally unrealistic. Lamb is a good author, and the book is easy to read. It's too bad the content stinks. He could have had Dolores turn her life around and show how people can overcome obstacles. Instead, she was typical of our society and played the victim. Oprah, please pick a book that really challenges people's minds--if you want to \\"change people's lives\\" DON'T have any more of these dribble books on your book club! Pick one that has a main character that has redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"After reading \\"The Notebook\\" (which was beautiful) and enjoying my time off before I go to my next job, I decided to read this book. The only reason I finished it was because I was hoping it would get better, and I had time to \\"waste\\". There was nothing I learned from the book - the main character did not cause me to feel sorry for her or have any positive feelings towards her, but rather look at her as a person I would not want to know... I am shocked at the number of great reviews about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, amusing, and ultimately a great read","review":"Well, I always enjoy especially reading the \\"bad\\" reviews on here before writing anything myself. It always serves to amuse me.Be that as it may, I have to preface my comments by saying that anyone, male or female, who buys a book only because some woman on television says to really has no right to complain. Come on, folks, use your brain--Oprah's a talk show host, not a literary mind.And finally, I don't care who writes a book, man, woman, whatever, as long as what's written is true and believable, which this was.ANYWAY, I loved this book; thought it was just simply wonderful, especially the end. I think it has a lot to say about the nature of love and the struggle of life. The only note that rang slightly false with me was the characterization of Dante--I kept wondering how he moved from a sensitive, prospective Lutheran minister to the dolt he became."},{"rating":"1","title":"insufferable","review":"I forced myself through the first 100 pages of this book before giving up. Lamb does get inside this adolescent's head with an eerie emotional accuracy, but I never felt like he really empathized with the character. I was always a few steps outside of her, looking in. It felt creepy. (Unlike the view of the protagonist in Bastard Out Of Carolina or The Bluest Eye.) And one of the more brutal episodes was so predictable, I found myself dreading it as I read. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"anything but funny","review":"After literally years of not reading a novel because I just didn't have time, I wanted a good read.I picked this book up on an impulse, never having heard of Wally Lamb.Throughout the misery of this book with a thoroughly unlikeable heroine, I kept thinking how strange it was that a woman (assuming Wally Lamb was female) would write something like this - neither I nor any woman I know would have thought, reacted or felt this way.Well - once I finished (and the ending is LAME, to say the least!), the last page revealed that Wally Lamb is a middle-aged man with a family, which at least explained that part.It was well written, if clich��d and predictable, but sickeningly graphic in parts. As for funny - unless you revel in seeing people heading for disaster and being jerks, I don't really see what's funny about it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the absolute worst book I have ever read!","review":"I could not believe this book was on the Oprah book list! This is the first book I read from the Oprah list, and it will be my last! I had to finish the book to see if there was a \\"normal ending\\", but of course it was just as bad! It gave me awful nightmares! Delores should haver killed herself at the beginning of the book so I wouldn't have wasted my time finishing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was so disappointed that Oprah recommended this book, that I will never trust one of her choices again. I hoped to share this with my friends after I finished, but was too ashamed to admit that I actually lasted through the whole horrific story. Wally needs to write about what he really knows. He should not write about female sexuality nor how it feels to be a trampled woman. He doesn't have a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad and Too Sad","review":"When I finished this book I was left with nothing but a bad taste in my mouth and a sense of wasted time. I didn't even want to finish it, but I felt that surely it would eventually get better. It didn't. While I did feel sorry for Delores, it seemed like she was just too weak to take control of her own life and create a better future for herself. This book was depressing and dissapointing and when I finally got to the end I threw the book in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like being at the scene of a bad accident...","review":"you want to look away but you just can't. Watching Dolores methodically make incredibly bad choices time after time set my teeth on edge. If she had done only one of the many stupid things that she did in this book I might have been able to stomach it. I Know This Much is True is much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book's undone!","review":"Wally Lamb may not have grown up in this time frame, but this is a poor attempt to capture the era. This book seemed overly peppered with 90's language (constant F-Y, F'n this or that) and not in tune with the late 60's/early 70's (nothing groovy or nifty about this one).

I don't see this friend through the same eyes anymore!! For the life of me I can't see what she liked about it. I kept waiting for Delores to redeem herself in some way but she continued to roll around in her own self pity, meanness and self loathing. Delores truly is the most unlikeable character I have ever encountered. I do have to say though, it made me laugh out loud a couple times. But it's hard to like someone who is that pitiful. It's a shame Wally Lamb has such a low opinion of women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I waited and waited for the good part to come, after getting about 1/2 way through I realized there was no good part.

After reading the synopsis on the back cover, I bought it because I thought I'd identify with Dolores Price. Then I read the book and found it to be completely depressing and uninteresting. I really hated it. It boggles my mind that this book has become so popular. I have no desire to read _This_Much_Is_True, but maybe I will give Mr. Lamb another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I read this book about a year ago, and I'm still disgusted when I even think about it!

If you enjoy teenage angst and dysfunctional adults, by all means choke it down, but don't expect to come away enlightened in any way. This author evidently enjoys dwelling on \\"Women Unable To Cope\\" and \\"Women In Need Of Intensive Therapy\\". Why anyone would think that he can write well about women's issues is beyond me. If you really need to find a man who can write about women - PLEASE - read any Larry McMurtry. Wally Lamb is from the \\"All Men Are Jerks and All Women Are Victims\\" school of thought. He also seems to think that no woman can be really happy without a good man and a size 10 figure. Needless to say, I was underwhelmed. No more Wally Lamb for me. This kind of lame fiction belongs in Harlequin romances at 99 cents a pop. OH - and Oprah needs to get a life if she thinks this is what women want to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"This has got to be one of the worst books I've read. As recommended by a couple of friends of mine who are avid readers, I gave \\"She's Come Undone\\" a try. I had to MAKE myself finish it. The thing that bothered me the most about the book was that it seemed like the author just threw into the story any horrible thing that could possibly happen. You name it, it's probably in there. The main character was barely even likable. I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Read","review":"This was simply a great book. The story was unique and interesting and the author did a good job making me loathe, then pity, then cheer for the heroine.

It was tragic and I never laughed once. The story should have ended half way through when it was believable. I felt like more stories and drama were added just to add more pages to the book. They could have been stories on their own. The symbolism of the whale and freedom and fatness is not orginal. I do however, take my hat off to the fact that a man could write this. He did see a woman's pt of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I love it? Hate it?

I haven't felt this disturbed since I watched \\"The Crying Game\\" in college. Frankly, anyone who wishes to just stay in their own little homo-phobic world should ignore this book like the plague. I am a pretty open-minded person, but I was not prepared for many of the themes in this book. I feel like I was lured into reading something that I would have normally passed up just because Oprah liked it. After reading this book, I only felt like brushing my teeth to get rid of the bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half unintelligible","review":"I watched the beginning of the first episode on PBS and found it annoying in general. Most of the heavy regional and class accents used (for 'atmosphere' I suppose) were only partly intelligible and this added to the fact that it is far from the best work of Dickens caused me to turn it off and go to bed. BBC productions of Dickens don't have to be only partly intelligible to US audiences as the Martin Chuzzlewit and David Copperfield adaptions make clear. It depends upon the actors and the direction I would think. PS I went to university in the UK (two years at Cambridge) so I am not an American unfamiliar with the UK or English speech. Of course at Cambridge most English was the Queen's English which presents no problems to Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"It's been a about a million years since I've read the book and cannot recall the details of it and therefore I watched this for what it is - the telling of a story. Perhaps it's not even close to the original, I don't know. But I do know that it is really beautiful. I couldn't take my eyes off of it while it was on and then couldn't get my mind off of it when it was over. It is haunting and gorgeous despite it's extreme bleakness. I've watched it twice now. I loved it. It is simply someone else's take on a classic and perhaps shouldn't be compared and judged so harshly. Maybe we shouldn't be trying so hard to criticize and over-think but instead, sit back and enjoy these things for what they are - a few hours to lose ourselves in another place and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Dickens - I don't know what it is","review":"Where to start??? The acting is poor, the casting is absurd, the dialogue is bland, and inaccuracies abound. This is not Dickens' great novel, but a soap opera loosely (very loosely) based on the novel. Just for starters, Miss Haversham is advertising for a boy even before Magwitch (the convict) is apprehended. The whole point of the novel is that Pip is selected for Great Expectations because of his kindness to Magwitch. He is destined for Estella, Magwitch's daughter, yet this all seems to be already in place. The sequence of events just does not compute. Did the director even read the novel? I will be going back to David Lean's superb 1946 versionGreat Expectations (The Criterion Collection)just to get the bad taste of this production out of my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this adaptation","review":"I thought this was an entertaining adaptation of Dickens' Great Expectations. (I enjoyed it more than the earlier one with Ioan Gruffudd) If you like costume dramas of the BBC variety, it's a must. As a bonus, the male actors are simply gorgeous. Douglas Booth is well on his way to stardom, and Harry Lloyd is adorable and charismatic and I look forward to seeing more of him in the future. The female actress (I don't know her name) seemed a bit out of place, which might be my only gripe. She looked a bit older than Booth, which I'm sure she is. Gillian Anderson was a great and entertaining Miss Haversham, even if she was a bit young for the role. She was a bit over-the-top but that's what made it so enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but...","review":"I have to start this review by saying that Charles Dickens isn't my favorite author, so I already knew to expect this series to be a bit bleak and gray, but after I while, I found it slightly tedious to watch. The acting is done well(except for Estella...) especially the sadly underused David Suchet. Douglas Booth does a nice if slightly one-dimensional Pip, but is overall likeable, and let's admit it, not too bad on the eye:) I know Gillian Anderson's casting was somewhat debated because she is still quite young, but I felt she played the role well. I know Estella is not supposed to be the most likeable or lively person, but I found her extremely bland and there was zero chemistry between her and Pip, which made this intense love he apparently felt for her hard to believe. He had more chemistry with Miss Havisham! But overall, it was entertaining and I would recommend it to fans of the film adaptations of Bleak House or Little Dorrit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Characters, wooden main actor performance","review":"This story is rushed and boring as presented. There is little to no character development, zero humor and little explanation.The younger main character is great but the adult actor (douglas booth) has a wooden face that does not express emotion. No connection with any character in this version.Compared to delights like Little Dorrit (2008) and Bleak House - this barely scratches the surface of what dickens adaptions can be.In short - this was disappointing to watch as the acting by the main model-looks booth seemed off and not easy to identify with characters/storylines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watcb David Lean's 1946 version","review":"I barely recognized Dickens' great story. Everything about this version was off. It was difficult watching Gillian Anderson's vapid portrayal of Miss Havisham; Herbert Pocket was a shell of his charming self; Mr. Wemmick is practically non-existent and his 'Aged P' makes no appearance whatsoever. It was depressing and dark.Don't waste your time with this version and rent David Lean's excellent and entertaining version. You might end up buying it and watching it over and over to see how what a gem it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"This 14-inch Purple Jolly Ball is terrible","review":"This ball is too large, very hard and dangerous to have in my house or outside. I can see an injury waiting to happen. I am throwing this in the trash before someone gets hurt.

This ball can be a weapon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fun but....","review":"Our German Shepherd has had hours of endless fun with this ball. We thought we had finally found a ball he would not damage beyond use. He figured out pretty quickly how to use the plug on top to get a grip to carry it, but still played pushing it too. However after 2 months, we have now realised that his bottom incisors have worn down to below the enamel, and are very worried about how this will hurt him in the future. It is all well and good to want an indestructible dog toy, but with this you also need an indestructible dog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Durable, but Heavy, maybe a tooth breaker?","review":"This ball is durable enough to not suffer punctures from my mini-Australian Shepherd who loves to herd a big ball. I ordered this one because it's hard plastic. That's the good news and bad news. It's pretty heavy for a 25 lb dog to push around. She's learning, but it's frustrating, so she jumps and bites at it. I asked someone who trains herding dogs about that and she said she had two dogs that broke teeth on these; one of those dogs broke a jaw. :( I'm going to see if I can get my pooch to push this around from underneath rather than trying to nip at it. I am now looking, again, for this size of a herding ball that won't be easily punctured by her sharp little teeth and won't break them either."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"We got this ball for our Australian Shepherd dogs to play with. I was thinking it was the same size as the one we had at home but it turned out to be larger. They don't seem to care and they can roll this one around just as well as the smaller 10 inch one. I prefer the smaller one for them for their size but it's a great toy for them and they love it. Very durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"much too heavy.","review":"This ball was for my Border Collie mix who loves to push/roll balls around the yard with her front legs and chase them.

But it stands up well to the pawing and chasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of teeth damage","review":"I have had one of these for years for my German Shepherds. They absolutely loved it, wore themselves out rolling it around the yard. One day my vet asked me about one of my dog's lower teeth being worn down. I hadn't noticed till then and said I didn't know what caused it. He was surprised my dog wasn't in pain and he said she might need crowns if it got worse. I finally figured out it was the push-n-play ball. I looked closely at the ball and saw gouge marks she had made with her teeth. She loved so much trying to get the ball away from my feet as I dribbled it across the yard. I was sad to put the ball away for good. I now have a new German Shepherd and am looking for a replacement that won't wear down teeth, something made out of the Kong material. Maybe some dogs teeth are harder than others, I won't use this ball again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Favorite toy ruined canine teeth","review":"Our German Shepherd absolutely loves this ball. He pushes it around and loves for us to throw it for him to chase and herd back to us. We noticed his mouth bleeding one day and discovered his tooth was bleeding. After taking him to the vet we learned that he hits his canine teeth on the hard ball when he steers it with his head with his mouth open(usually barking with delight). One tooth needs to be capped ($1,000) and the other is damaged. Sadly, I can no longer recommend this toy even though it is truly indestructible and the dog does love it. Canine teeth are definitely NOT indestructible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play ball","review":"The ball it's self is fine but it is heavier then I expected.

I have 2 Boxer's and a Boston, and they play together, and really enjoy it. The dogs do leave teeth marks on the ball, but it does not collapse like the softer balls, and my dogs have managed to get it airborn a couple of times.It is light enough to pickup and throw, but hard enough if you try to kick it with your foot, you will get hurt.

Very intertaining, great exercise for them as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware toes and shins","review":"Though indestructible, which we needed with our 40 lb. puppy, this ball is too heavy.

Anything rubber or plastic, he eats up. So, I've gotten to really enjoy these Jolly brand hard plastic items ~ he adores their teaser ball and has the best time with it with or without human involvement (check it out). This ball he must play with on his own because it is hard for humans to pick up and throw since it is so large and he cannot pick it up (thus the name push-n-play) and it would be great if he didn't keep rolling it out of our property boundaries where he then stands and barks for it!

It's true, he does seem to love it and it keeps him busy all day long, but I had to get rid of it when I noticed his nose was as swollen as bad as it was. It may not be a mediate health concern but at this pace it will only be a matter of time before I have to take him to the vet due to respiratory issues. This toy is meant for horses, not for K9's. It's absolutely too hard for there noses. If your dog is as important to you is mine is to me you might reconsider.

What amazed me the most was the quality of both images and sound for a performance recorded in 1982. The concert was outdoors. It started in the afternoon and went into the evening. Despite the dramatic change in light levels from day to night the images were clear, there was no grain, and the color was excellent. The remixed sound was wonderful -- there was strong base and treble. There was also a wide sound stage. The 2nd disk with some brief interviews and excerpts from other venues was OK, but it was the MK bowl concert that really shined"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"I only had the chance to see Queen live once in Dallas during the Hot Space tour, and I've got probably every single one of their concert DVDs...

When I talked to them, they acted like they would do something to fix it, send parts, RMA or something. But nothing so far. It's been about 5 days since I first contacted them about the problem. Also every time I call their tech support agents always try to get me off the phone in 5 mins or less.

They should have released the theatrical version in widescreen separately and kept the pilot version on the series DVD, it has other scenes as they did with Battlestar Galactica. That series set includes the 3 hr pilot and the shorter movie vertsion is available in widescreen as well. I don't mind the $90 price tag as that equates to under$2.50 an episode.

After watching a handful I predicted what Buck would do. Gil Gerard must have had a \\"kick\\" clause in his contract because that's all this guy did in every episode. Season one of course was much better. There's only thirteen episodes in season two, which meant it was thirteen too many.The guest stars here really stood out and that's why I am glad I own this.

While I did watch the first episode of the pilot all the way through, I did not order any further episodes.My kids thought it was bad, too.If you were a fan of the show growing up, I'd recommend saving your money and time and savor your memories and not burst the bubble by watching this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cracking","review":"This series takes me back to the early 80's when i watched it first. i had forgotten the frequent sexual references. it's more like a sci-fi detective series. at 15 it's good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest story...","review":"This movie is great. It brings back alot of memories. Also, this movie is different than the two part series pilot \\"Awakening\\". There are some alternate takes and footage added, while other footage has been deleted. They both run 90 minutes but they have some different content. Give them both a try back to back and you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely my Favorite Series from the early 80's","review":"This is my favorite series from the late 1970's to early 1980's. The only way the product could be improved would be to restore it and upscale it for Blu-ray.The DVD's are great. Too bad the series was only 1 season and 1/2.Yahoo recently stated that this series should be re-done, I would definitely support that."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the series on TV, and glad to have the box set.","review":"I LOVE this series because it is completely hilarious.My favorite part of the show is Twikki because you never know what he is going to say or do next. One of my favorite lines by Twikki is \\"I hope you know this violates my warranty.\\"the quality of the video is VERY clear the clearest images I have ever seen from ANY DVD.Why the four stars? I have two nitpicks about the series.1. All five DVDs are double sided. Double sided DVDs are a real pain to remove without touching one side or the other.2. the box is made from hard plastic, and it is very hard to remove the DVDs from the hard plasticThe first thing I did was put the DVDs in my Targus 160 case that holds 160 CDs or DVDs, then threw the box away.I was not able to see the pilot in a theater, but the video is MUCH better quality than you saw on television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like yesterday.","review":"I remember not that long ago but a few years back when this came out.

DVD-18 has flaws big flaws and the episode near the outer edge of the disk often suffer the most. I have purchased other universal shows which had less problems. Airwolf, The A Team, ect. The only saving grace is I have a number of dvd players so I have managed to salvage all or most of the BR episodes. Why put all of the episodes on 5 disks? To save money but they charge big bucks for the sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Love It If It Worked","review":"Being a big Buck Rogers fan, I couldn't wait until this set arrived. I made it through Season One without a problem, but once I got into the second disk of Season Two, every episode freezes up in my DVD player. I tried other players to no avail. What good is a \\"complete series\\" if you can't play the episodes? Sorry, but while I still love the series, this gets one star for terrible quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Craptacular!","review":"My wife and I grew up with Buck Rogers and had the fondest memories of this series. We sat down to watch the pilot episode and forced the kid to watch it with us. He was not impressed and we were amazed at how bad it really is. This did not stop us from finishing the pilot, but it is keeping us from continuing with the series. The show is so blatantly sexist and horribly campy that we were all heckling it from the opening sequence to the closing credits. The acting is terrible, the production value is worse and the dialogue sounds like it was thought up by middle school boys. We enjoyed our Buck Rogers evening together at the expense of the program rather than from any inherent value of the show. If I could give 2 1/2 stars I would. The show is awful in a MST3K way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is world music album 1for this year","review":"This album sounds like Rough guide to the world music(there isn't this one).The album is variegated - Savina sings in a different languages, the instruments are accordion, oud guitars and many more, the songs are from different points of the world.E��?���� voice, beautiful music.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sumiglia and Savina Yannatou's Voice","review":"Savina Yannatou is, quite simply, a goddess.

I wanted beauty and function. When I saw these made of cherry I was so thrilled.When they arrived they were beautiful but small. That was okay. But my heart sank when I tried using them...especially the pepper mill. It only works well when you use the largest grate which creates huge granules of pepper...the finer settings require many turns to get tiny portions of tiny flakes. I tried the large grate setting on the pepper mill when preparing a chicken dish and the size of the grains made the dish a failure. My husband, who usually loves pepper and hot food, even complained.The salt mill pumps out salt quickly with large flakes. I am a salt lover so I have to go easy with this guy.I'll keep them for special occasions, and will warn guests when they are used, but now I'll have to search for a good pepper mill for cooking and kitchen use."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in frustration....","review":"This grinder would tax a saint!

We were more than a little disappointed with this product.We had a grinder that we had bought in England in 1974 or 5. It was wood on the top and bottom; it had a heavy plastic mid-body that was scored so as not to slip, and was still the BEST pepper grinder EVER although it was looking a tad ratty.

I've got to agree with bunab -- it's all very un-Mac-like. And, like bunab, I'm no newbie -- I've spent plenty of time installing and using software, troubleshooting hardware/software problems.

There is about 80 cookies per bag, so it makes it well worth the money spent. They are light, buttery and crispy making them great for milk.

However, these cookies are hard and dry. I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do. The \\"chocolate\\" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat. The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits. And when Mi-Del describes these as \\"bite-size,\\" they mean it: These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first. As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Center of cookie is rock hard","review":"The outer layer of the cookie is good but the center is far from creamy.

I'm 15 years old and have read many poorly written fanfics on the internet. \\"Janine and Alex, Alex and Janine\\" seemed like a long and well written fanfic, but since it's a book and not fanfiction, I gave it a well deserved rating of 2 stars. The main characters were bubbly and stereotypical (annoying). It was filled with over cliched situations (boring). The boy that's meant to get the girl was too sappy and surreal (actually liked his part the most). It didn't accoplish capturing my imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Model Behavior","review":"I really liked this book. The ABC movie with Justin Timberlake and Kathy Lee Gifford was based on this book. I really liked it and wish everyone should read it. Oh, it is about a nerdy girl and a movie star meeting, looking exactly alike and trading places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of a Christian's walk with Jesus Christ","review":"This book was a bit troubling to start as I had not yet read the preciepts; hadn't gotten to know the author and his way of writing. As you get into the book it gets better and better, the alegories become clear. Please finish the book. It will enchance your personal walk with the Lord Jesus Christ. Every day I pray I have the opportunity to \\"pick up stones\\". I give this book 5 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"I have read Randy Alcorns other novels, and have found them to make me think about my spiritual life in a deeper way. This new book is no different. Written in a \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" style, the futility of pursuing riches on earth is seen for what it really is. While the story is a bit bizarre at times, there are deep biblical truths hidden in the plot-line. I highly recommend this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful read","review":"I usually like Alcorn's books, but this one just killed me. It was quite possibly the most tedious work of Christian fiction I have ever read. As an allegory, the plot was so disjointed and incongruous that it made no sense. The symbolism was so heavy that the plot was entirely neglected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Risky effort and flat result","review":"I read mostly Christian authors and think highly of Alcorn. Although Alcorn has great talent this book was like a bad dream. I am sure it connects with an audience but this one is a differnt group than the ones that his other works appeal to. It has been many years since I read this book but as I was looking for more recent contributions to download I could not help to see the high ratings here. If you like dreamy wandering and tedious books this one is for you. I prefer Deadline, Ishbane Conspiracy and one of the most impactful books I have ever read - Safely Home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the Real Author Please Stand up (and resume writing).","review":"\\"Wow! Great story!\\" I thought, at least throughout the first 3 chapters. Gradually, as I read on, I became more disapointed as the \\"plot thickened\\" - it becomes quite cliche-ish, such as, \\"little people hammering nails into the giants feet! C'mon! (Reminds one of Gulliver's Travels). Now I'm thinking, \\"What happened to the writer? Did he suddenly retire and gave the story over to a child with a wild imagination to finish?\\" I gave it a fair chance though. I continued on into the 10th chapter or so, or until I was near tears from boredom.A Christian/\\"Believer\\" will easily catch the message that the Author is attempting to put forth here, however, anyone else will most likely be baffled, bored and or humored by it.But don't take MY word for it, read for your self and judge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful eye opener!","review":"This book is great and will really make you think about the world we are living in. Take your time with this one. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible imagery/captures struggle between right and wrong","review":"This book portrays the everyday struggle of choice we face. The author highlights the masks we wear and those that deceive us. He powerfully captures the deception we accept as the \\"good life\\" and shows the invisible web that entangles and prisons those who choose it.At times, I found myself irritated with the lead character as he continually chooses poorly, yet I could see the parallels in my own life when I continually make the \\"little\\" mistakes--much less the catastrophic ones.The ultimate betrayal in this book totally captivated me and helped me see how easily we slip into the role as \\"betrayer\\"--one tiny nail at a time. I highly recommend the book. When you begin to feel impatient with the main character, read on. The next turn may surprise you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!!","review":"Again, Randy Alcorn has written an excellent book that keeps the reader on the edge of the seat until the very last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow developing plot with no end in site","review":"A friend recommended this book. I was greatly disappointed in the writer's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was strangely non-compelling","review":"I think too many Christian authors try to write \\"classics\\" instead of telling a good story, and, to me, that's what is going on here. It's kind of like \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" on an acid trip. The main character is a cliche of \\"the self-made man who cared only about his career who neglected his family and then he lost them and, oh yes, one of them died tragically\\". HO-HUM. He gets swept into \\"eternity\\", and the scene changes constantly, one second it seems to be heaven, then the next second it's hell. I had to give this only one star because, frankly, I wasn't drawn in enough to finish it. Note to aspiring Christian authors: don't try to be C.S. Lewis or J.R.R. Tolkien. You can't be. OK?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read","review":"I have a hard time finding books that will keep my interest. This one had me hooked on the first page. I couldn't put the book down. I highly highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll stick with you!","review":"This was a strange book . . . I was confused at first, then I thought it was a bit simplistic, then I was just in a hurry to be finished with it. But the ending really got me, and I had to sit back and absorb it for a while. Now that it's been over a year since I read it, I find myself thinking back to certain scenes. It continues to challenge me to step up my walk; I plan to re-read it soon, and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tele-Converter is Excellent","review":"I'm very happy with the tele-conveter. The image quality seems unaffected by the lens extender and the added telephoto reach is just what I was looking for. The lens is significantly heavy and with the weight and extended telephoto view, hand holding the camera is really not possible if you want a shake free image. I've found that bracing the camera on a solid object produces and okay image but best results are with a tripod.I would recommend this converter for anyone wanting extra reach, say for shooting sports which is what I use it for. There is vignetting if you zoom out to far but that's a price you pay with any long converter and in this case you have to zoom out pretty far before it occurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Images But Heavy","review":"I use this lens at maximum zoom most of the time for filming baseball players. There is little to no distortion even at high levels of magnification.The only negatives are that the lens is heavy (which is not an issue for me) and the image stabilization doesn't work (well) at maximum magnification (which is an issue for me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in the 90's but not for today","review":"Just to note, this book was written in 1996. Since some of Kevyn Aucoin's books were written around the same time I was going to discriminate based on age. The focus is on makeup & skincare (face & body). Instructions come with amazing visual aids, some of the best I've seen. Unfortunately, the makeup colors are dated, as are several of the products (cake foundation, eye foundation, etc). There is also a lot of emphasis on correcting, like using shading to downplay your face shape. And please don't follow the eye makeup recs for Asian eyes on page 95.Skip it. It would be great if DK came out with an updated version because the style does seem very user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate Makeup and beauty book by mary quant, et al","review":"Update the book to this millinium.

The Dutton-Lainson 400 All-Purpose Fence Stretcher/Splicer that I bought will not grip the wire. the wire slips during the pull and that means it will not do the job.the other thing that bothers me is that to return this item, I have to pay the shipping.

NOW, we bought the THIRD in the series and what happened? no quality looking case to match the others in the series. Next to the others on the shelf it even sits about 1/2 inch shorter. I am not complaining about the DVDS at all, LOVE this series! BUT, if someone is collecting they at least want the jackets on the DVDs to be matching or similar? Anyone else have this problem? I don't see any other season 3 available on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite shows","review":"David Milch's Deadwood is sublime. It's a wonderful show filled with grit and grime, villains and anti-heroes and beautiful television writing. It's easily one of my favorite shows of all time.Season Three is sadly the end of the series, but it goes out with a bang. Buy seasons one, two and three and watch them all. You'll thank me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadwood third season","review":"For some reason, our new DVDs were scratched up and the movie would stop abruptly. Guess Amazon sold us used movies not new ones. Very disappointed, however the movie is good but HBO did not finish the final series and the ending was left unfinished. Shame on HBO hope they do not do that to any more movie series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but weakest of the three seasons","review":"Any 'Deadwood' is better than virtually anything else on the television, but do not expect this 12-episode compilation from Season 3 to reach the heights of Seasons 1 and 2.Deadwood has matured. Mayhem that followed the creation of the frontier gold-rush town has settled into more a controlled, political-style mayhem. But there is still bloody mayhem, oh yes.But they needed less machination, and more Wu.No spoiler, but something of an assurance: The third season does not end on a cliffhanger, more or less. It has a kind of finish, although the makers obviously had a Season 4 in mind when they wrapped.For those new to 'Deadwood,' I am sure others have advised to watch the series in order, from Season 1. It is not a recommendation but a requirement. And give it several episodes to adjust your senses, so that you may appreciate a remarkable television achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Time Around","review":"The 3rd season is even better the 2nd time you watch it! Since it has been awhile since first viewing many scenes seem as fresh as the first time. The fight scene with Dan and Turner is still one of the best ever...as violent as it was originally. You see more character aspects and depth on 2nd viewing. Hearst is still one of the great all time villians, too. I was not disappointed at all, in fact, it was better than I expected!"},{"rating":"2","title":"they made it right","review":"The discs we recieved had been purchased from a video store going out of bussiness and 5 of the 6 discs were unreadable but acra video replaced the bad discs in a timely manner and for no charge"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadwood Series III DVD","review":"Disappointed with the delivery.

For one thing, who would ever have thought a Western series would use language reminiscent of Shakespeare? The dialogue actually had me thinking about language and its power, pretty deep stuff for a show that depicted life in the late 1800s. Ian McShane, playing the heavy, was my absolute favorite in this series but other actors certainly were nearly as memorable- including a nearly unrecognizable Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, pulling out all the stops.I expect this series will remain a cult favorite and, in time, become even more of a collector's item. I doubt we'll see the combination of skillful dialogue, great characters and interesting plot developments - and in a Western, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CAUTIOUS !","review":"This series was received in a timely fashion. Have yet to have time to get into this 3rd Season. Particuliarly important since our relatives live in Deadwood, S.D. The series has lots of foul language and explicit sexual content. We definately DO NOT RECOMMEND it for for anything less than OPEN MINDED ADULT viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful western","review":"Deadwood is the best thing to happen to the western genera since Clint Eastwood, it feels like the real west only with prettier people. The plots are deep and involved the chareters complex and the actors are amazing. The third season was a thrill to watch it is 12 hours to watch and I got through it in 3 days. The only thing that is dissapointing about this series is that HBO my reduce the four and final season to only 4 episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deadwood - The Complete Third Season","review":"It came on time as promised and in good condition.

My only disappointment was that there is not a Season Four!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The third season is both wonderful and maddening","review":"I bought all three seasons of Deadwood in order after viewing the season I just bought. I think the third is the most interesting, but that is not to shortchange the previous two. It's just that by the third there are so many connections between characters and backstory between everyone that everything is now so rich and complex. Hearst, the heavy of the season, is live and in living color and adds even more conflict between our characters. The dialogue is as profane and loquacious as ever and Al Swearengen continues to be one of the best characters in TV history. What I dislike is the cliffhanger and non-closure due the series ending. But if you liked the previous seasons, do not hesitate to purchase the third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still enthralling.","review":"This series has kept me totally captivated since the first episode.

Its as close as you can get to living in that time and in that wild place.And the 3rd season is no exception. Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great show for grown-ups!","review":"All three seasons are great. A show of how Deadwood, S.D. before it was a state was probably really like. Gritty, tough, and very funny at times. Ian McShane and Timothy Olypant could not be better. One of those shows made up with real starts that are looking to make a great show without everyone trying to get top billing. So many great costars and guest in almost every episode. You have never seen the west like this but you will want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grrr","review":"Sweedgin... cocksukka! Damn, I'm angry! Best show on TV ever, only to end with a very unsatisfying exchange of words between Bullock and the beast Hearst, who I desparately longed to see die in a hail of bullets, if not a weeks worth of exotic tortures.

This is the type of show that you can recycle a few months after watching for the first time so it was worth owning in my opinion.

I agree with one of the previous posters that the series strayed too far from the main story arc involving Sookie, Bill, the other vampires and their political infighting, and instead invested too much time on subplots.One other criticism that I might add is that towards the end of the season the series started to suffer from tonal problems. Normally, True Blood is a serious supernational drama with the ocassional touch of dark comedy. However, the writers seemed to forget this and turned the dark comedy/social satire dials way up to maximum. In the last several episodes, I almost thought I was watching \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" instead of True Blood.Let's hope that season 3 is little more focused and consistent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its addicting","review":"If you like walking dead or other such shows, than you will enjoy true blood.

I was pleasantly surprised to find an entertaining cast and excellent cinematography.While I don't care for Mary Anne in this season, I enjoyed the other deviances from the books. As far as I can tell, the TV show is more of an alternate reality than an adaptation. Many of the elements are the same, and the characters are emotionally fairly, but the story so far is different in quite a few ways.Weirdly, Sookie's character is the one that seems to me to be most different from the books. I feel like they have removed a lot of the story aspects that showed that she was a strong, confident, positive woman. She ends up being the damsel in distress an awful lot more in the show than in the books, which I don't like.Overall, I would recommend this show to people who like the books. Looking forward to watching season 3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this show!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The second season of True Blood was even better than the first.

I'm sure that any True Blood fan will love this, it would definintly make a great gift for Christmas or something. The only things to me that fell a little short of perfect was I wish there were more bonus features. The couple ones that were on it were not that many, and were okay. The commentaries are only available half-way through the season but are fun to listen to, because they do give insight on what goes on the True Blood sets. So my point is if you love True Blood and don't mind that there aren't as many bonus features, buy and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Blood DVD: Season 2","review":"Season two has Jason getting involved with the Fellowship of the Sun, Sookie traveling to Dallas to helpEric find his Maker, and Tara looking for acceptance and love from a stranger.

Sookie is her usual cheerful, trusting self, even when she knowsEric is not to be trusted.

Second, I was even more disappointed to see that it's only a RENTAL, not a purchase. HBO and Amazon expect you to pay $3 an episode to watch the season ONE TIME!?!That's just crazy. If they want to make them rentals they can't be more than $1 per episode. If I pay more than that I expect to OWN the series and be able to watch them over and over.

Even though I liked season 2 very very much, they stop the every episode super sex scene and concetrate more on the story line. Very fun and addictive after episode 3 until episode 11.I wish they will do more episodes per season, like 15 and not 12.I just cant wait to see season 3, even if I already read the books, since this is kind of a new story I am following it."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Blood: Season 2","review":"The DVD was brand new and in perfect condition and I received it in a timely manner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANGTASTICO!","review":"THIS DVD SET OF THE SECOND SEASON HAS SPECIAL FEATURES I LOVED.

I opened the shrink wrap to find extremely poor craftsmanship in the DVD case.

It's right up there with The Sopranos and Six Feet Under. Charlaine Harris wrote a great series of books that True Blood is based on. True Blood has stayed pretty true to her words and her characters. I do think her books are funnier. The show is very sexy but I don't believe they have tapped into the humor as much. I have had a vampire fetish since I was a young girl. They are such sexy, elegant monsters. They have manners. They can't enter your home unless you invite them in! The vampire lore that Harris has created is so interesting and almost plausible. Alan Ball is responsible for this series and created Six Feet Under and American Beauty. He is terrific at the details and a master at casting the perfect actors. True Blood is a romp. You are immersed into a world that is steamy and sexy and sordid and scary.

You would be wrong, of course, since this is a solo piano album by the Cuban legend Bebo Valdes. Not only that, it's his debut solo album, at the young age of 88. As he plays through one traditional track after another, it becomes clear that the piano is his vehicle for nostalgia - it is easy to imagine these sounds coming straight from a Havana night club in the 1950s. I would hesitate to compare him to the late Ruben Gonzalez, as Bebo is a bit less florid and this album is less improvisational than Gonzalez's work, but there's no doubt that he is of the same technical caliber. All the tracks are excellent - I especially like his renditions of La Bella Cubana (tk 6) and Tres Lindas Cubanas (tk 9)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Flashlight","review":"Nice flashlight.I also own the double A version.I have to say that the smaller version seems brighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTH","review":"Very disappointed in this flashlight.

I made that mistake and it took me 20 minutes to figure out that the sides were the problem.Other than that, the product was just as advertised. Oh, by the way, don't waste your time with the assembly video on GuideCraft's website. It is a sales pitch for the product and doesn't tell you a thing about how to put it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dress Up Carousel","review":"I bought this for my three year old granddaughter for Christmas.

It is the only headgear that he has asked for again, before he always switched each time he needed new ones. Wore out one pair, only had to get a new one this time because his old ones had tape on them, all the wrestlers like to tape the straps and this year our state school association does not allow for any \\"modification\\" of headgear, so we bought these. An excellent product, I'm sure when he wears these out we will buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"All I can say is... wow. I consider myself incredibly fortunate to currently be a student of Richard Wright's, studying Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri - St. Louis. While this ethnography is extremely insightful and intriguing, it doesn't even begin to capture the sheer brilliance that IS Richard Wright. He is truly a one of a kind researcher, and many of his ideas have been groundbreaking in the field of Criminology -- especially since the studies for this book were done in the '80s, a much more conservative period as far as criminological research is concerned. This book would be interesting and even entertaining for anyone, but especially for those with a background in Criminology or Sociology. I would also recommend Richard Wright's other piece about this research project, BURGLARS ON THE JOB."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is DUBBED -- in other words, RUINED so BEWARE","review":"I rented (instant play) the film \\"Stone Council\\" for 3.99. It is a French film, and I expected to see and hear Monica Belucci in the main role. I was shocked to find that it is DUBBED!?! My husband and I stopped watching immediately, deeply disappointed.I feel strongly that you (AMAZON) should explain that it is dubbed, as this is a major consideration in watching any film. It basically ruins it. Furthermore, I would appreciate a refund, as had I known that it was dubbed, I would never ever have rented it.Thank you in advance for your help.

It was terrible. I can't believe the Academy gives awards to flicks like this. I don't even recall seeing Jodie Foster or Anthony Perkins in any scenes either, what was that? Was Perkins pretending to be Delouise and was Foster Billy Zane or something. Ick! Anyway, terrible. I guess it's one of those \\"art\\" movies that are supposedly deep. I just thought it was stupid.

They were both sharing a motorized Jeep so we thought they needed something new. When we saw the price of this item (thanks Amazon for everyday low prices) we jumped on it.Well, it's been about a month since the kids started playing with it and they love it! It has a fairly robust built to it and is holding up very well. My kids ride it on the sidewalk, in the driveway, and all over the grass. They have been jumping curbs with it also, all without any damage or issues! The battery has been lasting about 2 days (about 1.5 hours of use per day) before needing a charge. We just plug into the wall outlet and let it charge over night and it is good to go the next day.I highly recommend this purchase to all. Your kids will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for everyone","review":"We bought this for my son's 3rd birthday. He received the smaller version for his 2nd birthday and wore it out. I was concerned about the size since it is more than twice the size of the smaller version. It took my son about 2 minutes before he was riding it like a pro. I love the reverse feature and well as the turbo. The option of disengaging the turbo feature is great with his smaller cousins want to jump on. Before I bought this I read several reviews and my problems with this toy are the same as everyone else. It would be nice to have an 'off' switch instead of having to disconnect the battery. Also, the foot pedal works great for my son, but can be tricky when smaller ones climb off and on and accidently step on the pedal. Overall, he loves it, I recommend buying a 2nd battery since the charging time is so long but this was definitely a good purchase. He rides it over rocks, grass, dirt and it seems to do pretty well. Even my 6 year old niece loves riding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for little ones","review":"My daughter was given this golf set when she was 3. We've had it for 4 years, and it is still one of the favorites in the house. It has lasted much use & abuse, and looks as good as when we got it. The storage of the \\"holes\\" is very useful, but requires adult \\"assembly\\" to replace them on the carrier after play. We still have all the parts. From our experience, this toy is exciting for kids from 2 years to 7 years. At 7, they would rather use \\"real\\" clubs & play real golf. It is a GREAT indoor game for year-round!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Par for the course","review":"What is there to say? I'm not sure what could be done to mess up a toy this simple. It delivers just what you'd expect. We've only had it a few weeks, but it seems sturdy. Putting it together was simple. I like the target cup thing. (I'll probably use it for putting practice myself.) Our 20 month son enjoys the toy. The plastic \\"bag\\" is sturdy, and our son enjoys pushing it around the room as much as he likes hitting balls with the clubs. I rated the educational value as low as I did because, realistically, I'm not sure there's much educational value in a sports toy like this. We chose this one over the Fisher Price because the Fisher Price seemed more complex than necessary. (Especially since our son is below the recommended age range for these types of toys.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like Daddy's!!!","review":"We got this for our daughter when she was 3 so she could play golf just like Daddy. Her favorite part of it is that it has the bag like Daddy, and he can caddy for her! The two of them get out his putting green, and set up a golf course in the family room. This is a great durable toy, like all Little Tikes stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor story, not worth the money","review":"Unfortunately, this movie fell well below my expectations. The story is ridiculous and contrived. There is minimal building done done by Bob and his crew, almost as if it was a side note. Spud the scarecrow and Scrambler are the main characters in this movie who are trying to find a golden hammer to give as a gift to Bob. The hammer was supposedly hidden by a pirate and they follow senseless clues found in pirate chests that they take from various locations without asking. I cannot find one redeeming thing to say about this movie. It is not educational and not particularly engaging. While I am a fan of the Bob the Builder series, this movie is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Junk","review":"This 60 minute Bob the Builder was complete junk. It was painfully repetitive and made no attempt whatsoever to challenge the intellects of young viewers. Basically, a pirate--who built their town centuries ago--hid a golden hammer somewhere. He leaves clues all over town for Scrambler and Spud to follow. The clues are in ridiculous places, though. Like a toy shop and museum that certainly didn't exist when the pirate lived there.There doesn't seem to be any problem with Spud stealing artifacts from the museum, and of Bob just accepting the ancient golden hammer as his (shouldn't he have put it in the museum?).Maybe I'm expecting too much, but my four year old was questioning it... Pretty disappointing. Fortunately, it was free on Amazon Prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful, wholesome, and family-friendly adventure","review":"Bob the Builder and his Top Team star in an exciting new computer-animated DVD for children, The Golden Hammer: The Movie.

Essentially a unix text about sed, awk and Perl. Ostensibly, it has to do with computational biology and the parsing of the various common data formats in that field. But a perusal of the book shows that the scope is more general. The biology formats are used as case studies. If you are in high energy physics, for example, and you have accelerator data in some other format, the book might still be of use in helping you parse out what you need.The sed and awk discussions could have be written 10 years or more ago. Those programs have been very stable. Whereas Perl has undergone relatively rapid changes. In fact, as the book indicates, Perl is far more powerful than sed or awk. It is a fully fledged programming language that can take you some time to master. The book doesn't give a comprehensive coverage of Perl's abilities. But for the expected reader, it may suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title, it has nothing to do with Biology","review":"This is just another basic book on how to use Linux, that's all.

The author should have quit there. The remaining 114 pages or so are a complete disappointment. I tried to buy into the plot - but it was increasingly more difficult to buy. In addition, the more I read, the farther I strayed from the initial story. I should have began a completely new novel instead of trying to finish this one.

Give me more, give me something I can lose myself in, I just cannot get into termanology like that. The story had potential, but the characters were annoying, especially Christiana.

I made it to just beyond the wedding and I just could not make myself complete it. It may have just been a matter of bad timing for me... I don't know.I liked the characters, David, much more than Chritiania, but I just was not that interested in the intrigue. I guess it was not intriguing enough. Maybe if it had some humor in it I could have stayed interested...?The love scenes were a little flat for me. I switched to a Gaelen Foley book instead and could not put it down for the first 150 pages....It is much more exciting and passionate and intriguing, and they haven't even had sex yet!Get the Hunter book if you want a bland romance in a historical setting, not too exciting to get your self worked up about.

I bought this book based on all the online rave reviews, but I was very disappointed. The story was very dull. The paperback I read is 389 pages long, and my interest was not gained until the last 100 pages or so. The political storyline was dull mainly because we had no details until the end of the book - just mysterious 'hints' throughout. And David's personality came off as being more uneven and inconsistent rather than three dimensional. I would not recommend this book. But as I said, I am in the minority..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"No Good\\"","review":"I'm so glad in didn't read this before reading \\"by possession\\" and By design\\" Because I would not have read them after reading By Arrangement. This book started out okay and as the story went on it got progressively boring. It was really hard for me to get through. Too much plotting took away from the romance of the story. The romantic scenes were not that good. The hero and heroine were just ok. All in all it was very dull. But MD made up for it with next following series."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"I did enjoy this book. The only problem was that i'm use to reading books were the charators are more important then the setting.

I started reading it and found myself not concentrating. I had an immediate dislike to the heroine. She was so mean to the hero and although he wasn't high on my list, I felt bad for him. The plot appeared to develop at a snail like pace. I made it to page 72 and could no longer read it anymore. I really wanted to like this book. I agree with another reviewer, perhaps the novel I read before had my standards set too high. My love for historicals is allowing me to give it a 2 though 1.5 would be more fitting. I may try this book later in the future.Oh. I forgot to add, the order in which you read these books is quirky.

Of course it all goes bad, predictable but still fun and entertaining. There's a lot of gunfire, explosions, tough-guys and a gal, and some humor thrown in. It translates to a very good action-thriller. Academy Award nominee Eric Roberts, is as good as he was in Runway Train (he was nominated for an Academy Award for in 1985). At the end of this film you might be surprise who the real target is! It's worth your time, however it is only available in limited quantities, you'll have to order it and wait. But it's worth it.

This collection is superb; and Orwell's essays will endure not only for his insight, but also as historic pieces that reflect on critical events and people of the 20th Century. His Notes on Nationalism is the best piece, perhaps, ever written on the topic; his views on Gandhi and Yeats are revealing. And for those who are Dicken's fans, his essay on the great author may be worth the price of the entire volume. Any aspiring writer or literary critic must read \\"Politics and the English Language\\"--it should be mandatory for any college level English major or professor. One may not always agree with Mr.Orwell's socialist political views, but these essays are extremely well-written, very thoughtful, and ultimately moving.

They run true to size and look great. I love them and the price was good when it was on sale for $45. They are comfortable and don't hurt my feet even when I wear them all day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"I was wanting some red shoes for an upcomming event and these seemed perfect. The website showed a red smooth patent leather shoe and I loved the heel heigth. However, when the shoes arrived they were rough in texture, not patent leather. I would have been ok with them if they had been the red croc skin ones also avaiable, but they were neither of the red shoes shown on the site. I was extremely dissapointed, so I have returned the shoes. Amazon was quick to refund the money, but I had to quickly look elsewhere to find the red patent leather shoes I had thought I was receiving from Amazon. The heel heigth and the Berry style look great, but not in the color and texture I received. Don't trust the picture, because it is extremely missleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy with purchase or service","review":"My order took way longer to get to me than I expected and longer than any order I have placed with Amazon previously. The shoes themselves run small and I didn't have enough time to break them in before the event for which I ordered them. They are more pointy than I expected, the pictures don't really reflect how long the toe is. I still haven't even worn them and regret having ordered them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, a bit slim fitting","review":"I bought these in two colors, navy and dark brown reptile. Why is it so hard to find navy pumps anyway?!! They go great with denim and navy trousers. Anyway, I found the colors and surface pattern to be very similar to what was pictured on Amazon. The heel height is perfect for me.I knocked off one star because I think the toe area of the shoe (and the part where your foot is widest) is a little slim. I don't think moving up a half size would help, as there is a little gap in the back of the heel, and if I moved up in size, my heel might slip out. So if regular width shoes are often too tight for you, you may not want these. Otherwise, I'm hoping these will soften and break in after wearing a few times.I also wish these shoes were cheaper, so it would be more affordable to have them in several colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have several pairs of Bandolino shoes in this exact style (Berry) which I love. This pair turned out to be all man-made material (synthetic) rather than leather, like my other 3 pair, so shoes were less comfortable or breathable.The synthetic material had a strong chemical odor, which might have dissapated over time but I did not want to take a chance on that. The styles which state they are leather would be a better purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pair of shoes but.....","review":"I purchased three pairs of these pumps because of the fit and the fact that they are comfortable. The height of the heel is good for walking around without squishing your toes. The shoes work well to enhance any outfit, pants or skirt. However, the major flaw of them relate to how they are made. The shoe is glued to the sole and in some cases the material look as if they are ready to be pull away from the sole of the shoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Berry Pump Review","review":"These shoes looked very nice on the web. But when I got them out of the box, I knew right away that they would not feel good. The toe is too pointed, so there is not much room for your toes to be comfortable. I usually wear a 7.5, but these were too small, felt even smaller with the pointed toe, and were also stiff.I do not recommend these unless you only plan to wear them for short periods at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I ordered Black Patent Croc, size 5M, which is my actual size. Regardless of it pointed toes, these shoes are 100% true to the size. It looks so classy, sexy, and beautiful. The height is just perfect even for whole day wear. I love it and I will buy another pairs soon. The quality is also really good, worth the money I spent on it. I wish there could be red fire color in these shoes. For thick and wide feet, I don't recommend it because these shoes are really meant for slim feet like mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bandolino shoes fabulous!","review":"Very stylish, and comfortable.

His book is an in-depth analysis of important era in the history of Buddhism and Japan, which surpasses all other works written on the topic, and which is nonetheless accessible to the non-specialist. Written in an engaging style which informs without resorting to pedantry, Dr. Abe introduces us to Kukai and his social and historical milieu. Focusing on Kukai's construction of Esoteric Buddhism as an innovative category in the field of Buddhist discourse and practice, he avoids the simplistic models of past studies and brings to his topic an analytic sophistication that is matched only by his eloquence.This work is by far the best book on Kukai and Shingon Buddhism currently available in English, and it should also, hopefully, exert a powerful influence of the field of Buddhist Studies as a whole, for which it should serve as a model for excellent scholarship."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mantra for Abe","review":"For the first time I read a convincing explanation, what Kukais thinking - and thus also Esoteric Buddhism - was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Biased against French Rev","review":"The author completely disregards many important factors that contributed to the divergent paths of the French Revolution and the American Revolution.

The last thing Con wants is to fall for anyone, much less the unconventional, irrepressible Val, but despite his best intentions he's falling hard. Con and Val unite to save her business, and to save her friend from a horrible marriage -- but more than that, they find they've united in a bond of love that nothing can break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank heavens there are three brothers!","review":"After reading THE PASSION OF PATRICK MACNEILL, I had certain expectations for Con.

The caterpillar/cocoon/butterfly process offers a wonderful lens through which to view such transformation. So I returned to this wonderful book and found anew the encouragement to let go of whatever holds us back from being all we were meant to be--and I found again the enduring hope offered in its pages. This book is as relevant today as when Trina Paulus wrote it in 1972. We are always in need of hope.Though this book may appear simple and child-like with its artwork, don't be fooled. It is filled with profound wisdom, as in: \\"How does one become a butterfly?\\" she asked pensively.\\"You must want to fly so much that you are willing to give up being a caterpillar.\\"This is an amazing little book for anyone who faces change and who could use a dash of hope in their daily life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple & Complex","review":"This is a great book for the person that is feeling worn-out by the \\"rat race\\".

We read a chapter each night before bed and both love the story and the pictures. Although I don't think my son catches the greater meaning, I love knowing that as he grows he will come to love the book not only because of the pictures and the miracle of the catepillars' transformation into a butterfly, but also because of the feeling of peace and hope it brings to the life of the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"This product was not what I expected, but is absolutely delicious and addictive. The granola has the consistency (and taste) of crumbled pecan cookies, flavored with cinnamon; more crumbly and less crunchy than I expected.

This product has one major flaw though: FAR too expensive. Delicious, but not worth 18 dollars (after shipping)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration to Personally Do Better","review":"The excerpts from Franklin's and others' own writings is invaluable in allowing the reader to truly get to know the man.

This work hits the mark on showing his human side, his intellectual rigor, and is also very good on his interactions with the other Founders. I found it more readable than other Franklin biographies. I recommend this book highly and believe it would also be a great text for our educators at the high school level or higher. Of course, History and its significance to people today is not really taught in high school much anymore. I wonder what people like old Ben would make of our glaring ignorance of our own history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to know the REAL Benjamin Franklin...","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is well written... even young children could enjoy the stories. Franklin was a remarkable man, he was a man of character. He excelled in many areas as a scientist, inventor, and politician. There are many lies being told about him today to defame his character, and this book will help you understand the REAL man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Benjamin Franklin and the American Classic Series","review":"I have recently purchased 3 of the American Classic series, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin. These 3 books come with a time-line,Life Story, and an index and thumbnail(s) of the individual by contemory. Allof which make these books great reference books for any library. So a brilliantquote on almost any subject is just a minute away.I have read Ben Franklin and a quick scan of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The Real Benjamin Franklin is an easy read, well structured, well documented(every page is footnoted). It gives you a general feeling for the man, the times, and his possition in it.The Real George Washington (American Classic Series)The Real Thomas Jefferson (American Classic Series)"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ for every AMERICAN","review":"This is a must read for anyone who believes in the Constitution. It shows what our Founding Fathers endured to make our Country possible! Parents can help their children learn about the Real Franklin by reading this to their children and discussing it! It can be done a few pages at a time. As an educator retired, I recommend this book highly. All books in the American Classic Series are winners. Help preserve the true reason our ancestors founded America, get these books, read them, and share with your children, siblings, and friends. Maybe even those who are not sure what or how America was founded. America was founded by the True grit, blood, sweat, sacrifices, and endurance, but most of all love of freedom of our founding fathers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"remixes should be long not short","review":"tracklist:Thank God I'm A Country Boy (Radio Version)3:45Thank God I'm A Country Boy (Club Mix) 4:47Thank God I'm A Country Boy (Unplugged Version) 3:45Oh Susanna (Dance Mix) 4:25Oh Susanna (Party Mix) 3:54"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid to return broken rice cooker","review":"First off - I hate posting reviews - especially bad ones. I have never done this before - but I had to this time. I paid $40 plus shipping for this rice cooker from Antonline (because the PRODUCT got great reviews). I used it once, and it didn't work, so I called Sanyo (which is what the seller said I had to do before contacting them for a refund). Sanyo said it was a faulty item and to send it back to the seller. The seller then made ME pay the shipping costs ($13.95 for a $40 item) to ship it back to them, and it will take up to a month for the return transaction. I found out later that another buyer had a similar problem with a lamp purchased from these folks. I would never have a buyer pay to return a broken item that I sold to them. It's just not good business...and they will never get mine again. Hope this helps someone else some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT broken","review":"I have just use it for 4 month and it broken now, besides I did not know how to repaire it, I feel very angry about it"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"Trying to find a reasonably priced non stick rice cooker.

Dworkin, like most radicals, simplifies life. she's had a bad life but I'm afraid that doesn't make her a good writer. For example. She describes penises in such a hysterical, bizarre, and overblown manner. I ended up checking mine for razor blades. When a man writes about vaginas in such a fearful way he is rightly laughed at. Andrea Dworkin is, basically, a female Sam Kinison without the humour. You've got to feel sorry for her but that doesn't make her right. All fascists use past grievances as a way of inciting hatred. Dworkin is no different. so, i'm sorry and everything, but the book is pretty dire."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY CAPTIVATING STORY","review":"This memoir by Jennifer Lauck is absolutely incredible. I could not put the book down. Her story breaks you heart. Jennifer speaks from the child's viewpoint, and yet she expresses the child's thoughts, not her voice, so there is no \\"baby talk\\".

I connected it to my RFL600D amplifier and it did not work. Causes the sub to \\"THUMP\\" when I connect it, which also causes all the lights in my car to dim (does not happen during normal sub operation), then basically turns off the sub output. The sub output will not return unless I turn the knob down close to the minimum setting, which then causes the sub to output max volume... After I changed my pants I decided to get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the money!","review":"This was advertised as a replacement for the ebc control knob that the older style mtx amps used.

When I plug the light into my Mac iBook's USB port, it is impossible to get a good, solid fit, and that alone causes quite a bit of unwanted give. Adding to this problem, the arm is very flimsy and unstable. The least bit of vibration causes it to sag out of shape bit-by-bit, to the point that it is no longer aimed where it was needed - so annoying! Good luck using this thing on an airplane with any turbulence (one of the primary reasons I bought it).In my experience, this is a poorly made product that is not worth the hassle of constant adjustment.

I purchased this to illuminate my 17\\" notebook keyboard and it just doesn't work like I thought it would. The light is sufficiently bright and the build quality is top-notch, but there are a couple of caveats that keep me from recommending it. First, the beam of light is far too focused. It's more of a flashlight than a lamp. It only illuminates about half of my keyboard which is fine in a pinch, but hardly usable for extended periods of time. Second, it's way too heavy; it sags and bends from it's own weight. It's inevitable that if you get it into a position where it stays put, it will be pointing too far up or down, or in your eyes. I leave this thing in the bottom of my laptop bag and pull it out every so often for various situations, but it's too frustrating to use on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough light, & too narrow a beam, for desktop use","review":"I was hoping to use this product to illuminate my desktop keyboard, which I use at night. Unfortunately I can't get the beam to cover the entire keyboard, and even where it does cover it's not bright enough for me to read the keycaps.I know it's advertised for notebook, so it's my own fault - notebooks have smaller keyboard and also the low light trades off against low battery draw. So it might be ok in a notebook context (I have the luxury of a lighted keyboard on my MacBook so don't have that problem).Meanwhile I'm still looking for a good solution for my nighttime problem.

Megaman does not have a large inventory of weapons like he does in his other games.The arenas are very small, and there are only about 8 stages. AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SKILL INVOLVED.
