I will be the first to admit that this is because these selections are \\"not as great\\" as his signature pieces but they are still good works and worthy of a hearing.The tone of the selections, as with virtually all of his works, is that of love songs.

I was very disappointed in this series of shorts of The Black Stallion produced for the Family Channel. This may good for children but for someone who was looking for the mystical and beautiful film that moved me in my childhood, it was an extremely poor imitation. What really irks me is the fact that nowhere does the product information explain that it is not the film of the same name done so well in 1979. I shoulda looked closer and I will next time. Just because its name is The Black Stallion based on the book by Walter Farley, starring Mickey Rooney does not make it the classic from 1979 produced by Frances Ford Coppola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the movie","review":"I originally bought this DVD thinking that this was the movie starting with Alec Ramsay being saved by the Black. As I watched it I realized that it was a TV show and a poorly done one as well. The script is poorly written at best and it's almost a shame that Mickey Rooney accepted a contract. There are a total of about 4 episodes plus a bonus that seemed to be a bonus only because I couldn't determine where it fell in the timeline. Having read all of Walter Farley's books, I couldn't even tell which books the show was based off of. The Black was played by a Friesan Stallion, not even an Arabian, and was referred to as a Thoroughbred. Having been involved with horses almost all of my life, this was probably the most disturbing. The cinemetography was poor and I probably will not ever watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this DVD","review":"Poor story line and just plain bad acting.

We thought, cool design, good price, Motorola... Didn't quite work that way.We both agree that the unit is relatively comfortable, and the flip-out boom is a neat feature - makes for a very small unit when not in use. The buttons are also easy to use, and pairing is simple. Having the boom flip be the on/off is also a nice feature.Unfortunately, the thing that really matters - sound - isn't there. Even in my luxury SUV, I can barely hear anyone at freeway speeds, with the volume at max. He's got a sportier (read: noisier) SUV, so he can hear even less. We also both feel that fit has a lot to do with this. I, for one, ended up pushing the thing up against my ear, which improved the volume.

The mechanism that switches the device on and off via the boom is flimsy and if not highly unreliable immediately, it will become so after moderate use.Our technical department had the displeasure of repairing one of the headsets and were disgusted by the build and design quality.I'm not the kind of person who usually writes products reviews, but wish I had read a review like this before I ordered the Motorola product.Needless to say we will not be buying in this Motorola product for our staff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Antithesis","review":"Or perhaps it's the Bible that exposes and clearly illustrates all of the inaccuracies of this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fervent reader of history","review":"Regretfully I had to borrow my hardcover copy from the main public library in order to read it, because I am still waiting to get the copy I purchased from amazon.com since Nov. 10, 2001.

I was looking to replace the 6' hose that came with my dust collector with a longer section of hose. My original hose also has a plastic instead of metal spiral, but the plastic spiral on my original hose is much stronger.

The feel of the ball off the bat is smooth, and after intentionally hitting a few off the end and handle, the bat did not break. Also, the vibration with this bat is much less than a standard ash or maple bat, which helps in the early season games here in Wisconsin so I can feel my hands after a fist/end job.

Writing has become a spiritual practice for many seekers on the creative process route. What makes \\"A Writer's Book of Days\\" so unique is it's built-in user friendly, compassionate approach, and Judy Reeves' intoxicating humor and witty writing style. Her writing prompts definately will launch any writer, experienced or not, into a blissful, maniacal, creative swell full of wonderous surprise. A Writer's Book of Days is a must have on any writer's shelf. Move over Annie Lamott, Natalie Goldberg, Julia Cameron, Judy Reeves is here and faced out! Stacked high on the trade tables!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workbook","review":"If you are looking for some sort of exercises to get you writing, this is a great book. Lots of prompts that you can take in multiple directions. Tips on areas to work on as you write. Suggestions about how to incorporate these exercises into writing that you are currently working on. For anyone who wants to write, this book will have you picking up paper and pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Edition","review":"I am writing this review for anyone who wants to read this book on their Kindle. I am reading and writing from this book with several friends and am really enjoying both the content of the book and the daily writing ideas. The book is very good at prompting you to write - great if you hate the \\"blank page\\" looking back at you. However, my only complaint is with the Kindle format - the daily inspirations are in small boxes scattered throughout the chapters - great in the physical book, but almost microscopic in the digital version!! It adds a new challenge to each days writing. Make sure you check out the \\"look inside feature on each before making your choice. It is a wonderful book for anyone looking to be or become a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Writer Needs This Booko","review":"This is a great book every writer needs for his/her \\"Writing Books\\" shelf. But you won't actually leave it on the shelf - you will carry it around with you in your writing bag or purse, or you'll leave it handy on your desk, since it's a constant source of inspiration. My writing group used this for prompts more times than I can count.I've had the pleasure of taking classes taught by Judy and she is a wonderful, giving teacher. That generous spirit comes through on the pages of this book. Buy it. You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Writing Buddy - Lots of Ideas and Inspiration","review":"I am always on the look out for quality writing books which will inspire me as a writer and that I can recommend to others to inspire their writing as well. Judy Reeve's well received book is successful on both counts - exceeds my hopes and expectations in every way (except, perhaps for the unusual color choice of orange for a highlight color in the layout of the book.)The book is simple to understand and implement. Each month of the year has a guideline, some interesting content with fun facts like James Michener started writing at age 40 and easy to follow tips of the month.There is a writing prompt for every day of the year. No writer would be lost for ideas with this book close at hand. I can see myself using it and re-using it and re-using it.Reeves comes across as a writing buddy sharing thoughts and guidance in perfectly reasonable and re-readable doses."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ART OF WRITING","review":"As a professional writer, I need this book. It reminds me that writing is about more than clawing my way up the best seller list, stroking and stoking the ego, and cashing checks that are rarely as large as I think I deserve. Writing is an art and when I put pen to paper, I am an artist. Wow. I'd forgotten that. Reeves provides prompts and inspiration that help me access the part of me that is not driven by market demands. Suddenly my metaphors are fresher; my characters stand up and sing. This book takes me beyond plot into a place where words are exciting and dangerous as they were when I was a young writer. It's the best cure I know for writer's block, writer's cramp and writer's boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"If you have read other books that emphasize writing practice, such as those by Natalie Goldberg, a lot of the material will be familiar to you (not only the philosophy but even many of the specific exercises). The anecdotes about writers were fun to read, but many of the daily writing prompts were fairly banal. There was also a lot of filler and repetition. Overall, I was disappointed with this book, especially considering its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Writing Days Will Fly!","review":"Judy Reeves has written a brilliant and inspiring book filled with writing prompts, suggestions and exercises which should be a part of every writer's desk set.This book is filled with a year's worth of writing material. Each month begins with a guideline like, \\"Keep Writing,\\" and, \\"Kiss Your Frogs,\\" then offers daily writing topics, tips and suggestions for meeting the life of a writer. Reeves writes each chapter with inspirational eagerness making those days of writers block seem like history.

It touches on issues relevant to all women including: our relationship with our mothers, our need for love and compassion, our beauty, our strength, our desire to be heard, and the how frequently we are (and have been) misunderstood throughout the ages. As Dacia Maraini states in her poem, \\"Poems By Women\\", 'And to be a woman/means to know her own state of subjection,/it means to live and breathe the humiliation/and self-contempt that can be overcome/ only by painful toil with black tears.'

The color illustrations are nice (compared to the Adobe manuals, which have gotten thin and have no color), but that's about it. The details just aren't there. For example, the author will show you the star tool, and talk about using its dialog box to set options, but doesn't mention using the Command (PC:ctrl) or Option (PC:alt) keys with this tool, nor what they do. So not only does it read a bit like a manual, but it's an incomplete manual.

He especially praises improvements in the text formatting and the inclusion of better 3-D effect capabilities. It is convenient how throughout the book he includes the keystroke shortcuts for the various actions. David has included a lot of diagrams and illustrations to help understand the use of the various tools and pallets. A lot of time is well spent writing about how to use the various Pathfinder tools.

Darren Shahlavi plays the evil ex champion who makes it his mission to kill high ranking martial arts champions one by one, and city by town. Thus enter Chuck Jeffreys, a police detective teamed up with an ex supercop played by Gary Daniels who must track down Shahlavi and bring him to justice. This is a HIGHLY underrated and overlooked movie which in production had a very limited budget, but delivers superb martial arts action, stunts, great storyline, and definately suspense to keep you in your seat within every single fightscene and obviously the final fight which is a superb climax to the film. In my opinion, Bloodmoon is one of the best martial arts films yet..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Fine","review":"Needed this for an AC unit inside a simulator room.

Then put it together and whallah!With a nice, thick mattress the bed is indeed nice and high off the ground- something to consider if it is for small children. More dangerous than an average height bed, should they fall off. I find it perfect for me, however, and the storage space underneath is equivelant to a good size closet, which I greatly appreciate in my small apartment. I have purchased the underbed drawer kit which I look forward to staining and assembling for use under this bed.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"simple solid bed platform","review":"I love this little bed.

There were no missing or broken parts, everything fit together correctly, and it was very easy to assemble. The frame itself is light, easy to maneuver, and very solid. It is unfinished wood but it is very smooth. If you like simple furniture designs, then you will find this product to be beautiful and aesthetically pleasing. Also, I have owned more expensive bed frames than this that were not NEARLY as well-made or durable.

The acting is good; I wish the actors could have ad-libbed a bit more to make it even more believable.. SO MANY parts of this movie are synonymous with my life; it hit so close to home it's unbelievable. A good message of friendship, love and life.This film portrays the Gothic scene more accurately than ANY movie out there, in my opinion. It's true to the Scene for the most part, and shows that even Goths are fun-loving, compassionate (and sometimes bitter) people.. It shows a full spectrum.The film got a bit confusing during the rest stop scene.. None of the viewers knew where everyone was at until watching it a second time; it seems as though a scene was skipped, almost. The HOT gay sex scene most definitely made up for the confusion, though.This is a beautiful and inspiring movie (and I love Stevie Nicks!), and I would recommend it to anyone! Blessed Be.~Raven~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I personally loved this movie dearly and am going to watch it again tonight with a group of friends.

Now I disagree with her. Something about this movie made me feel happy. I love Sara Rue and Kett Turton both madly. I loved watching this, and ended up teary eyed at the end.

The acting was very \\"real\\", especially the scenes showing the relationship between Gypsy and Clive. I really got the feeling that they were soulmates, in the platonic sense of course. So many movies today have a stilted feel to the acting, but Gypsy 83 feels real, I could actually imagine this whole movie happening to someone in the real world like me. I especially like the scene in the NY club with the catty gay goth guys. Just goes to show that even the \\"non-conformists\\" are not immune to being clique-ish and exclusive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie!","review":"This is an amazing movie if your into the dark scene, or a little bi-curious.

What a HUGE disappointment! Thing is, it could have been a great film. The premise held a lot of potential and the main actors were a cut above the usual indie fare. Anyway, it wasn't a total loss because of Karen Black's cameo. Who knew she could sing?! I was blown away. Wish she recorded an album or two. She should seriously consider torch as a career."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like Goth 2001","review":"This movie has absolutely nothing to do with Stevie Nicks. And as far as I can remember, Stevie never hung around with a Robert Smith-loving monkey who acts like Chris Kattan's gothic character \\"Azrael Abyss\\" from Saturday Night Live. I'm assuming Gypsy 83 just couldn't get the rights to any Stevie Nicks or Fleetwood Mac music, because this film might have been a tad better if they ever sang or listened to any of her music except for the forgetful tune, \\"Talk to Me.\\" Poor Gypsy Vale of Sandusky, Ohio looks more like a goth queen than La Nicks but I will give her (or her buddy Clive aka Azrael) props for recreating the white-dress-and-boots look from the \\"Bella Donna\\" album cover. Oh, and did I mention this film is terrible?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Garbage","review":"I saw this movie and was utterly disappointed. Rent something else and don't waste your time. Also, be forewarned, there is a soft core porn section of the movie where you see Sara Rue and a guy having sex in a bathroom and the male star and his new male friend having sex in another bathroom. I had to fast forward. Definitely could have gone through my life without seeing THAT!I also expected Stevie Nicks music given the main character's obsession with the artist and the fact that they were on their way to a Night of 1000 Stevies. That was actually the deciding factor on \\"to rent or not to rent.\\" Perhaps Stevie felt not the need to lend her music to this piece of garbage. The movie, simply put, was not nearly described accurately enough. Had it been, it would have stayed on Blockbuster's shelf and out of my DVD player!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If this sounds interesting to you you'll probably like it","review":"I give this four stars mostly because three starts tends to look like I didn't like it. I did, but it's a small film in focus and, like so many independent films, it doesn't wrap everything up into a neat package for public consumption.It's probably either going to be your thing or not. I'm not sure it'll convince people not interested in issues of youthful identity - sexual and otherwise. In some ways it's a road movie with all the familiar sort of encounters along the way, but it can be surprising in how things turn out, in how it's not overly sentimental or neat by the conclusion. I do think both the main actors are very good. Sara Rue is a full-bodied beauty - very unusual in film, but important. And Kett Turton could certainly be a star of indie films in the future.I encourage you to watch this if the descriptions sounds of interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie will become a cult classic to Stevie fans!","review":"When I first watched this film a few years - hence it came out in 2000 - I really didn't get it. It's deep, it's heart wrenching, it's not so much Stevie Nicks rocking out in her tambo like you'd want to see. A cameo from Stevie would have made this film an absolute winner. I love the storyline. I love the actors in this film. They really do hit on the lead character Gypsy's loss of her mother. And I could identify with her as I lost my mother at an early age. So the combination of mother loss, Stevie Nicks worship heroism and the angst and yearning to go after your dream. Yeah, it's all there. And it's pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gypsy 83- A must see!","review":"An alternative, dark, coming of age movie that revolves around Stevie Nicks, The Cure and the gothic scene of the 1980's.

The chapter on Hypnosis is very impressive, introducing some advanced concepts without overwhelming the novice reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly for the Licensed Professional","review":"This book is a course text book intended to worked through in the classroom environment. Without human input and dynamic conversation, this book is written way over the head of anyone just interested in learning about NLP. In fact, most NLP books are purposely written to confuse and complicated to the degree that a certified practitioner is required. NLP is not a strategy or technology to be used for personal growth or development. It is more a service to be purchased from the select individuals certified in using NLP. Tony Robbins was banished from the NLP groups because he used NLP to become rich. Well, every NLP practitioner is in the business to make money just like doctors who keep the patient coming back for years of theropy. NLP can work in hours, but the cure is worse than the original problem in time, money, confusion and complication. Please avoid this book unless you are a doctor.

And, if this book is about the different styles of communication, it was poorly written for Visual Types who make up 60% of people. The pictures and diagrams are few and not very good, in my opinion.

Used it a a party and when the 5th CD was done, I had to open each of the 5 CD's indiviudally at about 10-12 seconds each. It's maddening.And I was organized putting the CD cases in order to match the CD slot it was in, so I could replace CD's like the guys who change tires at a NASCAR race.My wife warned me, but I didn't listen. She wanted a player that randomly (and seemlessly)jumped from CD to CD and track to track all on its own (if there is such a thing).Anyway, have you ever been at a rocking party or bar and then the music went off for 1 full minute or two.

Upon following the complicated directions on setting the system up, the stupid system would only work when playing a dvd. There was no sound from any of the speakers when trying to watch TV, listen to music or the tuner. Calling Sony support was no help. The first customer service rep proceeded to yell and scream on the phone. He also made me hook up the system to the cable box which caused the system not to work when playing a dvd and told me i would have to switch the audio cables(which are not included) back and forth depending on what i wanted to do (watch tv, listen to music etc.) The second guy didn't even know how to hook it up at all.

We called Sony directly and after some trouble shooting, they told us it was defective and needed to be sent in for service. Since it was new, I returned it to Amazon and they sent us the third as replacement. Before we ran the wires I connected the system and it did the same thing. Again, Sony said we had a defective unit. Amazon was great at handling the whole thing. We returned the unit, got a refund and are waiting to buy another system."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good lock but not very secure.","review":"The lock is exactly as the product description states. Therefore, I am giving it 5 stars because the product is exactly what it claims to be (the create your own combination is especially nice).However, after getting this lock, I feel most people would be much better off with something different. I use the lock for securing my bike. I wanted something that was small and light, but didn't realize just how small this product really is. The cable is pretty short, just barely long enough to secure the frame and both wheels, so usually I have to leave one wheel unsecured if locking the bike to something. Also, the cable is very thin and just looks like it could easily be cut with a good wire cutter. Fortunately, I live in a small suburb where most people don't even bother locking up their bikes, so this is a nice small/light solution. However, when I commute to work I still bring the 12mm cable and U-Lock because I don't trust this little thing in a city like Milwaukee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rate negative stars if available","review":"You reset the combo by twisting the end.

I'll have to cut the lock off my bike.Buy a different lock."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"This is one of the cheapest bicycle locks on the market. It is very small and lightweight (about 6 ounces). However, the amount of protection it provides is very low. The cable can be snipped pretty easily with bolt cutters. The combo lock can be defeated pretty easily by feel. If you're going to run into a restroom or convenience store for just a minute of if you're watching your bike from a nearby cafe table, this lock may be enough to slow a thief down. I would not trust this lock if I'm going to be away from my bike for an extended period of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sent me the wrong color","review":"I bought this lock to match my Black and Yellow bike as it the picture in the advertisement was showing same colors.

I live in a low crime area and wanted a lightweight lock for quick stops, but this is just false security."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resets Easily","review":"This lock inadvertently resets the combo due to it's design, the reset tab is basically right by the number tabs so user error will be often. The first time this happened, my wife figured out that the combo went one number off, today was a disaster since I could not figure out where the numbers were re-set to. Basically, I have to cut off the lock now because who the hell knows what the combo is now for this inferior product, at the same time, the lock looks so weak that it might just get cut off by a thief overnight while it's stuck at my work (sigh)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy for Anyone to Open -- No Combination Required!!!","review":"After buying two of these, while looking to buy a couple more, I read a review on another site that said the purchaser's son could open these locks behind his back. Sure enough, pull on the cable while spinning the dials, and it is easily opened because as each wheel comes to the correct number, there is a noticeable click. I did it my first try, with eyes closed. This is basically nothing more than a decoy lock. I don't know what's worse--the manufacturer for making these locks, or retailers for selling them, when the locks absolutely do not provide the basic functionality for which they are sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak lock, bike stolen the first night we used it","review":"If you don't live in a high-crime area and all you need is a light lock to dissuade a kid from joy-riding, fine.

I didn't need all the extra features and walked away spening about $80 which included the unit, activiation and first month fee. This unit fits perfectly and is easily readable. Sometimes when you drive into bigger cities, you have to find a different FM frequency to get on. Also, the signal will fade if you are in a garage or you drive under a series of overpasses(like freeway changes), but it's very quick. Other than those two minor things, it's a near perfect unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not XACTly great.","review":"I purchased this receiver to use exclusively in my car so I would not have to keep rotating my Sportster unit from the home docking station to my car several times a day.

I finally stuffed it into an open spot in the console - pulling it back out to change the channel is a pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super easy to install if you have a cassette deck. Great sound quality!","review":"After calling Sirius-XM to activate this Xact receiver, I put the antenna inside my car -- I just set the end of the antenna behind the back seat, under the rear windshield. Then I bought a Phillips cassette adaptor for $9 at Walmart, put that in my car's cassette player and then plugged it into this Xact receiver. Now my car stereo plays satellite radio that is so clear it sounds like a recording! There's no static at all. Very simple and I definitely recommend this option as a cheap way to get satellite radio in your car if you have a cassette player on your car's stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xact","review":"Cheap, easy to Install, Easy to operate.

You will recognize a lot of these films which have been shown in various news stories or Elvis documentaries for just a few seconds, but they are almost never used in their entirety. Really cool old teen music shows and interview shows he appeared on in the late 1950's, comedic sketches from appearances on comedy shows, appearances on other performers' television specials, etc. Features several 1970's press conferences that are almost never seen on television - or anyplace else. Also features a lot of other performers and television personalities who were at the height of their careers at the time Elvis appeared with them.

It's about 14 months old. The light seems to have gone out. So I've tried calling Microtek several times and all that happens is you cannot talk with someone. It just goes back to a pre-recorded message. When you choose technical support is says to go to their website. When you choose customer support it just replays the same message again and again and again. After finally getting a hold of a live person, he can barely speak english and says that the customer support people are in a meeting and they will call me back. But before I hung up he prepped me that if the scanner is over a year old that it is out of warranty. So I can already assume that this is going to be a nightmare to get this scanner fixed.

Unfortunately, it hasn't been used for the last couple months because there is still no driver for Windows Vista. They have been bumping back the expected release date for a driver for at least three months.

It worked like a champ for about a year. The color scans were faithful and vivid and the black and white were great. Then, I guess it's the lamp, the color scans began looking horrible. No fidelity to the source material. Watercolor, in particular, looked wretched. It still works, but only in grayscale and is slow as molasses. It's also noisy.

The machine has never failed me. It's been a great investment. The quality isn't perfect, but with Photoshop and a bit of skill you can make useable scans easily. (Use a SilverFast driver and you'll get much better results.) You can't expect it to look like a drum scan at this price point, after all. I agree with everyone that the cost of these oversized scanners is completely ridiculous and out of line, but until someone comes along with a viable alternative this unit is about the best you're going to find. If mine breaks down I'll definitely buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money!","review":"I had the exact same problem as many others. Used the thing for 1 year and the bulb died, this was after Very light use. Maybe a dozen or so scans.. very very dissapointing.We had to have a working scanner though (I work in a university Music Library and faculty need it) so we actually sent the thing in for repair. It cost $300 + shipping to CA and back, and when it came back, it died again in 6 mos.I'm buying an Epson this time.

I bought a Microtek scanner a few years ago and lost the original driver disk. When I went to their web site to download the driver (my PC crashed and need an OS reinstall), the scanner is not supported anymore. They don't even post an archived version of the device.

You WILL regret it later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scanning lamp went out","review":"I thought the scanner was great, but the lamp went out just after 1 year after I bought it. So now all my scans have a rainbow line from top to bottom. Microtek's extent of technical support is reinstall the drivers, if that doesn't work you have to return it so we can repair it, because there are no authorized repair people out there, but us. They will not sell me the lamp, because they need to repair it themselves (they want the labor dollars). So, after I paid $1,400 for this thing a year ago I am going to have to pay another $200-300 for repair and shipping both ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely no support","review":"Scanner stopped working one week after warranty expired, which means this scanner only lasted one year.

Please take the time to consider another brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice - when it worked","review":"I've purchased two of these over the past year, and both of them had the lamp fail within the first 3 or 4 months of very light use.

I found a web site by John Lucas that showed him using the mini-planer pals to change the blades on a very similar planer to mine. The Delta instruction manual was a little skimpy on detail, but those pictures gave me the confidence I needed. Between the pix and the planer pal, I had my blades changed in about 20 minutes, start-to-finish. I was able to get the blades perfectly aligned the first time. Without the planer pal, that planer might still be in pieces. If they charged twice as much, it would still be worth every penny. If you have a planer, you really need this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use","review":"I purchased this product because I was not pleased using the device provided with my Delta planer.

Highly Recommended!","review":"If you, like me, never get tired of Austen's greatest love story, no matter how many film adaptations you've seen or book adaptations you've read, add this novel to your collection. This is a very witty, romantic, and well-written book that you'll want to savor, but you'll find you simply can't put it down. Henry Noble is a perfect modern Darcy and Jazzy, although perhaps a bit more abrasive here and there than Elizabeth Bennett, makes a charming and believable heroine. All the supporting characters are fleshed out and compelling as well. I loved this book and plan on reading it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This book was terrible. Melissa Nathan has not captured the heart or style of Elizabeth Bennet in Jasmin even remotely. Jasmin just came across as bitter and mean, not lively and witty.

Just skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ingenious and Fun","review":"It's hard to imagine a finer modernization of JA's P&P than this, with the exception of some under-developed plot lines, and a few poor choices of crude or vulgar language. The weaker plot lines are minor, such as the parallel to Lydia's being ruined, which I won't go into so I don't spoil the book for anyone. However, if you're familiar with Austen's novel, you will recognize what's coming in this one, but it's still a lot of fun. (You don't get the same degree or sense of social scandal to the family, as with Lydia and the Bennets, but perhaps that's why this book is more light-hearted and easy reading.) The bad language (occasional) also \\"jarred\\" with the atmosphere of what the author was trying to do, I think., and made it somewhat less enjoyable, but there isn't a great deal of it, thankfully. I opened it just to get a sense of the tone, and I ended up having to finish it. Dinner was late for the family! I'll probably want to read this one again sometime, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and forgettable","review":"I adore the real Pride and Prejudice, and it's primary imitation, Bridget Jones. This book was good in its own right. However, when the author attempts to copy things straight out of Jane Austen, it gets annoying. There are whole sentences copied from P+P!! Also, there are some bad tries at making the plot too similar to P+P...like when \\"darcy\\" intervenes on behalf of his best friend, who happens to play Bingley, and convinces him not to go out with \\"Eliza's\\" sister, \\"Jane\\" anymore. Hello! Make your own story up!! If you can't originate, don't imitate. At least the writing in its own right didn't stink. Despite all this, it was okay for a quick relaxing read in the bathtub."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never thought it could be this bad","review":"I'm sitting here trying to think of something good about this book, and I'm still at a loss. From exposition to end, the characterization is consitpated and the plot lines flabby.

Instead, it's a modern tale of a group of actors--amateur and professional--putting on a charity performance of \\"Pride and Prejeudice\\". It's a pleasure to read--especially when discovering which character matches which Austen character, and anticipating what will happen (some of the Austen characters have someone in the cast AND someone off stage who REALLY represents the Austen characters!) But even if you haven't read any Jane Austen, this is an entertaining, funny,read--and just might make you give the original a chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jasmin Field is Excellent","review":"I have to admit, I only read PP and Jasmin Field because it was an update of P&P, my favorite book. It does follow the P&P plot ot a point where you wonder why the characters aren't picking up on it. *But* I think that's because they are so caught up in their problems/feelings that they aren't seeing the big picture.I think this book is wonderful! It was a delight to read, and the characters are well-written. (I love the idea of Lizzy as a sarcastic columnist) Melissa Nathan does an excellent job of holding to the P&P story line. (I liked it much better than Bridget Jones as a P&P update - BJD is great in it's own right)Harry Noble - the Mr. Darcy of PP and JF - is adorable just like Darcy in P&P. I kept picturing Colin Firth as Harry (because everyone knows Colin Firth *is* Mr. Darcy)I really enjoyed this book.

How about Boring and Unoriginal?","review":"I am also a huge Jane Austen fan, and have read P&P quite a few times. After reading this re-do, all I can say is why bother? There was not an original move in the book not lifted directly from the original, other than the extraordinary bitchiness of the title character. If I wanted the EXACT same story, with the EXACT same characters and devices, I could have just re-read Pride and Prejudice. I'm all for updates, but mirror images? Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"The knock-off Pride and Prejudice retelling was done well enough in Bridget Jones's Diary. Let's leave well enough alone, shall we? I don't know why Melissa Nathan decided that Jane Austen needed her help because this story's been done.It's utterly predictable and not that compelling. If you're looking for a silly book on a rainy day, this is an easy read. But it offers nothing new to either Austen's work or the first modern retelling a la Helen Fielding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy update...but it's still mindless fun","review":"I found PRIDE, PREJUDICE AND JASMIN FIELD disappointing because it showed a lack of imagination and initiative. I wanted the characters in this book to develop on their own rather than remain shadows of Jane Austen's wonderful characters. It felt like the author gave up and resorted to cramming her modern day characters into the P&P plot outline rather than taking the time to let them follow their own natural progression. I would have preferred a book that followed the P&P spirit and spunk more closely rather than the plot.OK, now to say something nice. This book is not a bad read for lazy afternoons when all you want or can really handle is a story full of empty calories. It's mindless fun which we all need every now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Close For Comfort","review":"I started this book eagerly, because Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a favorite book. However, I felt the author made the parallels to P&P too close to be believable. After all, the characters were supposed to be rehearsing a P&P play throughout the book. I kept waiting for one of them to say. \\"Wait a minute. What's going on here? We're all pairing up in couples just like the book.\\" A better take-off on Pride and Prejudice is Kate Fenton's Lions and Liquorice, published about five years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disconcertingly bad.","review":"Character development? Zilch.Really, the only dimension any of these characters has is given by their correspondence to the characters in the original books. Nathan leaves so many plot points and character interactions at loose ends, it becomes terribly important to reference Austen's work just to figure out why each character archetype behaves as they do.Believable character interactions and reactions? Maybe.....no, zilch.If nothing else, does she honestly think there are men....or even people....who behave this way?

Egad, if you've never read the original, do yourself a favour and begin it immediately! Don't waste your time with this inane drivel. I know this is Ms Nathan's first book, but I wonder how she got a book deal with this idea. What was the pitch? \\"I'll write a book and base it on a classic. No wait, I'll just copy (in some places word for word) the classic in plot and characters, thereby saving myself from having to come up with anything original.\\" Poke my eye, this was horrid stuff.Now, I myself like a good romance to read while soaking in the tub, but a good romance doesn't have to mean predictable to the point of boredom (I mean really, if you know who every character is immediately and exactly who they are going to end up with, and exactly how they will get there, and exactly what they'll say while they're on their way...).Ack, Ack, Ack, big ol' hairball."},{"rating":"1","title":"inexpensive for a reason","review":"The sizes on the shank are often very faint or missing so you'll need a mic to tell them apart.

It was then that I noticed that some of the drill sizes were duplicated. For example, the 3/8 size and the next size down from that each had a 3/8 drill - instead of there being two different sizes.

Page 158, he says a drought threw regional sustenance into chaos and Chaco could not cope.Which is it?An error like that could almost get a a book three-starred.That said, there's enough good stuff here to keep four stars. But not five.For a good five-star book focused just on Chaco and its definite area of control and influence, read David Stuart's \\"Anasazi America.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Simpsons, but not as good as the TV show.","review":"This book is good, but it is not nearly as good as the full experience of the Simpsons that you get from the TV show. I read it once and kinda threw it in the corner and forgot about it. This is despite the fact that I am a Simpsons fanatic. I found I missed the voices from the show immensely. You lose an awful lot of the hidden jokes from the show and the humor just isn't there. Bottom line: If you absolutely can not pass this book up, buy it.

Dragged in by the pure energy of the VNV Nation remix of Destillat, I began to listen to Das Ich more and more. Having heard what other artists have done to enhance or bring in their own flavor to Das Ich's work I have gained a real love for the original versions of these songs.Das Ich is not for everyone, but if you like high energy, stomp inspiring music (like Funker Vogt or :Wumpscut:), this is a great choice. A great addition to any Industrial/EBM collection. I find their music some of the best music to dance to, actually I find it impossible to not dance to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be careful!!","review":"This is a treasure trove of remixes of Das Ich songs done by some of the most famous powerhouses in Electro music. The cd is breathtaking, and for those already fans of Das Ich, it is a whole new experience. But beware-Amazon states that this is the much desired 2-disc version. It is the single disc version. Turbomax6 was quick to respond to my inquiry, and they set me straight. Amazon made no attempt to fix the error or to compensate me for ordering a cd I already owned. In the long run, I accepted the cd from the seller, liking the imported versions to German bands anyway. Still, with my joy of getting the cd, Amazon sent me several formed emails, and ultimately did nothing. Sad. The music in this cd is top notch, and is a must-hear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prompt Response, Exactly as Described, & Pet LOVES It!!!!

It rarely rises to the level of \\"fun\\".The movement and cover system is similar to Gears of War, but I'd say it doesn't work as well in Dark Sector as it does in GoW.There isn't much of a story.Your main weapon is a \\"glaive\\", which is thrown and sometimes guided. Many tasks are impossible without learning to control the glaive. I used the glaive almost exclusively and never came to appreciate it, especially when you have to guide it. Towards the end, I can't even explain how tired and bored I was of using the thing.The boss fights have a similar feel to GoW in that some are almost trivial once you look up what to do. The final boss fight is as worthless and annoying as any I can think of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful....","review":"This game is gorgeous. The colors and lighting are absolutely incredible. I especially liked the lack of colors in the prologue. I felt it really showed off the game. However, as another reviewer commented, some in-game movies do look a little bit better than others. Also, I have noticed the occasional drop in frame rate.The gameplay is very fun. My only complaint is that the controls are a bit awkward when you are steering the glaive. It just feels un-natural to hold down the RB and steer with the right analog stick. I also dislike the fact that you are unable to crouch unless taking cover. Other than that, the game is a blast to play. I played about the first three levels last night, and had to tear myself away from the game to get some sleep.This game doesn't bring anything real innovative to the table. But if you are fans of GoW, then I would strongly recommend this game. It has a similar look and feel to it, and it is just as fun. And the glaive is an awesome new weapon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Gameplay, Storyline Could Have Been Better","review":"A lot of instant action, strategic moves, dark atmosphere,intense battles, good missions, and great graphics. A Fantastic game! This game had it all for me as far as the gameplay is concerned. I love the lighting and the controls were great. The mutants would rush out of the darkness in packs to make it challenging. There were excellent melee cinematics. You also had an option to skip cut scenes. Honestly, action wise, this was as good as any horror/action combo game I have played. I got it for 2 bucks. The story line barely existed. I would have given it a perfect five if the story was better.

The actual upgrades in the game are unimpressive, you would expect something cool to happen like, longer range, splitting into more. But nothing, it's repeditive and is old after 1-2 hours. The only real pluses to this game is it's a okay shooter with some de-limbing. But really there's better games for your money.

I have not played it since, so much for Gamespots reviews.If you liked Resident Evil 4 then Dark Sector is right up your alley. Great graphics and fun gameplay make for an enjoyable experience. The story line is week and some levels were alot out of balance but it doesn't take away from the fun, usually after several tries you can get it. About 16-20 hours of gameplay too.I liked it and if you're an action fan you will too. $60 well spent.- Dan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Sector is Too DARK to see","review":"This games graphics are too dark.

Gradually, through her relationship with the owner of the local diner/grill, Percy begins to make inroads into the life there, just by being herself.Eventually, through her grace filled manner to others who often do not treat her in kind, Percy's life leads to the redemption of the entire town.Peopled with believable characters and fine actors (Ellen Burstyn and Marsha Gay Harden)the film does not have a classic happy ending, but it is a most satisfying one that moved me to tears.

This movie is what I would define what an excellent film should be.

A young girl, just released from prison, decides to settle down in the quiet New England village of Gillead. The residents initially are downright unfriendly to her, and their transformation is predictable, but achieved in an unpredictable and pleasing way. The Spitfire Grill is like that: certain outcomes are required in this kind of movie, but the way the story gets to them is surprising and satisfying.A great cast of characters (and actors) surround Alison Elliott as the young ex-con Percy. But Elliott is the key: she is very, very good in this movie, and her character is one you'll remember for quite a while.I don't in general care for tear-jerker movies like the Spitfire Grill, but the tragedies and joys presented here are believable and not overdone. I enjoyed the immersion in Gillead and its people, and was both saddened and uplifted (without being manipulated) by this fine movie. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"spitfire grill","review":"I agree with all the reviews of other people who gave their revviews of this film. It is truely a great film.

This congenital growth out of prog was unusually dark, with angular movements and usually dissonant without melody or form. This style, probably more jazz-like than progressive, was interesting at times, but on this release, it is not. Harsh feedback, abrasive, incoherent ranting, uninteresting time changes, this is for the stout,so-called, \\"intellectual\\", Rock-In-Opposition (RIO) crowd, and Soft Machine fans, I guess.

Although the story ends on a rather abrupt note--to the point that I wondered if perhaps the last page had inadvertently been torn out of our copy--the story itself is so dear that children will hardly notice.Tim Bowers does a super job of upping the adorability factor in this sweet book.

We are separated by over 800 miles so to get near real time baby updates can't be beatThe one any major draw back to the camera is the slow picture speed. When you are trying to take a picture of a wiggling baby it can be frustrating to miss that cute pose you were shooting for. This can be VERY frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"First digital camera","review":"This is my first digital camera, I love it! It is very simple to use and takes better than average pictures. The price is reasonable and you really don't need to buy any anything else to take pictures or use it with your computer. It comes with easy to install software,battries, internal memory and attachment cord to download to your computer. I could not believe how easy the software was to use, to touch up pictures, email, create albums and other interesting things. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone that is new to the digital camera world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures, but slow shutter and poor batteries","review":"This is a really tough little camera and is great for vacation pictures. I just throw it in my bag and go--I've even dropped it a few times with no loss of function. I have blown up many of my photos to 8x10 and they still look great--even with some of the images cropped.However, there are some down sides. It sucks up batteries like they're going out of style. I had no luck with the lithium batteries that came with it and now use (ick) lots of disposables. Also, the shutter speed is slow. This problem can be lessened somewhat by holding down the button halfway while framing the shot, then pushing down all the way to take a picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"cons:Takes forerver to take the photo after you press the shutter.power guzzler.

I was lucky enough to find someone with the software that should have been in the package, and I solved the problem myself. The camera was NOT of good quality and condition, as stated in the add.\\"Let the buyer beware\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sure there are better cameras out in this $$ range","review":"I use this camera for work taking picture of damaged vehicles. For outside use in good light it works fine. However if you are in a parking garage taking a picture (poor lighting) you are out of luck unless you are ultra-close to your intended target. The flash is weak, I have not been able to take a good picture inside without good lighting. Also I can't stand the horrible delay in start up and shutter lag, this thing takes for ever to take a picture. I do have the docking station which is great for transfering pictures to your computer; however, it is unreliable for charging. You have to go through a ritual of turning the camera on and off (or opening the battery door) to get the docking station to make the proper connection and actually charge? My prior DC50 (early model digital) worked much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this camera","review":"I received this camera as a gift and it is probably the worst digital camera I have ever used. Spend the money and get a decent camera instead of wasting it with this one. Photo quality is VERY bad--I many webcams take better quality pictures than this. Charging batteries is a complete nightmare. The first time I took my batteries out, the top to the battery compartment wouldn't close correctly and it still doesn't to this day--it often pops open while I'm trying to take pictures. The wall charger I received doesn't work, and the dock will only occasionally charge the batteries for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use camera","review":"I bought this camera with the easy share dock. It is so easy to use and good quality pictures. With the software any poor pictures can be corrected. I had a Sony digital camera which was much harder to use. This camera with the dock is made for the novice user. I have windows ME and I ran the CD software and was downloading pictures within 5 minutes with one button to push. Love it and will use the heck out of it. Would advise anyone to get this and the dock. For the money, the camera takes good pictures and with extra memory can hold lots of pictures. I have 64 memory which holds 72 pictures plus the internal memory can hold 23 I believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Digital Camera","review":"If your criteria is: Ease of use, good quality pictures and optical zoom for less ... then this is the camera for you. We bought it for a family vacation and used it everyday. Surpised the original batteries are still going strong even after 75+ pics (added 32MB card), many LCD reviews, and several uploads. (I bought the Kodak charger and 4 battery pack and still haven't used it) We are waiting for the end results from Ofoto so I hope I haven't jinxed myself, but all the pictures look great on screen. Speaking of uploads, the software is very easy to install (WIN2000) and use. No need to spend the money on the docking cradle because you still do it with a push of the button within the software. Best feature: video out for slide shows on TV. Feature not avail: movie mode, but that's what video cameras are for.

My husband took it apart and we find it has a delicate setup on the lens cover. PLASTIC!! The lens cover had broken inside.Replacement parts are not longer available.I think this camera should have lasted more than 3 years.

I think for this to be effective, it needs to include some sort of attatchment for maintaining an angle against the cutting blade. It is supposed to work by just putting the edge of the plastic against the cutter knife, and sliding back and forth a few times at the appropriate angle. Well, unless you've got robotically perfect arms, you're not going to be able to keep the angle correct. If you could maintain that angle, you might be able to touch up a micro bevel, but nothing substantial at all. They were relatively effective when removing the burr created though. That aspect was pretty foolproof. They cost me less than a professional sharpening, so I figure I'm not out too much, but I certainly wouldn't recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken stones","review":"stones broke on 1st. use. cracked in several places.

Suffice to say it can't be forced into a genre mold as it stands alone - its own unique tour de force. I enjoyed the author's voice tremendously going from adorable to snappy and witty. The pace was measured out perfectly, the plot engaging and the characters fleshed out so much so I truly feel I know a few of them (especially Anjoli!) in true life.If you're looking for a deep, heavy, melodramatic read, this ain't it.

I had an expectation that the rest of the album would be similar, but it was not similar enough for my liking. The more rock-driven tracks, such as Johnny, sound a bit dated, like slightly strident late-90's folk rock that has not aged with particular grace. The quieter tracks, like Moon, Aslan, Twenty Three and Pray, sounded more appealing to my ear. As I continue to listen to this album, perhaps the insightful lyrics that other reviewers have mentioned will become more apparent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product Is Terrible","review":"The color is beautiful - unfortunately it doesn't stay on the steering wheel.

This game was complex and deep yet so easy and so fun to play. This game is best enjoyed if you have the original DC arcade stick. May not be as flashy as capcom but the gameplay and strategy elements most definately make up for it. I only hope that SNK revives or keeps the KOF series alive on the current and future generation consoles"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've been better","review":"Five yrs ago, the toughest SNK superstars faced off in tag-team action in the excellent arcade game KOF 94. Now the series is back, but it hasn't learned anything new. The KOF:DM99(man that's a long title!)chugs away with tired fighting mechanics and subpar graphics. King features characters from Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting. The fights are fun, but you still can't change characters during a match. Technically King's loaded with deficencies, most notably choppy, slowdown-filled 2D sprite graphics. For a part of an essentially 16 bit game to a 128 bit system, these flaws are inexcuseable and baffling. It's nice that the DC isn't limiting itself to polygon-only 3D fighting titles. But compared to Marvel vs. Capcom, Dream is a nightmare."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC SERIES COMES TO SEGA","review":"SNK has brought this port of KofF'98 to the dreamcast in perfect form!

This may sound strange, but I really recommend to only skim over any chapter that involves Orlando and Fredricks on the river with the Chief (trying to keep it vague to prevent spoilers). It's 4 or 5 chapters worth of absolutely boring content. I can't really even remember what it was about. All of it but the last chapter of the story line you should skip because it's a lot like Huckleberry Finn, but they never leave the boat and nothing interesting happens.I almost lost hope and almost never went onto number three. I'd give the other books 5/5. This one really gets a three and a half, but there's no option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...ouch my head hurts","review":"I started reading the Otherland series because of all the rave reviews here on Amazon. Plus Williams previous series \\"Memory Sorrow....\\" was superb. If the 1st book was \\"mildly\\" boring, then this is a huge bore. The book picks up whenever !Xabbu & Rene are involved or Fredricks & Orlando. Reading Martines \\"diary\\" gives me huge headache. Oh I'm sure I'll read books 3 & 4 some day.

Unfortunately I found this series to be WAY too slow. Not to say it doesn't have any redeeming qualities at all .... I read the first book and found it mildly interesting so I went ahead and bought the second one. Like the pathetic series lover that I am, I even bought the third, which I'm reading now. Sort of. I tend to fall asleep after just 8 or 9 pages of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING happening. I really can't tolerate the \\"Steven King\\" style of over-desciptiveness. If you don't have any light forms of ADHD then perhaps you will enjoy this book immensely, but if you're like me, save some money and just let this series go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now It Get's Interesting","review":"The first book was enough to hook me, but this book is where it really starts to get interesting since everyone is officially trapped inside Otherland and struggling to come to grips with that. This book had me riveted the entire way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"How come....?","review":"...modern sci-fi and fantasy writers think that they need to give us massive works that go on longer than War and Peace and Les Miserables put together? How about PLOT DEVELOPMENT! Unfortunately, Williams feels the need to wow us with how clever he is at creating alternate worlds, but suffers from the same problem Robert Jordan does...the plot grinds to a halt for hundreds of pages, until the poor reader needs to scream...\\"Get on with it, already!\\". Frankly, after wading thru better than 1200 pages of the first two volumes, I hope I never encounter these characters again. So, if you are at all cruious about this series, wait for Book IV to be released in paperback, read the opening synopsis of the first three, and go on from there.

After finishing it, I think I would have been better off stopping after the first. None of the major questions or conflicts were answered or resolved. Early on I had the impression I'd just be passing time until I started the third book to find some answers and that's how the book ended. I'm not sure I'm even going to bother with the next book because I've found out there's a fourth book to be written. This definitely looks like another V.C.

This is already a true classic-level read...highly recommended and well worth the hard-cover price."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Virtual Reality series","review":"Otherland is the Virtual Reality series which every sci-fi or fantasy writer dreams of writing, but can't because the concept is too huge, too complex. Well, Tad Williams has done it and done it very well (so far). The second book in the series which Williams more correctly describes as 'one long book released in four volumes' is just as good as the first. We're treated with a buffet of VR's both based on reality and based on fantasy. William's imagination really kicked into high gear with this one, and we begin to learn what Otherland was meant to be while at the same time wondering what it is becoming. I started this series in paperback, but now I can't wait, it's Hardcover for me the rest of the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slower than the first, but you must trudge onward","review":"Reading this book is a similar tale to those of the characters mucking their way through Otherland. At times the quest becomes tedious, but there is enough action to keep you flipping the pages and I always give Tad Williams the benefit of the doubt.I have to say that this book is as difficult as the first and dont think you are going to get through this in one night. I have to keep a timeline to keep up with the characters and where they are located.I am writing this review after having read the third book \\"Mountain of Black Glass\\" and I have to tell you to keep pushing forward because it gets much much better the farther on you go.RECOMMENDATIONS: KEEP GOING AND FINISH THE SERIES"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trudge","review":"Thats a good word to describe this book, in comparison to the first one. The first one was great, a quick, fastpaced story with surprises and mystery throughout. This one, the characters are travelling on pointless 'adventures' through world after boring world. Zzzz. So, I had to trudge through this one.Barely anything important happens in this book, plotwise. If you don't have alot of time to waste reading detailed histories of Tad's one-stop fantasy-worlds, then just skip to the third book. Seriously, read the little blurb on what happens, and you will be no worse off.I found myself skimming through the pages to find something interesting. Not a good sign.

(about a month)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a portable auto compressor","review":"I purchased this as a replacement hose for my litte dc-powered 12v compressor that I use for airing up after beach trips. The hose coils are smaller in diameter than I envisioned (not a bad thing), only about 3\\" diameter coils. The hose, coiled up as pictured, is a little under two feet long. The connector on the pigtail has a built-in swivel, which is a nice touch.I wouldn't use this for shop duty or in a situation where it is always pressurized, but it would be perfect for light use--compact, hard to tangle, etc. Note that the realistic usable length is probably 12-15' before it starts getting really taught, but it will easily reach the rear tires on both sides when the compressor is sitting on the ground near the front of the car. If I were using it for, say, running a trim nailer, I'd get a longer version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the Scale Funny","review":"While I was reading it (I had seen the movie prior), I thought that the movie followed the book about one third or even one half of the way but then the book just took off in a ninety degree turn and it was one incredible adventure after another - and I mean incredible literally. It has to have been one of the funniest things I have ever read. At the time, I thought it was as if the author thought mid-way through the book 'Heck, I'm the author - I can do whatever I want' ... and did. The unbridled imagination is thoroughbred. Best thing to do is get the movie and the book and compare them. The movie is first rate but the book is exquisitely funny - much more than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Forrest We Know!","review":"I am one of those people who cry everytime Jenny dies in the movie.. but the book on the other hand is nothing of the sort!

But this isn't the Forrest we have all come to love and know... this is a completely different Forrest.. a funny, awesome Forrest.

But it wasnt until about a year ago, I decided to pick up the book. I had heard that it was very different, but as good as the movie.In the book, Forrest is a bit of a different character that he is in the movie.

Not sure how the filmmakers could get the idea for Forrest Gump the movie from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare to be disappointed","review":"I should have known better than to have expected it to be like the movie.

I was barely able to finish reading the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid is as Stupid Does","review":"A few months back I watched the movie again and was well underwhelmed by my memory of how magical it was. The book didn't do much to bolster my opinion. The plot is similar even if it differs in many places. Forrest is very much the idiot sevant, but his adventures are mostly different. The book is funny in many places, and several times I laughed out loud. However, it fell short in trying to make me care about the characters or in its attempt at satire.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the movie","review":"Usually the books are better than the movie, but this is not the case with this book. Forrest was a sweet ignorant boy in the movie, but in the book he is like a trashy redneck stupid boy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better Than the Movie","review":"The book was a wonderful read. It was funny but had a message about labeling people and many of the events of the 60's and 70's. I highly recommend it.

He was much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying Hard","review":"Trying hard to get into this book, it is one of my favorite all time movies. About 25% through book and just can't get into it, I am about to give up. I keep hoping it will get better but pretty slow. A friend had told me years ago it was far funnier than the movie, don't quite see it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy and not too good","review":"This 1986 novel bears no rsemblance to the movie. In the book Gump does all the stuff the movie character fantasizes about--is a football hero, wins the Medal of Honor, does space travel, is successful pro wreestler(as \\"the Dunce\\"), plays cahmpionship chess, becomes a millionaire. At first it was funny but after about 50 pages it was fantasy and I have seldom had much longing for fantasy. So, the movie is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible book!!!","review":"The genius behind the success of Forrest Gump certainly lies within the screen writers of Hollywood and not the author of this book. Hats off to them....that they could take this gibberish and make a GREAT movie from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book, good movie","review":"After watching the movie, I have always wanted to read the book. My conclusion is that the movie is much better and after reading the book, I am more appreciative of the skills of the writers of the film version. In the book, Gump is pretty much amoral. He reacts, on almost all occassions, entirely on an instinctive basis. Yeah, Gump shows his emotions here and there, but at least in the movie he had a clear sense of what right action was. In the book, he doesn't really know right from wrong.Another difference between the book and the film is that the book is really goofy and nothing can really be taken seriously by the reader. The film, on the other hand, is pretty much a straight drama with elements of comedy. The film is rooted in reality, the book is absurd. It feels like Winston Groom just typed the damn thing.On its own merits, the book is just not well written. There's too much happening.So basically, the book is too goofy, too much happening, and poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gump as White Trash","review":"From lovable simpleton to mean spirited dumb-ass PWT.

If I had never seen the film, I would have rated the story with another star because it was \\"OK\\", but if you are expecting to enjoy the book becasue you love the simple love story and innocence in the film, you will not like the lustful, pot-smoking Forrest Gump who befriends a gorilla for most of this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real disappointment","review":"As a person who usually enjoys a book much more than the movie, this was the exception to my rule. What a flavorless, racist character Forest was in this book. I had very little empathy for his situations. I was disappointed in the portrayal of his relationship with Jenny. The movie warms your soul. The book makes you ask - they made a movie out of this?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"More ridiculous than the movie.","review":"Its a good thing the movie didn't exactly follow the book because 'Forrest Gump' was even more ridiulous than the film. In the book, he goes out into outer space and is some kind of ... savant who can play a master game of chess and and solve complex equations. Along the way, there is an ape that follows him around.

It looks like it was filmed in one take with each actor listening to a different director. No one knows what they're supposed to be doing or what their character is supposed to be about. It also seems like it is an attempt to portray gay life on the street by someone raised in Salt Lake City, or the Vatican. Completely out of touch with reality and filled with simple stereotypes. I could only take about 40 minutes then switched it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hustler at it's worst","review":"With hopeful expectations of a modern reincarnated Joe Dallesandro movie, I found myself beyond dissapointed. Even a bigger put-down was the fact that Siskel and Ebert gave the loser \\"two thumbs up\\". What you actually wind up with, is a sorry mutated version of \\"Trick\\" and \\"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\\" rolled-into-one. Even more distasteful, was the haunting \\"stereotypical\\" music in the background. Instead of collecting money to fulfill a drug habit, the main character \\"John\\", begs, borrows, and steals, to try and buy the \\"one- day-high\\" of staying at \\"The Plaza\\". How completely unrealistic, as was this entire film. I would not only give it \\"two thumbs down\\", but two big toes as well.

That's what this movie feels like. In fact, you might get a more interesting narrative than what you'd find in JOHNS. This movie wallows in squalor, despair, tedium, hopelessness...and, for some bizarre reason, religious symbolism. I can pretty much guarantee that anyone who might appreciate a little religious symbolism in their films will never watch--let alone enjoy--a movie like this.In fact, I honestly can't imagine anyone enjoying this movie.

The movie had some funny scenes but that was it. I thought David Arquette performances was seriously lacking any believiablity. Lucas Haas was great however as the caring hustler who would do anything for his friend.The plot was extremely unplausiable. I was hoping the movie from all the hype it had to atleast be as good as Leaving Las Vegas. It so was not. The picture quality was subpar and only added to make the movie even worse.The movie was a big letdown and that is why my review is so harsh."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty bad","review":"waited for this video in a lower price and glad that I did as this movie is no comparison to Midnight Cowboy and the story is weak very slow and Luke Haas was not very effective at all.

All I could think of was UGH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johns Review By Robert Raketty","review":"This film is about a group of boys who resort to selling themselves in order to fill a greater hunger and in some cases with tragic concequences. What moved me most was Lukas Haas's charactor, who comes to the streets after running away from a family unable to cope with ther son's homosexuality. This movie is able to open a window of reality into their world that no other movie has been able to duplicate. This fim also gives an intimate portrayl of youth trying to find a link in a society in which they are outcasts. I would recomend this movie to anyone who wishes to understand those that society has placed on the bottom and because Haas gives a stunning performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Portrait of Street Hustlers","review":"I was pleasently surprised after watching this film.

Dr. Dull!","review":"A surprisingly melancholy installment in the Alex Delaware series.

An especially disappointing selection considering the strength of the last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The longer J. Kellerman writes, the better his books become.

Stil wish there there additional characters who go from book to book - and it seems that there are a few detectives who are picking up this slack now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Death","review":"The most difficult book to get interested in~~~too many characters in the storyline, jumps around too much, and a lot of unnecessary info. Never read past the seventh chapter. The beginning chapters did not make you wonder what was happening on the next page.I am not a fan of Jonathan Kellerman. First and last book that I will try to read from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Dr. Death (aka Dr. Eldon Mate) is responsible for many assisted suicides. Dr. Mate is brutually murdered and the story revolves around who killed the doctor. There are too many extraneous plots and suspects. I felt that these were techniques used to only add pages to the storyline and to add a little suspense here and there. By page 116 (out of 352 pages) I was beginning not to care who did it. I am a great fan of Jonathan Kellerman, particularly the Alex Delaware series, and have read all of his books. This book is not his best and definitely not of the high standards as his other psychological thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A series on the wane","review":"For the past few Delaware books, the structure has been tediously similar: Alex (with or without Milo) goes from person to person and asks questions. Eventually, he figures out who the killer is, there is a single action scene and then it ends.Alex is getting to be less and less of a character. His girlfriend serves almost no purpose to the story, not even as a sounding board. In this story, even the concluding action scene is pretty minor, and in the only other scene of any real violence, Alex is threatened with no more than a sore jaw.Billy Straight shows that Kellerman still knows what he's doing, but the Delaware books seem to just go through the motions. It's time for either rebirth or retirement for this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pad Kellerman's wallet...","review":"...by buying this book! Kellerman's not my style to begin with, but he's done much better. Like James \\"Book-A-Week\\" Patterson, Kellerman has plied out a shamefully ill-written novel to cash in on his name. To keep it simple, you have about 30 pages of actual \\"Dr. Death\\", 200+ pages of pointless swerve material with un-interesting characters with little revelance to the ending(other than for Kellerman to flex his rather bland and suspect \\"psych profiling\\" style), and 30 end pages with a blink and you missed it wrap-up and tawdry \\"hot button\\" ending. Beyond the pale, Kellerman also chooses to plug a former work (\\"Billy Jack\\") in several scenes that add NOTHING to the story. Sticking a blatant commercial in a book is pretty low from such a \\"big name\\" author. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this, send a message to Jonathan Kellerman that his fans want quality in his works, not quantity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This was my first Kellerman novel. I thought it was well written, and enjoyed it until the end. What a disappointment. Very anticlimatic and left too many subplots unresolved. Perhaps these will be tied together in future novels, but it did not leave me with the urge to read any continuing novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back from the Dead","review":"After the last installment, \\"Monster\\", this series was near death. But Kellerman has returned to basics and found an interesting family that keeps us hooked to his story. Secondary characters are strong, and at least one could have told a fascinating version from his own point of view. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Read","review":"Jonathan Kellerman has done it again! I enjoyed the rich storytelling way in which he wrote this book. I found myself several times getting caught up in the characters lives. It is a book I'd definitely read again. Dr. Death depicts the psychological thrillers Kellerman is known for. It's suspenseful twists and turns, sends readers in to a whirlwind of demonic mazes, stealth bound hills, and unseen hallways of the psychopathic mind. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who could stomach the suspense riddled plots born only in Kellerman's mind, through Dr. Death."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and waste of money","review":"Jonathan Kellerman has almost always been a sure thing in terms of writing an interesting mystery. With Dr. Death he somehow lost his touch. It almost seems as if he's playing around with a sort of Philip Marlow/ 40's detective writing style in the beginning of the book and then he abruptly goes back to his typical writing style. Kellerman also throws in an obligatory and really boring love scene with Alex Delawares annoying and self abosorbed live in girlfriend Robin. The problem with Dr. Death is the barely fleshed out characters (other than Delaware and Milo and the dog) and that it tries to be a commentary on euthanasia and the movement that surround it. Kellerman should stick to writing what he writes best. All mystery-no social commentary, and most of all no Robin-it's time for a new love interest---Petra perhaps?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Dr. Death by Johathan Kellerman was a tremendous disappointment for me. It is the last Kellelrman I will read and I am just thankful I did not purchase the book. I am really tired of his distortion of Los Angeles...some of the simpler folks that read his books might take the info as fact when it is not. I think he should be ashamed of himsefl, but he sells so I guess thats not a possibility, too bad. I am downtown most every weekend enjoying the music center, the new Cathedral, extending out to the beaches and the valleys."},{"rating":"1","title":"My introduction to this author","review":"Having had Jonathan Kellerman recommended highly to me, I gave him a try with this book. Without reviewing the plot, I'll admit it moves quickly, despite extraneous information on virtually every page. I could have done without Dr. Delaware's sexual unions with his wife, for example, and without his detailed word maps of Los Angeles streets. These are minor flaws. The major flaw is that there is not one single character here that a reader can like or find entertaining. The victim, the cops, Dr. Delaware himself, the young woman Dr. Delaware is counseling, her nasty brother, her nasty father, etc. The novel left a rather bitter aftertaste, as if I had eaten something that was on the verge of being spoiled and vaguely poisonous. Would I read another by Kellerman? Perhaps--just to see if this is the norm or if Dr. Mate's death (see matar in a Spanish dictionary) brought out the worst in people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to finally close the book","review":"I have read every book Jonathan Kellerman has written.

Although it's a current topic (\\"assisted suicide\\"), the author really didn't add much to the topic. I also found very offensive the presentation of one of the characters who had, as Kellerman described it, gone to bed and eaten until she had almost doubled her weight. She was presented in a very unsympathetic view - almost as if she was a criminal, and most of the other characters seemed to be horrified by how fat she had gotten, as if being fat were a mortal sin. I'd expect a little more psychological understanding from Kellerman. I found that the book left a bad taste in my mouth (or in my mind)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Death","review":"Dr. Alex Delaware and Detective Milo Sturgis are back to solve the murder of Dr. Eldon Mate aka \\"Dr. Death\\".

EXCEPT - If you buy this quickcam, plan on only recording videos during the day! At night with artificial lighting, this camera does not work well. The capture is grany, with delayed video and audio response. I also use a seperate mic with most webcams. This mic is not all that great.

I was miguided by the cover and title. There's nothing really military about it, even though it's about military people(and some CIA and KGB), but mostly military.

Dexter has managed to remove a couple of inches off of one of them. But being several months old now, that's acceptable.

The manuscript reads like a college dissertation that offers very little to a non-academic who is interested in the Harlem Renaissance and its prolific writers. Calloway should take the time to revise her study into a monograph that will appeal to a much broader audience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with instrumentals!","review":"What a disappointment this CD was!! I wish I had read all the other reviews before I ordered it. For a group of superbly talented musicians, this effort was definitely sub-standard. The lyrics on these songs were sophomoric, at best, as compared to their previous efforts. I look for more mature material in their next CDs. Don't get me wrong, I am a great admirer of these kids, and have seen them in concert numerous times. I just expect a lot more of them to earn my automatic purchase of their CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I have listened to Nickel Creek's debut album until I know it inside and out. I love it. I saw them live and they were excellent. I was so excited to buy this CD and WOW...it's very different from the first one and it almost seems like the kids were trying to pull something off here and it didn't quite work out. I like the first song, but after that it's pretty bad. These kids can play their instruments so well, but they aren't showcasing that at all on the second album, just a bunch of mucked up lyrics and odd song structures. Stick with their first album and cross your fingers they come to their senses and write another great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Want The Old Nickel Creek Back","review":"Well, all good things must come to an end. I've followed Chris from his first solo CD through all the Nickel Creek releases.The characteristics that endeared me to him and them.....Chris's phenominal mandolin work, great lyrics, and (yes, I'll admit it) the bluegrass/folk feel to their work is gone in this newest release. Oh, of course, the mandolin isn't gone...it's there but not as a featured instrument. Lyrics are bizarre. They're all great musicians, don't get me wrong---you can't kill talent like they have. But they've obviously sold out to something, I know not what. This is the first CD I've ever bought as a pre-release. For two cents I'd send it back to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Twice","review":"The last Nickel Creek CD was is one of my favorite CDs of all time! Unfortunately this one is a huge disappointment. I'm all for streching out when it comes to song selection but this collection is a bit too out there for my tastes. If you liked the first Nickel Creek CD I'm not sure if you'll like this one. I hate to say it but I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor follow up","review":"I loved Nickle Creek's debut CD. This new one is a huge disappointment. What happened to the intstrumental virtuosity and songs like \\"I am a Lighthouse\\"? This effort is sophmoric at best with some painfully, shrill vocal arrangements. There is very little violin on this CD which is very disappointing considering that Sarah is one of the best young fiddle players on the scene today. I appreciate \\"taking a chance\\" musically but this just didn't work for me. It was almost cartoonish at times. Nickle Crrek, go back and do what you do best! Instrumental virtuosity! Your songwriting skills will come in time but they are not refined enough to make up 90% of your music! 50% vocal/instrumental split is more like it for where you guys are now!Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this side","review":"a very disappointing followup to their debut cd. if you are a fan of bluegrass you will probably be very let down by this album. i was hoping for several instrumentals (there is only one which is ok but no where near as interesting as any of the instrumentals on their first cd)and more bluegrass like music. there is a lot of jazz, blues and rock influence on this cd which might be to your liking but if you are expecting more of the type of the music from the first cd i strongly urge you to listen to this cd before buying it. i have listened to it a few times and i doubt i'll be listening to it much more. their singing and playing is fine; it's just very pop sounding, something you'd expect to hear on mainstream radio with nothing original about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to such a great group?","review":"Chris Thile is the best mandolin player in the world, and Sean and Sara Watkins are certainly also world-class on guitar and fiddle. Their first album was incredible, so I've been looking forward to the group's second album ever since the first was released. I also own all of Chris' albums, and Sean's solo album, so I had an expectation for what this album would be like. What a dissapointment! Other than the first song, an instrumental, the album is almost un-listenable. I forced myself to listen a second and third time, but that's probably it for me. The second song in particular is very bizarre - it reminds me of the Beatles' (who I despise) psychedlic period. I hope they return to their bluegrass roots and continue creating wonderful and unique music. They have SO much talent, it is truly a shame to see it being wasted on an album like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big-Time Sophmore Slump","review":"I couldn't wait to hear the latest Nickel Creek cd when it was released.Their debut album was one of the best i've heard in years.Just about every song got in your head and made you sing it to yourself all day long.If that's what you're looking for with \\"This Side\\" try somewhere else!The cd shows the biggest change seen between two releases in quite a long time.There's no great harmonies,no fancy hooks,no great song-writing.Plus the production is very weak.I have listened to the cd several times now and \\"Hanging By A Thread\\" is the only song that has anything going on.What you'll find is one good guitar part here,another catchy phrase for a second or two in another song and so on and so on.If you were really good at editing you could probably take all those parts and come up with one listenable song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this CD some time to sink in.....","review":"When I first listened to the CD I had my doubts, but the tunes were so infectious and musically interesting that i couldn't stop replaying it. Now, It is my favorite CD so far this year. This bunch is taking acoustic music to a completely new and delightful place. There is simply no one like them anywhere in the music universe. Don't listen to those critics who expected a followup Newgrass/Celtic album along the lines of the debut CD.This album is great, but in a different, musically expansive way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a change","review":"My first listen to \\"This Side\\" was somewhat disappointing, as I was looking forward to more of the same traditional bluegrass/folk/americana music presented in their debut album. After hearing the album a couple more times, I can honestly say the album has grown on me and I can appreciate \\"this OTHER side\\" of Nickel Creek's artistry. Listen with an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Great Track","review":"I bought the album after hearing \\"Smoothie Song\\". There are no other instrumentals on the album, and that's a mistake. While their voices are pleasant enough, they mostly distract from the above-everage musicianship. Two or three vocals would have been fine, but vocals on every song became an irritation to me instead of a joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big miss on this one","review":"Nickel Creek missed it big time on this one. Smoothie Song had me cranking up the stereo, but Spit on a Stranger had me nearly turning it off. Things dont get much better from there until the 9th song which is a traditional tune that Nickel Creek does best. The next four tunes are more of what I expect from this group, Chris finally lets Sara sing something. My advice to this group is to stay away from the progressive stuff and stick to traditional and bluegrass. Definitely not the quality of the last album. This is one of those albums that is good for three or four songs only"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Yes, A CD finally worth paying full price for","review":"I just saw NC last night at Amoeba Records in Hollywood. This was my second time. I hadn't heard \\"This Side\\", since it was just released that day. The show was exceptional (especially for free!). So nice to see a young extremely talented group of musicians jamb. So I bought the CD and listened to it the hour drive home and it really had me smilling. Hey a little Beatles influence there. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty interesting CD","review":"I know nothing about Nickel Creek. I bought there new album \\"This Side\\" yesterday at Wherehouse for the heck of it, [it was at good cost.] how can you beat that. I listened to it and I liked it. Its really mellow and folk-y. I can't say much about it. I just recommend it to a lot of people who like country or the \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\" soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmore Slump","review":"I really tried to like this CD, I did . . .Nickel Creek first impressed me when I saw them on a Grand Ole Opry special on TV, I bought the first self-titled CD, thinking they were an instrumental group. Boy was I wrong. Where the first album has strong songwriting with some of the most beautiful harmonies I've ever heard, the new album \\"This Side\\" lacks. Now it'd be foolish to think Nickel Creek would make a carbon copy of the previous CD to try to keep the momentum of that gold selling disc, they seem to have taken from all the less desirable parts of the album, and recreated it here on \\"This Side\\". The disc does have it's standouts though, with Green and Gray, This Side, and Seven Wonders recapturing some of that classic Nickel Creek sound, mostly, this disc falls flat. Still, if you enjoy this CD even a little bit, go see the Creek live. They're awesome on stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I first heard them live as a warm up band and have since gone out of my way to hear them as well. Their first CD was truly magic.Unfortunately this one is not. What makes them great is the musicianship. Chris is a mind-blowing mandolin player. He is NOT a mind blowing singer. They spend way too much time focusing on less-than-super vocals, and they focus away from the extraordinary instrumental talent. They also go off into doing \\"edgy\\" musical stuff that just doesn't work for me.I listen to their first CD all the time. I've listened to this one several times to see if it grows on me. It hasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!","review":"Nickel Creek is my favorite band ever, and this is a great CD!! It stays in my CD player and I listen to it everyday, and if it's not \\"This Side\\" it's their self-titled CD. It is a wonderful mixture of Bluegrass, Country, Rock, Blues, and many more. The lyrics are especially great just to think about. GREAT CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the bluegrass?","review":"They are so talented. So incredible to see \\"live\\". I was sad that they chose not to do bluegrass pickin' and hope Nickel Creek will consider doing more in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, Great SACD.","review":"I've heard some terrible multi-channel mixes (Norah Jones' first album). This is a great one. Nickel Creek's first multi-channel SACD isn't nearly as good as this mix, so if you've gotten that one this one is even better. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plug Nickel","review":"Frustrated. That's how I felt listening to This Side. There is so much potential for this band. I had to listen to the last one several times but it ended up being one of my favorite acoustic cd's. This Time just did not take. There are several enjoyable songs with the best being Spit On A Stranger. All in all the album is too all over the place. It's not bluegrass, not jazz and too much of the same from the previous album. It is definitely not for everyone. Warning! Bluegrass traditionalists stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Side CD","review":"I had to run right out and get Nickel Creek's new release -- This Side. I absolutely loved their first release -- self-titled, Nickel Creek (5-star rating), so I was really looking forward to buying their second release. I spent quite a bit of time listening to the CD last evening and for the most part was disappointed. The songs lacked the substance found on their first CD. I found the only radio-friendly tune to be the title track, which is featured on CMT as a \\"hot shot\\" video currently. It was spunky and upbeat. This is the ONLY song I truly enjoyed on the entire CD.I had difficulty trying to speculate what Nickel Creek's next single might be. There just didn't seem to be many songs that stood out. I thought most songs were down -- not upbeat...just the opposite of their first release.I think the members of Nickel Creek are extremely talented. I've seen them in concert and they were outstanding! However, for whatever reason, this CD missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Chris","review":"I loved the balance in the first album but Chris's song writing and gratingly high pitched voice on the majority of this album was hugely disappointing to me. No real duets with Sara, only one instrumental track...basically a solo Chris album. He drowns out the great background instrumentals which are the key to Nickel Creek's success! And, frankly, I prefer Sara's soft voice (ala Alison) to his as she subtly accentuates the music. Anyway, I haven't listened much, but I can guarantee you there will be many tracks I'll skip (Green and Gray is awful)every time I listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What CD have they been listening to.....","review":"Let me say first of all, I loved the CD that came before this one. It is a fixture in the disc changer in my car. As soon as I recieved my copy of This Side in the mail, I put it in the player. Never have I been so dissappointed. I have skimmed most of the other reviews on this sight...and frankly I don't know what CD they have been listening to. I wish I had read the CDNow review before I bought it. The characterization that the CD lacks the creative maturity equal to the performance talent of this band could not be more accurate. I have come to the conclusion that Nickel Creek needs a new grass producer who can bring some direction to the music that is beyond adolescent experimentation. While not entirely a disaster, for the most part, this CD qualifies as an experiment that should not have seen the light of day. My copy went straight to the second hand CD store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired Musical Direction","review":"Nickel Creek is an exciting and fresh band that can carve its own path and attract listeners from a number of different genres of music. Unfortunately, \\"This Side\\" seems as though they, along with the help of Alison Krauss, are trying too hard to package a new sound. The music on this album underutilizes the energy of this group. With the exception of a few cuts, it seems to drag. It is a shame because this group could do so much more. The CD seems to be following too closely the direction Alison herself has been heading. Unfortunately, her latest CD is also not very inspired. She seems to think that the \\"whispery\\" vocals are providing a new direction to bluegrass or whatever genre it is. Too bad that the energy is lost. In my opinion, Nickel Creek and Alison Krauss need to reassess how their natural musical energy can be shown rather than inhibited."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Album Was Better","review":"The material on this ablum is satisfying, but some of the magic is missing from Nickel Creek's debut album. The song This Side is the only one that I would describe as outstanding. The rest of the songs are okay and actually sound better in concert. Chris Thile is clearly the most talented person in this band and they should stick with him as their lead singer. There just are any compelling songs on this album that might compare to When You Come Back Down or the Lighthouse's Tale.On thing I do like about this album better that their previous offering is the number is songs with actualy singing. On their debut album, more than half of the album was instrumentals. There is more emphasis on vocals on this album. Over, it's a satisfying album, but could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential","review":"Before I listened to this C.D. I bought it for a friend. His comment was that it was \\"different\\" from their first release. How right he was. These groups is extremely talented, but have decided to go off into directions that their talent does not support. OK vocals, singing marginal words (I Spit on Strangers?!?), backed by excellent instrumentals make for a marginal album.If you liked the first album I would highly recommend Thile's and Watkin's solo releases. They are both excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good...","review":"I bought this album because i loved their self titled debut. Unfortunately, it really is nothing like their first album. There is only a hint of bluegrass sound, Chris Thile's vocals are straying into an alt-pop sound, and frankly, many of the lyrics are painfully insipid. Too bad, their first album was (and still is) one of my favorites. If you liked Nickel Creek (the album) for it's unique sound, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"After a delightful debut album spotlighting their great instrumental talents, this group has gone for more vocal cuts on this album; their voices are fine and blend beautifully, but as soloists they are thready and weak, self-conscious and even timid. It seems they have attempted to reach a larger audience by going more \\"pop\\" than folk/bluegrass. They should have stuck with what works, because this doesn't AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Side","review":"If you're cosidering purchasing this cd based on the wonderful song selection and brilliant musicianship of their last cd you will be disappointed. If you're a bluegrass fan then leave this alone. This was a futile attempt to emulate the Cowboy Junkies or something. James Taylor with a mandolin maybe. Was surprised they didnt cover The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. Listened to this junk twice...my first and last times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning to those who love their first CD","review":"Largely abandoning their bluegrass fans and having almost no memorable tunes, this CD is a big downer. It is sooo disappointing because I loved their first CD and still play it all the time. I REALLY tried to like it and listened through a half-dozen times but it just isn't happening. This is now in my \\"Next Yard Sale\\" box and I don't think I'll ever listen to it again. So my warning is to listen before you buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i was hoping for so much more...","review":"Nickel Creek's debut CD is one of my favorites and I was so excited to hear their new CD. I was extremely disappointed. \\"This Side\\" is NOTHING like the debut CD. The style is completely different and the music just doesn't pull on my emotions like the first CD did. As much as I hate to say it, if you enjoyed their first CD, you probably aren't going to like this one. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their first album was MUCH better.","review":"Nickel Creek's debut album of the same name was pretty good so when \\"This Side\\" came out I had hopes it would be a good follow up. I was wrong, if you expect this album to be anything like the modern Bluegrass of the first album don't bother coming here. I liked many of the songs on the first CD but it seems like all of the selections here are much more Pop flavored, little or no tradition to them (the video I saw on TV was too weird to believe). Any of the group members can do much better than the work they display here, Sean Watkins is a good instrumentalist and Sara Watkins can really sing, but they left that behind on this one. Maybe a third album, if there is one, will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going on a journey","review":"I too liked their freshman effort and was sorely disappointed in their sophmore effort. They seem to have veered off the path they had started on, exploring a road full of synchopated techno-pop and try-to-hard chord structures. I, for one, don't wish to follow them down that road. Perhaps one day they will find their way back to where they started but until that time I will wave a fond farewell and search for other inspirations. I only have myself to blame though, I bought the CD without even listening to any clips on the web. Fool me once, shame on you.I won't be fooled again. Bye bye Nickel Creek. Hope you have a good trip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Side","review":"This is a nice album if you need sleep enducement. I was verydisappointed with the lack of energy. After watching these guyson a TV special, I assumed this to be a high energy group andwas blown away by the indivdual talent displayed by each on theirrespective instruments. I did'nt realize they did so much vocalwork. No chance for their real talent to be displayed on thisCD."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are lost and trying to find their sound","review":"I was pleased and excited with the first CD \\"Nickel Creek\\" from this fine, albeit eclectic group. The melodies were distinct and memorable. This CD, however, is without a soul. It seems they are forcing experimentation to define themselves. Unfortunately this experiment fails miserably. If you liked their first CD, you will not like \\"This Side\\". If you loved \\"Nickel Creek\\" you will like some cuts here. Save your money, pull your favs from Kaza and wait for their next offering. If their next offering is as wanting as this, we will probably never hear from them again; and that won't be a bad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible Music","review":"I just heard the song Spit On A Stranger on the radio while driving home after getting some breakfast this morning, and my wife and I thought it was amongst the worst songs we had ever heard. It made me feel like committing a violent act. I immediately knew it had to be Nickle Creek, after seeing their awful performance on Austin City Limits. Sure enough I was right. These folks are doing roots music an injustice by being around. Can't you folks just disappear?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZ - CURE FOR INSOMNIACS","review":"I once thought this band was a treasure; a perfect gem; threepieces, great young instrumentalists, with a big wide future ahead in accoustic music; the first album, mostlyinstrumentals mixed with a couple vocals was powerful, no, brilliant. and even though it's musical suicide to develop aformula and trudge knowingly through it, these guys reallyjumped overboard with this release. and without life jackets!This is a vocal album, there is only one instrumental track here, these people can carry a tune, but they are not prosingers, they are players; this is the type of album a band putsout after a long recording career establishing their ability -This record is like the cover, cute, and cartoonish; i.e. fluff.buy it at your peril, those giving over three stars are justfans blinded by their own zeal - this disc will be gathering dustin a month; mine, i'm giving away tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newgrass Hits a Bulls-Eye","review":"Alison Krauss discovered and produced this very young group, and their self-titled initial offering on Sugar Hill gets better and better on repeat listening. This new recording tends to reach a broader audience, I believe, and that may turn off a few die-hard bluegrass fans. However, as with Edgar Meyer, who guests on three numbers, and Chris Theile, who guests on Bela Fleck's \\"Perpetual Motion,\\" and so many other collaborative efforts that seem to bring bluegrass influences and interests together theses days (\\"Oh, Brother...\\"), repeated listening will open the ears to earned enjoyment. It is nice to know that this band of twenty-somethings has been together for a decade and relies on licks and vocal skills rather than four letter words to express their musical ideas. I'm looking forward to seeing them in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heh...This is really cool!","review":"Welcome to another exciting Review by me! We'll start with the CD cover because it is the first thing you will ever see. It reminded me of a Train cover. Its cute, sure, but not what I expected. In fact, I had to flip the CD over to see if it was them for sure (and not Nickel Back..I confuse them because the names are so similar). Sean's pants on te back are really cool.The only instumental song is #1. To me, that is a good thing. I like songs with words. I Spit on a Stranger and This Side are the best songs on the album, although all are great! This album is more upbeat than their previous, but still stays true to the bluegrass it is. You should so buy it, it's cool. No Doubt!Heh...what a lame review. Let's just pretend I helped you and you click that button that says I was helpful! Thanks all!By The Way!....I gave it four stars because they're good, but they're no Spice Girls!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking.","review":"Not a word to use lightly. Never, however, have I felt so confident in using it. This album shows Nickel Creek leaping forward by increments, taking their bluegrass/folk amalgam and adding in a new element, rock, and in the process forging a sound unlike anything I've ever heard before. The playing is much more confident, and the songwriting shows an incredible amount of growth. There's less emphasis on the frantic instrumentals of the first album, and more emphasis on subtlety, nuance, and brilliant harmony. The singing of all three members is noticably improved from the first album. Ignore Amazon. There's no sophmore slump here. It's a brilliant new sound, and it's going to be looked upon in the future as a turning point in the career of a band that will have an indellible impact on the future of music. Buy this album, and be able to say that you were there when it all started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Melodies","review":"There is something so addictingabout Nickel Creek. The layers of beautiful instruments and vocal harmonies create perfect music. I've been anxious for the release of this album, and it's incredible! Nickel Creek covers the map of styles, paying even less attention to fitting into a genre than the self titled album. The strengths of this album come from the maturity of their song-writing. \\"Hanging by a Thread\\" and \\"Green and Gray\\" demand your attention, while the \\"Smoothie Song\\" gives you a chance to really enjoy an awesome instrumental. This CD won't get dusty in my collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Side - Nickel Creek","review":"I was excited to see the new CD released, but what a let down. These are three of the most talented musicians to come along in a long time, but what a total misuse of their talent. This was an CD of ballad songs. Nowhere in this CD do we get a chance to see the talent of the three. It's like there trying to prove they can sing. It would have been nice to hear an uptempo song somewhere on the album. I do not know what they were thinking or why Allison Krause would let this leave the studio. If they don't want to play bluegrass fine, but at least don't journey to far from what they are best at. I bought the CD as soon as it came out, listened to it three times and sold it back to the store for something worth hearing. Nickel Creek, you let your fans from the first album down bigtime, and I am a big fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"like bluegrass? buy the 1st one","review":"Unfortunately, I'll have to give this one a \\"thumbs-down.\\"I was really looking forward to hearing the new CD, but...well, Nickel Creek's first CD is Soooo much better than this one; if you're looking for something other than bluegrass, this may be for you. I did enjoy three of the songs on the CD but was really put off by the second track; try explaining to a five-year-old bluegrass fan(my son)why the song seems to say it's alright to \\"spit on a stranger!\\" Nickel Creek has so much talent, but unless you own their first CD, you'd never know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite albums","review":"This CD is great. From the first note to the last, I love it all! My favorite is Number 5. The way that they manipulate the music is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's foreign on this side.......","review":"Everybody else has said this too, but this album is different than the first. However, it isn't as drastically as you might think on a first listen. The funky newgrass element is still there as is the stellar musical talent and killer harmony. They even have Edgar Meyer on bass for a couple of tracks! There's also some nice new stuff that comes from their experimenting. Obviously they have been touring with glen phillips (from toad...) and that effected their style. The biggest disappointment to me were the self absorbed and often limited scope of the lyrics on several of the songs (thus the 4 stars only). But, that shouldn't keep you from buying this incredible CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't Bluegrass.","review":"I'm not saying it's not great music. If anything it's great music. There's a mix, even an emphasis on folk and British Isle style of music and poetry, a little too sad and a little too serious. Oddly, it's also a little too pop. These folks (kids?) are obviously super-talented both with their song writing and their ability to operate their instruments. However, their music appears to be searching for direction, or maybe just THINKS it's searching for direction. Overly dramatic, overly self-conscious, overly-non-bluegrass. It's not even newgrass, but more like Neo-Folk-Pop. Yeah, it's great music, but it's not what I was shopping for and not what I was expecting. If I knew then what I know now I wouldn't have bought this album. This isn't bluegrass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambitious Cross-Over CD","review":"I stumbled on This Side in my local music store and highly recommend the CD for anyone looking for a new sound. The vocals are brilliant--particularly those of Sean Watkins and Chris Thile. The sound seamlessly merges folk rock, bluegrass and jazz. I am not a bluegrass fan, though after hearing this CD I am inclined to delve deeper into this genre, beginning with Nickel Creek's first album and the two solo efforts of Watkins and Thile. It's difficult to pick a favorite track: these three each bring tremendous talent and together they have really have something with this CD. Count me among their biggest fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A keeper after 7 years","review":"The real test of a good record is if you still want to listen to it after a year. After seven years in our collection, I'm still listening to this CD and enjoying it tremendously.The sheer virtuosity and polish is just remarkable -- that three kids could play and sing this well, AND write mature and thoughtful songs -- just hard to believe. Chris Thiele's mandolin gets the attention and the ink, but Sarah and Sean Watkins are every bit as special. \\"Beauty and the Mess\\" packs about as much musicianship as you'll ever hear in 2 1/2 minutes -- Sarah Watkins' vocals are crisp and perfect like a Granny Smith apple, the guitar and mandolin work is fantastic, the rhythms playful, the harmonies interesting. These guys were (and still are) real musicians' musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Side - Nickel Creek SACD","review":"Of all of the SACDs I have listened to, this one is by far the most masterfully mixed. On a SACD player one must listen to this over and over to catch every nuance. It is a pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great True 5.1 SACD","review":"I love this SACD. This is about as good of a 5.1 mix you're going to get. I am usually an alternative, jazz, christian praise music listener, never liked country or bluegrass. This is a wonderful sound, not as country as their first albums, and not as sad as their final album, just right. I would recommend this SACD to anyone that enjoys music."},{"rating":"2","title":"give it a chance","review":"It seems as if you either love it or hate it. When I first heard it I wasnt quite sure, but I've grown to love it. Those people who seem to hate it now are probably warming up to it.A few tracks are not-so-great. But most are quite interesting, entertaining, thought-provoking, and fun. I am addicted to mandolin music, so I remain disappointed that there wasnt as much instrumentals here, but I can wait for the upcoming solo albums.Some of the slams here seem to be from folks who know exactly what they want and they're upset they've been deceived or something. This album will surprise you. Give it a listen online before you buy.No one else seems to be doing this kind of music...they havent sold out: they're stretching the boundaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest groups.","review":"The first time I saw or heard Nickel Creek was on CMT. I didn't really pay much attention. After a few years, I saw another one of their music videos for This Side. It seemed to be on TV continuously. I downloaded the song and listened to it all the time. Then I decided to buy the CD, and it has been one of the greatest CDs I've ever had. The music just seems to reach every part of your body and completely relaxes you. The instruments and vocals are superb. The first time I listened to it, I immediatly loved it and found myself becoming terribly anxious to get home and listen to it after a day out. However, if you are not up to opening your mind and giving this music a chance if you don't like this type, then I wouldn't buy it. But if you're willing to listen to it and all ready like bluegrass then I definetly think you should buy the CD. You'll wonder how you ever got along without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. Too good to believe.","review":"I saw Nickel Creek perform on public television and liked what I heard, so I bought this CD. Their mix of folk, bluegrass, celtic, blues, and well lots of genres are really unique, and each song is beautiful. The trio can sing and harmonize with the best of the bands and their musical ability is second to none. The scary part is that these three are still young. They will get even better. I'm excited for them, and will certainly purchase whatever they put out. Believe me, Nickel Creek is in a class all their own. Outstanding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nickel Creek Where Art Thou?","review":"Like a lot of you I started my latest round of summer purchases with the new Nickel Creek CD and I wish I hadn't. The cartoonish cover sums up the album perfectly. It's an eclectic, akward mess that clunks and limps along with no unifying threads and none of the barely contained energy or breezy, lightning fast instrumentals which characterized their brilliant debut effort. Instead they chose to concentrate on their vocals which was in my view, a major mistake, Thile and Sean Watkins share the vocal chores on the majority of the 13 tracks, but it is Sarah's vocals on \\"Seven Wonders\\" and \\"Sabra Girl\\" that provide the only highlights on an otherwise very disappointing sophmore effort. I hope this band which once showed so much promise can regain its stride after this misstep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"The words stink!!! (I don't know what the producer was thinking)The music is o.k., but nothing compared to their first CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Side","review":"This CD is a total letdown after Nickel Creek's first release. It has a few interesting notes but the \\"bubblegum\\" nature of most of the songs will keep me from playing it. I have decided not to see them perform live again. I wish that I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"Nickel Creek's first CD is one of my favorites. If you don't own it ...buy it. Make no mistake Nickel Creek is very telented, unfortunitally the result of this effort was just disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sequel that disappointed me.","review":"I loved Nickel creek's \\"Nickel Creek\\". In fact I would give it 4 maybe even 5 stars. Maybe my expectations, of this sequel, were too high. I will give my impressions of \\"This Side\\" as a comparison to \\"Nickel Creek\\". \\"This Side's\\" recording quality was, by comparison, on the dark and somewhat thick side.as opposed to the former's up front \\"alive\\" sound. Gone was the stunning instrumental vertuoso fireworks of the former replaced with lack-luster \\"poppish\\" lyrical wanderings.The former was 85% Bluegrass with a smattering of progressive pop/new age sound which melded into a pleasing new style of blugrass which I liked.The latter was in compairson about 15% bluegrass, and the balance was the bland uneventful lyrical wanderings mentioned above. After listening I could not recall a single tune to hum or whistle, that's too bad.\\"Nickel Creek\\" was a hard act to follow, but they are young and very very talented, I'm sure they will do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.......","review":"What a letdown..........no energy....nothing worth listening too......save your money......"},{"rating":"1","title":"They used to be so good","review":"Nickel Creek on the first cd sounded so good. Their music was actually something new and we really never heard that kind of sound before. This Side was so BAD! I hated every track it sounded also a bit on the sleepy side and it was too different to the point as to where I do not even know what kind of category this music falls in. There are just several different appearances to what the first record was like to this one. First as little as it may be a picture of the band on the front cover of the album is very important on albums its called promoting yourself a stupit cartoon looking thing on the cover turns people away. This is a very talented trio and they are just wasting there time making bubblegum records like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creativity?","review":"I am reading a lot of reviewers saying they are creative, which is driving me crazy. How many covers are on this album? What is really pissing me off is that their Pavement cover sucks. Pavement is so much better and then Nickel Creek comes is having trouble making their own material for their next album so they steal songs from people that are better than them. Nickel Creek does get some credit, however, for having some good taste in music. They obviously like Radiohead (The Greatest?) and probably Pavement (THE Greatest)too because they did that cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Newgrass Experimentation","review":"Someone told me this was a great bluegrass band and I should run out and buy this CD. I have never regretted a CD purchase more. If there were standards for defining bluegrass, this would defy them--and I don't mean that as a compliment. The main vocals are utterly devoid of talent, much less vibrato--sounds like whoever sang the \\"Friends\\" theme song. It's all very plucky, full of pointless stops and starts.Yes, these young musicians clearly know their craft--perhaps too well, because instead of listenable tunes, the entire album pushes the limits of tempo and style for what seems to be annoying experimentation for it's own sake. If you like the rich, rhythmic sounds of AK+US or other traditional, foot-tapping bluegrass, avoid this album like the plague. If you like uppity prodigies experimenting for kicks, then buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Blu-Ray transfer","review":"Since this was the DVD and Blu-Ray debut of KOTSW, I was expecting a decent transfer if not an outright restoration.

I consider my standards low - I have been thrilled with the quality of some titles that have been poorly reviewed by those with higher standards, like reviewers at dvdfile and highdefdigest. But I was truly shocked by this title. I am sure that my laser looked better. And this is a blu-ray! Still, I am thrilled to at least have the film, and the documentary included is outstanding.

The rest of the toy looks like it would hold up well. Just need to check on the drill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Install Batteries!","review":"This looks like it would be a great toy. My 3 year old daughter has played with the manual screwdrivers but the power drill is IMPOSSIBLE! I have spent at least an hour, first unscrewing the tiny little screw to open the compartment to install batteries. The batteries are on a spring so you have to use force to close the compartment. I have now worked very hard to tighten the compartment but, because of the spring, you can't get the screw to make contact with the other side. I have tried everything -- duct tape, packing tape, rubber bands, etc. It just won't do it. So, even though this has been fun for the manual tools it was way too expensive considering you can't use the power drill (along with having a 3 year old crying because she can't use the toy). So, big Thumbs down on this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after first use","review":"I bought this toy to work my pre-school special ed students.

Annoying, but I thought maybe it was just a bad screw.The second time my son received this as a gift from Amazon and we got a battery in and the drill lasted approximately two hours.

We even forgot about this toy till 2 months later, we took it back out and let him play...it works fine except the battery door sometimes open when tape is loose.

It kept his interest for over a half hour. Then, suddenly, the \\"reverse\\" mode seemed jammed. He kept trying and after about three minutes, the drill started smoking. We haven't let him use it yet, for fear that it could be a very dangerous defect. I suppose we have to return it, but he keeps asking for his \\"machine\\" back and will surely be disappointed when he realizes he may never get it back.

To place it into perspective, that's all a struggling singer wants, so I wish them both success in their extremely DIFFERENT music genres.That said...Free Yourself is great debut. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this CD. I think \\"Truth Is\\" and \\"B-A-B-Y-M-A-M-A\\" are the best tracks on the album.

How could she glorify young women carelessly having children by anyone with sperm willing to donate it! Granted, I do believe single mothers should be praised... ANY mother should be praised!! But this song is too much! The phrase \\"Baby Mama\\" does enough damage... now there's a song, by a young woman who can create soooo much better music than that.

She was great on AI, so I was looking forward to this album.

Go and pick up any R&B; album, and that is what you get on 'Free Yourself'. Only this cd is worse.And talk about overdoing something. 'Summertime' was good the first SEVENTEEN times she performed it on the show. Now it's on her single, AND her album. Let it go.The only remotely good song on this album is \\"Truth Is.\\" That's why it was chosen as a single.

All of her songs are very plain, express no talent at all, and no form of \\"music.\\" It was a terrible album. Hopefully Fantasia grabs a sense of taste on her sophomore album. The day I got this album I returned it... it was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana was better. If i could i would give it 1.7 stars.","review":"There are only about 3 or 4 songs i like on here. On AI when she sang she sounded like she had pipes up her nose she sounde too nasily. On this cd it is the same story. If you liked her than this is a good cd for you.

OF COURSE YOU CAN STILL HEAR THE GOSPEL SIDE OF HER AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING AWAY ANY TIME SOON BUT SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE. SHE PUT HER HEART AND SOUL INTO EACH SONG. I REMEMBER SEEING HER ON AMERICA'S IDOL AND SHE WAS SUCH A JOY TO WATCH. I'D WOULD CLOSE MY EYES AND JUST LISTEN TO HER SING, THERE'S SUCH A ANNOINTING OVER THIS YOUNGLADY THAT IN THE FUTURE, SHE HAS TO DO A GOSPEL ALBUM. I BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS HIS HANDS ON THIS GIFTED YOUNGLADY I JUST HOPE AND PRAY THAT SHE DOESN'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE GAME. I'M NOT FINISHED LISTENING TO THE CD YET BUT SO FAR SO GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasia's Album is a must have Cd! Don't Miss out !","review":"I must say that fantasia has arrived. Each song fit her to a tee. From the beginning to the end Fantasia brought nothing but heat thru out the whole album. I could go on about what I liked about each track but I am just going to tell you that each song, fantasia brought herself and noone else. Her emotion that she puts into the songs are just that Her emotion. That is something only she could do. My Favorite(personal) tracks are tracks 1,2,3,4,7,9 and 12. To be honest I might as well picked them all.That is just the type of voice she has. Trust me Free Yourself from all the negative opinons of what some people have been saying about the album. She did a wonderful job and she will have a wonderful future in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasia is FANTABULOUS!!","review":"Simon was right when he sayed that \\"Fantasia is the best IDOL performer in any IDOL competition\\". She has already proven that to America. I'm sure that has to hurt Mr. Clay Aiken really bad since he often comes off cocky and arrogant in most interviews feeling as though he is the most important of them all, and he didn't even win haha. Fantasia has a career that will last a lifetime. Great CD debut to match her wonderful personality and outstanding vocal ability. A must have. GO FANTASIA WHOOO HOOO!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt know the chipmunks won American Idol","review":"Although the music porition of the cd has potential, the singer has a horrible voice. I am surprised not more people have noted that she sounds like a chipmunk. Like past AI winners, this is a sore loser in the end. Bleh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not without it's charm.","review":"I actually gave this recording two stars, yet that is after much thought.What bothers me about this record is that Clive Davis is spending time and effort to produce Ms. Barrino yet his ignores the timeless talents of Miss Diana Ross.While it is fine to help up the ladder new \\"talent\\", Davis has overlooked that the world is waiting for Miss Ross to re-appear rise again as the great superstar that she is.Barrino gives a fine effort on this CD. My main reason for not rating this higher that a \\"2\\" is due to the song \\"Baby Mama\\". This is not a song that should be celebrated. Is it now that un-married mothers to be looked up to? If Barrino hopes to one day reach the status near Miss Ross, she should think twice about recording such material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying screeching cat impersonations","review":"Fantasia has an okay voice, but she ruins it by screeching. No, it is not artistic, it is plain annoying, and she is just vying for attention. The songs are boring, and plain stupid tunes. The tune of baby mama is so dumb, i think it needs to be educated, the song i mean. I hate hate hate this album. I returned my one five days after i bought it. hahahahahahaha. I hate this style of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh no thank you","review":"i didn't enjoy fantasia on american idol... i just couldn't stand her voice... which is funny because everyone compares her to macy gray and i love her... i decided to give her a listen though and see what a recording studio could do with her... after one play through i traded the cd in... it's terrible... it's more hip hop than anything else... baby mama is a laughable piece of garbage... this album certainly isn't anything i'd let the kids who watched american idol listen to... it'll be interesting to see if she's still around when the american idol crazy has ended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Fantasia's talent, under all the background singers?","review":"I'm a big american idol person, I watch it when it's on, and if I can't, I'll tape it.I was a fan of fantasia's singing while she was on the show, and i even voted for her.That's when she SHOWED her TALENT.I didn't even buy it, I listened to a few sample songs and I was like\\"Where is Fantasia's talent?\\"she is mostly squeezed in with a bunch of background singers, and she is better at singing with a louder, more active voice than doing slower songs.Sorry fantasia, but I'll have to pass this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad.","review":"This is nothing like the Fantasia you saw on American Idol. Here her voice is overprocessed beyond recognition, and the tracks themselves are repetitive and boring. The worst of the lot is \\"Baby Mama,\\" which has some awful lyrics such as \\"B-A-B-Y-M-A-M-A\\" (each letter spelled out) \\"this goes out to all my baby mamas, this goes out to all my baby mamas\\" and \\"today it is a badge of honor to be a baby mama.\\" Other songs are not much better either.Save your money and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st Album More Than an Honorable Mention","review":"I got the CD and had to listen to it maybe twice before I began to appreciate fullness and realness (not to mention nice melody) of many of the songs. Music is like that with me; can't appreciate it on just one sample. I can listen to all the songs, but have a tendency to skip to: TRUTH IS (wish they would play more of the others on the radio), GOOD LOVIN(Oh man, My FAV! what a sweet, classic retro, on-vinyl-like sound. A lot of old-hats will enjoy this one). BABY MAMA, YOU CAN CALL ME SELFISH If U Want 2. Her 1st Album already has a seasoned, veteran sound (maybe with all the veteran contributors and collabs). It's her unique, not carbon-copied or cookie-cutter vocals that really set her apart and makes her work appealing. Some people critize her sound, but a lot of artist including Patty LaBelle, Denise Williams, Erykah Badu and Macy Gray work those eccentric sounding voices into heart-touching pieces of musical art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure soul and flava","review":"I love her CD, IT'S THE BOMB! I was completely shocked at how pure and real her debute album was because it was not what I expected from an AI winner.

With her being on American Idol, I expected like a pop feel. But she delivers with soulful R&B; and hip-hop. The CD also gives us some of her life story (her being a mother, her life on the streets), wanting us to learn more and more about Fantasia. I certainly hope this is not the last I hear from this extraordinary woman.Song Highlights:Truth Is, I Ain't Gon' Beg You, Free Yourself, Good Lovin, This Is Me, It's All Good"},{"rating":"2","title":"F-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c !","review":"Fantasia's cd \\"Free Yourself\\" does not disappoint. This album is jamming! Fantasia sings every track with so much passion and emotion that you can feel she put her all into each song, whether it is slow and jazzy to fast and bumping. Each song tells a story, and I know that Fantasia can actually relate to what she is singing, which is why each song is so heart-felt. \\"Free Yourself\\" is a true r&b album that you can groove to and get inspiration from at the same time. Fantasia has true staying-power in the music industry, and this cd definitely shows that she will be around for many years to come. She is a true artist with the talent of artists like Aretha Franklin, Patti Labelle, Mary J. Blige, and Tina Turner. This album is one of the best, so \\"free yourself\\" and go buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"FANTASIA HAS DONE HER THING WITH THIS CD, THE CD IS VERY SOULFUL AND A GOOD LISTEN TO.FANTASIA PUT HER HEART INTO EACH SONG.THIS IS A CD THAT CAN BE PLAYED TRACK FOR TRACK.I JUST CANT UNDERSTAND THOSE WHO CLAIM THAT THEY ARE DISAPPOINTED IN THE CD.

She has a combination of songs from Pop to Jazz to Dance to R&B. The song combinations were very well put together and displayed Fantasia's vocal ability quite well. To compliment the CD even more, she has the best of the best in the music industry who contributed to her CD. The CD is a must buy, and will do down in history as one of the best. My favorite song from the CD today is Selfish and everyday is Summertime. The best thing I like about the CD is that you can listen to it while you are cleaning the house, cooking dinner, driving in your car, or just relaxing because it can relate to any and every person. I am looking forward to her next CD already."},{"rating":"2","title":"My God What Pipes","review":"I was thumbing thru my tv last night and I saw this lady in red belting out a song with an amazing raspy voice.

I am looking for wonderful things for Miss Fantasia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What do people see??","review":"Fantasia does have personality, and stage presense. That's pretty much it. Her cd is mediocre, nothing compared to Kelly Clarkson, or Clay Aikens. She has appeal in her personality, but her voice is much less than to be desired. She is screaming her head off, and will not have a voice when she is older, probably as a result of vocal nodes. People have compared her to Whitney...she is NO Whitnney houston. I enjoy watching Fantasia on stage, but on cd the effect of her stage presense is lost by her constant screaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her Voice Is Reeeeealy Irritating To Me...","review":"....with no disrepect to her truest fans and her American Idol followers, I'd rather not listen to her. I'd prefer Clarkson, Aiken, hell, even Rueben than Fantasia, any ole day: their vocal tones appeal to my aged ears better. But, I give props to her for having gone through what she has to get her record out...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't wait until her next cd","review":"I am aware that the AI winner doesn't have that much control over what goes on their first cd. I hope this is why \\"Free Yourself\\" is a \\"blah\\" cd. I love Fantasia. And would vote for her again, but this cd doesn't show the real Fantasia. Just like \\"Soulful\\" didn't show the real Ruben. Maybe it is because Clive produced both. Either way, I hope Fantasia, like Ruben, makes up for it and comes out swing in her sophmore cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season 3 Fantasia Supporter","review":"Didn't care for the song choices.

Fantasia your going to be a star. Mary J. Blige, and the rest of the so called divas, move over, there is a new star in town. I love Fantasia voice. It something different and unique.

However I was hesitant to purchase her album. And then I heard the single \\"Truth Is\\". I absolutely love that song and every time I hear it, it takes back in time. I am very proud of her and wish her much success.On a side note, I am ashamed at Amazon for displaying some of the postings. Just by reading some of them it is obvious that the rater is simply ranting and did not purchase the album. I don't normally write reviews but felt compelled to do so.

I was worried that her post-idol success would be limited. I was a huge Ruben Studdard fan, but was very disappointed in his debut CD. I thought they could have gotten Ruben some much better producers and some much better songs (better suited for his voice and style). But, Fantasia got great producers, great songs, great lyrics - the whole nine yards!! I just love the song, \\"Truth Is\\" and I totally feel her on \\"Free Yourself.\\" I recommended this CD to all my friends and I hope Fantasia gets herself into heavy rotation (radio and video) and grabs an AMA or Grammy next year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied w/ Fantasia","review":"Let me start off by saying that everyone has an opinion. So those reading the negative reviews just borrow a copy and judge for yourself!Now, I would have to say that we all have to remember that Miss Fantasia is new to the music industry so she has to conform to the industries desires of her first album. Once she gets her foot firmly placed she can call some shots later on her second album.I have heard of the negative responses to track 6 \\"Baby Mama\\" song. However, you have to be in the struggle to appreciate its meaning. I have a 9 year old that loves that song and I think have gained a better sense of appreciation because of the \\"hook.\\"I like her cd and I am pleased with its end product.If Miss Fantasia is reading this I will simply say \\"Thank You.\\"As well as encouraging you to continue in being true to yourself!What matters most is how you see yourself.Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Debut Album from Fantasia","review":"I live in the UK, and the album didnt get released until today (Nov 29) - couldn't wait that long so I ordered it from the states - it arrived TODAYAbsolutely fantastic - I'm absolutely loving every song on the CD - personal favorite for now has to be \\"Truth is\\" - simple lyrics, beautiful delivery - The album doesn't do her enough justice though. Was able to watch her live performances over the internet (Jay Leno & Ellen Degeneres shows') - fantastic !! The studio versions of \\"Truth is\\" and \\"I Believe\\" pale into insignificance when compared to the live versionsBut in all - a wonderful debut for a fantastic singer and performer - God Bless you Fantasia.You've got a load of fans in the UK - who all stayed up late a day after the show in the states (AI3 was showed a day later in the UK) to watch you crowned as AI3 - and we look forward to seeing you in the UK soondont think about buying this CD - just go and get it !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfull first offering","review":"what a wonderfull cd it has something for everyone , Good Lovin reminds you of old school basement party's , free yourself and truth is both have a jazzy feel to it,selfish let's you get your party on every song is good and then you have your classic's summertime and a new updated always on my mind will make you forget all about willie."},{"rating":"2","title":"emp","review":"I love the whole cd...

This is the Best C.D From an American Idol winner yet!!!!!! Her vocals, and her background add-libs just take to of, off earth and into your own zone far from stress. This is a must C.D To add to your collection. This is a very stong debut for Fantasia and she will make history just watch and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"To purchase or not to purchase...","review":"Before I purchase a cd, I find using the music samples and reading the reviews (with a pinch of salt) can be helpful. Fantasia's voice gives me chills & I think she deserves the chance to pursue her success, however someone is not handling her career with care. Again, I have not even bought the cd yet, but after tasting just the samples, well, I also thought to myself, \\"It sounds like all the rest of the cookie cutter R&B sound... And that cd cover??!!\\" I hope no one judges Fantasia based on this cd because she really is gifted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope she can swim","review":"I think the ship has sunk!

I never liked her in the first place! Her voice is just really hi-pitched and very squeky!!!!!!! This is definatly the worst album ever! What is with her pose on the front of the CD? It looks like she is taking a HUGE breath. I can't believe that this is what American Idol is like. This is very disappionting because this no-talent at all singer made millions, and other singers who aren't discovered yet but could actually be biger than Britney or J Lo, have no chance whatsoever. I can't believe this. It's a DISGRACE!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasia: What were you thinking?","review":"I am a HUGE Fantasia fan, at least I thought I was. After American Idol ended, I missed seeing and hearing her so much. Then, we had to endure the six-month wait for her CD \\"Free Yourself\\". After much anticipation I received what I thought was going to be a wonderful experience. Instead I was shocked speechless! Of course, I LOVED the cuts: \\"Summertime\\", \\"Always On My Mind\\" and \\"I Believe\\". But I was not prepared for the other ten HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE cuts of what I will loosely call \\"music\\". Fantasia: What were you thinking when you allowed yourself to record this slop!? Don't you have any self-respect at all? I'm so disappointed in not only you, but in Clive Davis and Missy Elliot. Great music has the ring of greatness in it and the 10 cuts of \\"music\\" I'm referring to only have the ring of mediocrity at best. I hope this album doesn't ruin your career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I bought this cd the day it came out because I was a huge Fantasia fan on AI. I gave it away the day after I heard it. The cd didn't come close to her performance on Idol. That Baby Mama song was dreadful. That whole pop/Beyonce-wannabe lyrics just didn't fit her voice or her style. She honestly should have stuck closer to the jass/blues genre. I wish her luck with her Broadway show and subsequent albums and performances, but honestly if this is an indicator than she's definitely off my playlist. I was highly disappointed with this dreadful cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Album!","review":"For the past 5yrs I've been a big fan of independent artists and that's why I started watching American Idol! Well here comes along a most amazing individual by the name of Fantasia on last year's Idol show and the first time I heard her I knew she would get the heart of the American Public! I have purchased her Free Yourself cd and play it all the time! Excellent Vocals and terrific songs! She does such an amazing job! Simply AWESOME! also a personal note: Fantasia don't ever loose your sweetness! I believe that's one of your qualities that will take you far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got To Be Kidding!!","review":"Once again, the creators of American Idol have taken the winner and turned their unique stylings into the same old, same old. I can't believe how incredibly disappointed I was in this CD. Other than the trademark screeching that Fantasia usually resorts to at the end of her songs, you can't tell this is the same girl who wowed me during American Idol.Even the version of \\"Summertime\\" that's on this album doesn't begin to compare with the soulful version that Fantasia did on the actual show.If you want to purchase this album for \\"I Believe\\"...or to try to further this girl's career...go for it. But if you're expecting to hear the same wonderful voice you heard on TV...FORGET IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wished I liked it better","review":"Loved Fantasia on AI3. Also liked single. I only liked 2 songs on this CD. Kind of like I felt about Ruben, wished his CD was more like the soul he showed on AI.

It captured the uniqueness of her voice. \\"What are you doing\\" is especially amazing. If you don't like her tone, don't get the album. You'd be wasting your money. People still either like her or hate her. But if you like her tone, then if your going to get 1 CD this should be it. It has an R&B Neo-soul vibe that is pretty cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Star","review":"I thought Fantasia was awesome on American Idol, but I was not expecting this! She truely is a star with an impeccable voice. She bares her soul and lets her voice be heard. If you haven't watched American Idol before, let this be the first person you listen to because this girl is phenomenal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am really disappointed","review":"Fantasia has so much talent and stage presence, imo, and she is from my area. She even came to a Halloween party a couple years ago, and she put some vocals into some mixed music for us, but, this effort makes me sad. I am not sure who guided her, or allowed her, or forced her to sing these songs, but, the word that comes to me is ghetto. She is so much more than all that on the album. Come one girl, do it right. If you do not have any artistic control, then stop because in my opinion, you have made a really bad album, and the songs are just so beneath you. I truly love this performer and I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Baby MaMa","review":"My favorite on this album Baby Mama...This is going to climb the charts and be number one very soon...it is off the chain!!!!

At first, I didnt' think some of the songs would capture her gifted vocal ability... but now listening to the finished product... this is a fantastic cd. My favorite is \\"Always on my mind.\\" This song shows Fantasia's incredible vocal range, her ability to adlib and bring a song to life. I enjoy the upbeat sounds of \\"Baby Mama,\\" and \\"Selfish.\\" This cd has something for everyone. I highly recommend this cd for music lovers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks For Keeping Your Promise!!!!!","review":"I just don't know where to start! Fantasia said at the end of the competition that she wanted to make a cd for everyone and that's just what she did. I was an avid Fantasia fan during the competition and I was praying that her cd would properly showcase her extraordinary talent and this cd does. I play the entire cd without skipping any songs. I haven't brought a cd this good in a long while.I just have to mention that Always On My Mind HAS to become a single because that is the sweetest, softest, most powerful song on the cd (other then I Believe). It just touches my heart! While every song on the cd has hit making potential this song has the ability to appeal to those old and young, country lovers and r&b; lovers. EVERYONE!Thank You Fantasia for letting us into your world:) Keeping doing what your doing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"It took so long for Fantasia to release her album.

Either you like that genre or you don't. This album was made for a limited demographic community and has zero appeal to people outside that genre. It also sounds the same as all the other female vocalists of that genre. No use of her talent - no stretch of her range.

Barino is a weak imitation of PHILLIPS right now, but with proper material and a real and sensitive small band behind her, she could match PHILLIP's excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Okay, Fantasia has a really really good voice and I kinda liked the songs on the CD. There is one thing that bugged me though:1. The cover. It's not that I didn't like her fur coat (actually I didn't) but the fact that it is OPEN and totally exposing her chest. Fantasia did not dress like that on American Idol. Kids UNDER 10 watched the show. I don't think they need images like that. Neither do I, being under 13.The songs, to me, were not like Idol. I liked Idol much better.In conclusion, SUPPORT DIANA DEGARMO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get past Baby Mama","review":"I am sorry but I could not get past the Baby Mama song. Unlike some of the other complaints it does not bother me if people are single moms or had a child out of wedlock. The whole \\"baby mama\\" stuff is just so played out and ignorant sounding. There must have been a more classy way for her to get her story across and empower moms. She has a great voice but this song was beneath her, it ruined it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring, dreadful songs on one CD","review":"Sure, Fantasia won AI3, but all the songs on this CD suck!!! I have yet to find a song on here that is listenable. And, the fact that RCA DUMPED HER!!! She had to go work with J Records to make her album. Gee, wonder why RCA dumped her??? (go to the first sentence to find out)"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic!","review":"Fantasia shows on this cd why she is the reigning queen. Her voice is electrifying and beautiful. Congratulations Queen Fantasia, I am bowing at your feet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must, must have!!!!","review":"There's lot of talent out there, but now can bring to the table what Fantasia have. I have some pics and choses about alot of singers, but none have touch my soul like Fantasia have. This girl sings with so much soul and heart. She has such a power to her voice that makes your face frown and you just have to say dam she is awesome. Every song on her album is beautiful you can fill she put everything into this album. You would not be disappointed buy buying it, this album is out of this world. Fantasia #1 fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Girl I'm happy for you.","review":"I really liked Fantasia during American Idol and I cried with her when she won. She will be one of very few that will make a great impact on the music industry, because this is her dream ans it wasn't handed to her. Not only that, but she really wanted this and it showed. After hearing her perform \\"I believe\\" on AI I couldn't wait to hear her CD, and the day it came out I purchased it and I'm glad I did. This is one of very few CD's that I can just pop in and listen to the entire CD without forwarding through any of the tracks. I am so happy for her and I wish her the best of luck and much success.Go Girl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Created Like a Veteran in The Business","review":"To listen to this cd, you would not know that this was Fantasia's first project. The songs are wonderfully written, song and composed from the beginning of the cd to the end. This cd is truly a must have for any R&B collection. Fantasia really has something to say on this cd. All of the aspects within the emotional roller coaster of love were written about. And of course; Fantasia's voice really adds life to the stories. This cd is pretty doggone wonderful! If you love great R&B music that has something to say, this cd will be one of your favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is a professional CD!","review":"Talk about being impressed. This is total Urban Neo-Soul at it's best. I'm making a big prediction right now. Fantasia will be the first Grammy winner from American Idol in the category of Urban Alternative . Mary J and Erykah B need to watch out cause Miss Fantasia out does them both on this CD. She's definitely no bubble gum pop princess and thank god for that. American Idol celebrates many styles of music and this last year they definitely got it right. This is a true musical artist with her own distinct sound. Way to go Fantasia."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give Free Yourself a 10 if I could!","review":"Just like Fantasia's personality and style, this CD is absolutely awesome! Fantasia is extremely talented and I'm excited about watching her career blossom. She's my new Mary J. I love every song, but my favorites are \\"Ain't Gon' Beg You,\\" \\"Free Yourself,\\" \\"Summertime\\" (which gives me chills everytime I hear it), \\"Baby Mama,\\" \\"Got Me Waiting,\\" and \\"This Is Me.\\" This is the best debut album I've heard in a long time. I can't wait for her to tour (without the rest of the AI3 group). She is a beautiful young lady (with sharp hairstyles, might I add) and she deserves this. This CD is worth every penny. Go 'Tasia!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Fantasia, but not her debut","review":"Fantasia showed talent on American Idol but I find her voice very raspy and screechy on this....it is kind of annoying. I was a fan of her on American Idol so I thought I would give it a try, but it's not great. Another bad thing....the picture is terrible.I gave it 2 stars because I like Fantasia and her personality is wonderful, but as for the CD....sorry Fantasia. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the REAL Fantasia?","review":"Let me just start by saying that I think this is a pretty good release, especially for her first one. However, I want to know what happened to the REAL Fantasia? After watching her on every show of American Idol, I came to know the wild, in your face, almost Aretha Franklin like quality that Fantasia has. That's what I wanted more of on this CD. This CD is now going in my collection as something to play during a quiet dinner party with my parents. I wanted to hear more life, more energy, more of that Fantasia personality. I'm disappointed that this would be the release she picked to be her \\"coming out\\" CD.Please next time, MORE LIFE, MORE FANTASIA!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Free yourself---from this album","review":"Fantasia can sing but she can't sing any old thing. Shame on her producers who must have told her to sing as hard and loud as she can. The title track starts off fine but flops when she does all that hoarse ad libbing. And \\"Baby Mama\\"--don't get me started on that one, bad singing and subject matter (whatever happened to promoting family values?). The rest of the songs also suffer from questionable singing and tired lyrics. Who on earth is giving this five stars? American Idol fans or Fantasia herself?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful CD","review":"After hearing several songs on the radio, I finally purchased Fantasia's album. I really like it a lot. I can listen to it over and over again without issue. I would surely recommend it as a great CD everyone can enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing debut from an outstanding performer","review":"After being enthralled with Fantasia's outstanding performances on American Idol, I had high hopes for her debut album. Her TV performances were marked by originality, authenticity and her incredible voice. The CD on the hand suffers from over-production and too much polish that makes so many tracks sound like too many other artists whose names you can't quite remember. What's with the overpowering backing vocals? The live rendition of \\"Summertime\\" for example was breathtaking, the studio rendition on \\"Free Yourself\\" just sounds like the best take of a so-so bunch. The single \\"I Believe\\" really shows what Fantasia is all about, but still suffers from over production.All in all, a very disappointing debut from a performer that has so much more to offer. I look forward to her second album with enthusiasm hoping that a production team with as much talent and originality as Fantasia herself are involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"WOW...... I love Fantasia, BUT..... This C.D. was notAs good as when she sang live. What happened? Even\\"Summertime\\" which made me know she was the BEST....On CDwas fast and not soulful.Where did the soulful, haunting Ladygo? I don't think I would have even gave it as gifts andsang her praises if I knew how just everyday it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"good talent, poor song selection","review":"Fantasia has a beautiful voice-why does she concede to this type of repetitive rap style mess. She needs to showcase her voice, she has such a natural talent, she doesn't need to do all this horrible screeching to be noticed. Sorry lady, you can do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really A GOOD CD","review":"Fantasia really surprised me with this cd. I was expecting a pop kind of cd and it was nothing like that. This was real R&B; music. Fantasia really has a beautiful voice and on this album you can really hear it.My favorite songs are Free Yourself, Truth Is, It's All Good, Don't Act Right, this is me, baby mama.But the bad and only song i dont like is the Jermaine Durpi produced song Got Me Waiting mainly because its a recycled Usher beat/song \\"U Got It Bad\\"Other than that.....Go Miss Fanastia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I CANT GET OVER THE TALENT OF THIS YOUNG LADY!","review":"Always on my mind is a wonderfully sung song that only ice the cake of this excellent cd. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated \\"singer\\" in the world","review":"I'd give this album a zero if that were available. This girl simply can't sing! She has zero voice quality, zero personality, and zero star value. She's so painful to listen to. Her voice is so squeaky, you'd think she's a cat in heat. It's worse watching her on TV, though. Her performance style is very ugly, and her interviews reveal how shallow she is. And this is supposed to be OUR idol??? I'm ashamed to be called American!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm really dissapointed","review":"This entire CD (besides Summertime, and Always on My Mind) is jumbled, pointless, pitchy, boring, forgettable, typical mismash. I'm really dissapointed in Fantasia for making an album like this. All of the songs sound exactly the same, like one extremely long song. I hope that Fantasia realizes that this isn't her style of music. Sorry Tasia, this just didn't work for me. Buy Diana DeGarmo's BLUE SKIES instead, she has amazing tallent! It's well worth your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT PIPES, ZERO PERSONALITY","review":"Like most of the other \\"American Idol\\" graduates, Fantasia hasa very good voice, and knows how to use it. Or should I sayOVERuse it. I'll admit she's better than most of the others,but you really do get the feeling that these kids go into thestudio with no clue as to what they want to say, and that theyare PRODUCED down to the last melisma. I may be wrong, but thatis the impression you come away with. I wish her luck, she'syoung and has her whole life to learn how to sing a SONG, asopposed to HITTING THE RIGHT NOTES. Fantasia, you ARE talented;now go use that talent in a compelling way!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon should create zero star option!","review":"Squeeky idol screeches throughout this album. Just get your cat to \\"sing\\" to you -- I assure you the sound is going to be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand","review":"I just don't understand why some people insist they enjoy her screeching. And I can't believe how many people insult Aretha Franklin by comparing this screechy idol to her. She doesn't have even an ounce of the talent and class Aretha has. I only gave this a 2, because people always claim you must not have listened to it if you give a 1. Well, I work with someone who threw away her hard earned money to buy this crappy album, and I have been forced to listen to the screeching and caterwauling. Just awful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This cd is a solid effort for Fanatasia. It is a good r&b album. The only thing that I found lacking was an element of surprise. I thought that she would experiment a little. The album is strictly rhythm and blues. Otherwise, it is well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I really did want to like this. Somehow, the power she brought to the Idol stage was lost on this CD. It was just too much of her screaming over background vocals for my ears. I still love to watch her perform. Maybe she's destined to be better in performance than on record. I think the same could be said of some of Tina Turner's music. So that's a compliment really - I just didn't like the CD. Honestly, after five or six listenings, I couldn't even hum one of the tunes (except of course \\"Always on My Mind\\" & \\"Summertime\\" - and did we really need another copy of \\"I Believe\\"?) Then there's the ultimate sin -- the songs on the label are in the wrong order! Really irks me when that kind of unprofessional crap happens! Track number 9 through 12 are listed wrong. C'mon girl - get somebody lookin' out for ya'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start to a Promising Career!!!!!!!!","review":"Overall this is a very good cd amazing voice love the inside picture just the beginning to something to watch out for.....First three songs are Tight...Way better than a lot of stuff out there today."},{"rating":"2","title":"She sings from the Soul","review":"This is an artist who reaches deep within herself to feel the words that she sings. She is able to emotionally connect with the audience in such a way that I have never seen with any other performer. Her album has a wide variety of diverse music, and I would strongly recomend it to anyone who enjoys any type of music: there is something for you on this album. Don't miss out, you gotta hear this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut","review":"Fantastia Burrino won the third season of American Idol. My husband and I watched her from auditions to the finale. She won Simon's admiration and ours. Fantasia has a unique voice unlike any other singer. She is loaded with energy and confidence. A young single mother, she is an inspiration to young people. She honors all single mothers with the track \\"Baby Mama.\\"One thing I was surprised and slightly disappointed was that none of the tracks bounce with infectious pop that you can dance to. Free Yourself is all slow, reflective R & B. It's excellent - but I would have liked to have seen some of the versatility Fantasia displayed during the show's run. Another disappointment was the track \\"Summertime.\\" When we saw her sing it on TV, we felt floored, and truly blessed. My husband said it was the best musical performance he had ever seen. But on the CD, she does not sing it slow and easy. It is stressful to listen to her as she is all over the musical scales on this song."},{"rating":"1","title":"just to prove a point. Barrino vs. DeGarmo is OVER","review":"i was gonna give Fantasia 3 stars but since somebody insisted on comparing Diana to Jenny Craig then i insisted that i must lower Fantasias rating 1 star. You are only hurting Fantasia by writing a five star review for her and a one star for Diana; people aren't stupid and nobody takes you seriously. Next time you're gonna bash; try to stop yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even if it was free~~~","review":"If you gave me this CD I would throw it away---I have listened to clips here and can't stand any of the songs. Then I saw her on AI last night and ohmygosh---she was sooo bad with her screaming and yeah yeah yeahs. I cannot help but wonder how she ever won. This CD does not have even one good song, I would not even give her one star if possible. Save your money or buy Clay Aikens CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flash in the Pan","review":"The fact that there are already 71 used CDs available for sale on Amazon--fairly soon after its release--should be a pretty good indication of the quality of this CD. I never thought Fantasia could sing well. Yes, she CAN carry a tune. The problem is, she sounds like she is singing through her nose. Every time I hear a song by her, I feel like sending her some Kleenex to clear out those nasal passages. I could not imagine listening to an entire CD of that voice.The fact that I have not heard ANYTHING on the radio by Fantasia (thank God)--yet Kelly Clarkson is ALL OVER the radio, is another indication of who has truly earned the title of American Idol. When Fantasia won--as with Ruben--I predicted that they would have (maybe) one hit and then fade to black. Thus far, the post-Kelly AI winners have done just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"FREE YOURSELF from this mess.","review":"This chick cant sing! How on Earth did she make it on American Idol? I thought this was supposed to be the BEST in America?! If anyone was good from Season III it was Jennifer Hudson. Fantasia is not sexy and last time I checked had a child--19 year old mother? I thought this was American IDOL? Id think more people would be outraged. I could understand if she was graduated or in college, but she is not. As for the album...dont even get me started. At least work with people like Rodney Jerkins who make people who cant sing sound good (cough cough, J LO, cough cough)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"This album and this artist should never be heard. There were sooo many more talented people on American Idol when she won. This album is a perfect example of that. All the studio effects in the world can't help this over-rated, so-called singer. You can't make chicken salad out of chicken s$%^."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Voice Busts All Ear Drums!","review":"I've listend to the Cd and it was worse than expexted! Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad! Her voice is okay, but she doesn't sing, she screams! Thats what I hate about her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Girl Can't Sing!","review":"This is the worst person to win from American Idol. I can't believe all the people who actually like to hear a duck sing. When the judges compared her to Aretha Franklin, I thought I was going to be sick! Aretha Franklin can sing, Fantasia just screams!There is not a good song on this cd. Don't waste your money! Diana Degarmo, Kimberley Locke, Clay Aiken, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, and Bo Bice are much better singers. They actually have talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit the snooze button","review":"The album isn't bad, but it is way short of being good either. This collection is just plain monotonous, and is EXACTLY what I expected from last seasons AI winner. Her voice is good, but way too nasaly, and this album gets very irritating after a couple of plays. Baby Mama has got to be the low point of the album. The subject has been done to death over the last decade and blows this album's credibilty wide open. Perhaps a second album from Fantasia will have a more varied appeal. Will the public buy a second after this disappointing first? Once bitten, twice shy. Fortunately I borrowed the album and was able to hand it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I really loved Fantasia's single CD with those 3 tunes. What a voice! She can do so much with it. Unfortunately, this CD was very disappointing.....very generic...what a waste of a voice. I was SO looking forward to buying her first CD. I was hoping she'd do more blues/R&B/Soul/Jazz.....but no, it's just plain pop....sounds like everyone else....maybe the next CD will be better and show off her voice more.....I'll keep my hopes up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Fantasia won American Idol, but this CD will make you wonder why. The only good song on the album is \\"Truth Is\\"; all the other songs are screechy and soon get on your nerves. I would recommend Diana DeGarmo as an alternative, but to each his own. I hope that Fantasia's next CD is better than this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big Disappointment!","review":"This was a very big disappointment, i expected more but she sounded like donald duck on helium on every song. don't waist all of your money on this Cd! Instead, buy either Kelly Clarkson's album or Diana DeGarmo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointing.","review":"What can I say? This CD is a complete let down from what I was expecting. The Fantasia that sings on this CD is not the same Fantasia that I voted for and loved on American Idol. The only song that Fantasia's bubbly personality shines through on is \\"Baby Mama,\\" and that song is cheesy, at best. Even the song that Missy Elliot wrote for Fantasia isn't all that great, either.My fear is that Fantasia is going to go along the same wayside that Reuben is currently residing in. If Fantasia doesn't up the ante with her sophomore release (if she makes it that far), I don't think she'll have the staying power that, say, Kelly and Clay have.Borrow this CD from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO SINGING ABILITY AT ALL !!!","review":"FORGET THE WHOLE SOBBY STORY THAT SHE IS A SINGLE HIGH SCHOOL DROP OUT MOTHER...NOONE IS TO BLAME BUT HER...SHE WASN'T A CHILD WHEN IT HAPPENED SO DEAL WITH IT...THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL SORRY FOR HER AND TRY TO LIKE HER VOICE...IT IS A TERRIBLE SCREAMING SOUND...THE CD IS A RIP OFF OF A CLEANER VERSION OF MISSY ELLIOT...MISSY ELLIOT IS ALWAYS IN THE BACKGROUND VOCALS...SHE SINGS BETTER THAN FANTASIA!!!SHE IS NO AMERICAN IDOL...THE SONGS ARE TERRIBLE...JUST PLAIN BORING...SHE IS NOT THE NEXT MARIAH IN SINGING...AND NOT THE NEXT CIARA IN HIP HOP!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful beginnings","review":"I am so happy that final a person that deserves the best got the best.

They did not short change her on the cd.Her voice is orginal, therefore the songs were written just for her. No one else could sing them the same.I fully enjoyed the album minus track number 11.Please do not burn copies of her cd for people. This cd (and her) deserve the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasia is the Princess of Soul","review":"All I can say is that this CD is incredible. There is something on this album for everyone from Ballads to Hip Hop and everything in between. Fantasia's remarkable spirit and incredible vocals shine through on every song. This album is going straight to the top of the charts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paddle boats don't go","review":"My Dad used to make these for me, and they moved great. These boats are not engineered right. They are too heavy, the boats sit too low in the water, the paddles are not big enough to propel the boat, and there is not enough clearance to wind the rubber band tight enough for a good ride.

If the rating allows me to give 0, I would. But the lowest I can give is 1. In the product description, it says 216 capsules (2 pack). I thought it meant 2 bottles each containing 216, but actually the total number of capsules in the 2 bottles is 216. Based on this, the price of the product is more than 50% more expensive than the same brand with different packaging.Although I realized the error within 1 hour of my ordering, I was not allowed to cancel my order and it took the selling company several days to reply to my request about their items. I have been pretty satisfied with shopping on amazon.com so far. This is the first time I felt upset. Amazon.com should be wiser not to list products from such misleading sellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Hose","review":"This hose is a great improvement over the stiff, kinky, too short, 1 1/4\\" hose that came with my shop vac. It's a bigger inside diameter and suction is much improved. I also like the claw tool and large crevise tool.I am only giving it four stars because I regret not just getting the Mr. Nozzle 30 dollar kit (100n, I think), which includes only the hose and above mentioned attachments. I was lured into getting this deluxe kit by the extra 3 feet of hose and extra attachments, but for the most part the extra attachments just duplicate what I already had. I know this is my bad, not the company's, but unless you specifically need the normal shop vac attachments, save youself 20 dollars and get the smaller kit. You could put the amount you saved toward getting the 12' additional extension hose and never have to roll your vac again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good kit","review":"I recently purchased a Festool CT-33 vacuum/dust extractor to connect with my non-Festool woodworking tools. The Festool cleaning kit was more than double the cost of this kit. I own a Festool hose that came with the vac and a Mr. Nozzle hose. Both hoses are of similar quality.I've read reviews that criticized this kit for \\"non-standardized\\" hose size. I find that humorous. What is a standardized hose or vacuum size? Is it; 4\\", 2 5/8\\", 2 1/2\\", 2 1/4\\", 1 1/2\\", 1 1/4\\" or maybe it's even metric? The beauty of Mr. Nozzle is that they offer a lot of different adapters. While not every option is available with this kit (a lot are) Mr. Nozzle itself provides a lot of choices to meet your needs. It just so happens that the kit that Amazon offers is such a good value that it's often cheaper to buy the kit than to purchase individual pieces from another Mr. Nozzle source."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice hose - rest is a waste","review":"Nice hose. The rest is a waste. I should have paid attn to the other reviews. I have used the hose some but the attachments don't work well together and are not quality. For instance, I was looking for a good floor attachment. This one is short - have to bend over slightly to use, it does not slide well across a wood floor on account of the bristles, and you have to physically hold the hose to the straight tubes while vacuuming. I have put it in the corner for now as it will take some time to rig up some fittings to make everything work together. The floor sweep attachment may be a lost cause. But, like I said, nice hose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step up your shop Vac","review":"Just purchased another kit for my other Shop vac.

Hearing the original music was very interesting and for some reason, I thought the sound was fantastic. The recorded sound is actually not that great: a relatively brittle bass, good dynamic range but not demonstration quality, and all together overly sweet-sounding. I think the LSO plays really well here, and get the feeling they enjoyed playing this original version recorded here for the first time. I love the addition of Butterworth to this disc. Chandos re-released this recording in SACD that presents little additional detail than that released on this standard definition disc. While the original version of the 'London Symphony' is interesting, it is not Vaughn Williams' final take on the music, and as such I prefer recordings of the revised music. For die hard RVW fans, this is a must, but for those intersted in obtaining a great 'London Symphony,' I suggest looking for Previn-LSO."},{"rating":"2","title":"jay Graydon magical production","review":"I used to love this album on vinyl. It's a crime that it has never been released except as an import. This was Dionne's best, most musical album ever. It was always a pleasure to hear how Jay Graydon could create a new vehicle for different artists during this era, e.g. Dionne Warwick, Al Jarreau, Manhattan Transfer. Jay's production values were always apparent, along with lots of tasty playing and kickin' horns. \\"For You,\\" \\"With a Touch\\" and \\"Can't Hide Love\\" are some of my favorites.

Dionne seems to be enjoying herself throughout this project. The musical arrangements are breezy and spare, not overdone. Dionne pairs with Johnny Mathis on two cuts, with the title track in particular, being one of the high points of this CD. You can listen to this CD repeatedly and hear something different each time.

I might have a weird shaped head, but the helmet wobbles a lot while wearing it, and it's incredibly difficult to see out of the eyeholes. The front and back of the helmet are held together with flimsy plastic clips, so the pieces of the helmet don't fit together all that well.On the whole, it served it's purpose as a cheap, last minute Halloween costume...

One great memory in my life is a camping trip in the early 80s up in the Canadian Rockies and slipping into town to see \\"Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\\" Trust me, folks, this CD \\"Halos and Horns\\" is dreadful. I believe it could drive unstable people over the edge. The music is convoluted and Dolly's voice (she sings and 'talks') is competely out of control. She must be taking acid in her old age or something!Since this album is being rated (by 72 people) as above 4 stars, it also leads me to believe that the ratings are not real.

While my system works fine with another Hybrid SACD (Dark Side of the Moon), on this disk there is no use whatsoever of the center, surround, or bass channels in SACD mode. It is recognized by the player as a SACD, but it does not play as one. I am not saying I disagree with the mix, I am saying there is no content on those channels.

Horrible lyrics (\\"hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't\\" Huh?), breathily speaking lyrics in that passe little-girl persona, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious pieces of cornpone ever in \\"These Old Bones,\\" which has to be heard to be believed. Everyone I play it for sits there slack-jawed, unable to believe what they're hearing. Add the heavenly choirs, the heavy arrangements, and some dreadful covers, and you've got one big step backwards to the kind of music with which Parton had stalled. Dolly's gone country again, and if that's what you like, you'll eat this up. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Time Ain't a Charm","review":"Following on the high-heels of THE GRASS IS BLUE and LITTLE SPARROW, Dolly Parton's HALOS AND HORNS is a sad return to the schlocky material and overwrough arrangements that marred most of her recordings from the 1980s and '90s. Parton can be quite a profound writer, but here she opts for cutesy (e.g., \\"Sugar Hill,\\" \\"These Old Bones\\") too often. \\"These Old Bones,\\" which celebrates mountain mystics, just doesn't work. \\"If\\" doesn't deserve to be revived -- nor does the faux-bluegrass reworking succeed. And, although Parton gets an \\"A\\" for effort, the cover of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" fails. One has to wonder why, if she feels compelled to change the arrangement and the lyrics she bothered to cut it at all. The background vocals are way too heavy, and even some of the bluegrass instrumentation is overdone -- sounding less like Bill Monroe and more like Dollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like Dolly, but not Bluegrass","review":"I read early reviews that touted this CD as great bluegrass music.

Quite a refreshing novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny, touching, revelatory","review":"If you want to have some fun reading about and listening to some wonderfully REAL characters, then this is the book for you.

Taking place in the village of Creevagh, this slight book is an example of \\"cute\\" Irish literature, with its silly characters, the expected Irish wake, and the overwhelming authority of the Roman Catholic church; all pushed together to form this superficial look at rural Ireland in the 40's and 50's.

I was very disappointed with this one. Aside from the crucial chase/shooting scene, the book was so dull that I stopped reading it after 84 pages. It is so filled with mind numbing descriptions and conversations that I had to force myself to plow through the dialogue. Being a detective myself, I was also put off by the author's obvious feeling of superiority to cops that seems to permeate his writing. In addition, the author, being a lawyer, talks too much without making a point. I have read other novels written by attorneys and have enjoyed them, so I am not just attorney-bashing here.

There are a few items that are not available compared with the MS suite such as designating certain default configurations to basic programs (i.e., Excel).My only regret so far is that an e-mail program had not been included as part of the package (I much prefer Outlook 2002 over Outlook Express).I am recommending this to my friends and relatives as an economical way of having MS application compatibale programs."},{"rating":"2","title":"In your face, Gates","review":"Personally, I like Microsoft and Bill Gates. I support their efforts as entrepreneurs, and think the government was way off base in their suits. The same applies to the state suits. However, in the competitive spirit of American business, Sun has trumped Microsoft with Star Office. It works as well as MS Office Pro, and for the vast majority of computer users, this is all you need for word processing...and it does a lot more.

I was a MS Office user before trying this out and have been able to transition to this very smoothly. I think the support for MS Office documents is seamless. XML file format, thats the very best, no more tied to proprietary formats, a very powerful move. I have used StarOffice 5.2 and this one's much superior to it in terms of performance. One of the nice change is the ability to launch standalone applications, which was missing in StarOffice 5.2 with its integrated desktop. Also nice is the ability to work with it on a variety of platforms including Linux, Windows and Solaris.

The applications are not user friendly.2. It functions far slower than office.3. If you try to import or export to your friends with MS or Corel apps you will have major problems with the formats.4.

Alright I'm going to talk about the good features, first of all the price is great, so for the money conscious consumer, it's a good purchase. It contains fair enough applications for doing your daily work task from typing documents to creating a worthy enough slide show. It's more easier to learn than the previous version, so it has really improved since the last version. Of course it takes a little bit of time getting accustomed to but eventually you begin to get the hang of it.The applications open indivdually, which is plus, in previous version the applications opened in task pane format. So if you want a simple suite to do simple and complex things it's the suite for you. One other thing the applications are more uniformed, which is why I think Microsoft Office became so popular in the first place. With more ease of use and more improved features, someday this suite might actually be competing against WordPerfect and MS Office"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT \\"fully compatible\\" !!!!","review":"The spec may say fully MS Office compatible, but it's not.

Formatting would be changed or lost virtually every time. Track Changes wouldn't stick. Worst of all, twice my StarOffice documents simply ceased to exist.

The quibbles I read about the time recalculating routes once off a planned route don't seem right - given 30 seconds or so, the machine recalibrates and calculates. Battery life is good, and acquisition and lock on to satellites is also excellent. In a battery saving measure, the backlight is turned off by default - I do hate that, but it is a very small problem.The unit is smaller than I had thought, and very light.

Easy set up, well packaged, and works great with only very minor adjustments to the factory settings. The fence adjustment mechanism isn't very smooth, but I haven't oiled it yet. No big deal though. Other reviewers complained about snipe...I have yet to see snipe and have run at least 100 board ft of wood through this machine. The tables and fence are flat enough to do its intended job, but not dead flat. The outfeed table has a very minor variance, but well within acceptable tolerances for me. I know for some, any measurable tolerance is a problem which is why I mention it. I have been using it on the mobile base with no problems contrary to another review I read also. I highly recommend the Jet. Good machine for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"I had a 4\\" craftsmen jointer for years and decided to upgrade my shop with a 6\\" jointer. Reviewing various models, I decided on the Jet 6CSX. My shop is pretty small and this machine fits well in the spot I had picked out for it.Machine assembly is realtively easy. It is heavy though. Two people needed to carry it down into my shop area, prior to assembly. After realizing how heavy this jointer was, I purchased a HTC mobile base. I highly recommend that a mobile base be used if you have any intent on moving this jointer in your shop.Once it was assembled, set up was very easy. Once turn on, it purred like a kitten, versus the noise that my 4\\" jointer used to make. And the cuts were smooth as silk. I tested flattening a cupped 4 inch pine board and after a couple of passes, the board was flat as could be.For the money, this is a top notch machine and an asset to my work shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably poor service.","review":"I ordered the long bed version of this jointer in Jan.

Amazon, you have lost a few customers on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"Shipping and packing were perfect. Machine was almost ready to go right out of the box. Instructions were easy to read and understand. A little cleaning with some kero, some minor adjustments to square the fence and set the infeed and outfeed tables and the machine was operating. Fit and finish were very good. What a joy to operate. Quite, smooth and the results are second to none. Highly recommend this machine to anyone considering purchasing a jointer."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice,but....","review":"This is a QUALITY tool, very rugged and looks great in the shop. I put it where I can see it every day when I pull my truck in the garage. It motivates me to get out there and do some work.It was easy to set up and was adjusted from the factory, now the but.The 90 degree stop is crap. Not up to the quality of the rest of the tool. I check it every time. Also my fence was not straight. It had about a 3/32\\" bow from end to end. Aside from those 2 problems I don't think you are going to find a better value in a 6\\" jointer.Edit to add:Called the Jet customer service number on the owners manual about the twisted fence. They shipped a new one out, no questions asked. That is how customer service should work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice jointer overall.","review":"Picked up this jointer about a week or so ago. Assemblywas easy enough, and the packaging was very good. Fit andfinish is excellent, and once I got the knives adjustedproperly(which took me forever the first time out) Iwas making nice, clean cuts. This is a really nice jointerfor the $$.Dust collection was also quite good, and my straight edgeand feeler gauges show no more than +-0.003 deviationin any direction across the tables and fence: well withinacceptable tolerances. So far I am very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does everything I ask of it","review":"This is my second JET tool, first jointer. I've used it to put edges on about 700 linear feet of rough cut hard maple. The blades appear to be holding in there. a hard steel. Setup was easy, creating just one minor scare but that's because I didn't have the outfeed table set at the correct height. I'm very pleased with the results it delivers. I've used the 45 degree function with success. It will also create toungue cuts for dado a lot easier and cleaner than a shaper table. Worth every penny. Get the mobile base. Forget about using this tool as a planer (cutting wood long-ways), get a planer for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works well, even without instructions","review":"I have owned this Jet jointer and the Jet Dust Collector with canister for about 3 months now. The products arrived in excellent condition and have worked well with little or no adjustments. My only complaint is with the lack of detailed setup and operating instructions. The dust collector is no big deal but the jointer requires much more in the way of operating, trouble shooting, adjusting, and operating instructions and/or illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Jointer Review","review":"Ordered product on a Friday. I receieved free shipping which was $146.00 savings. I was shocked to receive a call from the shipper the very next Monday setting up delivery for Tuesday as I thought it would take about ten days. Delivery was smooth, put the jointer together and everything is working great. From ordering, to shipping, to product, I couldn't be happier. I will say one improvement that could be made on jointer is the belt tention adjustment. I own several Jet tools and this one is the most difficult to adjust the tension. Other than that, the machine is smooth and quiet and produces a perfect edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"JET JJ-6CSX Jointer - Good value","review":"I think this is a good value for the price. I compared this model with Delta, and couldn't justify the additional cost for the Delta. If you do woodworking for a living, you'll probably want something better, but for the serious woodworker/hobbyist, I think this is a good product and I wouldn't go with anything cheaper. I've used mine regularly for about four months. A few things I've found: using a vacuum/dust collector is a almost a necessity as chips accumulate quickly. If you don't, you'll at least need to clean the chip chute frequently. Setting up the outfeed table and blades can take quite awhile (depending on how much of a perfectionist you are), but once I got it set, I've had no problem. I give it four stars because although I've been woodworking for a long time and have done my research, this is my first jointer, so I don't have first hand experience with other products to compare this one to. Product shipment and delivery was quick and professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet 708457K/JJ-6csx 6\\" woodworking Jointer","review":"I am very pleased with the service recieved from Amazon.com and the Jet 708457K/JJ-6CSX 6\\" woodworking Jointer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid is and understatement","review":"If you love poor acting, poor directing, and poor photography, then please get this movie.

Now that I take them all out and look at them from several angles, I see that these folders are not all the same height! In fact, only one third of them are all the same height. The rest are within a 1/4 inch of each other up or town.Two folders are very roughly cut, which might indicate the \\"cutter\\" was off on the assembly line. Or they haven't gotten all the kinks worked out for this product.As it is, I've wasted a sheet of labels and must re-start a tedious job.

Folders that need a lot of handling tend to \\"give\\" first at the tabs, which results in a file that is hard to read (and quickly locate the right folder) from the top of a box or drawer.Certainly not the biggest problem in the world, but if it is something that bothers you, this product's reinforced tabs are designed to answer it. Good quality folders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Product","review":"I have several filing cabinets, all full! Lots of file folders have come and gone through the years. These are very good ones.The area that extends up at the top of the file for labeling can get a lot of wear and tear as you open and close the drawer and go through files looking to the one you need. These folders have plenty of reinforcement there, to really do the job.The fold lines that allow the file to be neatly thickened at the fold are excellent. My files are about to be improved! I like folders that last and last. If the folder is still good-looking when I'm done with that file, I can put a new label on the top and use it for another round.These are a good price for a good product.

I never considered how blessed I am the the local parish is an old one, not ornate or beautiful, because when the church was built, the community was not a particularly prosperous one. But the church itself is a pretty one. Some modern touches have crept in, but NOTHING like the monstrosities Michael Rose photographed for his book. One church looked more like a rustic youth hostel than a place of worship -- and I couldn't recover from my shock at the Blessed Host being relegated to a back room chapel. As if He isn't welcome in the sanctuary!

The author solves problems and gives advice to all who would listen. Her voice is strident but her story is compelling.

Seeing the two units die so close to each other in time is a bad testament to the product design. Hopefully the new designs of the last 6 months will be better.

The unit won't recognize it's own USB drive even though it is installed. You have to download the updated USB drivers after searching the garmin web site.3) The unlock wizard fails with the initial installation. Tells you to reinstall the .dll.

You cannot hook the unit directly to your pc (unless you have an old serial port-male)The memory card (128mb) can only hold so much map data.

At first I was looking at Delta and comparing it to the other saws. I got stuck on Delta because I own other Delta tools and I liked the quality and performance of these machines. So, I ordered a Delta 14 inch band saw. But after reading the reviews (excellent source of information) I quickly cancelled the order. Then about the same time a Jet 14 inch band saw caught my eye. It was the same price and the reviews were excellent. So I purchased it. I was impressed right from the start. I received the saw 3 days early (way to go ABF). It took a little time to assemble the saw but it went right together. After a few fine adjustments were made on the blocks and the bearing the saw was ready to go. The operation was smooth and very little vibration. Only one recommendation, purchase the mobile base at the same time. It will save time and your back moving it around the shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"First of Two Reviews","review":"After hours and months or reseach and review reading I came to purchase the Jet 14\\" bandsaw. I am only going to review what I have seen in the limited time that I have owned it. It took about two hours for complete set up to include the mobile base, fence system, and riser block. Only very minor adjustments were made which you would expect from any new tool purchase. I encountered no problems with the enclosed hardware and the fit and finish on the machine was excellent. First time out the machine passed the nickle test with all stock parts to include the belt.After I log some major hours on the machine I will be back with what I really think of the tool. After all it's what your money buys in the long run that really matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet 14\\" Bandsaw review","review":"For the small amount of time that I have owned this product I have enjoyed it quite well. Set-up was easy and the instructions were easy to follow. However, because the tires that the blade runs on are concave and not flat, I cannot use a 1/8\\" scroll blade on the machine as the blade will travel to either one side or the other of the wheel and then come off. But other than that I am happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"still working strong","review":"I have had the Jet bandsaw for over a year. I have used to resaw 2x4 pine boards to build a fence. It has done well to resaw hardwoods such a oak and birch. It has all the power needed to resaw a 6\\" oak board. I also make boxes which I cut curves in a 6\\" thick piece of hardwood with no problems. I would recommend spending the extra money to get the 1 hp motor instead of the 3/4 hp. The guides adjust quickly and the blade tracks well. The only problem I have had is the blade tensioner broke after approximately 6 months. Jet quickly sent a new part and it was easy to replace. I have been very happy with this product and I use it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet 14\\" Enclosed Bandsaw","review":"I spent a lot of time researching bandsaws prior to making this pruchase and am so glad I did.

Carter makes one and that will probably be my next purchase. As far as the accuracy, quality of fit and finish and quietness goes for this saw, I rate it \\"fantastic\\".

At times there is a slight underlying new age or ambient feel to some of the instrumentals such as Mingus. The Latin, rock, jazz fusion sound is still there and umistakeably Santana's trademark sound.Like I said, forget about the few pop-like tracks, while a bit catchy (I'm Gone, 'Trane, Deeper Big Deeper) and concentrate on the majority of excellent material that is here !I was going to give this recording only 4 stars but because Bella is one of the most beautiful instrumentals Santana has ever written I have to bump it to 5..."},{"rating":"2","title":"santana's blues for salvador","review":"I consider this one of santana's best because of the sound quality on most of the tracks.

Maister's study of 139 offices of 29 professional service - more specifically, marketing and communications - firms in 15 countries. His objective was to identify the attitudes that correlate most strongly with financial success. He found what's been known all along - that financial success correlates very strongly with the perceived good character and integrity of management. When employees believe that management practices what it preaches, they seem to give extra effort and get astonishing results. The idea that character counts as much as, or perhaps more than, structure and corporate policy will be hard for many to accept. It takes courage, commitment, faith and humility to become the kind of person this study recommends.

This book explain (very detail), all steps necessary for completing a database application. The first step: database design, then creating database objects (tables and queries etc.) and finally building a DELPHI application based on the database. What I dislike about this book is, that the author uses PARADOX database that is not very popular in the database world. He could use ACCESS database for example, or client-server oriented database server.

I was building a new app in D5 for the Internet and wanted to find a good foundational reference for databases from the perspective of Delphi. I happened upon this book, and, boy, was I blown away! Given that it was targeted at D2, I couldn't believe that it would still apply to D5, but it does indeed. The tutorial section, where the author leads you by the hand from app concept to app deployment is the best I've seen. The performance & tuning section teaches a few tricks even an old dog like me hadn't seen before.

I've now worked through the entire book and have learned ALOT about Delphi -- including many things I didn't even know were there. Even though Delphi itself has changed quite a bit since D2 (and hence the screen shots don't always match up with the text), this book is truly timeless. I ran into a few minor problems relating to version differences (e.g., Database Desktop is no longer a menu item in Delphi like it was in D2), but nothing major. 90% of what you learn from this book applies to every version of Delphi.

The replacments were this newer model. One works great, but the other fails exactly as the older model did, by switch off as soon as the room temperature registers.

Fortunately, I have a really good sense of smell and the smell of fabric about to ignite woke me up. I unplugged it. Today, it will not turn on at all, so clearly I caught it as it was reaching some critical electrical malfunction. I previously felt safe even on the nights I fell asleep with it set to low. If you have one, unplug it at night. Reading the other reviews, I think there is a problem with the safety and reliability of the timer feature. I feel very grateful to my nose that I was not involved in a fire. Honeywell used to be a great local Minnesota company, but now all their stuff is made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"this item was dented and damaged and wouldn't even turn on.

I bought this for my kids room last Dec 2011 and it already broke with only three months past. The digital settings is defective. I set the heater at 74 degrees and to run for 9 hours. I woke up in the morning and the heater was still on. The room was reaching 90 degrees. It was a sauna. My kids was sweating like crazy. They could have gotten a heat stroke or worst. I wish I could get my money back. This unit is a DO NOT BUY and should be RECALLED!!!!My advice is to buy the cheapest non-digital radiator heater possible and then get thisLux WIN100 Heating & Cooling Programmable Outlet Thermostat. This is what I did after this Honeywell broke. This unit works flawlessly and is easy to program with good user friendly design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow to heat even a small room","review":"I bought this last december and, new to heaters, i bought this oil filled one. After doing some research online, this was one of the more expensive heaters that's available in the target store near my place. Tried heating a living room, which was about 700 sq ft but of course, it only heats about 5 inches its radius. I have to put this as close to me as possible and still feel very cold. Use it in my room that's about 150 sq ft and was only able to warm up about 15\\" its radius. Decided to get a delonghi and it hits the room faster than oil filled radiator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of return/repair policy","review":"Note that I don't actually own this heater. I owned the Honeywell Whole Room heater. It worked reasonably well for a whole season, then it failed. That, in and of itself, would not be big issue. Every space heater I have owned has failed before warranty (3 of them). However, Kaz, Inc's (owner of the Honeywell brand of heaters) return policy is ridiculous. You have to pay to return it and pay a \\"processing fee\\". I'm guessing this thing is heavy.I recommend staying away from anything by Kaz. That includes Honeywell, Vicks, Braun, Enviracaire, and SoftHeat. Their customer service is lacking that important \\"service\\" component.I can recommend Vornado heaters. They failed too, but they fix things for free, paying for shipping, and are nice about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"After a few months of usage it randomly turns itself off","review":"It is so unreliable I wouldn't buy it again.We set a temperature and in theory it should stay on, well, sometimes after a few seconds not having reached the temperature it would turn off.

The downside: this model appears to have a history of cords overheating and in some cases either melting and/or catching on fire. In our case, the cord melted at the outlet, melted the outlet and if we had not been home would have caused a serious fire.

It would shut off after fifteen minutes, then it became ten minutes, and finally after five months or so, it wouldn't stay on for more than a minute. When I went back on Amazon, I saw several other people complaining about the same defect. I called Kaz, the company that makes these Honeywell heaters, and they tried to tell me that the problem was with another version of this heater, and that my model was working fine. Now I find this heater listed on Amazon without any of the negative consumer reviews that it had earlier. Are we to believe this is a newer (supposedly problem-free) version of the old lemon? If so, the company should clearly state so somewhere and recall the old model with full money-back to buyers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive and well constructed","review":"What first got my attention was the looks.

PLEASE READ ME","review":"We bought this for our newborn baby's room and used it 3.5 years. At first it seemed to do the out of control skyrocket temp thing but then we figured out its quirk. Turn it on, let it sit 5 or so min then set the temp to where you want it and it will keep the temp for long periods of time meaning months if your power doesn't go out. Setting the temp right away when you turn it on does not keep the temp, you have to wait to set it. After 3.5 years we noticed small amounts of oil leaking, thank goodness we have it on a bathroom floor now as it would have ruined carpet in our child's room. more and more oil has been coming out so I decided to google reviews on it and I immediately unplugged after reading reviews. the home we lived in when we had it in our child's room did not have wired smoke detectors so I am very thankful we did not have problems with it sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad thermostats","review":"Like many other reviews, I want to warn you about bad thermostats on this model.

I bought this to heat the room where my 1.5 year old grandchild sleeps.I tested it for about 3 days in my office. The heater made the room about 5-10F warmer than the thermostat indicated. I thought I could solve that by setting the thermostat lower than I wanted.The first night I used it with our grandchild, I set it to 65F. Sometime in the early morning, we heard our grandchild crying. I went into the room and it was 95F. The thermostat for the heater was still reading somewhere around 65F.To make matters worse, the packaging said that if there were any problems, the heater should be returned to Katz, not even to Honeywell and not the place of purchase. So I was expected to disassemble it, repackage it and ship it???I have lost all respect for Honeywell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini mighty","review":"The heater works great! Its a small one but trust me, it packs a punch. Within 30 mins my 2 bedroom apt warmed up by several degrees. The heat is adjustable with 3 different settings. To heat up 1 bedroom, the low setting is more than enough. The only thing that i didnt like was the heat setting button that does not recoil back to its position when u press it so u have to bring it back up manually and that might been due to an open box.

She can dish it out (Infiel), sing like a French Cabaret Singer (En Tus Manos), or be mellow and beautiful in a Bachatta (Mesita de Noche). She turns a bland Diane Warren song into something amazing (Porque me amaste - Because you loved me - and credit must be given here to the very inventive arrangement). Also noteworthy: Se Fue, Vive. The other songs are very good, except for maybe two. Why she would choose to do a duet with the ugly-voiced Elvis Crespo, however, I do not know.Milly Quezada is an extremely gifted singer, and seems to be getting better with age.

As each chapter progresses, however, the questions begin to build from prior questions already answered and express more and more complex concepts.Typically, by the time a chapter has been completed, the reader will have completed one or more complicated proofs typically found in other texts on the same subject-- small bite by small bite at a time.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"welcome to Cali","review":"I teach AP Econ in a public school.

Not to worry though, as it seems that this novel is more about exploring the characters than it is about exploring a setting in a story.

I don't understand where they say the sound and Ross' voice isn't in good shape. Both the sound and Ross sounds great. People have to understand that during tours, artists usually change up their songs to give it more of a bounce. I like the way she changed up Chain Reaction and Mirror Mirror. I also like how she interacts with the audience especially on Muscles and Reach Out and Touch Somebody's Hand.

Here is a woman that this author has taught to be Pollyanna. Her estranged husband is pissing away their life savings and destroying their life together. Ms. Baker will likely find herself homeless because of his actions; however, while the Titanic is sinking Mr. Hauck has convinced her to smile and be pleasant about it, firmly living a reality called denial. I don't often condone censorship but in this case I may, however on the other hand, those who find this book helpful will be better served by the inevitably of natural selection.

Sort of gives the A100 a Pro Digital Camera look.I also have the A100 Body Armour. Which is great by itself but as of now!!! not compatible with the Optima BPG. Had to modify a $40.00 Body Armour to get it the way I like. Bottom Line so far I like mine. It's on the camer always I'm for it. The Downside for me is Bulkiness it adds to the A100.

Kurt Carr fans get to hear a selection by him. Tramaine Hawkins fans get to hear a solo by her on \\"I've Got to Hold On\\". Darryl Coley fans get to hear him on a track too. Before the WOW compilations, GMWA was a major way to hear a collection of compositions from a wide range of heavy hitters in gospel. More importantly, charts from all of these tunes are still available. For musicians who learn by sheet music, GMWA remains a powerful source for a wide range of gospel music. My prayer is that many of the contemporary gospel musicians who have built off the foundation of GMWA will not completely overlook many of the classic choir tunes contained in sets like this.4.5 stars, mostly for historical impact on the black choir tradition"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always nice to have these around","review":"I bought my 18-70mm lens used and I didn't get this lens shade when I bought it.

This biotch is so outdated that it takes up all 121 pages. And anything you want to save must be on a memory pack!

I'd rather have a normal version of a game to own, not to mention an INSTRUCTON MANUAL (I'm mad at whoever threw that away). The fact that you couldn't change the difficulty of the game was a BIG detraction from the fun. That's why I liked NBA Courtside Featuring Kobe Bryant a lot better.

Great cinematography and audio, as far as the story line, what was so bad about it, because it was \\"aliens\\" or maybe it wasn't original? please, isn't James Bond doing a movie with cowboys and aliens? I'll bet the same people who scoffed at this movie will be praising that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating military sci-fi...","review":"\\"Battle: Los Angeles\\"(2011) is directed by Jonathan Liebesman (The Killing Room). Aaron Eckhart stars as SSgt. Michael Nantz who helps lead a group of marines against an alien attack. This film is reminiscent of \\"Black Hawk Down\\" but with aliens instead of Somalis for enemies. A sweeping, heroic soundtrack that would have been at home in the film \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is often buried beneath the gun fire and explosions. The special effects are great and the action keeps coming. Some of the editing and jittery camera work initially feels choppy, but once the action kicks in all is well and we just hang on and enjoy the ride which is often compelling.This blu-ray has many interesting special features about the making of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the action","review":"My husband liked this movie so much I gave it to him for Father's day.

Other than missing a larger than life sound track like in Independence Day this was an excellent movie. Independence Day was a good movie, but you felt manipulated to cry at just the right times. This movie was more like reality even though they were fighting aliens. I enjoyed the extra featurettes also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle Lousiana","review":"This movie is very hokey and should be retitled Battle Louisiana.

This is what its like in the middle east except peoples heads, guts, and limbs are getting blown to pieces. A slap in the face for marines who really have to live this against other people. Those who died and suffer should not have their efforts twisted into some alien recruiting film towards teenagers that this corrupt government wants to ship out to war.Whats worse is the people in the middle east have to live this kind of ravaging warfare in their homelands as their homes are destroyed and children bombed. Hollywood has stumped to a new low."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not as good as expected","review":"OK, its a SciFi, but it's a pretty bad one.

I'm glad they have this in 2:40:1 aspect ratio so you can see the whole film. Lots of action to keep the pace moving along nicely. The Blu-Ray on this is pretty good as far as I'm concerned. I've seen this in dvd & the Blu-ray is so much better. I can't comment to much on the audio as I listen through external speakers hooked up to my stereo. No fancy sound system. Sounded real good in stereo though. I got this for under $15.00. Not bad, but I had to wait a while for this price. Plenty of special features also. Overall I think I got my money's worth on this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"The movie has a very good story line. It also has a good bit of emotion on a personal basis.

The action was good though, and some decent character development going on with those jarheads. But needless to say all this was was a shoot em up bang bang movie. No storyline, no overarching plot besides running around shooting. I thought this could be a sneaky movie that would grab my attention and I would come away saying wow that one surprised me. But unfortunately that did not happen...think the creators of this were shooting to create a District 9 cult type film, and well they fell flat on their face with this one. If you want a decent and recent sci-fi flick that is worth it detour to District 9 its much better and the story is much more grasping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guys movie!","review":"This is one of the best alien invasion movie I have seen.

When the battle starts, you feel like you're fighting with them, and cheering them on. Is this some deep, thought-provoking Oscar movie? Nah, it isn't, and it doesn't try to be.

You get the feeling that this flick was filmed with a bunch of home cameras by people inept at operating those devices. Perhaps this is part of a visual effect to make the film feel more real, but how can one get lost in the story when every few seconds they switch cameras, zoom in and out, point the camera into the sun so that the actor is barely visible. Whoever decided to shoot the film this way should have chosen a career at Taco Bell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Forward","review":"This film needs serious editing, 80% of the content is unwatchable, just plain stupid script, you can watch this in 15 minutes by fast forwarding the boring dialoques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what a waste of time","review":"So I felt like giving this a chance one evening, and it was a big mistake. Yes it is nothing new, yes, the CGI is used for all action scenes, and yes they use Marines in the movie. I hope that IF this movie made any money, that it went to feed the costs of our wars because the producers and actors deserve not a dime. The movie was lame and slow. You know how it will end and nothing will surprise you throughout the entire film. IMHO, no originality. There was no connection to the characters or their situations. I ended up forwarding through the movie just to get to the action parts, which were pretty decent, but nothing that will amaze you. Just another reason why you shouldn't waste your time/money on Hollywood these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dizzy.","review":"Stereotypical Hollywood view of soldiers. Stereotypical but effective. Excessive camera movement. Background noises so loud you can't follow the dialogue. Backstory - almost incomprehensible.Special effects were top notch. Aaron Eckhart's performance although given boilerplate lines straight out of a bad John Wayne movie - was quite good.It certainly had potential. Blame the director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best alien invasion movie ever","review":"If you liked independence day, war of the worlds, avatar, transformers, basically any movie that has a military defense component in a super crazy setting -- then you'll adore this. That's all I can really say. For me it was the best alien invasion movie that I've ever saw to date. There was no conversing with the aliens, no negotiations, a straight out battle the entire time. It was awesome beyond belief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move! Move!! Move!!!","review":"Awful. 2 hours of yelling. Cardboard characters. Predictable beginning, middle, and end. Non-stop melodramatic music (to dictate to the viewer how he or she should feel.) No more than a paragraph of meaningful dialouge and no, I am not being hyperbolic. The \\"movie\\" was, essentialy, like watching someone else play a sci-fi video game for 120 minutes. Even as an exercise in escapism-this movie failed. The cliches were so over-used as to be insulting to the viewer. There was zero attempt by the writer(s)/ director to make this into anything more than an extended preview of, well, any given CGI riddled train wreck. You could literally watch this movie without the sound on and you would miss nothing of its plot. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaky-Cam at its very worst....No Plot...No Character development","review":"Another pathetic shaky-cam movie. There is not a single frame of the entire movie where the camera is not deliberately shaking, or being rapidly zoomed in and out, or abruptly panned here and there. This ridiculous filming technique makes the entire film unwatchable. The only way this movie could be actually watched would be to rip it to disk, process it through an anti-shake video filter, and then view the result. I pray for the day when TV monitors will have image stabilization software built into them so that shaky-cam movies can actually be watched."},{"rating":"1","title":"IDIOTIC At The Very Least . . . . .","review":"Doesn't anyone in Hollywood have any imagination anymore. The same old lame special effects, the same tired characters, the same old explosions, the same old same old.

Super dumb !!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and Dumber","review":"About the stupidest movie I have ever seen. Filled with cliques, plot makes no sense, there were only a couple of good actors but only two. I don't know how many times they said, \\"staff sergeant\\" or \\"I'm not leaving you behind\\". I think it would be a determinable mind set for a twelve year old. Actually I can't figure out why aliens would invade LA in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Poorly written, poorly dialogued.

You want to find something worthy of your time within them, but they just rest there like the complete failure that they are. I wasn't expecting something great from \`Battle: Los Angeles' but I was expecting something. Instead, what I got was a halfbaked attempt at infusing a science fiction, alien film with a war mentality. There are a slew of characters all layered with \`real life issues' and yet none of them feel even remotely \`real'. They are all empty and soulless and \`who really cares' and yet, this film thinks that it is saying something important. I hate when a film thinks it is saying more than it really is. This film desperately wanted to be \`District 9', or at least capitalize on its success, but it lacked so much of the formers rooted realism. Instead, \`Battle: Los Angeles' tosses balance out the window and meanders so long that it becomes a boring, pointless, misguided waste of time.

The lingo, camaraderie a la armed forces is believable.If you loved District 9 for it's sci-fi action and it's portrayal of the complex nuances of human nature, you will likely find this okay to deplorable. I personally found it's dialogue tedious and the trite cliched characters unlikeable. I laughed at some of the one-liners that weren't meant to be funny and found the action sequences interchangeable and honestly they dragged on and on. The special effects weren't bad, I liked the alien mechanizations of war. The main focus of this flikk is the troupe and it's brotherhood. I just didn't care about any of them. The writers may have been ham sandwiches."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of talent","review":"This is going to be a very short review.. The story is weak from all the imitations, which made it very predictable.It has bits & pieces from the following movies:- Independence Day- War of the WorldsHow many movies have you seen of an alien attack with one Marines unit kicking them off the planet? Not to mention the gaps in its storyline, which makes one go 'Huh?! How.. What did I miss?' One unit thinks and acts better than all international brains put together.. A waste of talent, time, and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of subliminal messages, boring. Yawn!","review":"This movie is not only boring to hell but packs a plethora of subliminal messages aimed at the young and dumbed down generation. I guess \\"uncle\\" sam aka big brother is using this movie as a front to boost army enrollment and promote fear against a possible alien encounter (be it friendly or not).If you get thrills at this type of propaganda this movie was made just for you.Just think, why so many movies lately about alien invasions (Battle LA, Skyline etc?) The government is up to something and as always we're \\"entertained\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"The 1st 5 minutes and the last 15 minutes are watchable. The rest is a bunch of uninteresting drama set behind the vague backdrop of an alien invasion.The characters are presented in a way that makes them uninteresting. we never care if any or all of them die.The dialogue is so phony and 3rd gradish that it made me want to watch a good movie about marines instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring!","review":"So I watched this movie last week and I was looking forward to it.

Did you know this movie actually had a writer. I'm not sure why, there aren't but more than ten lines of dialogue. Every character has exactly one dimension and most serve as \\"red shirts\\" or target practice for the aliens that are stealing our water or using our water as fuel or doing something related to our water. Who really cares why the aliens came 200 gazillion trillion miles, maybe they were just mighty thirsty. It was fun mindless (MINDLESS must be emphasized) explosion after crazy explosion. Blowing Up Los Angeles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Action","review":"Most Sci-Fi epics require suspension of disbelief. That's a given. But please! Aliens cross interstellar space in mighty ships to annihilate earth's occupants and suck up earth's water. A Marine platoon faces off against them in L.A. After a seemingly endless series of tedious battles between a few gung-ho soldiers and the aliens, the aliens lose? They're on the run? Get real. Marines are tough, but my advice to them under the circumstances: Bend over, grab your ankles and kiss your a** goodbye.Silly story, decent special effects. If all you're looking for is mindless action, then this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-Moving and Realistic","review":"This movie is brilliantly directed to capture the confusion and sudden surprisesof life on the battlefield. Often, the shots are so brief that you're not certainwhat you're seeing, just as our warriors are. The script does deal a tiny bit incliche, but the whole thing surges along with such power that you scarcely havetime to think about that. Also, with so many soldiers and so much action, youdon't really get to know anyone except Aaron Eckhart's character. Still, the wholething is thrilling, a great blend of war film and alien-invasion film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad - What's the Fuss?","review":"The while this movie isn't \\"Henry V\\", it is not a bad movie at all (perhaps the critics were thinking of \\"Battle of Los Angeles\\", the crappo direct-to-video effort rather than this particular production). There are a few equipment issues, such as M4s changing to M16A4s and back again or UH-1D Huey helicopters standing in for UH-1Ys, but the thing that stood out was the sterility of the language (i.e, the lack of \\"colorful metaphors\\"): only one (1) F-Bomb was dropped during the entire movie. If these were real Marines, soldiers, sailors, or airmen, \\"colorful metaphors\\" would abound and the \\"f-bomb\\" would be used in ways that one would not think possible ;) Other than that, it is a good action movie and if I had to give it a letter grade, I would give it a solid \\"B+\\".In my opinion, those who have a problem with this film probably have a problem with a film portraying any branch of the military in a positive light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Action for the Sci-Fi Crowd","review":"The alien invasion theme is always good for a sci-fi action movie and I've enjoyed them all. \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" pulls a little from several of them and puts it together in a reasonably satisfying mix; it is loud, fast paced and has a really lot of shooting.Fortunately for the good guys the aliens lack one important defense that made the enemy in ID4 a lot harder to defeat. I'll go no further there to avoid a spoiler; let it suffice that the good guys, played by a platoon of Marines, win the day and save the earth.This one will not please those inclined toward romantic flicks, but should entertain most guys that appreciate sci-fi action movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves more respect","review":"I didn't really know what to expect while watching this movie. I heard that it was special effect driven, and no character building. I would have to say that I disagree with the no character building. I was really interested in hearing the backstory of the staff sargent. I really started to wonder if his group was goning to make it out alive. I just thought it was really entertaining. It reminds me of a video game like Resistance mixed with Gears of War. The thing I've learned over time is critics like bad movies, and hate good movie. They make us believe that The King's Speech or The English Patient are good movies. They tried to say that the first Batman movie that came out in 89' was bad. If I 'd listen to what critics thought I would have missed out on some really good movies. You just really have to judge a movie for yourself. You could always rent a movie befor you buy it. I would just have to say that this movie reminds me of Independence Day, which I thought was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"RETREAT HELL","review":"In all actuality, BATTLE : LOS ANGELES is a John Wayne war movie with aliens filling in for the commies. On that level, the movie is a testosterone celebration of the USA and the Marines.The gung-ho bravado of the soldiers and involved civilians is big, loud, frenetic and full of exciting battle scenes and heroic acts. It captures the viewer right away and in spite of the expected cliches, it is a rousing spectacle.The alien invaders are reminiscent of DISTRICT 9 and SKYLINE. The actors' roles are limited but they perform admirably especially Aaron Eckhart, Ramon Rodriguez, Bridget Moynahan and Michael Pena. The jittery camera work is effective and the special effects outstanding.BATTLE LOS ANGELES is a well done action film with a sci-fi twist but is really an Iwo Jima for the new millenium."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Hope There Is A Sequel!","review":"This movie rocked! Very simple story line. We are attacked by aliens because of Earth's resources. The concept of how they arrived, and started kicking butt was great. The FX on this movie were incredible.

I like sci-fi movies but this was more like watching a military/war movie and less like watching a sci-fi film. If you like war movies with a little twist of sci-fi then this is for you. Otherwise stick to watching Saving Private Ryan for good war movie or War of the Worlds or Cloverfield for traditional alien/monster mashup. The last sci-fi film I truly adored was Cloverfield - that was a movie that's part of our collection to watch and re-watch. Battle Los Angeles won't make our movie collection. Last time we made a mistake by listening to critics when District 9 came out - we bought the DVD thinking it would be great and it was terrible. Battle Los Angeles we rented and is at least better than District 9 but not what I was looking for in a sci-fi flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Independence Day + District 9","review":"Hollywood actors, upset by alien bullies, dress up like soldiers, go where they shouldn't, give away their positions, waste thousands of rounds, have tantrums, and generally get into lots of trouble before eventually turning the tide by taking out the enemy's space-hog network server.You sense that a fair amount of money went into this movie, but it's mainly stuff blowing up. The plot and interaction of the 'soldiers' is so unreal that the aliens are more interesting. The dialogue is so trite that my girlfriend got the giggles and annoyed some students sitting nearby in the theatre. The camera tremors are so bad that another good title would be \\"JIGGLE: Los Angeles.\\"The explosions are convincing.

Since I watched the film in my living room, I could not walk out. Battle: Los Angeles is not a film as much as a video game, with video sequences that repeat in intent if not literally so, and audio and dialogue that DOES repeat. Often. Couple that with a lame minimalistic storyline and incredibly bad acting, and you have one of the worst films in a long time. If you are a fan of the original SF war film Starship Troopers, as I am, you will be sorely disappointed in this work which borrows extensively from better films such as Independence Day, War of the Worlds, District 9, and even Skyline. Not that it doesn't have some interest for film students. If you are fan of Avid film editing you will enjoy taking the sequences apart to see how modern editing can make something out of nothing. But for the rest of us, there are much better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another dumb movie, this could have been really good","review":"I only watched this show because of Eckhart, I have really enjoyed his films in the past, but this was a very pedestrian performance.

Horrible story, cardboard characters, confusing action, and laughable acting. My 12 year old son nearly fell asleep, it was so boring.

Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait to own on DVD","review":"I was hoping this would not be a movie like skyline which maden it seem like it was going to be a good scifi but bombed, was pleased this movie turn out to be such a great movie, like the way the military was shown in this movie from the stand point of a rifle platoon fighting in urban combat never giving up and ensuring that the civilians they rescued stay safe.

It is a gritter War of the Worlds type miltary type battle.Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Two Face from The Dark Knight) does an impressive job of spitting out ham-fisted dialogue like he really, really means it in a John Wayne type mode. He is the highlight of the whole film. His Marine Staff Sergeant headed to the way of retirement may be the only reason you may want to watch this film. Otherwise, the Poor character development and a worn out storyline make this a very forgettable film otherwise.Charlie's Angels Ramon Rodriguez and Lost's Michelle Rodriquez seem wasted in their supporting roles.The humans vs Aliens type storyline seem weak.

Two of the ones I saw in this vain were: The Eagle, and \\"I am number four\\". Neither were great, but I could get subsumed in the reality they created. Battle Los Angeles on the other hand was super cliched and not very believable at any level. We are supposed to empathize with the staff sarge and his personal pain and then watch him as he performance continuous heroic acts that make his soldiers worship him. Following him everywhere he says hoorah. I love a good action war film and I'm hoping cowboys vs aliens lives up to expectations. As far as this piece of trash though, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens meet their match.","review":"An unambiguous and straight forward film that allows us to cheer on our troops.

I seldom watch a movie a 2nd time within 24 hours of seeing it but this one I did. The lead actor was superb in his role, his acting was very good. And Michelle Rodriguez, I could watch all day, she's great. Several of the other soldiers also did a great job of acting. The script in places was sophomoric but some marines and army rangers I knew were just like that in real life. The aliens and their weapons were great, the scenes of a destroyed LA was great, and it had a great ending. I look forward to a directors cut with more footage. Was it \\"Gone with the Wind\\" or something, no it wasn't, but it was still a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another alien invasion flick!?","review":"In a word, this movie is ANOTHER cgi driven, alien invasion, battle flick. Nothing new to see here, move along. While I like the main character, he was not quite what I envision is a marine sergeant killing the baddies, especially when the baddies are outta this world. So, the movie bogged down in places, upon which I promptly fell asleep. Further, some of the one liners were so cliche they were almost offensive. If you want an alien invasion flick, ID still does nicely. This movie doesn't get close to ID's standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle?","review":"Well, I saw a lot of Marines, but I saw very few aliens. I saw a lot of running by the Marines.

It is more of a war movie fought in and around Santa Monica, Ca. The camera moves too fast to let your eyes focus on the picture. Almost like a reality show. The \\"aliens\\" resemble somewhat the robot character in Terminator, hard to knock down. The story seems to have been written very fast and with no thought given to allow enough time to a prelude to an earth invasion. What can I say, the acting is so, so, the story even worse. By the way, the movie, seems to be somewhat of a copycat of the other scifi movie failure called: Skyline.

It's not a movie being promoted for the oscars, it's not 200 million dollar superhero movie being pushed down our throats with 24/7 advertising. The poor critic reviews caused me to think this would be lame, but it was alright. Not great, mind you, but good. Story was okay, some of the usual action-movie humor, acting was alright, effects were pretty good...overall it was worth watching if you just want to have a fun time watching a good alien-attacks-earth action movie. I *might* have been a little disappointed had I taken family to see this in an expensive theater, but for dvd or download it's definitely worthwhile. BTW, I'm not saying it's okay like some lame b-movie sci-fi like Starship Troopers 3 or anything like that.

It is an almost uninterrupted orgy of noise and screams. After ten minutes I was totally exhausted. The characters are completely one-dimensional. Macho men running and shooting at everything that moves. They communicate by cliche oneliners. The storyline is as flat as the heartbeat of a recently deceased person. After fifteen minutes or so, I was so bored, numbed and fed up by it all that I \\"switched off\\", crept behind my newspaper and left it to my son and his friends to complete the viewing. From behind the newspaper I patiently endured the endless string of gunshots, explosions and shouted commands. Do not be fooled: there's hardly any science in this fiction, it's just a \\"one-in-a-dozen\\" war movie. I cherished the silence as almost never before when at last the TV set was switched off.

If you're a real music buff, you need this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The picture quality not really likes DVD","review":"I've got this DVD yesterday, I just can say:\\"not bad\\". of course not good. the cover picture quality really let me down, and then I did put the DVD-rom. the picture quality let me down again. I just can say: This DVD not as good as <Steve vai - Live At the Astoria London>..disappointedly.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"Same type of set up for Vai and Sat as previous. Same old boring Malmsteen to listen to. Speed pick speed pick speed pick. Malmsteen has always sucked as a guitarist. Why they including him in this, god only knows. This should really be re-named G2."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I hadn't seen 'Live In Concert' with Erick Johnson...","review":"This performance has Vai and Satch burning up like we all know they do. Mr. Malmstien can wail all over the fretboard like a mad man but it would be nice if he would actually compose some music. Arpegios and blazing neck length scales are impressive but tiresome after all of 2 minutes. The \\"Live in Concert\\" DVD (filmed in Mineapolis) with Erik Johnson is WAYYYYYY better in every way. Vai, Satch and Johnson have a chemestry that just works. The songs played by Satch and Vai are better on the Johnson concert and they are each in absolute top form in every set. The last set with all 3 maistros is blues/rock oriented and is so well done! I was absolutely amazed how well Satch and Vai incorporated thier unique playing to more traditional blues/rock covers. Malmstein is an ego-maniac who was an uncomfortable ingredient in an other wise fairly good mix. Smashing his guitar to pieces might have entertained us when we were all teenagers... not today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously flawed technically!","review":"Save your money. Sometimes you can hear Tony Macalpine and sometimes not. Yngwie is almost completely out of the mix in the jam session at the end which is a huge part of the show. There are stunning parts, of course, because all the musicians are awesome but why would they release this dvd with these major sound problems? If you see it for 5 bucks, get it, it's worth about that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"G3 Shows are amazing","review":"I highly recommend going to see them live, but this DVD is the second-best thing to being there. I was pleasantly surprised by the length of the Vai set included on the DVD. When I saw only 3 songs listed for him, I thought it would be rather short. Not the case at all. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good fun","review":"let's seeJSatriani - leaving his looks aside, confirmed his studio work is much, much better. Sounded a little messy and repetitive to me-sorry!SVai - is my least favorite of the three, however puts out an incredible show. Has the best sound of the bunch, and his touch is unparalleled. I have to respect SVai even if I don't like his music too much. This is how aliens play the guitar. His acrobatic stunts (with a great band) are unbelievable.YMalmsteen - leaving his physical shape aside, was the surprise of the bunch. While on record tends to get boring after a few numbers (with the exception of his collaborations with the great Joe Lynn Turner), seeing him live was another thing. This guy just shreds (doh!). So much respect for Yngwie.Jam Session - the top of the DVD (on par with the Vai set). The three just let it rip without sounding like a rockfest jam session where everybody goes into different directions.I liked this DVD. 4 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"More G3 please!","review":"I recently purchased this DVD for alot more than it's being offered at here, so take advantage and take it home! It's a great DVD for guitar heads. I've watched an artist's section a day over the past week, and I watched the Malmsteen set at least daily. This kind of DVD will disorient you at first and leave you lifting your aspirations to play guitar to a much higher standard! I found that there was an occasional hiccup or stutter while using the Fret cam option, but all in all I recommend it. John Menna, M.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guitar!","review":"This is really good if you like guitar...and you more than likely do or you would't be reading this. The sound quality and camara work are fantasitc. These are some of the best guitar players alive. Nothing more to be said..check it out..you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for one watch.","review":"I am reviewing this and calling it average because one watch was enough for me. The Satch set-up was good, the Vai set-up was average and the Malmsteen set-up was crap. When I first saw Malmsteen play in the early Eighties I thought he was probably the most exciting guitar player since Randy Rhoads. But that was 20 years ago and you can only listen to this kind of music for so long before you fall asleep. Vai's music, though technically superb, is dull and lifeless for me. I always thought his guitar dual in the film 'Crossroads' and his material with Roth was always outstanding, but his playing now, is just boring. Satch is my favaourite from the genre, his album 'Surfing with the Alien' is the best solo guitar album of the Eighties. Overall though Live in Denver is worth watching, but there isn't really much material to replay on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING SHOW","review":"If you are looking at this DVD, you probably already know who these guys are. It starts off good with Satriani doing his thing, but Vai and Malmsteen steal the show. The jam at the end with all three is just a bonus. A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Satch &Vai; are top notch creative players.Always progressing.I believe Vai is the bestafter Hendrix...so full of ideas&emotion.;A real treat to see Tony Macapline+BillySheehan on his team.The best Band line up.The only problem is nostalgic Yngwie stuck in the80's... hair +music &all.; He looks like Fat bastardfrom Austin Powers shredding now.He hasn't grown asan axman.Playing the same music &sound; as when hewas 19 doing that neo-classical runs back in 82.Vai now beatshim in speed.Yngwie lay off the booze&porter; housesteaks mate.Go back to your Fire & Ice days...trynew & different sounds.Take lessons from Satch...lol!!!Beside all that I luv this DVD.It has inspired me to recordsome new stuff&experiment; like Vai &Satch;."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Okay...i've watch this dvd...and it is worth buyin'....i like the rock in the free world song...but it seems...it doesn't fit putting satriani, vai, and yngwie together....why don't they produce the one with petrucci...i was looking forward with the pettruci on it..well it is worth buying though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar heaven!","review":"I saw G3 in Boston, I believe it was 1998 or 99. John Petrucci of Dream Theater was in the line-up and it was an unbelievable show. This line-up with Yngwie Malmsteen is just jaw-dropping. Yngwie definitely spiced up the show. The jam at the end was the best. They all played together beautifully, going off into their individual leads and then coming together. Although all the songs are great, I have to say my favorite is Little Wing. I watch/listen to this DVD every morning on the treadmill and the 30 minutes just flies by."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"I have to admit that this wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. Joe was cool, but it's all the same stuff. And what's up with Steve having only three songs?! His live at Astoria is pretty sickening! Way more recomended! And good grief, hows about laying off the Krispey Kremes Ing-wee!! It was sad to see someone who used to be one of the more exciting players to watch be so weird looking. I mean his playing is cool, if not the most tasteful, but wow! He looked like some kind of 80's version of Leslie West!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is unbelievable...3 guitar heros on one stage","review":"I had always admired the skills of these 3 guitarists. It's almost like a dream to see three of them playing on the same stage. This DVD is a must have for all the guitar shredders out there. VAI...SATRIANI...YNGWIE...see these guitar gods in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has something for everyone","review":"It doesn't matter whether you're a Satch, Vai or Yngwie fan. To me, this DVDcaptures the joy and excitement of watching three musicians create theirown sounds in one great package. Come on, how often can you find a deal like thisfor just under 11 bucks? The only flaw is that it should have been two CD's insteadof one!! BTW, my personal favorites in order were Vai, Satch and Yngwie. On 1996'sG3, my favorites in order were Satani, EJ, and Vai. Get both DVD's and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"G3 - Live In Denver","review":"This is a good DVD for the price. One problem though is in the 3 G3 Jam songs - Rockin' In the Free World, Little Wing, and Voodoo Child there is something wrong with the audio for Malmsteens guitar, you can barely hear it. You can hear his guitar fine on his solo set."},{"rating":"1","title":"kareoki with guitar","review":"Been a big fan for years but this is getting old. The more stuff that is released the more it reminds me of American Idol with guitar. Heres some generic backgroud music now jam along. Its kareoki!The guitar work has always been brilliant but the imagination behind the rest of the song structures has no innovation. They should just program the rest of the instruments! To me this is turning into showboating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandaughter loves it","review":"She likes it and it was a lot less than the one at the bookstore.

The item description says age 4-8 years, however the back cover indicated 4-6. I personally verified and this book is definitely NOT for children above 5 years of age. My 5 years old daughter's vocabulary is quite mature than what this dictionary has to offer. The only plus point are the illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great system for the money","review":"Bought this system locally a few days ago and am really pleased. Got a great price on it. Sound it really good. Highs are quite clean compared to a Yamaha system I was also looking at and the sub is powerfull with 100 self powered watts. Plenty of inputs except for S-video, but none of my other components have S-video either so it doesn't really matter to me. Remote control is decent, though somewhat confusing at first. I will control my reciever and TV, but doesn't seem to control my cable box. Setup took a little while, but that was mostly due to having to work behind my entertainment center with no light. Surround setup takes a bit of tweaking to get right but the manual lays it out decently though the info is sometimes a bit scattered around and hard to find.Overall a gread system for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Miss Loser.","review":"The cd is a compilation of Diana and The Supremes best music.

I wish I had read some reviews about how bad it was before I tuned in."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Chemistry . . . . with ANYBODY!","review":"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I've always liked Patrick Dempsey, even though I don't watch Grey's Anatomy. He was so good in \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\". What happened HERE??? From the very beginning scenes this movie was a train wreck. And he had ZERO chemistry with the supposed love of his life and none with his best friends either. Then add cartoonish Scottish characters, oh . . .just so SO bad. I was just stunned that the film was so poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?!","review":"Uhmmm...this wasn't that great. As a matter of fact it was downright mediocre and predictable. Some of the acting was so-so even though I think they could have picked a better love interest/best friend. That chick's performance really didn't do it for me. It tried to be funny but I only managed to chuckle at the scene with the old grandma. On the flip side, at least Kadeem Hardison got a paycheck this time around because Lord knows I haven't seen him in anything that relevant since \\"A Different World\\". Other than that, I think that the director and the remaining cast and crew, with the exception of Patrick Dempsey and Kadeem Hardison, should all donate their paychecks to aid the cyclone victims in Myanmar. That would have been a better idea than producing such mediocre rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst ever!!!","review":"It's such a shame that I have to give it even 1 star. Luckily my cable provider had it for free. I am SOOOOO glad that I didn't pay any money for it.Things that bothered me: The guys wouldn't play basketball with the geeky skinny guy.

Too many of movies are high in computerized mayhem, comic book characters and extra-human gymnastics and watery thin in plot, while the others are shallow, crude, unfunny and just plain dumb \\"romantic comedies-???) like this one.None of the delightful romantic tension between D B Sweeney and Moira Kelly in \\"The Cutting Edge\\" or the more mature interaction between Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton in \\"Somethings Got to Give\\" ever develops in this one.Don't waste your money.I wish the disc producers were quicker in transferring more of the old classics to the new format which is really incredible and worth the money, instead of putting out inane drivel like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love or Friendship","review":"Hannah and Tom are friends forever and when Hannah finds love and gets engaged to (Colin) she chooses her best friend Tom to be her Maid of Honor, yes a guy.

Can their friendship hold together even when love is concerned? Can friendship turn into love and last forever?

True, it starts off plausibly enough; chance are you'll enjoy the first half. But then it just gets more and more unbelievable, farcical, even, and distinctly distasteful. Plus it's gross in spots when that was entirely uncalled for.

Apparently some fell through the cracks, and they got a hold of 'Made of Honor'. Talk about every conceivable chick flick cliche heaped on from the get-go.

That's about it - the rest of the movie is shameless fodder for idiots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"Patrick Dempsey does have star power, but this movie is so cliched and so unappealing, that except for some nice countryside views of Scotland, it is not worth the price of any admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same as every other rom com out there","review":"I cannot for the life of me understand the person who \\"loves\\" romantic comedy films. 99.55% of them begin, continue, and end the same way. This one is no different. Guy is a bad boy, jerk who sleeps around with every girl he can. Girl is a goodie two-shoes who insists she would \\"never\\" be into a guy like that... but of coarse she is. Her love makes the bad boy into someone who for the first time ever wants to be monogomous. We've all seen this movie 10 million times before.In general I do not like rom coms, but once in a blue moon I come across one that fresh, different and cute.

This world view is extremely well thought out, and I had to keep reminding myself that it was written before World War II broke out. It reads more like an alternate history written after the war, rather than an extrapolation from before the war. While it would be easy to find the subject matter of this book depressing, in the end I was actually left with positive feelings.

The lie would be that the Nazis were extremely anti-female. I'm not saying they were saints, but I disagree with the position. Sure, they were bad, but that doesn't mean you can say that they ate baby heads on sticks, even if you put your propaganda in story format and then call it a \\"novel\\".

This director failed.... I guess what I was disappointed in the most was there just wasn't any magic..... not between the Mom and her son, nor any of her boyfriends.

The ending left one unsure. The whole movie wrestles with life after death. As a person who believes in life after death because Jesus Christ is my personal Savior, I found the theology in this movie to be awful. If you're going to say someone goes to heaven, you need to go to the One who created heaven and who decides who does go. God says if a person believes in His son, Jesus, as Savior, one goes to heaven, not if a person is good or \\"believes\\" without specifying what one believes in. God says it is the blood of Jesus that washes away sin. If a person doesn't believe this, God allows that, but heaven can only be claimed on God's terms.

In the first movie, The Giant Gila Monster it is fun to watch the teens hot rodding around in their souped up jalopies trying to escape the Giant Gila Monster. The songs are hilarious and the subplot of the young man trying to raise money for his little sisters braces makes no sense in the plot. The second movie on the DVD is the Killer Shrews. This movie has a better plot and makes a little more sense than the Giant Gila monster. Did anyone notice that the captain of the ship is the same actor who played Jim Lindsey the Guitar Player on The Andy Griffith Show. These movies are fun but dont expect too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whattda want for $7.00?","review":"Actually, I loved the movie \\"Gila Monster\\"! It was super seeing all those old (I mean old) hot rods. The slang the kids use is super neat to hear (Hey, Daddy!) The songs thrown in were a little silly, but they gave me a good chance to get a snack without pausing the DVD. Did I know how the whole thing was going to turn out in the end? YES, of course, but I still had a good time getting there. Honestly, if you are placing an order already, just go on and add this one too.

Seeing Kline, Ronstadt and Smith on the cover, as well as in the description, I believed this was the movie version. I should have read further through the reviews. However, the misleading was not necessary. How many have you sold to unsuspecting innocents like me? Even so, I would have enjoyed this, had it been acceptable quality. The quality is extremely poor, the remastering done very sloppily, the color washed out, and the camera angles leaving one quite distracted from the performance.

As elsewhere commented, this product is not worth buying.The production is a disaster, probably created to suck in buyers who may have seen the superb Lansbury version which unfortunately exists only on VHS as of this date, and failed to note her missing from this cast.Her absence is not the sole fault here.

Yeah, it's really that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"great performance, awful video","review":"This is an excellent performance, especially from Kevin Kline and George Rose. But the video quality is so awful (something the Broadway Theater Archive is infamous for) that it's only worth watching as just that, an archive, or if you are looking for good ideas for a performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - but poor Video Quality","review":"This is an excellent version of Pirates of Penzance - it is a shame about the poor video quality. I understand why it was so poor, but I wish it could be better. However, Patricia Routledge makes up for it.She is the best Ruth I have ever seen. (and I have seen/own pretty much every recorded version available in the US).I wish she had done the movie version instead of Angela Lansbury who was pretty good. I also wish there was a soundtrack available of Patricia as Ruth - I had to make my own by recording her songs off the DVD.I wish she would do a new one with modern technology so we could see her better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Without Angela Lansbury but fresh and vibrant","review":"For those who have seen the movie version with Angela Lansbury, you may be a tad disappointed--not that Patricia Routledge's performance is in any way lacking. Kevin Kline as the Pirate King dominates the stage. Linda Ronstadt seems a little timid on hitting those remarkable high notes. However, Linda and Rex Smith as a romance item is even more effective than in the movie version. There is a freshness and vitality to this stage version that is electric. Still, one has to wonder why there has not been a DVD of the movie version after all these years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality DVD","review":"This outdoor stage production seems like wonderful fun. It is playfully presented, and well acted and sung (for the most part). I was disappointed in the video since the colors seem to be washed out at times (especially when a white dress dominates the scene--it seems to bleed into the other colors). I was most disappointed in the sound quality. At times, the most prominent sound is a minor accompanying instrument. I strained to hear the faint voice in the background. Maybe my hearing is as bad as the nursery maid's, but you might want to look for another production."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the brilliance of Kevin Kline with a fantastic ensemble cast!","review":"Wanna have some fun?

We have had the VHS tape of the movie forever, and love it. Even our little kids love it now. So I was happy to see this was available. Like others have commented the sound can be poor and the video quality isn't great. But, to see it on the stage rather than a sound set is really cool. It is fun to see both the differnces and similarities. And, while we LOVE Angela Lansbury, it is a real hoot to see Patricia Routledge in the role. We have been fans of hers since discovering \\"Keeping Up Appearences\\", and she really gives a such an outsize presence to the role that Angela's seems a little \\"small\\" in comparison. Routledge was the deciding factor for us in making this purchase, and in spite of the poor production factors we were not disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be very careful.....","review":"If you expect the movie, then don't get this.

Please tell me I can still get my money back somehow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing purchase","review":"I thought I was purchasing the movie version of the musical and was very disappointed to see that it was a recording of the live musical.

I love the VHS version and I have been waiting for the Pirates of Penzance with Kevin Kline to come out on DVD for years. I had a lazer disc of it years ago and loved it. The picture on this DVD is so bad it is unviewable. It is blurry and was obviously done on a home camera. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. The audio is poor also so it cannot even be used as a CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Routledge Finally Captured","review":"Finally we have a permanent record of Patricia Routledge's definite performance as Ruth in \\"The Pirates of Penzance.\\" Whatever the DVD lacks in technical perfection is more than made up by a level of enthusiasm of the cast and audience, all of whom are having the time of their lives. If you've only heard Estelle Parsons on the LP or CD or seen Angela Lansbury in the fil version, you must buy this DVD to revel in Patricia Routledge. If you only know her from \\"Keeping Up Appearances,\\" you're in for a treat. As for Kevin Kline, George Rose and Rex Smith -- their performances are dazzling and fresh. This is Broadway -- and Gilbert and Sullivan -- at its spontaneous best."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a colossal disappointment!","review":"Gilbert & Sullivan - The Pirates of Penzance / Kline, Ronstadt, Smith, Routledge, Delacorte Theater (Broadway Theatre Archive)I've loved Gilbert & Sullivan operettas for upwards of 70 years. Now I'm grieving over the worst DVD reproduction of a performance it's ever been my misfortune to view. The sound is atrocious, the orchestra drowns out the lyrics time & again, the diction of various performers is unintelligible, the camera coverage is erratic & clumsy, the color is washed out, and...I could go on & on.

I had to toss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this version","review":"If you're looking to buy a copy of Pirates of Penzance for some light-hearted family entertainment, get the 1983 movie version.If you're a hard-core G&S; fan and you want your kids' first exposure to the music of Pirates to be complete and top-quality, get the D'Oly Carte CD.If you seek the thrill and energy of audience-cast interaction, attend a live performance. Pirates is popular enough that you should be able to find someone performing it within a day's drive.Better yet, do all three. :- )But unless you were there in the Central Park audience in 1980 (or for some other reason this specific performance holds sentimental value for you), don't pay money for this DVD. It really doesn't do justice to either the outstanding performance of the Broadway cast or what is arguably the masterpiece of Gilbert & Sullivan's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Recording","review":"This recording is simply DEFECTIVE.It opens with a disclamer about the quality of the recording, and boy, they are not kidding!This is not a simple case of VHS quality on a DVD.

And the audio quality is in the same league as early cheap casette recorders, complete with pitch shifts..It is clear that abosoltely no attempt was made to clean up or remaster this recording. Even the title credits suffer from from jitter distortion and there is time base noise at the bottom of each frame.Some example frames at VienneseBall dot org slash PiratesThis is particularly criminal because it was such a superb cast and inspired live performance.I am immediately returning this to Amazon.

If you love G&S, then you will love this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent music, poor quality","review":"No doubt that Pirates of Penzance is an excellent musical with a great score and lyrics. But this version of it, performed in front of a live audience in Central Park is of very poor quality. For example the video looks like it came from a bad TV show from the 60's. Second, the audio sounds as if the orchestra is louder than the actors most of the time. In fact most of the time, you can't hear the singing at all. My advice is, get the movie version instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is not the version of Pirates shown on Great Performances.

When I was young, my family had a movie version of this with the same actors, so when I saw \\"The Priates of Penzance\\" with Keven Kline, Linda Ronstadt and Rex Smith, I thought \\"great\\" and just bought it. WRONG! It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so obvious that it came from an analog source. Have you ever watched a video tape so many times that it jumps and hiccups and the picture gets all fuzzy and the sound gets all muffled? Well, they didn't even TRY to remaster it - they just copied it to disc. If you're going to buy this version, GET VHS - save yourself the couple of extra dollars - it's not worth it.PS the version that I had as a kid had Angela Lansbury, this one does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality of original source material","review":"I had the pleasure of seeing this production on Broadway, and was looking forward to receiving this DVD. It opens with an ominous warning that the 'digital re-mastering may reveal limitations of the source material'. Boy, they weren't joking. It looks like they got an old copy of the video tape, pulled it out of the cassette, dropped it into a bucket of Drano, and then transferred the result to DVD. For my money, not even the performances (seen murkily) can overcome this major short-coming. A great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"wonderful players, WORST possiable recording","review":"I bought a copy of this thinking it was the one with Angela Lansbury in it, all the rest of her fellow players are here but not her. Turns out that this is a live recording of Kline & the rest done in a theater with the absolute worst sound recording i have ever heard. The video is poor as well. perhaps it was done with single camcorder all-in-one. It really is all that bad a recording. The professional version including Angela Lansbury is still available on VHS but not DVD (it is wonderful). Do not waste your money on this offering by Kulter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor presentation","review":"This DVD should not appear in any professional listing.

This chain is extremely heavy and bulky (as it should be), so wrapping it around my seat bar every time I move gets tiresome. Regardless of this size concern, I NEVER think twice about where I leave my bike (other than any weather concerns). Bike theft is all too common around campuses and near cities, but this chain/lock combo is about as solid as it gets...Edit - after further research, it appears this lock is not really that secure.

Yolanda has been one of my favorite singers since I was small and this new album just reestablishes herself as the \\"Queen of Gospel.\\" I must admit, however, that her last album, \\"Songs From the Heart,\\" disappointed me. There were only about 4 or 5 songs on there that I really liked. But this new album, with the exception of the first song, makes us for all that! I reccomended it to anyone that just LOVES great gospel music.

There is nothing written on the CD or box to indicate that these are alternate takes, or the standard double-talk disclaimer \\"These are new stereo recordings by one or more members of the original group.\\" United Audio Entertainment's website states that they are in business to exploit music, and exploit it they do. There oughtta be a law against this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent images, POOR QUALITY cover!","review":"The previous reviews cover the quality of the images in this book. I cannot say it any better. So, I'll touch on one little pet peeve I have.I'm puzzled that Arena Editions would release this book with such an inferior cover. The compressed, uncoated cardboard cover just invites disaster! Not only is it prone to staining, it is also VERY susceptible to moisture and denting... much more than the average hardcoverI know, I know... \\"you should be careful when handling books... blah blah blah\\" That doesn't do away with the fact that this book demands to be handled! The images are too good to let this simply be a \\"coffee table\\" book. This is a sure fire page turner that must be protected in some way.Before purchasing this book, I STRONGLY suggest you also purchase some soft cotton gloves and a book cover of some sort; and most of all, don't out it on the coffee table!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comments...","review":"Hmmm... \\"too much technique\\"... very interesting, this reminds me of the reaction of the art world to the inclusion of photography as an art form back about 40 years ago.. \\"not enough technique\\"... But, now we have an artist, using photo graphic images she has taken, and manipulating them in the most incredible and extraordinary ways. These go way beyond photography, yet have the sense of caught moments in early photo history using silver plate technique.Regrets? Yes, the cover, though handsome, seems cheap and too fragile to include with the excellent quality of the photo reproductions inside; and I would like to have more information on her \\"techniques.\\" I feel that Sarah is probably afraid to discuss it since she will likely be snubbed by the photographic world, especially if she does anything outside of a dark room with conventional tools, very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much technique","review":"I wanted to like this book and I probably would have liked it more if it had been about 1/3 as long. The technique weighs down the images and I could only take small doses.

After buying other books I am happy that there is finally a serious book on the market. Don't save money with cheaper books. If you buy this one, you can forget about all the others. The teaching method is refreshing. Right from the beginning you start with useful words and expressions. You always have the feeling that you don't lose your time. The explanations are clear and \\"friendly\\". I rate this wonderful book with 4 stars only, because the fonts used for the Armenian letters are a headache for the beginner. They are too calligraphic, they should be more simple (and different from each other!). I wished that this be changed in the next edition - the 5 star edition! Another wish is, that this book be accompanied by audio-cassettes. In that case you really don't need anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A piece of art!\\"","review":"The moment I opened the book, I knew it was well worth the investment! The language is broken down into nice segments for learning, and transliteration is used until the end when it is assumed the learner can read the script. The methodology for teaching the script (reading and writing), to me, provides a guarantee this will happen. This book, compared to others I have used for Eastern Armenian, shows how to write the script. Another \\"plus\\" this course offers.Anyone wanting to learn Western Armenian should buy this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The book is great for learning Western Armenian.The only thing that I would love to have is the CD of the lessons of the book, that would make it more complete.I hope that in a new edition of the book the author should add a CDAlso the Armenian letter should be more big."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor ending to a good story","review":"I don't want to spoil the story for those who haven't read it.

It reminded me of the movie \\"Cheaters\\" which I saw on HBO last year (and which was about a high school teacher who allows his students to cheat).My thumb is down for Lord of the Deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unequivocally awful","review":"This was a truly terrible story of a boy who idolizes his stepfather only to learn that the stepdad is not honest. So what does the boy do? Crushed, he goes along, having no real choice, according to the author's telling. A generous reading would call this book amoral; I think bad is more accurate. So the point is? Kids who are better than their parents should go down with them? Let's get our kids really depressed and cynical? Let's let kids think it's okay to accept dishonesty, if it means not upsetting people? That it's okay to cheat? I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay book with disappointing ending","review":"For the most part, the story line of the book carries the reader along. There are parts when the fishing gets really exciting. However, I hate it when authors talk about boredom. When they write that their character is bored, I get bored reading it, and that's not fun. I thought the display of Mikey's trust and love towards his step father was touching, but I guess I felt betrayed at how the ending played out. I know that it's impossible to ask for perfect hero action out of Bill, and that's fine that he wasn't a hero, but the scene where Mikey confronts Bill is so unbelievable, it makes the entire book seem unbelievable. I put it down thinking I had wasted my time on a story that was pulling the wool over my eyes, and that doesn't make me feel good about myself. Rather disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by an 11 year old boy who enjoys fishing stories","review":"The story 'Lord of the Deep' is a story about a thirteen year old deckhand working on a charter boat in Hawaii working for his stepdad Bill. If you are someone who likes fishing you would love this book. The reason Mikey is a deckhand at such a young age is that his stepdad trusts him. I have had similar times fighting a big fish like Mikey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Way To Learn","review":"I really enjoy this DVD and the various routines. The instructor's voice is calming and I feel my flexibility increasing. The variety of routines, at least 15 or so even at the beginner level, is great and helps make the video fresh and new. I plan on using this for a long time. As others pointed out, just make sure to listen to the intstructions and relax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy, stop and go, no flow at all","review":"I cannot believe that this video has as many positive ratings as it does. This is the choppiest yoga video I have ever had the misfortune of watching. If you are at all accustomed to a normal, flowing routine, this video will drive you as crazy as it does me. Each pose is just an individual video segment. Fade in... pose... fade out.... Fade in... next pose...fade out. It's absolutely horrible. Sadly, I can't return a DVD after opening it so I'm stuck with it... or rather, my local garbage dump is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I do not have the patience for this DVD. I do not have any trouble falling asleep on my own. A little mental relaxation is good, but I feel like I'm wasting time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"This video is chopped up into segments, one segment per pose. There is no flow to this video, you do one pose a few times, wait for the next clip to start and do that one, and so on. Whoever came up with the idea of putting a yoga video together like this clearly does not understand what people want in a yoga video. Putting the video into segments by pose is a terrible idea. I wish I could get my money back. The description also needs to be changed so that shoppers have a better idea of what they're purchasing. I hate this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Having An Instructor at Home","review":"Im not the biggest fan of yoga, but started taking classes two months ago just to see what all the talk has been about and feel in love with yoga for is ability to elevate me to a higher level mentally and emotionally. I've bought a few videos, but what I liked most about this one was how slow the practice tended to be which as first may seem kind of odd, but I liked it because I didnt feel rushed or that I was in competition with anyone else which you sometimes feel part of a large class. I am able to learn more about each poses and their benefits as well as proper alignment. For those looking to learn more about Yoga in-depth Id say it's a great buy and learning tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technology Is Amazing","review":"It gets me how far we've come with at home fitness videos, and this DVD is certaintly on the forefront. I've been practicing yoga for little over a year, but depending entirely on getting to studio, which is almost 45 minutes from home. This DVD was the perfect solution and the instruction is nice, offering variations for poses that may be too difficult for some and series of poses that help relieve stress especially after a hard days work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and slow, more suited for beginners","review":"This video moves very slowly with long pauses between the poses in which they announce the name of the next pose. The instructor's voice is also very monotonous which makes you want to fall asleep instead of working hard. The intermediate and advanced routines that I tried were, first of all, very similar in the level of difficulty, secondly, the level of difficulty itself was more suited for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"yoga dvd review","review":"I did not find this to be a DVD I would use again. The routines were interesting, but kept repeating, and required a high degree of flexibility and balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga video","review":"I was disappointed with this product. though they show you a variety of poses, the poses do not flow together and therefore can not be used as a routine.

The setting and presentation were dull, and the narration was excessive and monotonous. The routines had no flow or energy. And even though there are \\"35 routines\\" to choose from, many of the same poses are used over and over again, so you are not actually getting much variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING/POOR EDITING","review":"The voice over and sound quality is TERRIBLE! .

I really don't like this video and can't see it's value relative to most other yoga DVDs I've tried. Not sure if others will find use, but I think it's confusing, not well produced and there's way too much space between segments.

Too many options and all of them are pretty similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"yoga for every body.","review":"I really really like this dvd!!! You are given many choices in which level you want to start at. The timing is just right and the lady's voice is not annoying like other women's voices. I highly recommend this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent travel partner.","review":"I bought this DVD to take with me on a three week trip so that I could retain some practice while I was away from classes. It offers a lot of variety with 25 to 45 minute sessions at both basic and intermediate levels. The instruction is clear and the longer sessions flow well. You will need a strap, and maybe a block. Some of the shorter sessions seem to move to quickly, but being able to \\"pause\\" at different positions works. I beleive it could be used to learn positions if you are a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga for every body","review":"This DVD for Yoga is the best DVD I have purchased. It has many different levels for every person.

I've bought a few DVDs and this is the first one I've stuck with. I can find a workout no matter how much time I have to put in that day, or what I feel like. There's so much to choose from. This isn't the standard 2-4 routines of 30 minutes. It's good instruction and a great home practice yoga video"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if you already know yoga","review":"I got this DVD primarily for the variety it offered. There are tons of options both time-, level-, and purpose-wise, which I love since I like to do yoga pretty often. Because of this format though, transitions between poses are pretty choppy, and there is no warmup or meditative beginning to the ones I have tried so far. Because of this, I think that it's better for people who have already done some yoga, whether from another video or a class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many workouts, great directions","review":"I purchased this yoga CD based on previous customer reviews. It appealed to me that customers were saying it had a great variety of workouts. That is totally true. You can choose from many, many workouts according to how you feel or how much time you have. I do a workout every day and still get surprised.On the not so hot side: the scenery is not as hip and chique as other workout DVDs.A PLUS PLUS: I have been doing yoga for many years with multiple instructors. The VERBAL DIRECTIONS the teacher gives you in this DVD rank top on my instructors list. She is constantly giving you very specific cues about where it should be felt, how to get in and out of the poses, etc, which makes it perfect for both beginners and advanced students wanting to improve their practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless options","review":"This is one of the most versatile and detailed yoga instructions I have ever seen. I got it on one of the Amazon deals where they have two products together for a discount. After actually getting on the mat and doing the routines I couldn't be happier. J.J. gives the most detailed instruction I've ever had, (including some classes I've been to). I'm glad I decided to get this DVD and would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about yoga and really get into the details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video","review":"I think this is an excellent video for people of all abilities and flexibilities! The instructor constantly reminds for that you should not go further than your body is able. This is helpful, because your less likely to hurt yourself doing the poses.I did feel a little sore after doing my first workout, but thats because I am the most un-flexible person every. Despite being a little sore, I felt energized after each workout. A half-hour a day really helps a lot!I would recomend this video to anyone who wants to try out yoga, or any one of any skill level, because you can keep challenging yourself to do the harder poses and workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for every body","review":"Yoga for every body doesn't begin to offer yoga for various bodies. I have no idea why it is given that name. There is no real introduction, no suggestions on how to use the DVD, and the routines I checked out included no suggestions for modifications for difficulties with any of the positions. I am mystified. Maybe the routines are easier than the usual? Even if so, that does not make them useful for a great many of us.Perhaps for beginners without any restrictions or body difficulties."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"There is no flow to the routines. One minute she's lying down and the next second she's standing. A very pooor editing job. There's alot better stuff out there that works you thru an entire routine from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy This","review":"ught this with the idea that I really couldn't do yoga, but since it said it was for Every Body - I figured that was me. I went to a yoga class - actually 2 different ones, and I thought yoga wasn't for me. This dvd changed my mind. The classes always seemed to rush through everything and I felt lost. This video had a nice slow, clear pace that I could follow. Some of the things I like most are the most simple things on it - exercises for the hands and wrists and the eyes. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot that is challenging as well. I have ordered the \\"Power Yoga for Every Body\\" from the same company and looking forward to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Video I Ever Owned","review":"I been practicing yoga for about 2 years and found this DVD to be very comparable to being in class. The instruction is clear and concise and perfect for beginners and advance alike. The variety which you get for the price is incredible especially when you look at what else is out on the marketplace, you cant go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga for Every Body","review":"I had this DVD before and it it the best yoga DVD I have ever found. I like it because it has beginner, intermediate, and advanced workouts, and different length workouts in each of theses areas. Italso has workouts that target different areas of the body, or themes such as \\"centering\\" or \\"mobilization\\".Also, I love the way J.J. Gromley guides you through the poses so thet you stretch what you are supposed to be stretcing and get the full value of the pose.Doing yoga is truly a pleasure with this DVD. As a result I do yoga almost every day. When I am not feeling strong I can pick one of the easier sets. When I feel well I can do the 70 minute advaced workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"choppy video, not really class form","review":"I am a beginner to yoga and was looking for something to take me to the next level. Although, there are many options on this video, it is all pieced together and not in a class format. Did not like this at all! Instructors voice was also annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too scared to watch....","review":"I was excited to watch and follow the yoga routines in this DVD after seeing so many positive reviews on Amazon. The cover of the DVD looks promising too. I'm not sure if it's just me but the lady in the video scared the crap out of me. Something about her voice and body were just not right.... She's also in this room with all these eerie decorations instead of a relaxing waterfall, green grass, or Feng shui type of room like normal yoga videos. Not sure how to describe it but it's like walking into your great grandmother's house that hasn't been redecorated in a while because she died years ago. I thought I was being paranoid so I showed it to my friend to get a second opinion. I threw this video in the trash that same day."},{"rating":"1","title":"too slow, a bit borig","review":"I recommend it to the more elderly population, or if you want to meditate more than exercise...For me it is too slow and make me want to fall a sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I gave this video a 1 because I could not give a 0. This was a big waste of money. I wish I could return it and just get my money back. First of all the want more than just laying on the floor breathing or rolling my neck. I did not want meditation I want workout. Maybe I missed something here but this was just not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've seen","review":"Although I skip the lengthy intro, it is plainly taught, good for all levels, and the instructor is just very good, not a lot of new age nonsense like other yoga videos I've seen, just excellent professional teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite yoga DVD","review":"I love this DVD because I can choose whichever workout I feel like that day.

It is great how much is on this one video."},{"rating":"2","title":"A teacher's teacher","review":"I am a yoga teacher. I return to this DVD over and over for my personal practice, and recommend it to beginning students who want to develop a practice at home. I've enjoyed doing these sequences for five years, and have trusted the instruction enough that I've suggested it to dozens of new students. I lost the disc when I moved, and am purchasing a replacement now.

Really, Ms. Gormley has created one of the most thoughtful yoga videos, with excellent demonstration and verbal instruction with is essential in helping practitioners attain proper alignment and flow.

People called this video \\"disjointed\\" because they pull from numerous routines in making up other routines, but it is easy to follow. I thought I would not be able to work with JJ because she is so tall (and thin, ha ha) but I follow along fine. Also, she demonstrates several variations to each pose, and reminds you not to push too far. I liked her instructions on exactly what she means when she says things like \\"move the hip points toward each other\\". She ends many segments with the relaxation pose and takes you through a relaxation exercise. Beautiful. To me, this is what the exercise portion of Yoga is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video","review":"I like the format for this video, it has 5 or 6 routines for Beginner, Inter, and Advanced level which is nice to rotate through.

I don't usually read autobiographies, but something about Lauck's story grabbed me. She shows true insight into herself and others. Occasionally I felt she (or her younger self) missed some possible insight, but that only served to emphasize that she reveals herself so clearly as to give readers a chance to truly know her, and thus reach their own conclusions.

The singing and dancing are top notch and the storylines are romantic in a sweet, childlike way. The movies are basically about making friends and having fun. The third and final installment has the added plus of emphasizing the importance of picking a college and growing up to be a thoughtful and productive member of society. I like the broad characterizations and don't mind over-the-top antics in the musical genre. They seem to fit quite well against a backdrop of spontaneous musical outbursts.And for those of us who are not preteens, that Zac Efron kid is something else. I know he's young, but he has the magnetism of someone who is not jailbait. So while I'm still unable to tolerate Hannah Montanna and her brethern, I'm okay with what director Kenny Ortega has created in the HSM World.

They're cheesy, but they're always entertaining. I think Highschool Musical 3 is a really well made film with great music, some good acting, and it's just a good time for the whole family. Some of the actors in the film aren't that great, they're way too cheesy for me to find them believable, but Ashley Tisdale is actually pretty decent at being the snobby diva and Zach Efron is actually a good stage performer. Other than that, most of the cast is slightly forgettable. Good movie and good musical. I have a weak spot for musicals and disney, so this one gets the better side of me. ps it looks great on blu ray, I'm glad this is how I saw it for the first time, however, i think ima skip out on 1 and 2...I've never seen them but...they must be alot cheesier than the 3rd one. Ok maybe I will rent. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Musical is Back!!!","review":"Packed with jump out of your seat and dance music, the High School Musical series is something I think everyone could enjoy. I saw the third film before seeing the earlier two and I think it is the best one of them all!

It is full of teens prioritizing boyfriends/girlfriends over college and ends with a strong \\"my high-school girlfriend is all that I live for\\" vibe. The songs are beyond annoying and repetitive.

The songs are very catchy and the acting by Zac Effron and Vanessa Hudgens (especially on the roof when they were doing a dance) was top of the line. This is almost a classic movie, but a movie the whole family will enjoy. I watched it by myself at the Blue Ridge Cinemas and really liked it. I am thinking of later watching it again on DVD from Blockbuster, Netflix, or Redbox.I am hoping for a High School Musical 4; Freshman College Year next Spring!

Let somebody else do FR novels instead of him, please? And for those of you howling about how it's 'official', I beg to differ. The book was written from that sluggard Malik's perspective. It's complete allegory and hearsay, therefore it doesn't seem to be something that WotC will build upon. At least they better not...So, rejoice. Look to the Prince of Lies as the last 'offical' word on the goings-on of the FR gods (or to the trilogy of FR gods-related books such as Faiths & Avatars, Powers & Pantheons, and Demihuman Deities--at least James Lowder and Eric Boyd know the Realms well enough, both in novel and game terms!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"...nuff said","review":"this book was not only a waste of time, it was also a big waste of money, and a big waste of the author's talent.

In this case Troy Denning totaly destroies the characters of Kelemvor and Midnight created by James Lowder and Scott Ciencin respectively. Troy Denning decides to turn Kelemvor into something that he would not have had Lowder written this book and had Midnight just cry about it.Also, the way in which it was written was bad. Not that Denning is a bad writter, but writing from the first person is very difficult and he did not accomplish what he set out to in this book.I think Denning destroyed the entire Faerunian Pantheon single handedly with this book. If you want a good ending to the Avatar Trilogy just stop reading at Price of Lies by James Lowder. It gives you a much more refreshing feeling when you are done rather than a putrid feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aliens:3 & Highlander:2 are not the worst sequels","review":"Don't waste your time reading this book.

This book was about as flavorful as frozen orange juice made with 4 cans of water rather than 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maddness at it's best","review":"This novel unfolds the truth about Gods of Forgotten Realms. A reader will learn the history powers allies and true nature of each of the gods. That alone is reason enough to read it. But I feel that the most important things about this story is the point of view it's told from. A mad man, one lost in the love of his own God but not because of faith but because of power he will receive for staying in his favor. As you read this novel feel yourself as a mad man would. Cyric is the God of madness and for that reason the story is being told by a mad man. This allows the reader to truly see and feel what we will never (hopefully) feel in our lives and more importantly what Cyric truly feels. Read this novel if you true want to understand what goes on in the forgotten realms but even more importantly, when a God goes mad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful new perspective on the Forgotten Realms Universe","review":"Through the eyes of Malik a fat, dim witted, sniveling, coward, new light is shed upon not just the perspective of the \\"good\\" but also that of the \\"evil\\".

This book is great if you could not get enough of Prince of Lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some so called 'writers' should leave a good series alone...","review":"What the hell is wrong with this writer!?!?!?!?!?Is this the type of person who thinks 'What a great series!

Writers like this really get on my nerve and should refrain from writing rubbish like this piece of trash. My opinion? If you read the previous books, leave this one in the 'bargain bin' where it belongs...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crucible","review":"My largest problem with this book is that it is told through the words and deeds of a follower of the wicked god Cyric - and Cyric is by far one of the most despised characters I have ever come to know in any series of novels. Why, then, would I want to read a book where the heroes of the first books are referred to in ignorant insults? And in the first moments of the book, characters from the previous book are cut down without much thought, and that bugs me. I did not care for this novel at all, and it's a shame, because Mr. Denning has talent - the Prism Pentad series, for example! Now those I can recommend! But alas! I cannot, and will not, suggest this, even to fans of the books that have come before."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good but...","review":"...it's, like another reveiwer said, written from Malik's pen. Not that it's bad, but to read a story viewed by a follower of a mad god doesn't agree with me. Yes, Malik is amusing, and his view of the gods is funny. But hey, it's not quite \\"official\\". i.e. Mystra told Ao she wanted to destroy Cyric because she's jealous of his power??? I've nothing against this style, but the story is too twisted. Actually, it's jsut as twisted the way Cyrinishad is."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's alright.","review":"It is an interesting perspective looking through the eyes of a minor villian like Malik.

The trailer looked great but 15 minutes into the movie I was already falling asleep. Skip it save your money this isn't even a wait for cable TV movie..Spoiler Warning... The horror element of this movie should have hit the cutting room floor, it was awkward and had me saying WTF? The movie would have been better if they just focused on the lesbian teenage love story and did away with the horror element. The movie was about 25 minutes too long and the majority of the movie had very little dialogue wich made it a complete bore. I didn't care for the Diane character, at times I was wondering if she actually had a brain. Its a shame this wasn't better especially since there aren't many good lesbian movies.

Is it a love story or a monster movie? Neither really. The werewolf/monster is so poorly made it is laughable. The odd animations make no sense. (Hair moving in and out of what appear to be organs is plain weird but since the beast, when seen, has no hair why use hair symbolism to represent the monster?)Okay, so we get it Love is a Monster. But this picture fails to bring that point home at any point.The best monster element was the masturbation scene where she kicks the lamp off the end table with a clawed foot.Switching and mixing up who might be the wolf in this film left this viewer completely confused as to who was supposed to be the monster in the relationship or was the relationship the monster?The story idea had potential.

Focusing on the power and control that Teresa, Magdalena, and Antoinette wield in the ghetto, we watch their sons and catch a glimpse of their interwoven, sometimes heartrending, sometimes-comical lives as they live in the tenement. The mother's lives center around protecting their sons at all costs, and often these methods can be rather unusual.Although the author developed the characters well, I felt that the plot was terribly weak. The story didn't seem to go anywhere and fell flat. It was, however, an interesting peek into the seemingly simple but truly complex lives of those who lived in the ghettos from the 1940's through 1950's."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyment plus","review":"since viewing this particular DVD on t.v. oneSunday afternoon, I strived to purchase it as it gave me such pleasure to watch.

The microwave method didn't work for us (can't melt cement in a microwave) so I used a pot on the stove - and unfortunately, the residual gum stuck and ruined the pot - yet the instructions did not warn me about this!Second, even with the flavoring and sugar we added, the gum tasted pretty awful, and the texture was grainy.I hope Discovery can improve the flavor/texture of the gum base because this is a great concept for kids, and we would love another try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun idea but not really that great","review":"My kids had a lot of fun making the gum and reading about polymers.

The kneading of the product was easy for my kid to do. They thought it was cool to chew their home-made gum!However, though the initial flavor was good, the flavor lasted a mere 20 seconds, and then it became tasteless hard rubber in your mouth.

The good part about this book was the party at the end.I give Nate the Great and the Monster Mess 5 stars. It was awesome because Nate and Sludge are detectives.

I found the overuse of the analogy to boxing got old real fast. Very little practical information for the beginner Raw Foodist of the why's and wherefor's. I found it to be entirely too extreme and fanatical. If this had been the first book I ever read on the Raw lifestyle I would have been instantly turned off and gone back to just being vegetarian or stayed with the S.A.D."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a much younger reader!","review":"I was really disappointed in this book as it was my first attempt to get in touch with raw eating. If you're a 12 yr old with a Karate Kid attitude then this book is for you. Not a good book if you're looking for help with transition to a raw food diet. Very little mention of what you should eat on a raw food program other than the obvious (fresh veggies and fruit), just a lot of caveman hype about what to avoid eating, drinking, smoking or swallowing. And the spelling and grammar were atrocious as well. Sorry Paul, better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginers, OK for more experienced","review":"I found this book to be very basic about the subject. I am already 50 percent on my way to this diet ideal, so I am not a beginer. But,I found the affirmations against bad food groups to be helpful. The author encourages you to vocalize your affirmations. ie. \\"I do not want to drink alcohol, I will have water instead\\". This is a good idea that will help me. Also, it was great to find out more about weight loss and teeth problems associated with this diet. The interviews at the end of the book were helpful and inspiring. The book was a good and easy read, but like a lot of raw food books, it is written in a way that makes the diet seem less scientific and more like a fad. High inspiration, low scientific method. Depends on what you need. I will keep it in my health library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"This book has got to be one of the most horribly written books I have ever seen. I seriously wonder what kind of company would publish something like this. Thank God I got it from the library. The grammar and spelling are horrible and the material doesn't flow very well. The constant boxing analogies are totally unnecessary and take away from the value of the underlying information.Right from the get go I was disappointed with this book. As soon as I read the Foreward by David Wolfe I wanted to put the book down. It read like it was written by a teenager.Although this book contains some decent information about raw foodism, the writing style and use of the boxing analogy completely take away from any sort of benefit. If you are looking to spend money on a book about raw food, PLEASE do not waste your money on this. Rent it from the library if you think you might actually like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in CHINA","review":"I had thought that all Yellow Jacket extension cords were made in the USA when I bought this product for my dad for Father's Day.

I'm a huge fan of Madonna's remixes, and more often than not, she manages to find the most club-savvy artists to tweak her records. Arguably the centerpiece of her current project MUSIC, 'What It Feels Like For A Girl' stands as one of Madonna's finest recorded moments. Unfortunately, some songs occasionally suffer under a remixer's hands, simply because the original IS so original that tampering with it taints it. Tracy Young contributes passable versions of the tune, but far below the great work she did on 'Music' and 'Don't Tell Me'. Richard\\"Humpty\\"Vission contributes a remix steeped in retro-disco vibes, with middling results. Only the \\"Above And Beyond\\" remix shows any real flair, and it's basically a dub mix.

Will someone new step up to the plate?I probably would have given this single 3 stars, if it weren't for the AWFUL Spanish version of WIFLFAG. The translation is weak and contrived, and Madonna's delivery is so laboured and grating to the ear. Is this the same woman that gave us the awesome \\"Veras (You'll See)\\"?

The remixes are amazing. The one shot for the video is the best one. There is a long version and a short version of the song. It basically explains Madonna's pregnancy and what it really feels like. The video was directed by her husband Guy Ritchie. It was not shown because of the violence associated with it. I have seen more violent videos on MTV.

It takes a look at 33 people from soldiers to CIA to nurses and tracks their experiences and memoirs form the war. These are sometimes very short no more than a page and the longest ranges about 10 pages. It is very clearly written and the interviews are top notch. It is one of the few books that shows how horrifying it was to be a non combatant as well as a combatant. The nature of the war is expressed clearer here than most books that focus on a specific battle. It is really possible to see the genesis of the whole war. This is a must have for any Vietnam war scholar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Oral History","review":"This is a very readable oral history of U.S. participation in the Vietnam War by those that were there. Author Al Santoli lets 33 men and women tell their stories, arranged in a sort of chronological order. We learn about our early participation, the TET offensive, the later years, etc. We hear from grunts, nurses, and some officers. The book doesn't have a strong theme other than to allow the veterans to tell their stories. And that they do openly and in stark terms, without rationalizing or justifying, and usually without much sense of necessity or patriotism. The result is a moving look at what the grunts endured in an ugly and questionable conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal view","review":"This collection of interviews doesn't really give a overall view of the war. It does give the view from a very personal perspective. The interviews range from the grunt in the field, to nurses, to higher commands. I got the feeling the histories given reflected what the experience did to the interviewees afterword more than during the experience. It sounded like it would be something you heard in a Vietnam support group. Nonetheless, interesting reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating of Everything We Had by Al Santoli","review":"We are very disappointed with your service!

'Kill! Kill!' 'What is the spirit of the bayonet?' 'TO KILL!' It was just a bummed-out trip.\\"You're right, Rawls. The Army's not the Boy Scouts. But that quote pretty much says it all for Santoli's book. He gathered the most disgruntled vets he could find, plus at least one poseur, to write an oral history of the Vietnam War. The problem is that not all vets view their service with the same bitterness and cynicism that Santoli's thirty-three representatives do. If you're an America-hating university professor, and you're teaching a class that touches on the war, this is the book to have your class read. If, on the other hand, you want a balanced and more well-rounded understanding of the Vietnam War, look elsewhere. A good book that comes to mind is Eric M. Bergerud's Red Thunder, Tropic Lightning."},{"rating":"2","title":"required reading...","review":"This is required reading this month, and this book really opened up my eyes. What Al Santoli was trying to show in his book was that even though many soldiers went through different experiences, they had many of the same thoughts. What it brought out clearly to me was that there were 2 types of American Vietnam Veterans, the Elites and the Grunts. Al Santoli brought to light some very important details concerning why Vietnam veterans now are dealing with so much pain. If you don't think so, take a highlighter and go read it again.

The cape is thin and cheeply made, we didn't use it. The bow is small and made from really cheap plastic, we couldn't use it at all. The cuffs we did use, but I had to cut them and add some velcro because they were huge. The arrows are just dowels with a fabric head. I added feathers and used that end to hang out of the quiver. The quiver is small, I added some foam board to it to make it larger, then I used gold paint to paint over the design and added some gold leaves to make it all blend together. I then had to add some styrofoam to the inside of the quiver to hold the arrows, since the arrows were so short. So basically I used the costume as a base and remade everything"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"One of the worst introductory books I've seen. There are many unrelated windows/OOP topics in the first week. When teaching you the programming, I found the difficulty level is poorly handled.

The fundamentals of the language were not focused on strongly enough and the author's attempts at humor were more distracting from the topic than funny. I'm glad this book came free with my copy of Delphi Desktop because I wouldn't buy it over something like Marco Cantu's Mastering Delphi or Peter Norton's Guide to Delphi if I was shopping now.

He omits the compleat Kicho forms ( but includes them is his other two books)The self defense section however,is for the beginner only.

The book also presents examples of breaking techniques and has an excellent step by step easy to learn section on Pal-Gwe Poomse.

But that was a few years back. This one tends to make me believe that he must be going through a mid-life crisis to have written this colorless, odorless waste of time. It reads like one of Jane's fabricated program ideas, and perhaps that's what it is - the joke's on us, McCauley just wanted to see if we would read and \`say' we enjoyed this just because it has his name on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Black Sabbath CD","review":"This CD has every Black Sabbath song you will ever need and plus a nice 48 page booklet containing rare pictures and a little biography.

If you want too start on Black Sabbath this CD is for you.For the price of $28.99 you get two CD's a 48 page booklet and all in all about 30 some songs. A pretty good deal if you ask me.

The makers would have been well suited to include a few more tracks off Technical Ecstacy or never Say Die but I can't say I didn't get my money's worth.

If you want to hear EVERYTHING that Ozzy/Sabbath did in the 70's without having to buy every album, this is the way for you to go.

Emily still sings about love and life's journeys...true to what we all know Emily to be...Amy simply sets my heart on fire with this one...\\"Dairy Queen\\" resembles something we have all been through...breaking up and knowing it's right, yet still feeling love for the other person.

Cruising down highway 101 (in oregon) I was sold after the first 10 seconds of \\"Fill it Up Again.\\" Their ability infuse issues that scratch to get up from under our skin with catchy pop-esque tunes is exhilirating.

It is wonderful to hear them harmoizing again, and playing off of each other rather than as two seperate musicians on one stage. I have missed the blending of their vocies and instruments like they used to do in the olden days....The only thing I hated about it is that I hate it when Amy makes you get your dictionary out to look up a word in one of her songs.....(yes, I had to look up manumission) but then again it is good to learn new words now aint it?Anyhoo, Awsome CD, beautiful vocalizations, and a wonderously soothing CD from my favorite band."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 out of 12 people agreed...","review":"Our Mystery Club reviewed THE DUTCH this month(September). 10 out of the 12 of us agreed that we don't care for the most recent Jacovich novels.

I heard Ms. Whitfield in person in SF several years ago and enjoyed her performance. However, on this album, her consistently flat (as in pitch) delivery made it astonishingly difficult to listen to.

Her Aunts realize this fact (though to one of them he apparently has some appeal) and it all works out quite strangely. A simple story with just a few characters but Bainbridge's psychologically penetrating descriptions and dialogue make this a memorable book.

However, my excitement evaporated with every turn of the page. While the author seems to have a thorough knowledge of the lore involved, and an above-average grasp of the academic perspective, it did little to outweigh the ongoing conjecture. The book is rather one-sided in presentation of the mysterious topic of seid and much of it is just opinion without any real supporting basis.I can appreciate the author's attempt to illuminate, but for individuals who are looking to immerse themselves in seid as it is shown in the sagas and Edda, this book misses the mark. The author would be better to omit the \`seid' from the title and text and simply present it as a treatise on her own speculative soothsaying practices based loosely on the V?lusp��."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"I found the book definitely not scholarly, the grammar was horrible and totally drowned any sense of direction of the work. The tangents taken completely destroyed the thought they started from. There was use of terms totally unfamiliar with no explanation of where they came from, plus a few she admitted making up to fit her understanding of something. I give her kudos for attempting this work. However, alot of what she \\"interprets\\" as the meaning of the Voluspa is Theosophic/Neo-Pagan in origin. To truly understand the meaning of such old works as Voluspa one would have to live in the time it was conceived and have that world-view and the life experience of those people. Would I recommend this book to anyone interested in Norse lore or practices? Absolutely not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't call it \\"scholarly\\"","review":"I was disappointed by this book. I wish Yngona had just stuck to translating the Voluspa rather than injecting her bizarre interpretations into it.

Apparently, she spends more time \\"actively monitoring ley lines\\", \\"assisting local Guardians with energy clean-up\\" and \\"reconnecting in a non-invasive manner with primal and ancestral energies\\" while communing with her \\"folk-soul\\" than she does performing scholarly research.

For days I thought about some of the scenes and funny lines contained in Ravi. What impressed me is how filmmaker Dr. Ravi Godse, who loves word plays, delivered jokes to make deeper points that reveal insights into a physician's psyche. After all, doctors are people, too!

My shirts, however, still looked like balled-up tin foil and took far longer to iron with the DeLonghi than with my old cheap one. I suspect it's because the iron unit itself has only half the wattage of my old iron. And yes, I had both the steam and the heat cranked to max. I'm sending this one back and getting another $20 iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing product","review":"It seems a lot of money for an iron but this product is truly amazing especially since it comes with a 3 year warranty. I do a lot of quilting and need a good seam iron that is ready when needed as I sew. This really is perfect for my needs. I am so tired of buying steam irons that work great for a while and then get clogged up and wont steam anymore, so this seemed like a great alternative. No need to sprinkle clothes anymore to iron them damp, this iron gets all the wrinkles out, even on linen and gives results that look like you just came from the cleaners. I am really impressed, and would unreservedly recommend this iron. It is not heavy, and is so easy to work with. I also bought the Rowenta ironing board so my ironing experience is now perfect. For people who love to iron (as do I), this enhances the experience, and for people who hate to iron, this will make the process much more pleasant. Buy it for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"European style pressing","review":"These type of ironing systems can be frequently found European households; chances are you've seen one of these if you've traveled there extensively. This one provides powerful steam and very smooth glide - leagues ahead of most \\"American-style\\" household irons... but then again, the price is also leagues-ahead, so it better outperform them!This is not for the ocassional user, but for serious crafters, seamstress or folks that are perfectionists about pressing. You will do better with this than your average dry cleaner pressing.Get ready for the amount of heat generated and be careful with steam burns. I find that it can be too powerful for certain fabrics and that seams tend to get \\"marked\\" or fabrics shiny - get ready to use a cloth in between your fabric and the iron... and even still you will get some... exercise care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Iron","review":"DO NOT purchase this iron, spend the extra money and purchase the Reliable Ironmaven. This is a poor product. I have owned this iron for a year and it will always spit when left to sit for more then 5 minutes when using the steam button, you must press the steam button over towel before you use it or else you will get a puddle. It is a very heavy iron and it will slip off the stand, mine has slipped then melted the front steam button. The lip that holds the stand is not high enough to hold the iron and is built on an angle, poor engineering. This is where the danger slips in, if not place perfectly on the stand it will slip off as mine has several times. The warranty will not cover any replacement for the buttons. The steaming is not very robust, I test drove a Iron Maven yesterday and shot steam about 8ft the Delonghi will do about 2ft, if you are lucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap parts and difficult to replace","review":"Good product overall, but the stopping gasket and the O ring (rubber part) that prevents steam from escaping are very cheaply made and broke after only 3 use. Called DeLonghi and they don't have the replacement in stock, plus it costs $3...which is a ripoff. They should have included at least several spares and carry replacements in stock - not to mention that you have to pay for shipping so it ends up being even more. Otherwise it's a good iron, but short from buying a new one, I don't know what else to do?! I guess trying to find a replacement at a hardware store (which would be easier if they at least indicated what size it is...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"I iron every day. For the past eight years, I've used \\"steam generator\\" irons. Without question, this is the finest I've ever purchased. The feature of being able to move the cord for right or left handed use is brilliant. It also helps even if you move the iron and your plug is in a different spot. The pressurized steam is extremely hot and powerful. The cork handle never gets too hot to handle as many other brands do. No matter what setting it is on it NEVER drips, which happened with all my other brands of steam generator irons (Rowenta included). The best $200 I ever spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of dreamy but Not as Steamy......","review":"I purchase this iron and it did not produce any more steam than a standard/regular iron. Not impressed with the heat of the element/iron as well, also standard/regular. I returned it after one use, why?

I opened it up to take a look and found a number of frayed and burnt wires in the handle section, and in the iron body. The heating element in the iron has also burned out, so it's no longer usable (the iron doesn't get hot, so the steam condenses and water splatters all over the clothes). This is the fourth steamer iron I've had, all of different brands, to have failed on me. Looks like no one can make reliable products anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Not only did this product not hold up - worked for less than 1 year with minimal use, but requests for service help were a disaster. Small things began to go wrong almost immediately and continued until it was spewing hot water from every seam.

I do not recommend and will never buy another DeLonghi product."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeLonghi Stiromeglio Compact PRO 300 Ironing System","review":"For ease of use. For creaseless ironing. Pricey but pays for itself compared with laundering in a few months if, like me, you use cotton sheets and comforter/duvet covers. What a difference it makes to the final result.

I would recommend the product without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good steam generator","review":"It seems like I have to buy a new steam generator every year because most brands are really built cheaply.

I LOVE to iron and am very serious about quality. For the past 7 years I have owned a Laura Star Ironing system (purchase price over $1K) - unfortunately the annual maintenance costs have averaged $150 and when it broke down last week I decided it was time for a change. This DeLonghi iron EXCEEDS my expectations - it arrived yesterday and I ironed until midnight - it is easy to use, the handle is very comfortable and I was thrilled with the steam generation. This product is AWESOME - for people who like to sew, or people like me who just like to iron. DeLonghi has a lifelong customer in me after 24 hours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BOMB!","review":"I bought the Rowenta and Shark steam irons from the awesome big box store that starts with a C. I also ordered this steamer. They all arrived on the same day. I tried all three on the napkins and table cloth I was using for Easter. The Delonghi is the CHAMPION HANDS DOWN! The other two are going back to the big box store. I am HOWEVER waiting for my IronMaven that I also ordered from Amazon. I will then compare it to the Delonghi and update my review. For now, the Delonghi ROCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Life Span","review":"Two major problems:The rubber seal that comes with system split the fourth time I used it. I took the seal to the local hardware store and bought three replacements for $1.00 and almost a year later, the first onestill feels like new.The rubber tube inside the iron that connects from the hose to the iron steam tank died after 18 months and I replaced it with an automotive high temp silicone tube. That died after six months - am now on my third tube. Replacing these tubes is a real PITA, not recommended for anyone short of a 9 on a 10 scale ability to repair electrical appliances. I have all of the tools and it still is difficult.DeLonghi/Fox International does not carry parts for this iron, so you are stuck.One functional design I don't like is the inability to see how full the tank is. You have to be careful filling with the funnel, slowing down the flow until you can see the water. Otherwise, over the top it comes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"couple of nitpicks but 5 stars","review":"To all my fellow ironing haters--buy this iron. This machine has made my most dreaded chore so much easier--maybe even fun. My mother in law asked me to order her one after she saw how well it worked. I've had it for about a year now and I still love it. I have to iron school uniforms and the steam just erases the deep wrinkles no matter how long the clothes sat crumpled in the dryer or laundry basket. My only complaints are that there is no automatic shutoff (I haven't forgotten yet, but you never know) and there is no water level window so I overfill the water compartment almost every time--so much so that I bring along a washcloth to wipe up the overflow. I have used distilled water only because we're on a well. Anyway, I've bought about a million things on Amazon and rated very few but this product deserves high praise. I think the price has come down a lot since I bought these last year, also. Buy it and don't look back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my new iron!","review":"I love this iron!

The Iron has so many design flaws that it is not worth the $172.00 it cost. It has no water level, the hose is too short and spits hot water, there is no way of knowing if it is on or off, and it doesn't last very long. The Delonghi electric cheese grater lasted only one month and the coffee maker less than 6 weeks. I will never buy another Delonghi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for about 5 months.

So just pull the trigger and purge the line off to the side before you put it on the garment.I would have thought that a \\"period\\" of time would be more than the little time it takes to reposition the item you are ironing.

If he did he never bothered to learn the language and the translations he got were so misinterpreted that he wrote fantasy instead of fact. I believe that Mr. Waddell wrote the book from his armchair and used fantasy and other books. The original was written @ 1900, so the books that he had to rely on were sparse and were not very insightful into the real Tibet of the time, or were plain fantasy. It is amazing that he wrote such a long book (I guess that he had nothing else to do for a while.) Though there are a very few facts about Tibet in the author's book, most of it is wrong and very misleading. I suggest that you pass this one up or read it as you would a fairy story."},{"rating":"2","title":"USEFUL TOOL FOR STORM BUFFS","review":"'Hurricanes' is a great book for storm and weather buffs, and anyone who would like to know the basics about these storms.

I am the type of reader who read all genre of books and am always happy when my authors delve from one genre to an other. Keeps me on my toes. However, this book was terrible. It bored me right from the beginning. The romance was laughable. In a word...corny. The mystery was okay, but not very well set up. I almost put this book down a few times but forced myself to finish it in the hopes that I will be pleastantly surprised with the ending. No true. It ended exactly as I expected.

The history section is far more detailed than any other book out there, and the thing I love about this book is that it is ENTIRELY dedicated to Dobermans. Some books have the first half dedicated to a certain breed, and then the rest is just the same info on health, grooming, etc. regardless of the breed. This book is different, and it's strictly made for Doberman enthusiasts. When it talks about health, grooming, etc. it's tailored to only Dobermans, and that's what makes this book unique. Every word in this book pertains to Dobermans, and that's why it's worthy of 5 stars.

Almost all of the detailed information in this book is about breeding, showing, and most definately the history of the breed. When it comes to the important details of raising a doberman and caring for it, the specifics are not there, it is very vague and opinionated on that subject. The book is extremely dry and a boring read. The first half of the book is like reading the beginning of the Bible, this dog begat that dog and this dog begat that dog and we think this is how it was and we think this was what happened...blah blah blah. I have found 100 times more useful information on the breed by just going to this doberman website [...]Don't waste your money, unless you are interested in a dry history lesson.

I didn't appreciate the European/German dogs being slated so openly. This is a German dog after all. Even the fact that the Americans can't give the breed the correct spelling 'Dobermann' just shows how arrogant they are. The fact that the Americans have watered down the temperament is so sad.

Soured the whole thing for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"What a wonderfully informative book. A must for any dobie enthusiast or for someone considering the breed. Great information on the history of the doberman as well as general care for all ages of dogs. Great sections on breeding, training, temperments, showing, sporting, and a fantastic section on health and general care. What is great about the authors is that the book is not just one sided, such as \\"only show type dogs and cropped ears\\", it represents both working type and show type dogs as well as American and German standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arachnid 300 Dart Board","review":"Bought the dart board, set it up and played the first time.

I certainly would have never guessed it. Yet, because I work in the field of law enforcement, I decided to give FX a chance and watched the pilot for The Shield last year. I was truly blown away. This is no Law and Order, folks. This is as close to the real deal as any TV show will ever get. The acting in the show is truly amazing, and I give the writers a lot of credit for making the show credible among law enforcement circles.

I thought I'd paid for a book, not a sales pitich.I also found the author's claim to be the actual person who invented \\"Life Coaching\\" and \\"Workplace Coaching\\" to be distasteful, patronising and rather derogatory to the real pioneers of the coaching movement such a the late Thomas Lenard and the great Sir John Whitmore.

It didn't set career development in an economic history which would explain why theory developed the way it did. Additionally, the book doesn't explain many of the theories so the student can dilineate the differences between them. the author states that career counseling will soon integrate with other forms of counseling and yet, he doesn't point out obvious relationships between career theory and other psychological and developmental theories. There is a lot of guidence on counseling which covers both general and career skills. I would have liked the assessment section to be much bigger and more practical and the school assessment section to be much smaller. Zunker has an assessment book and should probably take his huge section on school counseling and make a book from that.

Jesse Metcalf gives a great performance along side Johnny Messner (WHO IS CRAZY IN THIS), Corrupt, Chase Crawford, Vinnie Jones, Lochlyn Munro, and Corey Large. The cast is great, the acting is good, and the film is interesting in its style, plot and execution. Again the girls were hot!!!I dug the score and source music in the film.

Tristan is apparently the kind of guy who just does whatever a stronger person tells him, whether that's his dad or his dealer. Why should we have any sympathy for someone like that? The movie flips around from Crank-ripoff to morality play to mystery-thriller with no sense of direction whatsoever.

Let's just say that this is the best series that I have ever seen on TV. Season 1 was just good. By the end of season 2 it was great and stayed that way through season 5. Seasons 6 & 7 got a bit dark for many people, but still broke new ground and took us to new and interesting places. I am in awe of the amount of creativity that poured into this show over the years.

This season has the fullest cast of all seasons. It is Angel (David Boreanaz) and Cordy's (Charisma Carpentar) last season. We see more of Oz (Seth Green). Faith (Eliza Dushku) enters the cast. Anya (Emma Caulfield) comes in this season too. This season is a set up for the Scoobies starting college in season 4 and Angel and Cordy making their big move to L.A. and to Joss' spin-off Angel.This season is filled with more humor and drama then we had previously seen. I am being vague, so as not to give anything away to those who have not seen it.

My only problem lies in the dvd itself, the transfer like season 1 and 2 is bad,i its very grainy, and the picture looks slightly muffled, of course this problem never occurs during BRIGHT outdoor scenes, but most indoor, and every low light scene this shows up in a bad way, its not bad enough to want to skip a purchase, but it is bad enough to mention, and its the only, and i repeat ONLY reason i didnt give this box set 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to kickstart your website!","review":"This is a great book if you are computer savvy, but not Dreamweaver savvy.

The top/bottom parts are really smooth but the middle parts are rough. So when you go to turn, it rubs against your hands. It also has a really bad odor that fills up the whole car and my hands. I took the cover off and wiped down my steering wheel, but there is still an odor that gets on my hands. I am returning this item and I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty much as I figured","review":"Looks good, comfortable, and the faux suede on bottom provides good grip for driving with my knee. After a little while (few weeks, maybe) it rotates slightly around the wheel, so if you want it straight up with the logo on top you may have to remove it and put it back on. Otherwise, great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stand","review":"My wife gave me one of these stands as a birthday gift. Out of the several stand I have had in the past this is the best.The Guitar hangs from the head with the body resting on the legs. The padding works great. It is very stable and the guitar lifts out with out a problem.I highly recommend this stand.-Ed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves a ZERO","review":"I sought out this stand in an effort to avoid the vinyl-based padding used on cheaper stands--vinyl reacts with the nitrocellulose lacquer used on Gibson (and other traditionally finished guitars). Unfortunately, this stand was only good for about 18 months of very light use around my home. Eventually, the lock that holds the legs in place when they're deployed failed. I sent it to Ultimate Support, who determined that I qualified to give them $19 for a refurbished stand to \\"replace\\" the defective unit. No thanks.So, my search continues for a better-quality stand than this one. At least I can say that I've narrowed my search down... I won't need to look at anything that Ultimate Support sells.

Guardini is not a pessimist, but he is vitally concerned about the potential loss of human dignity and individual responsibility in a world culture dominated by technological utilitarianism.Occasionally Guardini is off target (e.g., about all future wars being world wars), but mostly he is penetrating and prophetic in his analysis of contemporary society. After a brief review of the major epochs in Western history, he focuses on power as the defining problem of our age, and proposes that virtues such as humility, self-control, and faith are more crucial than ever.After more than 50 years, this thought-provoking book still serves as one of the best introductions to the fundamental ethical and theological issues of our times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality; awesome price!","review":"I got the long pulls (16\\") for my hobby room. Home Depot had these available as a special order item but they were more than twice the price I paid them from Amazon. I highly recommend both the seller and the product.

After more than 25 years in the business, she is still the best voice in the industry. This album is as great, if not better, as \\"What a Wonderful World\\", and \\"What a Wonderful Christmas\\". Her tender rendition of \\"For the Good Times\\" easily surpasses the original. Her gritty version of \\"Singing The Blues\\" is not only surprising but amongst her best ever. Her duet with Vince Gill is perfect in every pitch,and her version of \\"Always on my mind\\" is unsurpassed. \\"Loving Arms\\" is quite touching and her upbeat versions of \\"Til I kissed you\\", \\"Lonesome Me\\" and others proves she still has it.

In fact, the author seems anti-children so if you are looking for a book about startng a small family friendly restaurant, look elsewhere. It has good, basic information on starting a small place. I would like to see an updated edition as the POS/Computer section was a little dated. This book was not what I was looking for, but if you want to open a small, classy cafe I'd give this book a shot. Overall it is a fairly quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"leave it in the past and move into the glow","review":"I'm glad I heard Antique Glow before I heard the Past was Faster. If it had been the other way around, I might have not have even cared to go check out Antique Glow.This cd has a handful of gracious moments. The rest I would describe as Kelley sponging his influences and lacking the refinement/talent to wring out his own style. If you'd like to hear him in the beginning stages of discovering his own voice and laying down tracks that sound more like incomplete compositions, you may want to pick this up.I'd suggest Antique Glow instead of this album. On that album your palette won't be overwhelmed with the aromas of Robyn Hitchcock, Nick Drake, Syd Barrett, Beatles, Captain Beefheart, etc. like it will be here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I have seen this movie before, maybe it was on broadcast TV. Now I've seen it on blu-ray. The movie is mostly depressing. It takes place in a small southern town. The people who live in this town are either bored or depressed. About the only happy person in this picture is the town hooker. It seems everyone has her telephone number, she makes house calls! Also great at polite small talk. Halle Berrys and Billy Bob Thorton's charactures seems to have more than their fair share of problems. It's also so quiet I had to rewind and turn up the volume to hear some of the dialogue.There are a few scenes you might find disturbing.However the ending was happy.

I'm a twenty-seven year old male that seeks out low brow, silly, sick, and twisted humor. This movie has none of the above. I feel almost as bad for the individuals that spent so much time on the stop-motion clay animation as I do for myself for wasting the forty-five minutes I gave of my life to watch half of it.

On earth, they show a bulimic teen pageant, and they learn they are going to die, they start eating junk food! When they save the day, the bulimic teens scream and start puking!

THE MOVIE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic story of Earth's destruction","review":"I am very pleased with this product. It has everyhing I have ever wanted in one movie, and it is jam-packed. The jokes come fast and furious, they include racial stereotypes, beastiality, homosexuality, drug abuse, extreme farting, military stupidity, dumb blondes, and sex sex sex. It is the ultimate movie! It even has a Captain Kirk character who ends up lobotomized!!This movie is comedy at the lowest common denominator and that is just where I like it. The crude clay animation just adds to the charm. This movie has a lot of beautiful, gravity defying clay boobies too, with nipples!!!! This film makes me very happy.From a Frenchman with the power of flight acheived through flaming farts, to man eating space apes, this film has something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read-Kept Me Turning Pages!","review":"This is the first I've read of Nancy Pickard's books, and I liked it very well.Marie Lightfoot is the main character and she is writing a true crime novel on a charming minister's love affair with a beautiful wealthy church member. His wife Susanna is murdered in the process, and no one really knows who the guilty one is. The accused sits on death row, while his lover will walk free. Justice looks as though it has been served, but Marie knows better.

But she better watch out, as she may learn a bone-chilling lesson in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It grabbed my attention in the beginning, but quickly became a diatribe about the death penalty and anti-police.

Luckily, I bought this at a thrift store for $1.00. It was so bad - that rather than passing it on to another charity, I discarded it in the trash. What a waste of time.

I was quite impressed with there performance so I picked up their cd.... It was well worth the money. It is nothing new or groundbreaking, it's just good modern rock. There are some dark grungy tunes, some ballads, and some pop radio hits. I'm not dissapointed with any songs on the whole album, it is good from start to finish. They remind me a lot like Stone Temple Pilots or some other early nintys band with a modern sound to them. For anyone who likes any sort of rock music they should pick this one up.... You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE NOTHING SPECIAL!","review":"I bought this cd based on reviews I saw on Amazon. People compared this group to Nirvana, the Foo Fighters, the Vines, Silverchair, etc... The list goes on and on. Those bands all have something special in my eyes (Silverchair once did).

However, this CD, is much more straight up rock with some programming a la Garbage or NIN. I've found \\"Can't Relate\\" to be my favorite song off of Inertia, perhaps because it is much closer to their old sound. Each song has its own sound, and that can be good, or bad, depending on how you like things. I like it when every song on the CD does not sound the same, so I find it good. From the harder rockin' first single \\"My Goddess\\" and a kickin' \\"No Secrets\\" to a much softer \\"Creeper Kamikaze,\\" that incorporates a string orchestra, this CD is, despite not being quite what I had wanted, an excellent CD and well worth more than whatever low-price you will pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a great cd. All the songs are varied and all have clever lyrics. Their style and voice are very unique, unlike most big bands today. I guess I like cds that Matt Serletic produces, because them and matchbox twenty are my favorite bands, and they're both produced by him.

Buy This.","review":"From start to finish, this is simply a fantastic album. I read a review of them somewhere that critiqued them for the way the songs on the album don't have a consistent feel to them, but I disagree. Certainly, the songs on this album have a wide musical range, from the hard rocking \\"Without\\" and \\"Calm and Collapsed\\" to the far mellower \\"Creeper Kamikaze\\" and \\"Genius.\\" In my opinion, though, this range doesn't lead to the record feeling disjointed in any way.

First, the songs from the film are re-recorded and rather lifeless compared to the film soundtrack. Secondly, the \\"Tar Sequence\\" track has been given a strange piece of introductory music rather than just starting naturally and loudly, as in the film.Still a good listen, but these changes are not for the best.

I have always liked thrillers set in places where strange goings-on captivate the imagination. Barbara Stanwyck is excellent as the nurse outstanding in her unsentimental approach. Joan Blondell also stands out with her vivacious and humorous performance. Clark Gable, in an early role, demonstrates the masculine allure and screen presence that shot him into stardom. This is an outstanding thriller directed by William \\"Wild Bill\\" Wellman who was truly one of the greats but has been unfairly overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Nurses Battled Gangsters","review":"This is something of an antique, but yet another vintage Pre-Coder. Barbara Stanwyck and her nursing school friend Joan Blondell seem to be forever removing their clothes down to their skivvies while learning about babies and surgery before earning their pins and taking up private duty work. That leads them to a shameful place where a rich lady is doped up by her scheming evil chauffeur Nick, played darkly by young unmoustached Clark Gable.

Maybe it's incredible for the indie category but then many progressive rock bands took music way above this level and that was back in the 70s.

Discounting the ABout a Boy soundtrack (although it is, in my view, an excellent album in its own right, there is no doubt that it is lead to a significant extent by the storyline of the book and film), I have to say that I think the direction taken by the second real album is an absolute triumph.

What a disappointment. Try as I may, despite repeated playings, I remain bewildered and disappointed.There is no cohesion or direction...just a cacophony of quirky tunes with strings assorted horns and piano that never really settles down. A jumble of too much going on.

Whether light and humorous or more typically dark and mysterious these prints provide some small glimpse into the psyche of one of todays pre-eminent printmakers. This book shows the development of her unique style and tells of some of her primary influences, as well as her personal history. Ms Covey is one of a handful of artists still practicing the art of WOOD ENGRAVING, not to be confused with the more common woodblock prints. The subtle shading and delicate shapes Ms Covey achieves are well depicted in this text. The only drawback of this book is, it does not cover her more recent works. Check out this book and you'll definitely want to see what she's been up to since.

Yes, if the actors can't act and the writer can't write","review":"The Raspberry Reich is a mess. Written and directed by someone calling himself Bruce LaBruce, the movie is designed to be an-in-your-face send-up of Europe's revolutionary passions by the youth of the Seventies. Here the leader of an inept boy gang is a left-wing, well-built harridan named Gudrun, who shouts, rants and copulates energetically with her hetero (at the start) partner. Gudrun discovers that hetero sex is not all that revolutionary or liberating, so she insists that her gang members have sex with each other. Cue in plenty of gay sex acts.The visual look of the film is vivid and bold. The story is amateurishly written, acted and directed. The sex looks like it was fun. The movie, after the first half hour, wasn't. The ranting was loud. The sex, ultimately, seemed merely a way for the writer/director to provoke all the grannies in New Jersey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I highly recommend not getting this movie unless you're into senseless porn.

I used the batteries that came with the TuneJuice and got no more than around 10 minutes of additional additional play time (it's supposed to give 14 hours of audio playtime). Thinking that the supplied batteries might have been old, I replaced them with four new batteries only to find them completely drained in around 10 minutes as well. So not only did I waste the money I spent on this crappy power source, I also wasted four more perfectly good batteries as well (not to mention the inconvenience of 6 hours of flight time without access to my iPod).

If there are no movie stills or if the stills look low budget, then I either don't rent the movie or I log on to amazon.com to check out the reviews. The stills on the back of DRIVE-THRU gave a good indication it wasn't cheaply made and could possibly be a hidden gem. And a hidden gem it was!The leads were well cast. The one-liners were actually funny. And the villan was scary. Although the mystery surrounding has been seen before, because the movie was so well done, the worn-out premise is easily overlooked and works.Scariest scene is when Horny's mask is torn off and his true face is revealed.

What I found: Linus and Charlie Brown are regularly mocked, belittled, and called stupid; and Snoopy pretends he's a WWII ace complete with incoming machine gun fire and (if I'm not mistaken) the sound of bombs in the distance. Not recommended for children unacquainted with the cruelty of aerial combat and relentless teasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bullying, belittling and violence against animals??? wow..","review":"I remember each year watching this as a kid when it came on TV. now that I have my own three year old I was looking forward to this movie.

Then to see Lucy pick up and throw her dog snoopy when he was laughing too much while she was watching tv. Not very funny to me. Then she went over to her little brother and continued to mock him about his letter to the great pumpkin. This was enough for my and my family. Teaching children it's ok to mock others who believe different than we do and to harm animals when they are \\"annoying\\" us is hardly the lessons I want to leave as a legacy for my children.

I now give the book (I collect out-of-print editions throughout the year) to my senior advisees when they graduate from our small liberal-arts college.

I have tried to give it to my dog as an expensive dog treat; however he smells it and walks away, like what are you trying to give me you jerk.

The book is divided into six phases, each of which cover different aspects of therapy, such as the basics, including induction; regression and past life; parts therapy; timeline; shame and addictive personalities; archetypes; the 'Shadow'; and several other topics.Mr. Elias's approach is to integrate aspects of various approaches to hypnosis and therapy with spiritual actualization to resolve issues. This *is* a practical 'how-to' book, not just another book of scripts, or theory, or metaphors used by Milton Erickson that you will never be able to use in a practical or clinical setting. After all, you're not Milton Erickson, are you? I enjoyed reading the book, as will you. And more importantly, you'll learn more about hypnotherapy from this book than any other you're likely to find here... At least until I write mine. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative.

I do recommend it as additional resource and believe that every hypnotherapist can benefit from reading it.It is loaded with scripts and different techniques from NLP, Ericksonian hypnosis, working with archetypes and similar. It also does incorporate some eastern terminology and worldview which may be a rather foreign territory for western hypnotherapists who were not involved in Eastern studies and may go over their heads as they may not relate to it.Nevertheless there are a lot of good scripts of transpersonal nature, where the client is guided to access his deeper wisdom and engage in learnings and transformations which are appropriate for the client. For this purpose scripts use quite a bit of indirect (Ericksonian) hypnotic language patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Metallica fans -- Everyone else shouldn't bother","review":"This Metallica DVD chronicles the making of the Black Album through exclusive interviews, archive footage and performances with the band members and producer Bob Rock.

With that said, they may not have been the most original, but who cares? Remember, there can only be one original. These guys play metal in the vain of afore metioned bands. Music that was started when these guys were in dimpers. The chances of this band getting back together is slim, but if your after a great cd that you won't hear anywhere else, this is it.

That is less than 6 cents a cup, half the price of the same in bag form even with free super saver shipping. That's only a bargain if the tea is good, and it is in my opinion. The Ceylon green tea is not grassy like many greens. The large broken pieces of leaf have a full and pleasant taste. Not bitter. The tea flavor definitely comes through in the blend. The bergamot smells wonderfully of citrus and tastes just as good. The bergamot is not overdone but isn't underdone either. Similar to the level of bergamot in Twinings but slightly less bright.

Yet he manages to escape back to his homeland.The novel opens with a mature, forty year-old Patrick sent back to Ireland, the country of his enslavement, with the mission to convert the people of Eire to Christianity. But Patrick is not at peace with himself. He is driven by bitterness, anger, and insecurity. It is only through his growing friendship with the Irish bard, Osian, who has come from the Otherworld to help Patrick, and through his tales of his legendary Fenian father, Finn Mac Cool, that Patrick might be able to make peace with his past. This is also a novel about Ireland's Druidic past: their sage beliefs and customs, and their bonds with earth and spirit. It is where past and present blend and begin to become one in this mystical and romantic historical fantasy of ancient Ireland."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am of Irelunde","review":"I had the great pleasure of having Juilene Osborne McKnight sign her book for me at her first signing at the Eastern Monroe Public Library.

This tale unlocks some of the mysteries and makes the legends of both Patrick and Osian very readable. The characters in the story are very real and believeable. The retelling of the adventures of Finn Mac Cool are enchanting, exciting tales. The author has skillfully woven the stories of St. Patrick with the legends of Osian and Finn. Patrick is portrayed as a human being, full of faults, and concupiscence. Despite periodic self loathing and inability to forgive himself, he remains convicted of God's love for him and his ultimate redemption. We poor humans, even in the 21st century are able to identify with him.

Clearasil's Daily Face Wash has been my preferred face (and body!) wash for years, although I do cheap out and get the Walmart equivalent when it's in stock. I prefer the \\"sensitive skin\\" formulation, because if I'm going to smell like anything other than fresh male, I don't want to smell like perfumed face wash, thanks. It can be very economical even as a body wash; one tube lasts me about a month of daily showering. It will not be economical if you just slather directly on your skin - it needs to be worked into a foam in your hands, per the label instructions. Judging by how the \\"sensitive\\" formulation is usually sold out when I shop, I think most everyone else who uses it prefers the unscented formulation too. Maybe someday Novartis will get the hint and just pull the plug on the regular scented formulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"I just recently switched from Clearasil Ultra Daily Face Wash to this new product called Clearasil Daily Clear Oil-Free Daily Face Wash (New Formula).

He can 'out-nuance' the best of them. The protagonist is likable in the tragic way of Hamlet. He deserved better; here he rallies and makes it so, enjoying some honest titillation along the way. But there is no escaping the current underneath this story: things out of balance require radical action. In light of recent events, it is even more poignant. Who of us deserves to make that change happen in a violent way, even if no lives are taken?

Fans of the show should stay away and watch The Show, it is much more entertaining than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I love this book but there are too many typos in the kindle edition.

However, after reading Scott Chambliss' \\"Maahvelous!\\" I have to re-evaluate some of my hard-lined stances. The over-the-top plotline is engaging and self-deprecating, making it a great read. The main characters, fallen home shopping star Princess Puut and design mogul friend Dali, are both edgy and endearing. I am impressed with Chambliss' bold juxtaposition of images: cartoon characters, phootographic portraiture and high Renaissance sculpture are contained in a single illustration. The eye candy comes in a delightful tongue and cheeck board book design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effervescent and Enchanting","review":"When a book is created in a way that is entirely original, it is time to give a shout-out to other readers. With diaphanous art and luminous words, \\"Maavelous!\\" has pages that seem to be swimming, floating, navigating canal-pierced Venice. Dreams of the land of the doges pull Scott Chambliss's Princess and her soulmate Dali away from L.A.'s realityland to the fanstasyland of Disney's favorite European city. There they find many swirling mysteries and magical answers. It is an artful book you will want to return to over and over to celebrate the joys of travel and friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"never again","review":"Shocking - what do you people do for sex?' if you are not completely satisfied with this CD, listen to it again and then realize you have wasted your money' goes the disclaimer printed on the CD. Are they being ironic, I don't think so, they know all too well what a load of crap they have turned out.I will never take note of other readers coments again. I know I was foolish; my comupter could keep enough of a connection for me to listen to any samples and as the reviews were so ecstatic I decided I couldn't go wrong. Of course I did and big time.I don't know what is remotely sexy about this CD. I've listened to more sexy Brian Eno. It's blatant, in your face, look we are really naughty boys and we make music about it. Right from the 'we revel in red light district atmoshere' cover to the pathetically jeuvenile titles this CD is peurile.Well got that out of my system, back to Kruder and Dorfmeister."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a class by itself, well worth having.","review":"After a promising begining for the \\"new\\" genre of electronics and turntable Funki Porcini and Ninja Tune help push the boundries of what is \\"acceptable\\" as not being \\"wack\\". The music on this cd has substance from begining to end without any of the tipical garbage we all know and hear everyday, otherwise passing as \\"mainstream\\". Call it R&B, or whatever it's still crap anyway you cut it. With this release we can now get back to what making music is supposed to be all about.Samples carefully mixed with instramentals that are equally dream sequence and funki groove( if you can imagine such a thing). There are two cd's in this release and they both deliver almost two hours of Porcini's style of what might have been called \\"trip hop\\" in friendlier times. Pleasantly surprised you will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I almost never give anything 1 star, but...","review":"...this one earned it. If you're looking for some hip, avant-agrde trip-out music 90s style, this STILL isn't what you're looking for.It's a mish-mash of not-strong beats, wack musings on interesting instrumentations, and just plain old bad songwriting. Ambience for ambience's sake isn't refreshing; it no more pushes the envelope of a tired music scene than does record reviews. But this CD is just a little too left-field for any causal listening, and I don't shouldn't have to put my brain too heavy on a CD with so many wack tracks.Nice idea, nice try at being different, but different has never equaled good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of its kind","review":"This is one of my favorite CD's. The music is fairly well described in the other reviews, so I won't add to that, but I'm surprised that 2 of the 3 previous reviews pan it. Usually even mediocre albums get nothing but rave reviews, and if there is even a little criticism it's usually s bad sign, but I have over 20 CD's of this style and to my taste only the benchmark \\"K & D Sessions\\" and Nightmare on Wax's \\"Carboot Soul\\" can compete. It's cool, relaxing, sexy music. I most frequently listen to it while stuck in rush hour traffic to keep from pulling my hair out and almost regret pulling into the driveway. I've played the CD for multiple friends and they all like it. Those who are into the style agree that it is one of the best of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be toyed with","review":"Funki Porcini's 'Hed Phone Sex' is easliy one of the best down-tempo/abstract hip-hop albums I have ever heard.

If I had known that it only covers through version 4, I would not have purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the way up!","review":"Glenn has definately grown much musically since he appeared on the pop seen a little over ten years ago as a teenager. When many of his musical cohort have lost their fortunes or just left pop music, he has gone on and expanded on his talents. The songs on this CD show how much Glenn has matured. The love songs still make one float on air, but there is a feeling that there is more than fluffy clouds holding one up there. There is feeling and heart behind the songs now. The dance beats are still fun, but now they are beginning to grab one to the dance floor.This album is great, but Glenn is definitely going to grow even more in the future. I know I'm not the only one waiting to hear more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent ensemble","review":"This concert was clearly a showcase for some superb musicians, notably, Arturo Sandoval, Paquito D'Rivera, Airto Moreira, Giovanni Hidalgo, Steve Turre and Dizzy himself, amongst others.The video is sometimes a little confused but the sound is as good as being there and the music itself is classic, with some memorable solos to be heard.Whether you're a fan of Dizzy's or Latin jazz in general, there is much to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have....","review":"This might not be Mr. Gillespie at his best, but it is Dizzy, and it is jazz. (And) Dizzy playing jazz (even if it is not one of his better performances) is better than most at their absolute best. Touring is takes a lot out of musicians. Even when you are not performing you still don't get any rest. You have signings and rehearsals you have to attend. At any rate this DVD is great to have because there are some great solos by the other artist performing. Although I feel as if some of them were under used. You will not be disappointed with any aspect of the performances on this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent!","review":"I already knew the concert, so I also knew the music quality of what I was going to see. Incredible musicians, and a real nations unity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dizzy the creator of bebop","review":"Dizzy displays his talents here. Though he is older, the music still sounds fresh.

This has got to be one of the poorest written books I have had the misfortune to read. I can not belive that it was published. If one of my students would have handed this in I would have given them a F. It is a sad day when a book as tedius to read gets pubished. Anne should be ashamed and embarased, it was clearly a last attempt to hold on to her fastly running out 15 minutes of fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call me sceptic","review":"After watching the Barbara Walters interview I was intigued to find out more about Anne's story. Unfortunately, the book is poorly written and a disappointment. In print, the story seems even more ridiculous. I have to wonder, if she could imagine spaceships while on ectasy, could she have imagined the sexual abuse as well? I am sceptical about her whole story. Her insanity defense seems to wrap up everything quite nicely. Yes I believe she is a good actress but her real talent lies in curing herself of 30 years of mental illness in just one day. The entire book should have been devoted to that feat alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Call me stupid for buying this book!","review":"I was a big Anne Heche fan, until I saw her interview on the Today show and then read this book! The book has no central story line, other than to randomly repeat her stories of abuse and horror. HELLO! If I took LSD and had a random stranger massage me for 8 hours, I might imagine my father molesting me, too! LSD = hallucinations, am I the only person to recognize this? Although she may believe the abuse actually occurred, I think her 'memory' is clearly a bi-product of the drugs. I feel sorry for her and her family, but most of all for her unborn child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was a little hard to follow her writing at times.","review":"I like her as an actress better then a writer. She was to all over the place, hard to follow her story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flighty, wispy, and insignificant","review":"Having just finished reading this book, I was terribly disappointed. I saw her interview with Barbara Walters which I found intriguing and interesting; at least interesting enough to pick up her book and read it through. However, as I kept turning the pages waiting for something concrete, revealing (as this IS a memoir), or at least as charismatic as the writer is in person, I reached the last page realizing I had read in vain. This book is self-indulgent. It is written as if the writer's mind was a cockroach haphazardly typing on a keyboard, and most wretched of all, not in the least bit engaging as its author is in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call me Crazy","review":"I feel this was the worst written book I have ever read. It jumped around. It was not clear of what the author was intended for her audience to see. My suggestion is to borrow it from a friend or from the libray-save your money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I've been an Anne Heche fan since she was on the soap Another World in the early 80's. I've followed her career, and enjoyedwatching her evolve as an actress. She is one of my all time favourite actresses, she's incredibly talented and I am a huge huge HUGE fan. My husband bought me this book, because I am such a fan, and I dove into it and read it in a day.I wish I had that day back. I feel for this lady. From the sounds of things, she's had a tough go of it but I didn't feel one ounce of empathy towards her, and it's not because I don't think her story is true. This story is cold, boring and has no real direction. It's a collection of memories that just don't ring true.The abuse may be real, but this book reads like a cold fish. Does that make sense? Neither does this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, I would call her crazy","review":"The best thing about this book is that Anne speaks so highly of her relationship with Ellen. As for the rest of it, she clearly has some very interesting beliefs (especially, the one where she becomes God for a while), and even though she was never 'officially' diagnosed, I would call her crazy. If the facts of her childhood are correct, she did experience some horrific behavior by both her parents, and I do applaud the fact that she has become an accomplished actress. But, she is a mess, and to read her story is to get the inside view of a very disturbed mind. I ended up feeling sorry for her, and hoping that she (somehow) gets her life together. If you like Hollywood gossip and sordid details of sexual abuse and mental disorders, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy indeed","review":"Crazy, irresponsible and implausible.Clearly, she thinks little of the intelligence of the American people. Or perhaps she thinks too much of her ability to charm and manipulate.If you can believe that a person could spontaneously remiss after suffering from grand delusions like talking with god and believing that the mother ship was coming to take her home, then I guess you can also hold out hope that Anne will save a seat on the ship for you.I agree, she is \\"crazy\\" but I'd classify her as a sociopath. And, while most sociopaths do come from abusive or dysfunctional backgrounds, as adults, they usually become the victimizers and not the victims.I can think of a few people and a few groups who will be hurt by her actions and by this story being told as the truth.What is really crazy, is the attention she manages to get from the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY BUY THE BOOK?","review":"Anne the nutball spilled her guts on 20/20, what more is there to say? I have never seen a more ridiculous woman in my life. Think Sally Field's \\"You really like me!\\" speech stretched out for 40 minutes. This woman is so hungry for publicity (has she been in ANYTHING since the breakup?) she spilled her guts Sally Jesse Raphael-style on TV, complete with eyelash batting, hair flipping and tearing up. Please Anne. Go away now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call Us All Crazy For Not Seeing","review":"I read Anne Heche's book, \\"Call Me Crazy\\" because I am the Christian mother of two daughters who were molested by their adopted father. I am researching the effects of incest upon the mother-daughter relationship and Anne's book was one of the few books available to give an inside look at this issue. I was sobered by the power of a father who sexually abused his daughter to inflict pain and division on those closest to him while maintaining a positive image in the community. I was also struck with the apparent blindness we as Christians demonstrate in regard to the evil among us. Anne's language will be offensive to most Christians, but those reading it should try to hear the pain behind the words and never forget her message."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book...soulful and warm","review":"I read this book after Talk magazine recommended it as one of the top picks of the month, and I was very moved by it's graciousness, its love for the reader, and its general longing for healing, for wholeness, for wonder. Anne Heche is of course a cracked vessel, as we all are, and she writes out of brokenness. This is very difficult to do. I read hundreds of memoirs, and I count those ones as literary who manage to do this, to muster strength out of their weakness, and joy out of great hardship. Read this book. Love yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Heche reveals her true beauty","review":"Why in the world would an actress reveal intimate and painful memories of her own childhood if not to help others. Suzanne Sommers was praised for her book but Anne has been torn apart for revealing what she experienced and why in the world would she want to reveal something so painful if it was not true. I feel sorry not for Anne but for her family that continue to pretend that nothing happened in their home. Congratulations Anne for revealing yourself. I believe that your words may help others to realize their identities."},{"rating":"2","title":"life is crazy","review":"many of us have lived a life similar to anne heches, the only difference we aren't celebrities and we aren't writting books about it. thank you for writting this book ... it makes me understand my own families dynamic much better and accept the fact of being crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"CALL ME CRAZY BUT THIS IS ONE HECK OF A WAY TO GET PUBLICITY","review":"Anne Heche.......hmmmm!.I saw her on Oprah a few years ago right when her and Ellen werean item. Then I knew she was an opportunist.This book is just a ploy to get her career on track. How convienent that her book comes out right at the same time as her highly publicized marriage to a MAN.Well it must be working she is already getting offers again with possibly her own sitcom.I can see it now the CBS friday line up \\"The Ellen Show\\" and \\"The Anne Heche Show\\" as a comedy block....Wouldn't that be interesting.This book is complete bleck. Just another opportunistic ploy to up start an already down spiraling career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call Me Crazy","review":"If you read the book watch the interviews.5 in all I think.You will find her story doesn't match up.He dad abused her yet she wanted him to notice her more?

Well, when you have a compelling story to tell, when you have the talent and the intelligence to do it the way Mz. Heche does, then I guess it is all right to sum up your life at 31. She tells her story frankly, openly, and without feeling sorry for herself nor for her readers.The only uneasy feeling I got was at the very end of the book, when I wan't sure if the whole book was not written by Mz. Heche in order to clear herself and prove that she is not, after all, really gay. However, this feeling does not change the fact that the book is a great read, and if nothing else it proves that Mz. Heche is everything but crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bout, \\"Call Me An Attention Seeking Nutjob!\\"","review":"Ugh! I bought this after her wacko interview with Barbara Walters and was amazed to see what a goofy gal she is. She talks about childhood tragedy, but then seems unsure it really happened. I'd love to see a book by Ellen Degeneres and get the real story. Her flighty can't seem to get the facts straight style makes it tough to believe what really happened to her. And why is there nothing about her affair with Shirley Hemphill and Todd Bridges in this book? That was the part I was looking forward to the most!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Solid Book","review":"This is a good \\"my story\\" book about DID. Those who suffer from it should draw strength from the book, especially those suffered from sexual abuse. Its well rounded book. I would recommend it. It is not a however a recovery book about DID as I felt some reviewers at Amazon.com thought it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Anne...ya want some cheese with that whine?\\"","review":"By now we should all be sick and tired of actress/model/pop types who try to identify themselves as victims in one form or another. LIFE IS TOUGH, DEAL WITH IT. Actually this is an OK read if you are really into Anne Heche but I fail to generate any sympathy myself. It would be more interesting as a BIOGRAPHY CHANNEL presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call Me Crazy","review":"Ug is right! Anne's eagerness to wave a literary flag drawing attention to her lunacy is nothing more than a means to earn money and movie deals. Ellen D is truly better off keeping a safe distance from this disturbed, self-centered wisp of a human being. Nothing worth reading here. The book is poorly written, and lacks a sense of truth and character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Story Badly Told","review":"This book and an earlier work by Susan(Heche) Bergman are poorly researched and badly written. I viewed them as a complete waste of time. Annes early years were pretty tough and I admire her recovery. However, she comes off as a dull light weight throughout. I do admire her acting particularly in Wag the Dog which was even more convincing in view of her fondesss for Bill Clinton. I am surprised the two never got together. Oh well maybe they did and we can read about it in ''Call Me Crazy II\\" Let's hope not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took Guts to Write this Odd Memoir","review":"Strangely unsatisfying tell-all. I distinctly felt that the book was more the writer's attempt to heal than a piece of literary work.Heche shares much of her oddball therapy work, self-spun theories of her case, and dredged-up memories of abuse in her utterly messed-up childhood, but strangely enough reveals little of her SELF. I felt I was pushed into the psychiatrist's own chair, not allowed to be merely a reader or (in the best case of autobiography) a kind of temporary confidante and friend.I gotta hand it to her, it took some guts to own up to some of this (psychotic episode under influence of Ecstasy, for one), and I am sorry for her suffering as a child. But perhaps SHE should have paid ME to read her unsavory chunk of insanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call Me Contrived","review":"I've been a fan of Anne Heche's since her days on \\"Another World\\". In fact, the best part of this book, for me, was her recounting of her time on the soap. However, the rest of the book falls flat. It reads like fiction (bad fiction at that) rather than a memoir. As for her \\"revelations\\" of insanity and sexual abuse I'm led to wonder, especially in light of her performance (and I believe it was a performance, not an interview)on 20/20, if any of it is real. I wonder if the book is part of the show? I don't believe there's a sincere word in her story- not even her explanation for her affair with and supposed affection for Ellen Degeners. And as for her personal philosophy, the less said the better (it's a lot of new age bunk). I wish her well. I also wish I had my money back"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad!","review":"This is a self-serving whine about tragedies that beset one family and offers no sympathy for parents, siblings, or the circumstances which brought them to despair. Unlike her older sister's book (\\"Anonymity\\" by Susan Heche Berman), a painful, poetic, and empathetic re-examination of life lived and distorted by the phenomena of masked homesexuality, untimely death, and the struggle of survivors to overcome, Heche's diabribe brims with venom. It's vile language and unsubstantiated accusations reveal a fatally flawed human being who has achieved fame and fortune, but not inner peace. This is not a book for teens who idolize Hollywood stars; marked by vulgarity and disrepect for the dead and living, it is a sad commentary on Miss Heche and the world she inhabits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth one star on rating!","review":"A friend loaned me this book hoping I would find some redeeming quality in the story. I did NOT. The writing style is very poor, the story too nutsy to even be close to reality. I think Anne has pulled off another coup....she keeps herself in the news with her various antics...this is just the latest of many. If she writes this with any belief that it is fully true, she needs years of analysis. There's so many better actors/actresses out there doing things for society and Anne's whole focus is simply Anne. Forget it, it's a waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"90s trance","review":"This is a 2 cd compilation of FL&F's work from the early to mid-90s, and is very much music of its time. Most of it still sounds great, but be aware this is club music born of the 88 English Summer of Love (that which evolved into high energy trance), so it sounds a little dated to contemporary ears. The aesthetic that informs it - love, peace & happiness - is needed more than ever; some things don't date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent square with just one flaw","review":"I've used this square extensively and I like it, I just wish the etchings on the blade were filled in with black ink.

When I was in about 100 pages I pulled back. Not because the book wasn't tremendous, but because I didn't want the story to be over too soon. The stories of the Indian Wars show the ambivalence of a few good men and the greedy hatred propelling others. General and Mrs. Atkinson are memorable characters, and along with vivid description help your mind's eye to truly 'see' the inhabitants of 1830's frontier. You also see a fresh prospective on what really motivated our first post-revolutionary war heros and how their actions were truly interpreted without the spin we can now so closely associate with our history.

Her characters are entertaining and she shifts persectives -- from Army wife, to Army officer, to Native American -- with ease and wit. Well written, entertaining and a good journey through our past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Eclectic","review":"I bought this album sound unheard outside of the highly likeable \\"You're the One\\". I figured with a song that good on it, it couldn't be too bad and I was right. The rest of the album doesn't sound much like that song but is highly listenable nonetheless. Not so smooth as YTO would indicate, it actually leans quite a bit towards being a unique blend of abstract and chill; heavy on the abstract. An interesting and eclectic mix of jazz, funk, and hip hop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denim Tommy Hilfiger Shower Curtain","review":"I love the look of the shower curtain.

I'm not sure if it's the material it is made from or if it was defective but it had a horrible smell when I removed it from its package. I used toy cleaner and even tried soap but the smell stayed. I decided to see how it worked anyway and put two new batteries in. The vibration was so weak even on the highest speed. I was so sad and disappointed...

Also it is very discreat which is nice. I would certainly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first and so far, so good!","review":"This is my first vibrator I have bought for myself and I am SO glad that this became my first choice. After reading other reviews, it does come along with an odor but it's as strong as others said, unless you have scent sensitivity. Like others, I cleaned it with soap and water and then used it. The shape is conveniently sized and reaches to the areas where it excites you. The level of vibration is great, especially if you don't simply want it to be too soft or strong.

The vibrator itself was bigger than I expected, but not so big that I wasn't willing to give it a try. So, I opened it. As I did so, I was hit by a wave of chemical stench so strong that it gave me a headache almost instantly. I immediately put it back in its box and started to read. The toy is made with PVC - a fact that would have stopped me from buying it in the first place had I known. Sex toys made with PVC can contain harmful additives. Obviously I have no way of knowing if this particular piece does, but why risk it? Besides, the smell is so off-putting that I can't imagine having it anywhere near me, much less using it for it's intended purpose. If anyone does purchase this, I recommend using a condom with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Requires some practice...","review":"Definately not for beginners...that being said, with a bit of practice, it feels AMAZING. Still working up to the elusive g-spot orgasm, but it's shaped to fit wonderfully. It's quiet enough for neighbors to ignore, but it doesn't get extremely powerful - but it's great for a slow build-up.I like the material it's made out of too... it's easy to clean, which is a releif as it seemed to be very porous at first. All in all, a good investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This worked once. No instructions on which way to place batteries. Had to variate till it came on.

The toxic smell still hasn't gone away after multiple washes/uses. Besides that, the shape is rather awkward. It's very large at the top and skinny in the body. When I use it, I have to hold it very still, or else it rotates and makes the tip point sideways or down -- which is very uncomfortable, and misses the \\"G-Spot\\" altogether. Even when I manage to climax, it's rather dull, and doesn't compare to other simpler vibe designs I've used in the past. To me, this product was all hype, and no hoorah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great shape, horrible smell","review":"Pros: Great shape for G-spot play, waterproof, decent power on the motorCons: Repulsive disgusting hydrocarbon smell. Not phalate free. Tacky PVC exterior versus hard plastic.I had thought this toy has a hard plastic exterior but I was wrong as Doc Johnson's website states that the toy is constructed from non-toxic ABS plastic and PVC vinyl. The vinyl exterior is a tad bit tacky and smells horrible. Unfortunately, the vinyl in cheaply made sex toys has been documented to contain a wide range of potentially harmful chemicals and sticking this toy into one of the most sensitive and blood rich areas of my body is not what I had in mind - won't be using this one :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke immediately!","review":"I loaded the batteries, and turned the base to start it.

It looked a bit exciting, ergonomic shape - cool color and all, but, it is a quite a bit larger than I expected.

I don't know how Doc Johnson counted 14 speeds, but mine was more like three: 1) Is is working? 2) I felt a twinge of something. 3) I think that's a vibration. It also just feels like hard plastic.

First of all it smelled bad. Even though we washed it several times it still had a bad plastic odor. Secondly, it stopped working the first night we used it.

We will try something different next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery loose connection","review":"I cant tell you how many times I have been 'right there' and the thing shuts off. The batteries go in through the bottom, and you twist the bottom back on to close it. But when doing so you have to turn it just the right way-if its too tight it wont work and if its too loose it wont work.

I couldn't get it in by myself at first but with a little help, it didn't seem to be a problem (could be an angle thing, I'm not sure), Once it's in, it's good to go.

The head is very big, it actually made me bleed a little, and I have had two children! Once I got it in it would go off-angle and I could not seem to get it to hit the spot. So out of frustration I took it out and just used the head of it to massage my...well you know...and it felt heavenly, just like being licked. As far as using it for the g-spot, it might be more helpful to have a partner to hold it for you so you can get into a good, relaxed position, and the holder can keep it in the right position. In that way it's a little frustrating but I'm not going to give up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT pleased","review":"I bought this and the same week I got it the wire shorted! I hardly even used it!

I'm sure eventually I would get used to it but then again why would anyone want to put an enormously thick vibrator up their hoo hoo all the time and risk stretching everything out even more.

I use this in conjunction with the apricot jelly vibrator for a really good feeling.It is not too noisy, I have yet to try it in the shower, I am afraid it will ruin it even though it states waterproof.This is a great buy for the money, trust me I owned a $100 Doc Johnson rabbit that died on me.

She naturally orgasms easily (almost everytime for over 17 years of marriage)so its not too disappointing that it doesn't do anything for her while penetrating.She likes it much better on low than anywhere else. Also tried the Hitachi but it just makes us numb- too powerful or strange frequency in the vibrations. The lucid is much better. Hitachi only gets used on her back now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good when used with another device","review":"Couldn't get off with just this device by itself. When used with Hitachi Magic wand, it helped things along though and I was able to. A decent product.

It only took 2 seconds to do its job. I was very satisfied as many other women have said to have been. I read the reviews before buying and was unsure because of the lower stars and reviews but Im glad I bought it. The low reviews talk about it being big and hard. Well it is big but not ridiculously big. But big is good. And its not jelly soft or jelly flexible but its not a stick either. If you pushed on it, it would give a bit. Not a whole lot but enough. Men get just as hard when in the moment so whats the difference, other than that this thing is heaven. I would rank this as better than any I have tried before so far. The seller was also early in delivery which was nice. No complaints here what so ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great but worked.","review":"The vibration was not very powerful and the cap for the batteries did not line up properly so if we had wanted to use it in water we would not have been able to.

My GF picked this vibe out of the multitude of vibes and toys advertised on the internet. In short, she loves it and has even given her copy an affectionate name, Gertrude. (Gertrude starts with the letter, G, as in G-spot.)This vibe is quiet and effective. The level of vibration is gentle, not like a jack hammer. My GF sometimes uses it while I'm sleeping and I don't even wake up. Since my GF got her first copy we have sold dozens to members and guests at our swingers parties. We keep three of these vibes available for use as demos at every party and recommend them highly.Sheriff JackRainbow Group Hawaii"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits the right spot","review":"This item came packaged, new in the box.

Nothing more!","review":"So it does have a weird smell when you get it home but the thing I don't like is that it was too hard and not \\"human enough\\"...I would prefer if it was either a vibrator or a dild0.. not this thing that does both while trying to stimulate your g-spot!

I killed this thing within two weeks of receiving it. That's really disappointing, although not as much as it might have been if the product had been a little more satisfying to begin with. It never quite lived up to my former vibrators in intensity or how it was shaped to fit.Don't get me wrong; we had some good times - for a short time.

After almost a month of trying, I still don't orgasm with this toy alone.

I'm surprised it didn't burn a hole in my drawer. Fire hazard product and even before it melting was very touchy and would only work if I screwed it on just enough. DO NOT GET THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"128 People CAN be wrong! Don't waste your money on this.","review":"Clearly 128 people CAN be wrong. I made the mistake of trusting the positive reviews over the negative reviews. The smell is pretty strong and doesn't seem to improve after washing it with strongly scented soap but I can live with the smell, what makes this product absolutely useless to me is that the motor is VERY WEAK even on the highest setting using really good rechargeable batteries. The person who said it's about as weak as the vibration from a cell phone wasn't too far off. The only positive thing that I can say about this item is that it is so quiet that a fan could cover up the noise. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, spend a little more for something better than this. My quest for a STRONG yet relatively QUIET vibe continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not To Her Liking","review":"I bought this to play with with the wife - she didn't like it. We've had a number of vibrators but this one doesn't have the power that she needs - she said it feels like it might have the power but the jelly-substance makes it not be powerful enough. We're definitely not going to be using this vibrator unless there are no other options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Up To Par","review":"I was excited to recieve this item, only to be dissapointed after the first use. The viberator lacks much intensity, which does not assist in stimulation. The toy itself is very hard. I would comparte it to being glass, without the cold factor.

Overall i would not purchase this viberator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love the way it feels inside..but it never worked properly. The vibrator never quite vibrated.

I was surprised that I enjoyed it so much, but while not flexible, the size was good and length great; the adjustable dial gave you the exact speed you want. After 3 months it was drying on the counter after being washed (not submerged) it turned on, I assumed I had accidentally turned it on, however I had to remove the cap to get it to turn off.

However, this item doesn't provide enough stimulation. The highest setting is extremely mild, about as strong as a video game controller vibration. After I applied lubricant and inserted it, I had to adjust it several times to feel anything. Additionally, the hard material makes insertion uncomfortable if you are dry.If you are looking for a budget sized g spot stimulator, I recommend theTrinity Vibes Pink Waterproof Rabbit Vibrator. While I have to use a bullet externally to get the vibration I'm looking for, the g spot vibration from that product is very satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doc Johnson Lucid Dream","review":"At first, I was in love with this vibrator.

I was in the middle of using it this morning and it just stopped working. I thought \\"this is weird\\" because I'd just put new batteries in, but I got up, changed them, and still nothing.

Well, no pleasure here! After setting it aside for sometime, it still has an aweful smell and now it has a sticky feel to it that won't go away. I'm not sure if it's because the toy has been sitting unused for a while. Whatever the reason for the sticky residue, it's just one more reason for not liking this toy. I want to throw it out but worry about polluting the environment. Does anyone know of a way to safely discard unwanted sex toys? Oh well, for now it sits in my lockable Vibe chest, unused and will remain UNUSED! My suggestion, by-pass this toy. There are other toys available that are way better then this one."},{"rating":"2","title":":]","review":"I like fast speeds, and while it is true that it could go faster it does get the job done.

Before, I've tried to keep baby wipes in the car for those times when something is spilled or you just need to wipe your hands, but they dried out far too quickly. These have been under my seat for at least a year (maybe more) and the packaging retained the moisture well enough that I cleaned the inside of the windshield and all of the mirrors with one wipe.They can also be used to wipe up dried coffee drips, though they do dry out too quickly to give a good scrubbing (but that would be the 'streak-free' finish portion, so I can't fault it for that).It's a great product to keep stashed in the car. For around the house, though, I still prefer the old spray bottle and a paper towel."},{"rating":"1","title":"smudgy on reflective surfaces","review":"Excited to try these to make cleaning our stovetop easier, but all they did was leave a streaky linty mess that I had to use another towel to clean up after. Nothing convenient about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too much lint left behind.","review":"\\"Streak-free\\" doesn't count for much when the surface is covered with lint after cleaning. This is unacceptable for a product specifically designed for glass. I've tried several packages (as well as the earlier wipes that came in a plastic tube/container) so I'm fairly sure this problem isn't anecdotal. While convenient, regular bottled Windex and paper towels will do a superior cleaning job for less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It came broken....","review":"This appears to be a decent product, but I really can't tell. Mine came with a timer that 1/2 the LCD didn't work, so you really couldn't configure it or even set the time. From a slip in the box which describes this fault, It sounds like this is a known manufacturing problem. The worst part is that AMAZON basically abandoned me. They shipped me a faulty product and then said \\"call the manufacturer\\". My suggestion, if you are going to buy one of these, buy it somewhere with a return policy, not through AMAZON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works","review":"The product does a great job, when and if it works. The motor is a cheap Chinese motor, which they do not offer as a replacement part. I have had two motors fail, after warranty of course. They do not repair--the best they can do is sell you a new base, with the $3.00 motor, for about $70.00. The timer is available, for less at hardware stores. Shipping is excessive--I ended up paying $26.00+ to ship a small plastic spout($15) for the feeder.It is a great idea, it is just too expensive for molded plastic and a cheap motor. They need to do more testing.If you have problems, they are very hard to deal with. Customer service is a big problem. It is all about making money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"Ordered two of these from another site and both worked for about 5 minutes and then no more. Very poor design and no quality control. The screw in the center of the feeder stopped turning on the first one and the power device has copper showing from the connections which even after we fixed that still did not work. A total waste of money - too bad because I loved the idea of timed feedings for our barn cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Cat Proof","review":"I recently purchased a medium ERGO auto pet feeder. After some difficulty in understanding how to get the timer working, the directions are poor and the the buttons on the timer are not correctly marked, I got it working.All went well until on the second day of operation. I went downstairs to check on the feeder and the cat. Low and behold the cat had inserted his paw into the feeder spout and was shaking out cat food pellets. He would eat them and then repeat the operation. I then put my finger into the feeder spout and was able to shake the feeding device and get out cat food pellets.Needless to say this was not what I was lead to believe in the product advertising. Failure to make the feeder cat proof is a major design flaw. My cat is no Albert Einstein, so this will be a problem for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"not quite what it appears to be in the picture as the one I received does not have the little door flap but an attachment that directs the food down into the dish with clearance for the food but not for little paws to get up into. I got the medium size for two cats and it works well with catfood. I had to get a replacement for another unit I had that my cat figured out how to put his paw up inside and flick the auger to get more food out. He eventually broke the auger. I do not this this will be a problem with the unit. One other thing to be aware is the auger in this unit turns very slowly so it will take 30-60 seconds to dispense a portion. I thought it wasn't working when I first plugged it in to test it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numerous Errors","review":"I would have to disagree with the other reviews of this text. I found this book full of gramatical errors, typos, and errors in the source code. The concepts presented in the text are exelent and the authors do a fine job of presenting these ideas. It is unfortunate that the editing was not better and that some of the source code seemingly was not compiled and tested prior to being included in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of errors and novice style of programming","review":"Stay away unless you are desperate to lay hands on any data structures book. It has so many errors. Poor editing can confuse you. The code is written in often very beginner's style while no thought is given to Whys and Why Nots of an approach. Definitely not a good reference. Use and throw perhaps.The program outputs are needlessly printed without any sensible explaination for most of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book due to it's errors.","review":"As stated by many others, this book contains many errors; especially in the program code that is listed in the book.There are numerous places where function calls written in the programs given make reference to variables that don't exist and won't run without editing. There are some sections where functions are added to the program code that are not discussed nor relevant to the topic at hand as if sections were cut and pasted without checking for accuracy.The whole book is full of these types of things. So while the theory behind the logic seems to be sound, the examples and applications are so wrought full of holes that you'll probably spend more time trying to debug and decipher the code than focus on what you're trying to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors, Avoid.","review":"Avoid this book like the plague.The authors did a decent job in presenting the ideas and concepts, BUT here's why I do not recommend this book:- Too Many Errors in the source code.

It has many grammatical errors and typos.They should have never released this book.Find another book on Data Structures don't waste your time with this one like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"O.K., we all know it's a gimmick, but it's such a good gimmick that you can't help but be won over. John O. Whitney and Tina Packer extract timeless truths about human nature from the works of Shakespeare and apply them to today's business world. Theme by theme, the authors tackle power, communication, trust, decision, action, hierarchy and women in management. Linking business dramas and dilemmas faced by today's companies and corporate leaders to those faced by Shakespeare's characters, the authors serve up a treasure trove of valuable insight and guidance in this immensely satisfying book. We [...] recommend this book to anyone in business or outside of it.

Songs that were okay on the original CD come alive on this disk.I still say the definitive RT album is Watching the Dark. But for someone interested in one of the great out-of-mainstream songwriter/guitarist of the last 30 years, Action Packed makes an excellent introduction. The remastering makes it valuable to us long-time fans as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maximum Strength, economy of action","review":"I am a fan of early Richard Thompson, shoot out the lights and such, but I picked this comp up on first hearing Persuasion a song so delicately beautiful but not sappy that I had to get it, not the Tim finn version although that is good, Richard has a way of really capturing a sense of melancholy that is his hallmark. Richard wipes the floor with clapton who is stuck in AOR mode. Richard has the chops and doesn't need to flaunt it he plays what he needs and is the real deal. Get this comp as it has some really life affirming tracks and of course persuasion which is worth the price of admission alone! Clapton is not God Richard may be as close as any of us may get to in the form of a musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone...","review":"but it is for me. Great guitarist (I can only dream to be 1/4 as good)unique song-writer and singer, a true original. I have been a fan since the Fairport Convention years and have the 4 Richard and Linda Thompsons on well worn LP's along with two of the capital records. This is just a nice selection and sampling of the great work he did for Capitol. Songs like I Misunderstood (we'll always be such good friends you and I), Feel So good (I wanna break somebodys heart), etc. are just too good and great to sing along with as are all of his songs. My one minor quibble is the omission of Two Left Feet, love that song, probably because I dance like I have two left feet. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius and Heart","review":"Open note to Don Henley and Glen Frey, \\"Persuasion\\" belongs on an Eagles Album for 2 reasons, A) You covered Ol' 55 and introduced thousands to Tom Waits (thank you), plus made Tom a few bucks (See Glen's joke on the Live CD from the box set). So get yourself a classic single and B) introduce this man's gifts to a wider part of the world. Sacrifice a few royalties (Don, you cannot have all the money, no mater what anyone tells you). For everyone else, what makes this CD so tremendous is the jaw dropping guitar, the heart that is so evident in the vocals,and the honest insights into basic human behavior that the lyrics hold. This man sees and hears things that many of us cannot, than he shows them back to us so we can better understand our lives. That is the function of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the collection I'd have made.","review":"Sure are a lot of good songs on this record. Not as many as on, say, Mirror Blue, but about average for a Richard Thompson record. So how did they choose them?

It even seems to avoid the very best songs of all from each record (This is less subjective than it sounds).

If I had listened to the CD I would of moved on to real talent! First of all I've haven't experience any talent on the guitar! I would rate his chord playing talents in the likes of Bob Dylan or Willie Nelson (but not the song writing and singing talents!) I've personally heard better performers at the city park.

The songs range from haunting ballads (Beeswing), dark-scary (Cold Kisses), and pure rock (Razor Dance, Fully Quallified To Be Your Man). This CD shows why RT is regardes as a genious by the people who actually 'listen' to him. I don't know why he's being compared to Eric Clapton. There are way too many differences between them to make a good comparison. If I were to compare Richard with someone more famous I would say he's like Bob Dylan with a much better voice. All the songs here are great, but I would say the CD is worth buying just for \\"52 Vincent Black Lightning\\", which is one of the greatest songs of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critical Architecture","review":"This book is not for someone looking for structural systems, mechanical systems, or simply physical form. In other words, this book is not going to appeal to people who believe architecture is simply about building any kind of building. Zaha is trying to show us that architecture is so much more because it affects us in so many unimaginable ways. Her book and her work must be looked at carefully and consciously. Her work is about presenting critical ideas and opinions on constructions and the way we live. Take nothing for granted. We are not all contractors, developers, or money-hungry architects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Source Book","review":"The book reminded me a lot of the Radical reconstruction by Lebbeus Woods, witch I love(d).

If you're expecting a book that *clearly* depicts an architect's works, with photos, sketches, diagrams and floorplans, this book isn't quite the best book for that.

Of all authors, I was really disappointed in the blatant reuse of specific examples: the orangest orange example, the Peanuts back-of-the-shoes example. Others. I did read it cover-to-cover in one night. I did chuckle. I did enjoy the examples. But there was no blinding new insight.Having loved his original, I'm disappointed with the sequel.

In this book, as in his previous bestseller, Selling the Invisible, he offers wise and witty on-target assessments about human nature. His candid observations come from his extensive experience as head of his own marketing firm. Written in an intelligent, conversational style, this breezy book gets right to the heart of what works and what doesn't in marketing. Beckwith breaks open every myth and standard business practice in the industry. He incorporates plenty of examples and anecdotes, not just from the business world, but from literature, pop culture, the arts, history, and more.

With music character to the late 1600's, this album is not only a soundtrack to immortalize this great plot, but a true classical cd as well. The different styles of classical: action music, romantic music, and ballroom music are all a part of this cd. As a devoted Dumas and classical fan, I find this cd constantly in my cd player. A definite 5 stars. If you like this soundtrack, you would LOVE the Three Musketeers soundtrack.

I believe this book is an excellent resource and explains a great deal about the history, workmanship, and variety of Oriental carpets, but it also includes tips on how to shop (including haggling), how to pick rugs based on your home, and cleaning and care recommendations.

It shows my favorite scene where Elton is playing the song \\"Harmony\\" a pump organ outside while the band is sitting around a tree. That scene alone was worth the cost. The types of things Elton and Bernie discuss are the things I used to always want to know about. The \\"process\\" I guess of crafting a song. I learned a lot of things I never knew before.

Behold fellow reader, not since the days of the Crusades have we seen such a complete and utter war on the senses.

Viva Elton John! And God Bless the Queen! Not only am I listening to this CD...I am feeling it! Day by day, hour by hour, and sweat by sweat on the edge of my brow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete! Was not worth the price,","review":"I was very disappointed with this dvd. First they say 90 minutes of time on the dvd but I believe there was only about 45 minutes. They call out a bonus section but it is a repeat of the first 45 minutes. I feel if they put a cut of every song, thats on the double album, and added those songs to the dvd, that would have been much more suitable. They do not even have a list of the songs or the great art work from the album.. Most dvd's made these days are jam packed with info. I am old enough to have bought the double album when it came out, and it changed my life. If a new fan would like to purchase a copy of this dvd they are not getting the whole picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elton John: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.","review":"I had other expectations about this album ( Elton John: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road DVD), such as live music instead of interviews and cuts.I purshased \\"one night only\\" and I hope to be more lucky this time.Rgds.,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer Beware","review":"If you like Elton John's music, do NOT buy this dvd.

No where does it say in the promo on this DVD that it is not a music show, but a word show. Leave your money in your pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Albums - Elton John: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road","review":"This is a complete theft of my money and if you buy it, it will be of your money TOO!

It turns out that all along it was this gear. I noticed a fair amount of slop in the rotor when I replaced it and read up on that issue. Apparently, the V6 Vortech is known for worn distributor gears.Since replacing it, my idle is much nicer and that first 1/8 throttle feels more responsive. No more highway miss either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, OEM distributor gear","review":"Turns out I didn't need this part, but since I had the distributor off, went ahead and replaced. Very easy to install and perfect fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you hate MS then this book is for you!","review":"I bought this book, expecting to get a serious description of Steve Ballmer, but it turns out this is just another book in the infamous serie \\"We who hate/envy Microsoft!\\". In this book all competitors, such as Sun, Netscape and IBM, is presented as a nice group of companies that all follow the rules, and never offend anyone. At the same time this book says muliple times that Bill G and Steve B run their business as Nazi leaders; the book does comparisons with the war criminal Slobodan Milosovic, and the author does a lot of irrelevant personal comments. This is not what I expect from a serious book - It could have been a very interesting book, if just the author was more neutral. There are a lot of other good books that explains MS and their business methods, if you are interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"I was expecting more insight. What I got was an endless series of content-free anecdotes, long descriptions of technology the author clearly doesn't understand, and a bunch of factual errors and misspellings. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice rehashing of the Microsoft story","review":"Microsoft's CEO Steven Ballmer is the subject of \\"Bad Boy Ballmer\\". It traces Ballmer and Gates friendship back to their days at Harvard University. It uses primarily secondary sources to give a nice rehashing of the Microsoft story. We learn of Ballmer's Jewish heritage, Detroit roots and even have a mention of Robin Williams. We learn of Ballmer's enthusiasm, tearing his vocal cords, ascension to the CEO position, and his arrogance. While technically a biography, it is more a history of Microsoft with Steve Ballmer as the focal point. Read and reviewed by Jimmie A. Kepler."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Gem","review":"Fredric ya gotta fan. The book is a gem! Felt like I was looking at a well-cut stone;brilliant light reflecting and refracting on the computer industry and the \\"bigger than life\\" it seems men that run it or are run down by it.

First as a cop and now as a freelance investigator, he has used his skill at spotting scams to bust enough grifters to fill a $3.99 buffet. When casino pit bosses find the house getting taken to the cleaners by the best, they know Tony's the man to stop them.\\"Grift Sense\\" is James Swain's first novel and it's a winner. The story is very interesting and unfolds at a well-measured, suspenseful pace. Like Elmore Leonard, Swain has the knack for creating the kind of thugs and larcenous malcontents whom you can't help but be like.This book is supposed to be the first in a series featuring Tony Valentine. I hope the author is already hard at work on the next volume because I'm looking forward to reading more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grift Sense Delivers","review":"Retired detective Tony Valentine takes us behind the glitz and glitter of Nevada casinos to find the grifter who took the Acropolis blackjack tables for a bundle...Only problem is:he's been dead for years! Valentine's investigation involves the usual, and not-so- usual, suspects; crooked cops and hired killers. We meet whales and minnows, plungers and pensioners, super- stars and wannabes. Mr. Swain took me for an enjoyable ride, and then he floored it for a keep-your-eyes-on the-road-and-your-hands-on-the-wheel finish. I enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Grift Sense!","review":"Jim Swain writes for the people! I can never put any book down once I start if he is the creator . It moves, changes, he makes you empathetic and angry. I laugh out loud during Mr. Lucky every time I reread it. Yes! I reread his books because it's like visiiting old friends. I reccomend starting with the first Tony Valentimne series and keep going. Delicious words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Rollicking, Las Vegas Thriller","review":"This is Swain's first Tony Valentine novel and it's a good one. The book centers around a massive scam aimed at a raggedy Las Vegas hotel casino and features characters that would do justice to Elmore Leonard or Damon Runyon. Protagonist Valentine, an aging retired Atlantic City cop and now casino consultant, is a worthy hero and provides the book's locomotion. Swain knows how to write a breezy book that keeps you rapt from page one. His knowledge of gambling and casino operations, combined with his writing ability and imagination, offers up a tale that is a delight to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining dectective novel","review":"James Swain's Tony Valentine isn't your typical detective-story hero: he's a retired Atlantic City cop in his early 60s, who now lives in Florida, where he runs a consulting business named after the book's title. He consults with casinos who suspect they're being scammed by cheaters (grifters).Valentine, whose wife has died and who has troubles with his son, is hired by a second-rate (or less) casino, and we follow his efforts to figure out how a blackjack player and a dealer are scamming the casino.The plot is complicated, and the colorful characters are the usual assortment of cops, security men, bad guys, and eccentrics. The dialogue is crisp. Yes, we've seen this all before, but it's not usually done this well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Humor, Nice Flow for first of series","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read 2-3 books a week. This one kept my attention. When I review a book I ask, Did it keep my interest? Does it have humor? Is it well written? Does the ending have resolve? I answered yes to all these questions after reading Grift Sense.This is the first of a series of 4. The author is also an expert on gambling. You could tell. The main character, Valentine, is likeable and funny. I can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste Of Time","review":"Las Vegas gambling and the grifters that attempt to cheat the casinos. A book of repugnant characters doing ridiculous things. The plot is confused and uninteresting. If this is the best author Swain can do, he ought to find other employment (and so should the editor and publisher who put out this tripe)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent light for city riding","review":"This is a great light for city riding. It is bright and has a long battery life. The mount is secure and has a quick release so you can take the light with you. The body is waterproof and opens without tools, plus it is very compact. What more do you need?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"This light is great. I use it at night all the time when I'm riding and it's very useful. It makes all the difference when trying to see the road. Sometimes it would be useful to have a wider beam spread but then I'd have to buy a larger/bulkier light. Good product for the size and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safety 1st!","review":"This is a safety light, which can be used in constant beam or flashing modes. It is easily visible at a distance, which is what I wanted - cars coming my way on a grey day should know I'm on the road. It is not designed to illuminate your path.Easy to mount & use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright and Powerful","review":"I really like this light.It's compact so that when I remove it from my bike, it fits nicely in my pocket. It has a very bright, very focused light. It's great for when there are no street lights. I also like that there are only three seettings; blinking, steady and off. You don't need to make anything any more complicated.It's a good light, simple and clean design that works well. What more can you ask for."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent light...","review":"The light is bright enough I suppose although my only gripe is that the bracket mount's clamp doesn't snap securely shut into place. It only closes but doesn't give me the assurance that it's snug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good visibility, poor fastening device","review":"This works very well in terms of providing light. It's bright and very visible. I feel safer riding with it.The big problem is that the piece which attaches it to the handlebars is difficult to adjust tightly if you have any bend in your bar. Mine perpetually slumps forward.The connection between the light and ring, however, is great. I'm confident the light will stay on, but it's easy to remove in a hurry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Price","review":"Considering how inexpensive this light is, it seems to be a bit brighter than the rest in the price range.As others have said, in flashing mode, the light is considerably bright, and will help you to be seen. Steady-on mode is best for dark streets without streetlights, but another light to supplement would be ideal.Not as good as some high-power external battery lights, but also much less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Out of Three Have Failed","review":"We have bought three, and two have failed. They worked great until they died, but I won't be buying any more. The problem seems to be the switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bright at all","review":"I've been using this light for about a year now and it is not worth the money I spent on it. It is a bike that will let cars see you, but that is pretty much it. I ride in a fairly dark area, and if I ride more than 4mph, I can't see a thing. The mount is also poorly designed and never seems tight.The only real benefits to this light are that it is cheap, and it uses AA batteries, which can be found pretty much anywhere, and the battery life is good.If you need a light that will actually help you see, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 6 months","review":"The front light is not very bright, and broke after less than 6 months. Other than that, it was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light!","review":"Simple to take on and off the bike, fits easily into a pocket, and provides pretty good light, too. (It's not going to light up the street, but it will definitely make you visible to cars and show you what's directly ahead.) I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I almost didn't buy this CD, but I am glad I did","review":"I saw the other review that said you could not use this CD offline, so I almost didn't buy it. But it had more tutorials than all the MAX books, an a friend had it and liked it. So I took a chance, and found out that it works great. You don't have to be online, and it doesn't run slow. Anyway, I really like all the material and modeling tutorials on this CD. I've been using MAX for about six months, and I think its very hard to learn. There are so many tricks you have to know and terms you have to learn. This CD really helped me figure out what was going on. I highly recommend it.

Chloe was clingy and spineless.Matthew didn't seem to have any ability to focus, instead he was constantly worried about Chloe.The elderly companions were a copy of the Golden Girls.Perhaps I should make another Dee Davis selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, don't get the attraction","review":"I bought this book after the glowing reviews here but have to say I'm seriously disappointed. I didn't feel like the characters jumped out of the pages, the heroine was irritating- the author was going for funny and quirky and it never really worked. And the romantic scenes were just plain boring with absolutely no heat. When an author needs to use lines like \`riding the stars together' they should just stick to suspense. If you want a story with a good amount of humor, vivid characters and some passion read something by Susan Donovan or Charlaine Harris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Bother","review":"Only read this if you want to waste your time!

I am distressed because some Poser-related utilities don't come in Macintosh versions. I thought I'd try to learn Python and write some of my own.I gave up after less than 100 pages.

I find it to be the easiest, fastest way to get useful results. Of the six books I've read, this one is the best introduction to programming with Python that I've used.

Still, I must recommend this highly for anyone who digs guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Thoughts From A Simple Man","review":"I've read this book, and I can honestly say that there is nothing surprising here. The core material for this text may have come from Reagan's own hand, but it is still nothing more than a timeworn repetition of the McCarthy-era blather his speechwriters penned for him way back in the 1950s. It's sad that Reagan could never nudge his petrified mind beyond this sort of black & white world view, and it's equally sad that he continued publicly preaching it right through the 1980s. What's even sadder, though, is the sheer number of people he deluded with this Simple Simon message.This book is a valuable historical document, and people should read it for that reason. It will leave future researchers scratching their heads in wonder at the gullibility of the American public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Republican Standard Evident Here","review":"I enjoy books like these, they're authentic and relatively honest. That said, a President should not be praised merely for their sense of awareness. Shouldn't that be a minimum requirement of any president or human being? Look at President Bush, hmmm...maybe not.Reagan was a warm person who knew how to make Americans feel good about themselves, which came in handy during those great international relations (America is better than you!) he was known for. He was an actor playing the president, nothing more. To think that he is being deified is ridiculous. Say what you will about Clinton, he was far more competent as a world leader. He spoke the truth, not just what the public wanted to hear, and he was not afraid to confront his opposition without a script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Study Item","review":"Even before President Reagan's passing, I had wanted to find a book that would outline his political views. When I finally got around to it, I chose this book and so far find it enthralling. You soon learn to read through some of the cross-outs that the editors decided to leave in because it is a book of his handwritten drafts of his radio addresses. I've decided to flag some of my favorite addresses that can be updated for the world today for later study. That's the great thing about any great thinker; his thoughts and words are always able to be updated for the time you are in, and I think Reagan's words, including these radio addresses, will live on as long as the free world reigns. Great book, you should buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Terribly Illuminating Material","review":"84% of the book is Reagan's handwritten drafts of his radio punditry from 1975 to 1979. Reagan liked to take a small selection of what for him amounted to fact and build a conservative argument around it. Sometimes it's convincing, sometimes it's less so, but nearly always it's pretty boring stuff. Reagan's genius was his simple vision of what America could be if it stopped apologizing for itself. The way he energized his staff to that end when he became President is the real story of his uniqueness (George Shultz' Foreword is perhaps more illuminating in this respect). The material in this book does little to advance our understanding of that uniqueness. And of course wading through the crossed-out prose and the bad spellings merely becomes tedious after awhile. It might be excellent for Reagan groupies or serious historians, but it is hardly great reading fare for the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight - beautiful writing","review":"It doesn't matter what you think of Ronald Reagan - this book is uplifting and insightful.I think what most people will find somewhat surprising is the intellectual depth that Reagan had.

Reagan was a big thinker with big ideas who had the courage to act on them.The only downside to reading the book is that you are left wondering why today's Republican's don't/won't take Reagan's playbook and run with it.

When you push them in the whole box falls apart because the folds in the box are in the way of the tabs.If you scotch tape the ends after destroying the box they still don't work.The wrap itself does not stick to anything.

All of the stories in to book are explained very well and I think it was a good idea to write a book about the women in the Holocaust because not many books tell about women's lives.

So, once the child has \\"dissected\\" the frog and removed the organs, it is a matter of guesswork as to how they go back in. More like just fitting them in best you can rather than really understanding how the various pices/organs fit back into the frog. It would be far more useful if there were a schematic diagram which the child could follow to reassemble the internal organs. As such this turned out to be a \\"play with it once\\" and then put it on the shelf item. Too bad as it is a great idea.

Unfortunately there is no way to turn off the option to use it as a media device since this depends on the operating system, windows XP will only recognize the player as a media device, other versions of windows (ME and 2000 ) will recognize it as a mass storage device instead.( you have the player with the sigmatel chip so it cannot be changed to a mass storage device manually ).''

A little research will show that \\"Full Speed\\" actually means the same speed as USB1.1 (12mbps) - what people usually think of as \\"USB2\\" is actually called \\"Hi-Speed\\" and is 480mbps, 40x faster.USB1.1 speeds are too slow for a unit with 2GB of storage - they're barely acceptable with a 512MB unit. (Imagine having a 2GB flash drive that could only read and write at USB1.1 speeds - that's basically the situation with this.)In this unit's defense, like the 512MB model, it's got more bells and whistles than a similar iPod shuffle - but the USB1.1 speeds are a real deal-breaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible user interface--not worth it","review":"I got this because it was cute and inexpensive.

The script makes every single mistake that's normally corrected by your very first screenwriting teacher. Everything feels forced. Backstory is conveyed in the most obvious of methods. The acting is just plain god-awful. I think I only watched the whole thing because I was hoping there would be something at the end like, \\"Hey, we were just kidding! Didn't this movie suck?

However, it isn't a show-stopper, since it will get \\"weathered\\" anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Administrative Law Hornbook Disappoints","review":"I am extremely disappointed with the Administrative Law edition of the Hornbook Series. This volume, written by Alfred C. Aman, contains dozens of of grammatical and spelling errors. The writing style is also extremely cluttered and confusing. Aman regurlarly shifts back and forth between different ideas and concepts in a single sentence, making it difficult to digest the information he seeks to provide. Although some of the sections are better written and organized than others, I got the impression that this edition was rushed to press at the last minute without being reviewed by an editor. I would not recommend it. Stick with the Answers & Explanations Series by Seaman & Funk. While it does not cite to as many cases or cover the issues presented with as much depth, it is far easier to understand and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music, Great Style!","review":"If the great female pop groups of the WWII era were still performing, they'd find some real competition in the Boogie Woogie Babies. This is music you can just get lost in -- wonderful harmonies wrapped around beautiful songs simmering over playful enthusiasm. If you don't like this music there has to be a shadow on your soul; listen again and watch the light pour in!Check out the Boogie Woogie Babies Amazon Store, listen to the sample MP3s from theirBoogie Beehives & Beyondalbum, and try to catch them live on stage. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Atlas","review":"This is a very good travel atlas. It features the U.S., Canada and Mexico with detailed information about major cities. It also has maps of the major airports as well.The atlas also has milage charts, the \\"Best of the Road\\" - where they tell you the best places to eat, shop and stay, and also has the \\"Land of the Free\\" that points out 25 places across the country that you can visit for free.All in all, I was impressed with the ease of the atlas and suprised with the number of different things I was able to use it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEMORIES GALORE","review":"Growing up in the sixties you had to have heard \\"I've Got Rhythm\\" by the Happenings. The nostolgia of fun summers equates with friends from youth and dreams realized and dreams forgotten. Yet the music seems to live forever. Thanks for making these CDs available."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I was looking for","review":"Trying to increase my colelction of older music I enjoyed growing up and this one was a nice colelction of The Happening's tunes from 60's era.What gets me is so many younger people today only think the Beatles were the only band in those days who made any music, when in fact, so much quality USA-made music and excellent musicians were everywhere and The Happenings are like those who seemed to be forgotten about along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be revised","review":"I wish I had looked at the pub date more carefully before ordering this book. FMFM hasn't been revised, so all of the forms are outdated and therefore, useless. Some of the info is helpful, but who needs information that 6 years old?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for anyone new to baking","review":"Eleanor Klivans has written some of the best dessert cookbooks that I have seen. My husband who never baked before these books has become the best pastry chef I know. Everyone wants his recipes and they are ALL from the previous books of Eleanor Klivans. This new book is formatted wonderfully with each chapter presenting a new and a little more acvanced technique. The savory section is wonderful for vegetarian choices and the desserts, as always, are inventive and absolutely delicious. I don't know another author who does a better job, especially for the \\"baking challenged.\\" Hopefully the first books will be back in print, as the previous three were treasures of treats and should become classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"good old time science fiction","review":"I like this old-time science fiction because it has a lot of science speculation - something that seems to be missing from some of the most recent examples of this genre. This is something of a thriller-suspense \\"mystery\\" novel. It is a fun as well as a fast read. It involves a mutant species which can ingest another species and mimic its DNA causing all kinds of havoc. A group of scientists and one young policemen solve the mystery - actually quite exciting in a quaint sort of way..."},{"rating":"2","title":"herein lies the issue...","review":"While the negative reviews here hold a certain amount of water, it must be understood that this is certainly not a \\"traditional\\" biography, if a biography at all. I came upon this book from the opposite direction as previous commentators, as an fan of literature with a passing interest in boxing. Tosches' entire ouevre reads much the same way as this text: pop cultural riffing, hyperbolic spiritual send-ups, flourishes of bizarrely germane quotes. But it all works.I can safely admit that this won't serve as an effective biography for anyone hoping for detailed accounts of Liston's fights, but it is a wonderfuly tempered, passionate work. In terms of boxing studies, if you care at all for the style of Oates' \\"On Boxing,\\" this is certainly worth a paltry $0.19."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad but could have been better","review":"This book is worth reading but it could have been a lot better. The author should have left out some of his personal commentary, which was bad enough and made even worse in many cases because it often had nothing to do with the subject matter and seemed totally random. However for all its faults it has more stuff about Sonny Liston than anything else I have ever read. It more or less obsesses on his \\"darkside\\" more than boxing or anything else. His various run ins with the law and prison stints, the possibility that he threw the fights against Cassius Clay, his association with the mob, and it explores whether or not he was murdered instead of dying of a heroin overdose as the official story claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these characters?","review":"So many names. So many digressions. So much gratuitous cussing.Who are all these people? Why do they each have a name and four nicknames?This writing is so self-absorbed that the story is virtually incomprehensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lousy Book","review":"This Nick Tosches book focuses primarily upon, (1) Nick Tosches, and (2) organized crime, rather than upon Sonny Liston. Tosches' writing is overwrought and self-indulgent; the history he provides is thin and unrevealing; and the portrait he draws of Liston - a truly fascinating, troubled, and battered figure - is cartoonish. Tosches skips over the two Liston-Clay (Ali) fights in a couple pages, despite their importance to the Liston career and the national mood at the time. He instead embraces Chuck Wepner, who may be a nice guy but lacks any significance in the fight-game. In sum, the Tosches misses the story almost entirely, and his narcissistic writing style ends up wasting the reader's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil and Sonny Liston","review":"The book gives a great insight into the unknown aspects of Sonny Liston's life. Nick Tosches' writing works well with the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Boxing and I HATED this Book !","review":"Sonny Liston was without a doubt, one of the most interesting stories in boxing history. He was mean, tough and just a genuine badass. Moreover, he had mob connections and a truly strange past. However, reading this book you would not get such a fascinating portrait of him. Instead, you will get fifty pages of his family tree and other unnecessary and un-entertaining info. I cannot describe in words how much I hated this book. This guy took an enigmatic icon and buried him under page and page of trivial nonsense, which did nothing more than demonstrate the tedious writing style of a pompous twit. Sonny, you deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"I was very displeased with this book. It was very disjointed. I didnt learn much more about Liston than i already knew. There was very little detail about his fights. The author gives slanted details as to why he thinks the first Liston-Clay fight was fixed. He ignors the fact that Sonny was beat up durring that fight and that Sonny's corner used a substance to blind Clay during the fight. That part of the book reminded me of some of the rediculous conspiracy theory books out there. I think everyone would agree the second fight was fixed, but not the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashes a sacred cow with a hard left","review":"Sonny Liston was an animal. Sonny Liston was a lowlife. Okay, he was no role model. Sonny Liston was a problem for society. But inside a boxing ring, Sonny Liston was a force of nature: he could pummel opponents like no one before him.This book treats Liston's life as an American tragedy and makes a compelling case that he was made to throw both Muhammad Ali fights under direct orders of the Mob. After reading this entertaining book, it is only possible to look at the famous photo of Ali raising his victorious arms above the prone Liston, with a wry and knowing smile about how fraudulent was the result.If you are a fan of Muhammad Ali, you will squirm while reading this book. If you despise Ali, this book is a must for your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tosches Down For The Count","review":"If you are interested in reading a book written in a sorry, fourth rate Norman Mailer style, this pathetic book may be for you. Filled with idle speculation and needless jive, the author repeatedly attempts to impress the reader as being \\"in the know\\" on the subject matter. Anyone familiar with Sonny Liston's career will realize that the book is merely a regurgitation of old magazine articles and tired old stories.The term \\"shadow boxing\\" applies to this book. The author dances around the understanding of Sonny Liston, never really connecting with one sold punch. Avoid this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a biography or even a book about boxing","review":"This was the most tedious book I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Having read dozens of boxing biographies, I was thrilled to see that someone had chosen to write about Sonny Liston. Liston was larger than life in every way, he was the original bad-ass of boxing. However, what Nick Tosches decides to concentrate his efforts on is....uhhh....I have no idea what he is concentrating on. The guy is all over the place, but generally spending most of his time on inane and trivial matters that no Liston or boxing fan would care about. Seriously, this guy is an awful writer. I'm not sure if he considers himself a bad-ass as well, but I would love to meet him and tell him what a lousy writer he is. Certainly if Sonny was alive today, he would have given this guy a beating for screwing up his biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Sonny Liston Please, Nick","review":"As other reviewers have stated, this is not the best boxing book ever. It was really hard to get through, especially when the subject matter took many detours. Definitely not even coverage of Liston's fights. Also struggled with Tosche's writing style, which had a liking for really bad metaphors.Now to try and find another Liston book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"Tosches is a writer of substantial talent, witness his Dean Martin and Jerry Lee Lewis bios. Unfortunately, his effort here misses the mark, and in a big way. This tome is filled with gristle and no beef. Short on details but long on speculation, Tosches takes the reader on an unfulfilling ride to nowhere. This is a book about a heavyweight fighter. Sad to say, it carries the punch of a featherweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"How did he write such a boring book about such an interesting character. Very little about the fights or fighhters of the era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh...the drama!","review":"I struggled through this book, reading painful page after painful page. If it were not for my personal interest in Sonny Liston, I would not have made it through. And at the end of it all, I was left feeling cheated, uninformed, and ANGRY (I felt similarly after seeing \\"Showgirls\\"). Now, in my mind, Nick Tosches owes me some time.Tosches tries too hard. Tosches mistakes melodrama for poeticism.I'll recap the meat of the text for you here and now:Sonny Liston grew up poor. Sonny Liston became a criminal. Sonny Liston learned to box. Sonny Liston was really feared. Sonny Liston was connected to the mob. Sonny Liston died of heart failure. The End.Avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jan Karon fans Rejoyce","review":"\\"The perfect series for fans of Jan Karon's Mitford books.

The song reminds me a little, ok more than a little, of Bryan Adams. (The same can be said even more so regarding \\"Starting to Hurt\\", the worst track on Demolition).The B-side track is the non-album track \\"Blue\\", which makes this single a lot more interesting. It shows Ryan basking in the glory of retro-sounding guitars, you could say twanging. In the end, this single is not necessary but for the Ryan Adams completist."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-58912a4b"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/36.md","filePath":"guide/36.md"}'),R={name:"guide/36.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
