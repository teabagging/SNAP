This book offers a \\"what if\\" scenario that has obviously not come to pass. If the beginning premise is that UFOs could be anything then this book almost has an air of plausibility. Almost. As is becoming apparent, UFOs from 1945 on appear to be man-made craft. The military and governments of all countries have responded in the same way: ridicule, denial, and more recently, the release of documents and records that show confusion and intense interest, at least in the early days, but, ultimately, no definitive action, aside from further denials and 'official' disinterest.

I read it a little over a year ago and since that time have read all but 2 of his novels. One of which I am reading now and the next will follow shortly.

This time I knew what to expect and once I started the book I couldn't put it down. The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove is a delightfully demented retelling of Pete's Dragon with a style of humor that rivals Terry Pratchett.Moore's books are especially funny to me because there is a Pine Cove, California and while it's not where Moore has located it, he's captured the town's many small town quirks perfectly.

While not for children, parts get a bit racy at times, any adult should enjoy this book ... be it for reading in a plane, bus, car or on the beach.

The quality is more than acceptable for headphones under $60 US.

Armstrong, Horace Grant, my main man John Paxson, perform in 6 Championship Series is nothing short of incredible. One more thing... to those who think Kobe is 'better' than MJ, think of it like this...

This dvd set not only takes you through their arduous journeys during their championship years, but it also includes some of the NBA's Greatest Games (i.e.-Game 5 of 1997 Finals; Game 6 of 1998 Finals).

The answers are unexpected and seldom reached easily - indeed, the stakes in this book are high ones: fidelity, faith, life, death. Some characters in this book long for the past, where, they seem to suggest, everything was simpler and everyone had his or her place. Bill's novel challenges that interpretation of the past and presents a a terrifying but ultimately affirming vision of the present which is neither Mormon nor heathen, gay nor straight.But what happens? A single mother, raising her young son in glitzy Las Vegas gets a phone at work. Amid the sounds of the casino, her aunt's voice tells her, \\"Come home. Your father's got the gun out.\\" And we're off.Bills shifts between the points of view with ease and story unfolds masterfully and with surprising suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so series doesn't take advantage of its talent","review":"I purchased this set for the \\"Soul Man\\" segment starring James Marsters and Roger Daltrey. None of the four stories, however is all that engaging despite having some notable actors taking part. The stories are somewhat predictable, the acting is uneven (Peter Strauss appears to be sleepwalking through his performance although his segment is perhaps the most interesting), and since each of them is rather brief you have little time to be engaged by the characters even when the actors have something to work with.

The owner of the disco enlists the help of \\"hot disco chicks\\" to try and persuade the rockers to succumb to the dark side, a/k/a disco!Perfectly cast, cleverly written, and well acted, \\"STRANGE FREQUENCY\\" is worth buying for the \\"DISCO INFERNO\\" segment alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Useful, But also Out-dated and Junk Science","review":"The author lists many useful (but obvious) items in protecting Earth (insularting your home, recycling, etc).

That's what happens when you rely on emotional crusaders instead of reason and science. And we have also found that humans have little - if anything - to to with ozone depletion (don't hear much about anymore) or global warming.

Most of the album could just as well have been recorded in 1964-65, and clearly the heyday of the band was coming to an end.But apart from this, it's actually a fine 1960's pop album; several fine songs, fine production etc.The band members were even beginning to write fine songs themselves. On this album \\"Busy Line\\" and the bonus-track \\"Nobody Needs to Know\\" are good examples of this. Other highlights are Donovan's \\"Museum\\" and \\"Don't Go Out into the Rain\\".

The only bright spot is Eva Mendes as the nanny, who may not have turned in the best performance of her career but is at least believable. If you really feel you must then rent it for the kids.

These are the days in where Scarlett Johansson was not even famous at all, she was just there, this was pre-scarlett johansson, before her success in lost in translation and girl with a pearl earring. i have not seen it but i am going by the trailer and i say get it, this is a gem, you can't go wrong with a johansson film. they all have substance!

It's a lengthy book, but it had my attention from the very first line because Claridge immediately delved into the personality of Rockwell and showed how his personal life influenced his art. The book also fully depicted Rockwell's family and how they impacted his work. Claridge writes intelligently, a bit dramatically, and always interestingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I found this book very difficult to read for the following reasons. First, the text is in serious need of a good editor and could be cut by 20 to 30%. Second, the prose is difficult to read not because it contains profound thoughts, but that the sentences seem to be \\"tangled\\" and eccentrically constructed. Third there is too much psycho nonsense. Even professional psychiatrists tend to tread very carefully when discussing subjects that they have never met - Anthony Storrs on Sir Winston Churchill or the late John Mack on T. E. Lawrence. Psycho babble about Norman Rockwell doesn't teach us anything and only makes the author seem foolish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky controls, inconsistent recording","review":"Awkward clunky controls make this a poor choice for someone who wants to use the product regularly. The VAS and general recording is also clunky, because it takes two seconds for the first sounds to get recorded.

Worse still, the unit MAY NOT RECORD if the case is not closed in a certain way. It looks like it's recording, but then doesn't record. What is the point of a tape recorder if you can't trust it?I finally got sick of the thing and bought a Sony M-470. It was a few $ more but well worth it.

Her first novel of the Fifth Age, (Dawning of A New Age) was shallow in depth and thought. This novel is good, i found it hard to leave without picking it up again, and is definately a book that breathes some life into the Bridges of Time series, after the bland Spirit of the Wind novel by Chirs Pierson. Gair was such an admirable character, even after he became posessed, and i almost cried after the scene with Goldmoon & Camilla at his grave. A definate good read for DL fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and disjointed. Not worth the effort.","review":"Given Rabe's previous work on the Dragons of a New Age Trilogy, I was reluctant to pick up this book in the first place. I wish I'd resisted. For those who've endured the aforementioned novels, it should be noted that 'The Silver Stair' is definitely an improvement on her earlier work, but it's still dire. It's laden with inaccuracies that instantly spoil the sparse atmosphere that had been built up, notably Knights of Takhisis building a keep in 352AC (almost twenty years before they were founded), a sorcerer running about on a ship only a year or two following the Second Cataclysm and Goldmoon ascending the Stair without a hint of her fear of heights showing. Even putting all that aside, the story's bland and the plot drags. Only stubbornness made me read it through to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to the Dragonlance Series","review":"This is the only Dragonlance novel I've read so far(I've read 73) that I haven't liked. This book had a terrible plot and the characters were weak. Gair's change to the darkside was unrealisticly fast and did not show his struggle with it very well at all. I won't even go into all the mistakes Jean Rabe made about Dragonlance history. This book made Goldmoon, a character brilliantly protrayed by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, look bad. It's a shame that this book was allowed to be published and I hope that the 5th age books aren't as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"A very poorly written work and a disapointing read.

The elf goes from being an inheritantly good person to the most evil person in the world in one chapter for no apparent reason.

You gotta wonder why TSR lets her continue to write for the dragonlance series, I have not read a good book from her yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Dragonlance book.","review":"Despite a few flaws I found this book quite entertaining. Following Gair's story was a very interesting read, and if this is how the Age of Mortals trilogy is like I'm sure it's hardly as bad as some people say.

Unfortunately, in the screenwriter's apparent desire to put as many unexpected, even quirky, turns in the story as possible, he forgot that a story is supposed to be appealing. A few moments were. Most were either routine daytime soap-opera material or just boring.Also, the casting was incredible. It's as though someone tried to win the prize for who could cast the largest number of unappealing actors and actresses in a single movie. There were one or two exceptions, like Margaret Colin, but the other eight or ten--or however many there were--ranged from off-putting to repulsive.Apparently, a number of people liked this movie, so maybe you will too.

If Traders is on T.V., than save your money and just tape the episodes.

I would recommend this book to anyone with a family problem. It doesn't have to be enormous, mine wasn't a true estrangement, but small things can grow. Ms. LeBey lets you know that you aren't alone and she gives concrete do-able advice.

What I explored in this book was a bunch of one-sided mother of son sob stories that blamed the daughter-in-laws for family breakdowns. Unfortunately, there wasn't much exploration as to why these estragements were SONS and their mothers. Also unfortunate is that my mother-in-law read this book and now has ME to blame for the years of dysfunction and denial that have plagued her family. She now has a convenient excuse to ignore the alcoholism, manipulation, conditional love and lack of communication that she raised her son in. Honestly, if we, daughter-in-laws, were such \\"evil puppet masters\\" with enough control over our husbands to make them abandon their families, don't you think we would work on the dirty socks on the floor first?!!!

Great to learn this.But this will not help anybody who seriously wants to safe family relations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too one-sided","review":"In her book, LeBey discusses several types of family estrangement, but she tends to tell only one side of what are typically two-sided stories. Relationships between family members are complicated, and the problems that gave rise to the estrangement are often rooted in destructive conduct on the part of both parties to the dispute. I wonder what Ms. LeBey's estranged son (and his wife) think about Ms. LeBey's account of their estrangement and what their side of the story would reveal? If LeBey hopes for reconciliation with her son and daughter-in-law, did she consider that writing her book would probably damage the prospects for reconciliation with them? One can only assume that she did, yet she wrote the book anyway. How ironic."},{"rating":"1","title":"One side of the conflict","review":"Unfortunately, in almost every relationship covered, the author only addresses one side of the conflict. For this reason the book fails to accomplish it's goal and provide help to ALL those in the conflict. For example, the author relates the story of her estrangement with her son and her daughter-in-law. Many other reviewers have pointed out her obvious lack of attention to the other side of the story - her son's. However, the author also fails to mention her own relationships with her mothers'-in-law during the course of her own marriages. Silence as to these relationships surely leads one to suspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too good book","review":"this book is one sided and that's why I can not make use of it. was looking for severe advise to handle my mother-in-law. unfortunately Lebey only describes her point of view, that daughters-in-law1) have always the fault2) want to control sonsand that's why the family does not work.

My mother-in-law doesn't respect me as his wife or the mother of her grandchildren. I have always gone out of my way to do nice things for her because I think that family is so important and she raised my wonderful husband. I want my children to know their grandmother but I won't let her run over me. If I tell her that I don't want something done regarding my kids she will do whatever she wants. She will come in my house and move things around and correct me in front of my kids. Not all daughter-in-laws are bad, it can be the mother-in-law having problems excepting that their is a new women in her sons life. I wish I hadn't spent my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided Perspective","review":"The author discribes herself as a laywer, wife, mother, and grandmother, but, not a daughter-in-law. Her perspective is quite one-sided against the \\"alienating and threatened wife\\". Quote \\"It bears mentioning that the daughter in law's perspective is not included here since, in almost every instance, it is the family of the estranged son who suffer the alienation of their loved one. The daughter in law does not require skills in copeing because she usually has the option of mending the relationship at any time\\".As a d-i-l seeking to understand the actions of a m-i-l , I am dissapointed with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't cover a book by a judge","review":"The author is not a psychiatrist. She is not a family counselor. She is not a physician. She is - horror of horrors! - an attorney and \\"former judge.\\" She is also way in over her head with the subject matter, offering nothing more than: Estrangement is unpleasant, we should work to avoid or fix it. Having dispensed with this nugget of advice she spends the rest of the book treading water and repeating her mantra. My advice to the author: Stick to the bar and leave advice giving on how to carry out the heavy emotional lifting to the professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"overlooked gem","review":"This is a fantastic album I discovered this month. It's got a really dark mood about it like early Cure, but the singer sounds quite a bit like Michael Stipe. I've even heard a rumor that this was a Stipe project that was abandoned and released under a different name. The guitars are lush and echoey but aggressive, think Marty Wilson Piper meets Kim Thayall, and the drummer is fantastic, reminds me of the guy from Interpol. Definitely check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze Fest from TX","review":"Bands like this make me think that very few american bands can offer anything good anymore to the music world. I was told to look into this band. 3 songs in and i was about ready to choke the person who told me about this album.Why is it boring and a snooze fest? One, the guys vocals are irratating like a Michael Stipe coming off a 3 day meth bender.The lyrics are just tripe... i cant even put more effort into explaining why they are horrible, just listen to the samples.They dont have a distinctive or original sound... they sound like every other suburbanite band that wants to make music. Im sure some dippy girl at a club will eat this up and only cause the guy plays guitar and tries to brood over his half heart felt lyrics. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this like a person with a bad case of SARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date info.","review":"This book is a decent overall book coving many of the basic wedding expectations and traditions. However, the author puts her opinions in on what she thinks is good and bad about the changing trends in weddings. If you don't want that, you can find a better book. Also, I found that some of the information is quite out of date (by nearly ten years on most info)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a TV Pilot - what do you expect?","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said \\"We've found something special!\\" But we haven't. Very early on you can tell that it's made for TV and not only that but ripe for a series. Sure the good guy's HQ gets destroyed but as they said earlier, they operate in cells so no one knows. Tim Matheson is not known to have died. The death of Sabbath's boy is left open.The writing is only TV grade as is the acting. But if you look at this like it's a TV pilot then you won't be disappointed. BUT don't spend big money on it.

I thought they were decent, but what was really cool was their big heart for God and the passion they have for sharing his word with students all over. I know that if you like catchy, fun, music then you'll love this cd. (All Star United fans should check this cd out!) The CD begins with a very fun song that just makes me want to dance. I worked in the snack shop at a christian camp (L-bar-c camp to be exact) and whenever the first song on the cd would play everyone would be dancing like crazy in the snack shop, including me behind the counter! The Clint K band shows how being a Christian is a heck of a lot of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost treasure","review":"Argent Circus is an overlooked gem from the seventies. It is my favorite Argent album and finds them at a mature peak. The songs are cohesive from beginning to end and full of energy. The musicianship is topnotch and the concept of the album is realized. The feeling of being at a circus is captured in all its glory. The band fails to miss a beat throughout the whole album. Unfortunately, the album was overlooked in the seventies by bigger bands. This release gives those who missed out the first time a second chance and gives me the chance to fill in a gap in my cd collection. This release was long overdue and ranks as an all-time sleeper hit. I never tire of listening to Circus as I am a die-hard rock and roll fan. The seventies was my decade and I am glad to relive the seventies one more time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Argent part of the twofer","review":"The Argent album part of the twofer is an excellent continuation of the Zombies for keyboardist and main driving force, Rod Argent. The sound is basically the same and Rod Argent shares songwriting with guitarist Russ Ballard. These songs are incredibly well-crafted with great melodies. Liar (by guitarist Ballard, is the same song 3 Dog Night had a hit with and pretty much copied note for note), Like Honey, Schoolgirl, Be Free,and Dance in the Smoke could have all been singles. Great vocals and harmonies with a Zombies-type vibe make this worth the price of twofer alone.

And an additional 2 to Stillwater, in case no one knows what town she was approaching on her way home from work every night. Sorry, I lost my mind for a minute. Rose McGowan is Sonny, a radio shrink, who has to contend with a psychotic, nursery rhyme-spewing paperboy. Detective Briggs (Ray Wise) and his partner are particularly dense. Quite infuriating. A solid 8.5 on the Silly Meter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not among Salva's best.","review":"I wanted to like this movie, but it felt pointless. It had a few creepy moments, but in the end it just didn't make any sense. I won't give away the ending, but instead of being creeped out, I felt confused. The whole movie was full of characters who didn't matter, with moments that felt thrown in just because Salva didn't know what else to do. The movie has no focus whatsoever. I can't imagine Salva being overtly proud of this mess.The only thing I liked about the movie was the atmospheric neighborhood. I love that hill and the wonderful camera angles used to capture it. It reminds me of the neighborhood in which I grew up. That's about it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Rose - Thats the reason I watched it but...","review":"Very slow in parts - like a \\"Lifetime\\" scary movie. But worst thing is, I didn't get it? Who was the kid? Why was he going bad things? Was he mad cause they didn't tip him as the paperboy? Or was he the paperboy? I thought the ending would tell the viewer more of the story but it only told us what I guessed in the middle of the movie... So I walked away thinking - what did I just watch?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth watching. . . . . . . .","review":"I didn't like Rose McGowan as the main character - just didn't appear serious or old enough for the character.

In several scenes it even looks like she has trouble annunciating her words. Rose needs to chill out with the plastic procedures, she already looks like a junior cat-lady. It literally looks like she was punched in the mouth & the upper lip seems to be immobilized (botox), it never moves! The story itself might have been good, but I couldn't take looking at her face for more than a half hour, so I played Internet Scrabble while this movie was on in the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second worst movie ever!","review":"Just bad...very bad on all counts!

You realy should upgrade to a larger memory card if you want to take hi-res photos.The main reason I wrote this review is to point out that even though the tech specs say this camera is not compatable with Mac OSX, it in fact is. iPhoto has no problem recognizing the camera, neither does the image capture utility.

It is easy to use and the pictures are so clear and beautiful. It also takes fun movie clips! This is a perfect camera for the beginner.

It is the most functional point-and-shoot camera (aside from the quality of pictures). It is very easy to use even with all the bells and whistles. It works basically like a high quality 35mm camera except that the quality in the pictures is astounding. It also has the ability to produce 30 to 180 second mpeg's. This is a nice feature especially to attach them to e-mail's.Maybe the nicest aspect of the camera is the software package included. The installation was a breeze and the programs ran perfectly without any glitches. It was probably 20 minutes from the time I opened the box to when I was downloading my first pictures.The only downside to this camera might be it's size. As small as it is I am afraid I will drop it and break it. Other than that, this camera is fantastic and definitely a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera, needs a couple of extras","review":"I got this camera about seven months ago, and I've been very pleased with it. However, there are a couple of extras that are important to have in order to make it usable:1 - The included memory card is a bad joke. Plan on buying at least a 128, more likely a 256. You'll need it. (I bought a 128 at the same time that I got the camera, and I've found that it's not enough. The 256 that I picked up a few months later seems about right.)2 - BUY AN EXTRA BATTERY, and carry it with you. My single complaint with this camera is the expensive proprietary battery. Expensive as it is, though, an extra battery is indispensable if you're going to use the camera much.3 - Particularly for low-light shots and no-flash shots, get a tripod. (That's going to be my next purchase.) My hands are good and steady, but not steady enough for this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too funny","review":"I've been a big fan of Joe's since I first peeped his website, \\"Mentally Incontinent,\\" from a link from Fark.

This book is not even worth the 80 cents. The profane language used in this book is terrible. There was nothing funny at all. Anyone who thinks it's funny to show porn on televisions at Walmart where it can be seen by children is a sick, warped, individual. As the mother of a special needs child I was completely appalled at the authors insensitive and derogatory use of language like \\"retard\\" and \\"having a third chromosome\\". This book is nothing but garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books on the subject","review":"This is easily the best book on Jack the Ripper I have read yet. Rumbelow adds a lot of background to the case study, including an early chapter on just how horrible the London slums were in Victorian times (far worse than anything out of Dickens). He also covers what the press and the police departments were doing as the case unfolded, which form interesting subplots of their own. The last half of the book is not quite as good as it wanders over a slew of suspects, a handful of later serial killers, and comments on a few media versions of the case. Still Rumbleow is thorough and objective and easily proves to be one of the leading Ripperologists working today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was ready to purchase the video until I found out it was just highlights.I agree with one reviewer who wrote...

It only makes me wish that they had placed Burmese tiger traps, anti-personnel mines and cobras on that island.If you have no life and watching the filmed exploits of a bunch of attention-starved, back-stabbing, bumbling nitwits is your idea of a good time, then this tape is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful Record of a TRUE American Phenomenon","review":"For those of us who have seen some or all of Survivor, this DVD allows us to relive what was a truly unique, unexpected phenomenon. And though this DVD may not bear limitless repeat viewings, it is something I certainly enjoyed viewing in its entirety, and will perhaps again in the years ahead.However, for those who have NOT seen Survivor, what an opportunity this is to witness the series for the very first time! The drama builds quite nicely without commercial interruption, and rather than waiting seven days between each episode, you can go at your own pace.The extras are nice, though I wish they had added still more unused footage. Given the unbelievable amounts of footage CBS recorded, it seems like they could have given us a bit more.The Survivor Season One DVD has won a permanent spot in my collection. This critic has spoken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer highlight DVD. But, YES the gay man won!","review":"Bummer! This is only a 2-hour-15 minutes DVD of highlights from the first Survivor.

Having not seen all of the episodes of Survivor. I was hoping for a complete, unedited, uncensored version, with all episodes Collector's DVD set. I guess it is not possible. One special feature is the \\"Survivor: Inside the Phenomenon\\", a 20-minute documentary, which I found to be quite interesting, especially how fair the game is, the exhausting hard work Producer, Mark Burnett and the Art Department can do, and how they managed to surprise the Challenge Survivor Winner, Sean, with a surprise visit from his father on the yacht at such short notice. How they got his father there at such short notice is remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE letdown.","review":"I am a big Survivor fan. (Yes, I've been sucked in by the hype.)

I'm happy that I checked this out from the library, so that I can return it and not have it collect dust on MY shelves. The only reason why I'm even writing a review is that I'm so shocked about all the positive comments this book has received thus far. I looked on Amazon to see if my thoughts were shared by others; I'm surprised that they are not.

The narrative is extremely interesting, detailing Mr. Garrison's experiences in training and then into combat in the ETO. Interestingly, Mr. Garrison was sent to France in December 1944, just in time to participate in the Battle of the Bulge (what luck!). I found his story interesting because of the breadth of missions he was engaged in and the fact that it wasn't all about combat. There are some unforgettable scenes here and you really get a sense of what combat was like for a US machine gunner advancing toward Berlin.

The pan grippers are useless if you make anything like a real deep-dish or stuffed pizza (My wife and I prefer stuffed). It should be noted that I fill that pan with two crusts and a LOT of toppings, sauce, and cheese. When all is said and done, the middle of the pie will top the edges, so it's a very heavy pizza. This gripper just can't handle it. It's made of stamped metal, not forged, and will bend and give and your pie winds up on the floor.

Locking the supports into place and figuring out how to put the pieces in it when it is stored flat were a bit of a challenge to her at first, and she has fairly good fine motor skills. But with some occasional help she can now get it most of the time and she loves being able to put it up and down.

Although by this point he was mesmerized by bop and the new sounds coming out of America, his fans and comrades had come to consider him part of the old school of Euro jazz. Django probably decided he would have to inch his way over to the new sounds and seems to do so on many of these recordings. His electric guitar playing can be thrilling and unusual - he was already experimenting a tiny bit with distortion and harmonics - and you can hear him trying to pull the other musicians into the great beyond with him. This collection nicely wraps up the studio work from some of his final sessions and is nicely mastered and annotated. Not exactly on par with the gold standard JSP series of Django's work, but still very worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book - but reading is hard to bear","review":"Like most previous reviewers, I loved this book. I did want to mention that the audio version, narrated by the author, is problematic. On the positive front, the author pronounces Yiddish correctly! The problem is in how he pronounces English. He has a very odd way of speaking, with the last word of each sentence articulated very slowly (str-e-e-e-etched out) and about three notes lower than every other word in the sentence. Every sentence ends with a melodic downturn. I found it quite maddening and really had trouble enjoying the book because of it. You may want to be careful if you plan to buy the audio book because his diction is really rather odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 18 months; no picture but sound","review":"YET ANOTHER DEAD PANEL.Purchased for $650 on 12/27/07 and the screen died 18 months later.

I did lots of research on brands and prices and decided that the Toshiba REGZA 32\\" was the best for my needs. Not only is it attractive but the picture and sound are amazing. The reviews here also helped. I don't think one can go wrong ordering this model. Also, the Toshiba Web site is very helpful for information on this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I purchased this TV on December 1, 2007 and it has malfunctioned 5 times since then, including 15 minutes before I sat down to write this review. The first time was December 5th and the problem is the same: The screen suddenly goes black but I still have sound. At first Toshiba tried to blame the cable box but I don't believe it. Toshiba's customer service tells me to unplug the TV for 5 minutes and see what happens. It has helped, but ultimately the problem repeats itself. This TV has lots of pluses, such as the audio and the picture quality, but I'm starting to regret not shelling out the extra $150 - $200 for a Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead After Two Years","review":"I too thought this was a good TV, paying well over $800.00 for it about two years ago. Much like others who have reviewed this product the picture suddenly went black on my set although the sound and other commands still worked.To make a long story short I am very dissapointed with Toshiba and the costly suggestions on fixing this model so I went out and bought an LG which I love.For now the Toshiba is serving as a very fashionable 32 inch \\"radio\\". Just a word of caution to those that might be considering this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave good service but picture gave out after 2 years","review":"This TV gave good service for two years during which we had no problem with it. But, after 2 years, the backlight for the LCD gave out. Now, when the TV is turned on, the picture appears very briefly and then fades to black. One can still hear the sound, however. For a $750 TV, I expected a lot more than 2 years of service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another unfortunate customer","review":"Bought the Toshiba Regza 32\\" HDTV in January of '08 and it worked just fine until yesterday when it suddenly lost its picture. Audio works fine and I can change channels, but no picture, just a blank screen. After reading the reviews here I guess I have joined the ranks of the poor souls who paid alot of money for a TV only to have it last less than 2 years. I liked this TV until yesterday. Toshiba can kiss my you know what......I'll never buy one of their products again. Unfortunately I have another Toshiba flat screen in the bedroom.....guess I'll wait and see how long it lasts. I'm buying a new TV tonight and I'll see what can be done with the Toshiba.....maybe I'll take it back to the store and leave it in front of their door. They can use it for a door stop.

It has offered sharp picture, great sound, and truly was a great bargain. This was until about a month ago, when the TV lost picture out of the blue.

By far the best bang for your buck","review":"I had researched for months and months looking at budget HDTVs in the 32\\" size and finally bought the 32HL67U when Amazon put it on sale for $684. I wanted to make sure whatever I bought had the Clear QAM tuner (for picking up free HD channels over basic cable). I was debating between a Westinghouse and a Vizio really as those were in my price range. I had seen the Toshiba REGZA before but it was out of my price range (it was like $899 or $999 depending upon where you looked). It's picture is AMAZING! The viewing angle is also the best I've seen. It's really amazing how clear and bright the picture is even from extreme angles. I've had the tv for a few weeks now and really couldn't be happier. I would highly recommend this tv!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good TV","review":"The TV is great and it was easy to install. I just wish that the base swiveled. It's pretty light so it's not a big deal.

I paid to send it back the first two times, about $15 each time. When I called the third time and asked to speak to someone beyond the people who answer the phone, I was scolded by the person I was talking to because I balked at calling a toll number. I was told that Canon could not give toll free numbers to everybody. I eventually talked to someone who told me to send it in again. Only, after I balked at paying shipping again did he offer to send me prepaid packaging. Guess I should have balked the first time. So far the third \\"fix\\" has worked for over a year.Very nice little camera. The service is very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Eye is a Problem","review":"This was an OK camera but red-eye was a problem from Day 1. Also had trouble taking good night pictures.

The picture I took with it looked good, portrait, landscape. I started shooting for pictures I need to put on my website, ie, up-close, 18inches. I was so disappointed because I was not able to get a clear and true picture. The white background came out golden brown and the item I was trying to get a picture off was fuzzy and did not show the true color. I tried all the settings (including Macro) available but still cannot get a true picture. I suggest to all the people who bought this camera to try and take a picture of a nice piece of necklace with a white background. I am curious how this would come out. Please let me know. For me, I am returning this camera and getting an Olympus Camedia C-4000. I think Olympus has better digital technology than Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"I have two digital cameras now, and have researched this area extensively. This camera has some great options: Compact Flash memory cards, great zoom power, movie mode, overrides on everything, a panoramic stich mode, it feels high quality (some of the cameras I checked out locally felt cheap). This camera is so packed with features, it also takes excellent automatic photos too. We're very happy with our purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"E18 error","review":"This was my first introduction to digital photography. Wouldn't you know, just out of the warranty period, the camera stops working. I test the battery just before my daughter's soccer game, then hop in the car. Get to the game and....the thing won't work. The lens will not come out. I now own a piece of junk. I think the retractable lens adds needless complexity to the camera. I will look for something simpler mechanically in the future. Maybe it's back to film cameras for me. I'm tired of 60 dollar ink cartridges anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best digital camera ever!","review":"I got this camera for my birthday, and it is the best camera I've ever used. The quality of the pictures is great, and with a 128 memory card you can take up to 140 pictures. It has a movie option too which is so much fun to use. My friends and family love seeing the videos of them, and I send out digital photo albums all the time to everyone. I would highly recommend this camera to beginners or experienced photographers. People that have tried my camera are now ditching their older models to upgrade to this one. It's light, compact, and incredibly easy to learn to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best 3.2 MP camera","review":"The best 3.2 MP camera you can get for that price, can be used as point and shot, but this is not what it made for.Endless features are packed into this relatively small body, very high built quality, feels like a little brick, image quality is a full 10, I did print 8x11 images that are very hard to distinguish from film.If you have no patience to read it's 144-page manual, don't bother, you are wasting your money, I got amazing results once I was able to master it, took me about one month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mid-range camera.","review":"This is a fantastic camera. It will take a while to learn the myriad of features, but it's worth it. Get the 128Mb (or more) compact flash card. You'll thank yourself later.

It has a horrible redeye problem even with the redeye flash turned on. Now it has stopped working altogether. It has developed the dreaded E18 error which means the lens will not come out when you open the camera. This has happened to a huge amount of these cameras; just search the web for the S30 and E18 code and you will see. Buy a different camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prone to failure after the warrentee expires.","review":"I agree with the reviews by Simplicissimus & \\"curious\\", it was a great camera until it died. Mine had a critical failure just over one month past the warrentee running out. I paid $150 to have it \\"repaired.\\" What I got back was a refurb with a different serial number. That lasted less than a year and half before it died. Given the price when I bought it, this camera has already cost me close to $800. The repair price that Canon charges will buy a new camera of the same functionality, with full warrentee. They offer an \\"upgrade\\" to a newer model, for $220, but that is a refurb with only a six month warrentee. I would prefer that Canon built a quality product that would last at least two years. I would settle for them at least standing behind their products when they die under normal use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me A Break","review":"I have had this camera for over a year now. The camera is great until now. I simply plugged the camera into the USB port in order to download my pictures and all the sudden my LCD DISPLAY turned White.

I talked to Canon and the only option they left me was to ship it in and get it repaired...for $200.00 What a joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Canon PowerShot s30","review":"The Canon S30 is overrated. I find that the shutter speed is really inadequate and I have missed some terrific moments because the performance isn't up to snuff. In general, I find the whole lens operation slow.I find that the slider button--for zoom/slideshow operation is actually quite difficult to use. And I have small fingers, to boot. I bought the camera in 2002 and the LCD is pretty scratched up, even though I keep it in a cushioned bag all the time. I have never dropped it or anything like that. Really not good for wear and tear.I am very disappointed with this camera, having heard such great things about it before I bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent digital camera","review":"I have been using this camera for 5 months now and have been very pleased with it. The controls are intuitive and easy to use-my only complaint is that sometimes the master control/cursor button at the top of the camera is difficult to control. Picture quality is excellent and there is good creative control with the exposure compensation and manual focus. The included software works well withmac and windows. The photo altering program that comes with it doesn't have many features, but at least alters exposure and removes redeye. I wish the camera used AA batteries like my father in laws Sony.-you definitely need an extra battery with this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"all metal case! yea!","review":"I was going to buy the s110 but it was all sold out!

It was under warrantee, but it took about 4 phone calls to find out where to send it for repair. When I sent it out, it disappeared for about 2 months, after which I got a letter saying that they wouldn't repair it because I'd damaged it. After hours on the phone trying to talk to someone, I was finally told, basically, that they couldn't find the problem but, they assumed it must be my fault. After another hour on the phone to Canon headquarters, they agreed that they had made a mistake and said that they would repair it. But, they seem to have lost track because yesterday the camera came back in a box unrepaired with no explanation. I've owned Canons for years, but I would never buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"This is a very sturdy little camera, the mid-level entry in Canon's \\"S\\" line. It features great optics and a decent optical & digital zoom combination, as well as awesome 3 megapixel resolution (enlargements of 11\\" x 14\\" are no problem). If you had to buy one digital camera for all your needs, chances are you'd find the S30 a satisfying choice. It does require a 2nd battery and a larger memory card to be ready to go, but aside from that, it's nearly perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy a Canon camera.","review":"If you really are going to buy one .. try this search on Google first \\"Canon e18\\".

Mine got the error a few days ago.Canon has evidence of hundreds of such errors but provides no information on their website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny camera -- just a little short of being aim and shoot...","review":"I was looking for a small but sturdy camera that gave me high quality pictures. On this, the camera does not dissappoint!The one issue that I noticed early on....too many controls to be a out-of-the-box aim-and-shoot camera. I think a few times with the manual is absolutely necessary. The Kodak DC4800 that I owned before was truly an aim-and-shoot camera that I hardly needed the manual for.The indoor picture quality is excellent. The colors are little bit more true on this camera than my dc4800. I have only used the auto setting so far and every picture has been of very good quality.This is a camera for high quality pictures on automatic, indoor setting for a person who does not mind refering to the manual a few times before getting comfortable with the camera. (Most digital cameras do well in the outdoor shots....so, I was looking at this camera for the indoor shots specifically)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"I have owned the S30 for three months and find it easy to use, very good picture quality, sturdy feel, good battery life. Invest in the 128 meg card...you will take lots of pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT UNTIL IT DIED","review":"For the first 15 months of ownership, I was sure I made the right choice for my first digital camera . Many great pictures, especially available-light stuff, lots of flexibility, rock solid (OK, hefty) feel. Then one day I turned it on to review pictures taken at a wedding the weekend before and nothing happened. No error message, no reaction to replacement with a fresh-charged battery, stone dead. I returned it to Canon Service even though it was a few months off-warranty. They repaired it and returned it very quickly, about two weeks turnaround. I would have called it perfect service except there was no explanation as to what the problem was, what they did to remedy it, and the fact that my MINT S30 was returned with two almost identical, obvious new scratches on top and bottom (clamshell vise?) Now I feel like it is a ticking time bomb that could die again at any time and have migrated back to film and my more dependable 1970s-vintage Rollei 35S."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Camera w/ Dead Pixels!!!","review":"Well this has been an excellent digital camera. I have taken lots of baby photoes with it and the quality is great EXCEPT for one or more dead pixels!I have sent it in for a warrantly repair. But it hasn't been repaired properly. Now the dead pixel is at a different location.To see if your camera is affected, view the downloaded image at 100% on your PC. Scan the image closely and look for a \\"bright\\" pixel.It would have been a 5 stars if not for the HORRIBLE quality control of the CCD."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more film","review":"This is a great camera. It has an array of easy to use features that make set up for various situations very easy.It has a tremendous light range, from bright daylight to dark interiors using default settings.With 3MP images, I'd recommend at least 256MB of flash memory.If you take a lot of pictures a second battery would be worthwhile. Taking 100 shots in a day was well beyond the limits of a single battery.The biggest problem is the delay between pushing the button and the actual shutter snap. On moving objects you have to go to the sports mode(with lesser quality) or it will get away.That said, I see no need to ever use a film camera again."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than happy","review":"I've shot hundred of pictures in the rain, at the beach and have never had any issue other than the sometimes slow first shot issue, mentioned else where.It has been drop off the kitchen counter and lived on with a small dent.I'd gladly buy a newer model if I needed to, but 3.2 megs I have found to be more than good enough for family shots. In comparing this to my other camera from a computer vendor I'd have to say stick to camera vendors models, they feel and work like cameras, right down to the little mirror/shutter sound that lets other people taking your vacation pictures know that they have in fact taken a picture.I do think the lcd too small at times to determine some options, like the flash mode (red eye). Perhaps newer SLR digitals will get in viewer features, for when you saving power by not running the lcd display."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish DVDs were availible","review":"This first series is a very good magical girls show that does not take itself too seriously at alot of points. I think it's one of the best I've seen in the genre but viewers should note that this spurned a sequel plus six spin-off series(seven if you count the sequel to \\"Yes! Pretty Cure 5\\") that are not available in the USA. Also this version is not perfect as it has issues with the subtitle timing although it is watchable and you can usually tell what's going on.

The sharp blade can be easily opened with one hand and, with little effort, be closed with one hand as well. I am pleased with my purchase and carry it full time.However, it must be said that as a bottle opener it should be used only in the case of dire emergency. Getting the cap off a bottle, in my experience, requires several attempts. The Metro just can not get a full grip on the cap and tends to slip off endangering one's fingers. Opening can not be done in one motion. It will get the top off, but it is not efficient.So, if you want a handy, uniquely shaped knife this is a good buy. If you intend to sit on the beach and open bottles of your favorite beverage, you had best look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big for what it is","review":"It's a great little design for this knife, but it's just too big. It's almost two inches wide (to fit the bottle opener) and 2.5 inches long. The blade is barely an inch (not a complaint--that's what I wanted).This is a knife meant for someone who wants just a short blade, who doesn't want to be the kind of person who carries a pocket knife. But the design does't work. The cool factor doesn't make up for the bulk and weight.It is well made. This is clearly a Buck, but that's not enough here. I gave mine away and bought the Buck 325 Colleague."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book!!!","review":"I thought this was a good and entertaining book to read. Basically it explains some of life's little mysteries.e.g.Why the other lanes always seem to move faster than you.Because, as the cars slow down, they get closer to each other, therefore changing the distance between them and the \\"density\\" of that lane. Thus, you see the cars moving forward because they're really getting closer, instead of getting ahead.Is this a life-changing book and will give you a new perspective on everything?

Jane Wyman's performance is one not to be missed. Other reviewers on this forum have noted her expressive face, body language, growth; the ground-breaking subject matter (sexual assault and dignity in the face of bigotry); and the outstanding supporting cast. All come together to create a timeless story, told in an amazing performance.The ONE possible flaw may be with the \\"Perry Mason-style\\" theatrics in the courtroom. However, it's so minor as (and so VERY 40's!) that it detracts nothing from this outstanding film."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgetable love story.","review":"I'm a lover of classic film.

Of course, none of this goes unnoticed by the small town residents that surround them. The story is engrossing and moving, but really the film is worth watching for Wyman's wordless performance alone--she's really one of the best. Don't know how I avoided seeing her all these years but I sure plan on checking out any of her movies I can get ahold of.

I read this for a book club and everyone in the club agreed that the main character is next to impossible to like or feel any connection with. By the end of the book we all could have cared less about what happened to any of the characters and were very disappointed about the waste of our time! I would rather read a trashy romance novel (and I hate those!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome To The Pity Party","review":"It is obvious that Ms. Dew has great writing talent but the characters in this book are so distasteful that it was difficult for me to read.The main character, Dinah, is completely self-obsessed and lives her life waiting for the other characters to apologize to her for inconsequential things that happened during her youth.I wanted to shake Dinah and tell her to move on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential family novel","review":"This is one of the best novels ever to treat marriage, child rearing, dealing with eccentric aging parents, and a whole range of other intra- and inter-generational threads, with humane and literate humor. Worth reading just for the poignant description of a child's illness, all the mistakes that can be made, all the resilience a family can somehow locate. But Robb Forman Dew is also brilliant when it comes to exploring the effects of marital separation, family feuds, adolescent memories as they remain in high-relief in the psyche, the fragile wonder of adult friendships. Whenever I re-read this fine novel, I'm confident of receiving some new take on hopefulness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and absorbing","review":"Although the subject of Dew's novel is well-trodden territory-- a husband and wife, temporarily separated, re-evaluate their marriage and their conceptions of each other-- Dew's writing is excellent.

I like the 2-deck format (one for quick responses, one for longer, more thoughtful responses). Can create an atmosphere of non-judgemental values exchange...depending on the parent and the kid(s). Very portable. The reason i didn't offer a 5-star is about 20% of the cards have the phrase \\"Ask one player a question\\" which is annoying because the reason i bought the cards was to have a \\"list\\" of questions for my teen that are NOT my questions.

I re-read several of his novels many many times (I did re-read \\"Invisible life\\" like 8 times), but I can't say i will with his last novel. Harris is now concerned about boring subjects. What made him special and different isn't there anymore. He's been tagged as a brilliant storyteller, but in this book there's no emotion at all, just a common story. No special moments, no wonderful descriptions, no heart-felt characters. Everything is too standard, I wonder where he's been all these last months. And i hope he'll be get back to his tracks. This is no evolution, i'm, so sad to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody's Perfect","review":"E. Lynn gives us a predictable piece of fluff that tells the tale of Heisman trophy hopeful, Brady Bledsoe, and his saintly mother, Carmyn. The perfect relationship between mother and son becomes strained when schemer, Barrett Browning, enters the picture and you can easily see how this story will end.First, the character names - is Brady Bledsoe supposed to be an amalgam of Tom Brady and Drew Bledsoe? Barrett Elizabeth Browning - clearly a spin of the famous poetess Elizabeth Barrett Browning. I mean, really?Second, the story is mostly dialogue, which makes it easy to read, but shows a lack of substance.There is nothing remotely interesting about this story and certainly not worth a purchase. It just seems that instead of building on what made his earlier works so successful and noteworthy, the author has slipped into the trap of publishing something just to stay in the game. Get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"somethin' different......","review":"E. Lynn Harris informed his fans that this book was something different from what he usually wrote. He was right! Somethimes, different is good and he proved this point. I didnt think I would enjoy the book, but I did.

The story introduces the reader to new characters, and still manages to expertly slip in one of our old favorites from his previous books. Like the rest of his novels, it's hard to put it down once you start to read. The story moves quickly and gives you enough development for each character that you start to wonder, \\"What next?\\" I really enjoyed this novel because he could easily continue the story in his next book, or let the story end.

Lynn Harris (RIP) and I wanted very much to fall in love with it, but just couldn't get into it. The only reason that I finished this book was because I really wanted to find out what happened in the end. The plot would have been wonderful if half of the side stories were eliminated. E. Lynn Harris used very childish language in this book such as on p. 181 when he writes \\"I slipped my Yolanda Adams CD into the Bose CD player,\\" was it necessary to explain what type of CD player that it was? Sadly a lot language in the book was framed like this, making it difficult at times to sift through it. I really did enjoy the last 1/3 of the book.

WAAAYYY to wrapped up in each other's lives to be healthy. Mothers like that raise sons who are incapable of having relationships with anyone else without having Mommy call the shots.

Why is he playing with Luke? It really was great how Hooper went back and forth from the different perspectives of the characters. The subtle romance between Sam and Luke is there all along which adds another dimension to the book.

He is part of a psychic FBI unit know as Bishop/Special Crimes Unit.In Hunting Fear he comes across a serial kidnapper that gets the ransom and then kills the victim anyway. The killer seems to have heard of Lucas Jordan and in a way challenges him to a twisted game in which he kidnaps people and has Jordan try to get to them before he kills them.This book is excellently written with an intriguing storyline and some great suspense, highly reccomended.

Nothing bugs me more than sloppy writing and this book has it in spades. Hooper jumps from character to character with little transition. You are unable to grab hold of the story because it never sits still long enough for you the reader to enjoy it. This is totally a comic book novel. I felt like I was watching an x-men movie instead of reading a book. I even started to find myself envisioning characters in the story upon the appearances of characters like the old star trek guy and wolverine. I couldn't stop thinking of them that way.Their is no real redeeming quality to this book. I made the mistake perhaps of making this my first Hooper story.

The director must judge the character and motivation of those volunteering to be interviewed.An adept film maker can cull out or skillfully develop the testimony of those who are simply \\"acting out\\".The sole motivation of some volunteer subjects is nothing more than a subtle but seditious effort to \\"cleanse their soul\\" in public.

I didn't rate it 5 stars because it makes the great-leap to advanced-beginner quicker than I think it should. This is a Beginner's course, it should stay more beinner than moving onto the advanced lessons. I would have preferred a few more songs to practice on.Some of the music I have never heard of.

The people, who differ from the mainland English due to their former French identity, are made to live with their occupants in 'harmony'. This is something that some characters find easy to do while others struggle at it. Some, however, do it for convenience and to raise their social standing. The novel questions the moral decisions these characters make in a world which is distorted and unreal, making the entire question of morality warped as the island is camptured in a time when nothing feels real. What the would have decided at peacetime is not something they will opt for in times of trouble. Binding's novel is illuminating in exploring the human condition, and the prioritisation of values which bring out the true nature of a human being in crisis. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"The situation that the Guernsey islanders found themselves during WW II is presented. The murder of a girl who had collaborated with the occupiers seems interesting until the murderer and motive are revealed, and then that ALL falls flat. The solution was very unsatisfying as was the aftermath. I felt that much of the writing was disjointed. The author seems intent on giving personalities and backgrounds for characters that go on interminably for pages and with few periods or paragraphs, often with little reason for the hundreds of minifacts related. I read the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society which piqued my interest in the Channel Islands during that time. Loved that book. The book seems to have 2 titles: Lying with the Enemy and Island Madness. Can't imagine why. Lying with the Enemy seems the best to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the Mission, please.","review":"Waiting for another album where Don can shine, and that's with Innocence Mission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Map","review":"I went to Venice for the first time in May 2007 and found this map indispensable.

The book has an interesting history since Byrne left the title after issue 8, then returned more than a year later and pretended the intervening issues never happened.But that's another story... in this book you get 8 light and funny issues. She-Hulk confronts a variety of minor villains, makes jokes, breaks the 4th wall and generally has fun being a comic book character.Some of the sight gags are quite good and the meta-gags are clever.This isn't a classic, but it's fun and worth a read.

While Vlad Dracula is certainly a famous, or infamous, historical figure, not a lot has been written about his world. Augustyn does a very good job of introducing the average history buff, such as myself, to the region and time. Augustyn is clearly a revisionist. By placing Dracula in historical context, he demonstrates that his subject's bad reputation is at least partially unfair. One can understand how Dracula is still considered a national hero in Romania. The bottom line of what makes this book work is that it tells an interesting story. It reads like a fictional thriller. I do not understand why the book has not received more main stream attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good parts, an overall disaster","review":"This movie has a number of little gems - the soundtrack, typecast-bending casting of Dustin Diamond, Danica McKellar, Maureen McCormick, Alley Mills, and Michelle Phillips, and great performances from Colin Mochrie and Wil Wheaton. It's fun to watch the references to television shows that pop up in titles, credits and dialogue.So why is it so awful?I mean really, really, unwatchable.Part of it may be due to the fact that Kim Little (the eponymous Jane White) is not funny. At all. And the writing is painfully bad. It should be played, as Wil Wheaton and Colin Mochrie do, with a full knowledge that it is bad, but so pop-culture referential that it should not matter. But when most of the film concentrates on the main character and she is just so dreadful, well...it's just awful.If you're a fan of Wil Wheaton or Colin Mochrie, rent it.

The acting is wooden and an embarrassment to Filipinos. None of the characters are fleshed out to a point where the audience cares. The most cringe inducing scene is when Christopher de Leon makes everyone say: \\"I'm mad as hell and I can't take it anymore.\\" The dialogue and story ramble with no particular place to go.This movie (and like most Filipino movies) are throwbacks to the way Filipino movies were made during the 1970's. Unlike other countries of the Southeast Asian community, the Filipino movie making industry has stagnated and refused to move forward. In all movie making disciplines (direction, cinematography, art direction, lighting)...all amateurish.Finally, as a Filipino-American, this in no way reflects my life and the lives of any one I know.

Now, to me, that sounds like a very, very emotional movie. I couldn't get passed the horrible acting, I mean, maybe it would have been more intense if the whole movie was Tagalog.The plot really falls short. It's out of focus and doesn't leave for any character development except for Tere's character. Also, to just add in political and religious dialogue so randomly abrupt doesn't even give any of the issues substance at all. This movie had so much more potential to really push the limits of filipino upbringing in the US, American assimiliation, and the portrayal of deep internal conflicts to balance these two cultures.Unlike the people in the movie, I thought the adobo was really overated."},{"rating":"1","title":"* out ***** and that a 1 out of 5.","review":"Aristottle Marson from San Francisco, I don't understand why Mr. Dorsey had anything to do with your movie review.

This is the first CD I've given a 5-star rating and it really deserves a 6!!!This is the greatest piece of musical mayhem that has been released in the past 3 years. Metallica should all be locked up in a room and forced to listen to this CD, 24 hours straight for an entire year and then released and told they have one more chance to get it right before being castrated and forced to lip-synch with Ashley Simpson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw em","review":"I saw these guy's in concert with Megadeth.

(Sorry Steve, I'm sure you're a nice guy and all, but some things just weren't meant to be)Lucky for me that Slayer, Deicide, Opeth, Cannibal Corpse, Napalm Death, and Morbid Angel are still here to keep the metal scene from sucking so much ass."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW ABOUT ...

Sadly the style is so overdone 10 years ago that I have trouble giving that fifth star. To Steve in Costa Mesa, Im sorry but I like Souza. Sorry not everybody dislikes him. Also, its not that Exodus has lost the ability to create a cool sounding song. Its that the sound is so overdone that its predictable. The first time I heard Fabulous Disaster it was the greatest thing ever, I dont get that feeling I miss so much with Tempo of the Damned because the sound has become expected. Steve in Costa Mesa shouldnt be so critical of Tempo of the Damned, spend your time critisizing crap like the new album from Metallica or atrocious music acts like Linkin Park and Evanescense. Now thats horrible music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The return of an icon","review":"As I said before, Exodus is one of the most underrated thrash bands of all time. Even though Metallica is hailed as the inventor of thrash, Exodus isn't far from it. They were around even before Slayer. Nonetheless, due to record label problems and such, the band got a late start.At any rate, I feel like this album should've been the follow-up to 'bonded by blood'. Many of the songs on the album like, War is my Shepard, Shroud of Urine, Culling the Herd, Sealed with a fist, and Tempo of the damned, employ many Baloff-like vocals. The riffs are insane, and tend to sound like a mix of, 'Bonded by Blood', Pleasures of the flesh, Fabulous Disaster, and Force of habit. This is a great comeback for a great band. And with the ensuing release of 'Shovel-headed Kill Machine', the band can only solidify its place in the echelon of thrash metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good new disc from Exodus","review":"I was pretty shocked to hear this number of good new tracks from these guys. Flips off all the nu-metal garbage we've had to endure for what, a decade? Starting this album with Scar Spangled Banner is, in my book, as good as kicking off Reign in Blood with Angel of Death (metal blasphemy!). NO it's not that consistently good across the album, but there are several outstanding tracks that I listen to over and over and over.If you ever liked Exodus, I predict you are going to like this one. A lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exodus - This is a Head Kicker","review":"In the first new full-length studio recording in years, Exodus sounds better than ever. With Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt STILL on guitars after all these years, the coherency and metal riffery that distinguishes Exodus from the rest of the Metal world remains true and strong. (...)Exodus' punches you in the stomach all the while keeping you focussed on the metal guitar mastery of Holt and Hunolt. With punishing lyrics in both \\"War is My Shepherd\\" and \\"Culling the Herd\\", Gary Holt, who writes 90% of Exodus' lyrics, has blessed Metal fans everywhere with the re-birth of what is to be expected from Exodus: In your face, jaw dropping metal mastery, precise and as heavy as ever. \\"Tempo of the Damned\\" is a must buy. I would rate this CD at the top of the Exodus \\"Best Ever\\" recordings, right alongside their debut CD, \\"Bonded By Blood\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun language book, very useful!","review":"I love this book.

There is way too much English explanations, when they could have used the space for more communicative conversations and introduction to real language.

I got it from a friend who didn't finish it, and now I know why. I read about half, skimmed the rest, stopped and read when I saw somebody was getting peed on, decided I could have lived the rest of my life quite nicely NOT having read that, and then fast forwarded to the end. I'm sure I missed a lot of plot by not reading the last half, but at least my soul didn't suffer. The writing is slow, plodding, methodical, and doesn't sound or feel like the voice of a troubled adolescent, full of rage, or even ambivalence. The sex is vulgar and coarse, but when it gets to the actual sexual material, there's no processing of feelings or sensations; perhaps that is the only part that seems like it could come from a teenage boy. I've read a lot of repulsive or vulgar material that was fascinating, like, \\"Ecstasy\\" and \\"Fox Girl.\\" This book simply didn't interest me on any level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but equally good","review":"The pleasure of reading this book comes from the fact that is different from the film with the same title. It is very disturbing, sometimes funny,and it's okay to read it, it's just a really good book. The film's script was also written by Stuart so it's a good thing to compare these two original version. To me, the book is about betrayal, madness and decadence while the film focuses straight on the effects of incest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the mark on a very important subject!","review":"I feel the author missed his chance to explore the subject of incest from the child's perspective.While casting most of the blame on the child; it never explains the WHY. I feel the novel was exploitive and needn't have been; since the subject itself always is. There was a lack of clarity in regard to the child's motivation in manipulating the people closest to her in such a perverse way. The book left alot of unanswered questions and I had an overall feeling of sadness after reading it.

It is a shame when a film (Iron Man) whose success was uncertain and which was a gamble, but which turned out to be very profitable can be a curse. Everyone involved wants to repeat the success, especially the financial return, but at what cost?I will always be glad we got the first film, which I feel is a classic.

Neither applied to any element of this film. Why take a character that was a hero and written as such and turn him into some obnoxious glib jerk you cannot stand to watch? In the Avengers movie you did not get too much of this character. Here it was just pure indulgence. No restraint. It was embarrassing. The dialogue was fast and empty.

However, this film shows that bad screenplay and acting will still make you want to bolt for the door. Robert Downey Jr. was just hideous as a self-absorbed jerk through the whole movie.

Digital copy licence out of date so dropped it one star. Also bought Avengers at the same time, and luckily watched IRON Man II first. Liked the movie.

The only problem I ran into was trying to play the second disc on my PC using Windows Media Player - it locks up every time. However, I can use an older copy of PowerDVD to play it on my PC and everything is smooth as silk. I don't know why WMP doesn't like that disc, but I'm not too worried about it since PowerDVD will play it just fine. The 2nd disc also contains an authorized digital copy of the movie (I didn't expect this)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks newness of the original","review":"Robert Downey Jr. returns as the superhero with a new foe, the son of his Father's former partner. This leads to the usual exciting finale of the battle between the hero and the villain. The film lacks the sense of discovery that the first Iron Man had, with Tony Stark's Iron Man now a well-known public figure. The introduction of Scarlett Johansson as a karate expert is a welcome addition to the franchise, as her character kicks some serious booty. Overall, disappointing. The first was much better. Seeing Iron Man put the suit together and emerge as a superhero was what made the original exciting. This one is just a below average action film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Man 2","review":"This was a xmas gift for my son and he was so excited.

Plot incoherence3. The biggest sin: It's not funny! Either play it serious or for laughs. It's obvioulsy not serious, so.......???4. The screenplay is excruciating.5. Robert Downey and Gwyneth: where are your standards? You look idiotic trying to sell this. Couldn't you take a look at this and just walk away?6. Ridiculous CGI, especially the Scarlett Johanson fight scenes. Gag me. So freakin' fake.7. Excruciating hammy over the top acting by everyone. Everyone gets an F.8.

The plot could've been great if carried out, but Mickey Rourke was horrible and Gwyneth Paltrow, a CEO, come on. A few of the scenes were good but the writing was so ridiculous, like I said, everybody I invited over left the room except for me and I regretted watching it to the end...

Also, gained sympathy when we thought he was dying. All in all, I enjoyed watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Follow Up to a Great Movie","review":"We loved Iron Man! We thought Iron Man 2 had a weak story line with so - so characters. Although the Black Widow is introduced as a character in this movie - there is nothing to tell you who she is or what her history is. The story did not set up the villin (M. Rouke). Although he plays a good 'bad guy' in other movies, you did not know his story other than a few second of something about father-vs-father. Very disappointing.

Robert Downey Jr. owns the role of Tony Stark. The supporting cast, and even Sam Jackson's portrayal of Nick Fury is very entertaining and works together well. I personally found the 2nd installment of the Iron Man series to be more fun than the first, which is what these movies are all about.

I do feel compared to the first it was only slight inferior, but otherwise it was still enjoyable to watch. I added this to my \\"Pre-Avengers Collection\\" with much anticipation. Even though I liked the movie it wasn't without its flaws. Some things in the story wasn't well resolved and the running gag with Stark and the Senator, while entertaining, was a bit unnecessary in my humble opinion. The movie really picked up when Rhodey donned the armor. I enjoyed him having a more important role in the film.Another gripe I have is I think Jon Favreau made himself involved in the movie more than he should have. I guess when you're the director you can do that. It's not major, but I just really didn't see a purpose of him being in the movie.Overall, it's a good guy. It has some good special features and I just enjoy it. Good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Good price from Amazon, as always. It was a personal must see for me. Robert Downey has really made Tony Stark his character. If you liked the first one, you will enjoy this one as well. Cameo by the late DJ AM was nice. Scarlett looked hotter than ever.

Go get it, all I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped + Brief fighting scenes + More about Tony Stark's personal trouble than Ironman","review":"This movie spent more time depicting Tony Stark's personal trouble than Ironman's achievements. That made it more like a drama. Yet, it's a half-baked drama because it's not given enough time to move me. Just when the drama was building up, it moved to the action scenes. However, these were too brief to provide excitement. For example, the fighting at the race track looked good but it ended too quickly. The last action scenes with hundreds of Ironman clones looked like cartoon.There were less funny dialogues than the first film.Overall, this picture is over-hyped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ironman 2 Blue-Ray Review","review":"I must admit that I liked the movie this time better. After I saw it in the theater I felt a bit empty. I thought like the story wasn't as strong as the first movie. I think now that the movie was a fun one to watch. I still think is not as great as the first one was, but I think it was very good taking into account the studio demands.I know now why Jon Favreu is not coming back for the 3rd movie. In the documentaries he looks tired and not very happy with the studio giving him so little time to finish the movie, hense a lot of changes were made. Speaking of documentaries, the features for this movie were so much fun than the first movie. Deleted scenes were a lot of fun.For the price you should get this.

The Introduction of War Machine was sweet, and the fight sequences were quite fun, especially those involving Iron Man and Rourke's Whiplash character, even though I thought ( like several others, apparently ) that it should have been longer, and that the rather tiring mid-section of the film could have been abbreviated. Johansson's kickass Black Widow was excellent, but Pepper Potts ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) was more annoying than anything else. Also, perhaps the director could have just placed a banner announcing the upcoming AVENGERS movie in the background instead of hitting everyone over the head with not so subtle references to it every time they had some dead space to fill. Still, Robert Downey Jr. is awfully fun ( and 'funny' ) to watch- so I give it 3 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"Great visual effects.Good story.Great cast.Great sequel from the ironman franchise.I have a good every time I watch it, no matter how many times I watched it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"Waste of time for me to watch it and what a waste of money to make.

I flicked back on the Roku and finished up Loose Change 9/11. Like the first Iron Man, this was all flash and little tension. Don't bother with this one.

We both expected far more than was delivered. This movie disappoints on many levels. Very little action, the acting is so-so, and if all the CGI was cut out, there would be no movie at all. It starts out by giving you a little hope that it will be more action-packed than the first one (which was a total dud) with a car race. But that ends in an eye-blink and the remaining 95% is non-action, until the final show down. In between these two events is Robert Downey Jr. talking. That about sums it up. I will not buy another Iron Man movie until it's done by different producers, directors, scriptwriters, screenwriters, and actors.This one is also a TOTAL DUD.Editing note---3-21-2012--I apologize to everyone who read my original review referring to Spiderman instead of Iron Man.

The first iron man is better and has moaction than the sequel which is ridiculous.But the acting overall was good and scarlett johansen fight at the last 15 minutes in the movie was very well choregraphed and executed.

There was way too much inane dialogue, and characters that were not needed except for Marvel to advertise their other upcoming movies. Scarlett Johanson phoned in her role, but who could blame her, there was no reason for the Black Widow in the movie, she hardly did anything. Samuel L Jackson, whom I love, was actually annoying as Nick Fury, not this fault though, really the writers fault for putting him in scenes when the movie didn't warrant it. Don Cheadle was OK but I missed Terrence Howard's charm. Sam Rockwell as Hammer was good though, and Mickey Rourke as Whiplash seemed terrific if only they had used him more! Paltrow and Downey were good but the movie was really slow moving and the fight scenes pretty sparse. Overall a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I went to the midnight showing of Iron Man 2 and I left very happy. I will admit that it isn't as good as the first one but that movie was a near pefect super-hero movie. The sequel has a great amount of laughs and some cool little stories. The action is awesome, just wish there was a little more but it was cool that the movie builds the characters more. Definitely looking forward to the 3rd one and as for the build up for the Shield movie...stay til the end of the credits for sure.

It's filled to the brim with action, explosions, suspense, and comedy. The film takes place six months after the original, and Tony Stark is loving the fame and publicity he's made with Iron Man. Tony is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in his arc reactor, until he can find a replacement. He soon develops a drinking problem. During a race at Monaco, Tony is attacked by Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. Whiplash teams up with a weapons manufacturer to perfect a line of armored combat units that will upstage Tony. The units begin to attack, which are remote-controlled by Whiplash. Iron Man must team up with War Machine in order to save the day. I highly recommend IRON MAN 2!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"110% satisfied.","review":"Amazing movie especially as far as sequels go! Downey did a perfect job, although I don't think there is anyone in the world who would doubt that he would be anything less than perfect in this film. The chemistry with Pepper was great, which is rare in movies-- even more so in comic book movies. Personally, I thought Terrence Howard being replaced with Don Cheadle was an upgrade. The banter between Rhodes and Stark was fantastic. Mickey Rourke did not disappoint as Whiplash. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer was a home run. He almost steals every scene he's in. I was particularly impressed with his role in this film. All in all the cast was great. I attribute this to the brilliant direction of Jon Faverau. The story was clever and unique thanks to the genius who wrote the screenplay for \\"Tropic Thunder\\" Justin Theroux. All around great movie.

I don't think it looked this good when I saw it in the theatre. Crisp, sharp and clear (blu-ray player, HDMI cable into a 1080dpi television), there are times you feel like you could almost step through and join the movie. Downey and Company do a fine job (if you can accept Samuel L Jackson being Nick Fury, my only complaint in the casting). Loaded with extras, all well worth checking out and worth your time. The seeds of the coming Thor, Captain America & Avengers movies are all here and better shown in the extras. I really have no complaints about this movie other than I wanted more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"Good movie. Don't analyze and take it too seriously.

Get a better blu-ray player before you get this or you'll be sorry (it happens in battle scenes and it's terrible to see the impact and then here it 2 seconds later).

Now this is coming from someone who hasn't seen the original IM, but I needed little to be explained to me, it was pretty action-packed (i.e. I didn't fall asleep), there was plenty of humor (bonus points from me), and I thought Ms. Paltrow was REALLY good in her role as Pepper. That surprised me quite a bit. I definitely recommend people to see IM2, especially if you've seen the first. I saw a couple people that were disappointed in the sequel, well, I don't know what you were expecting. I watched the first IM after I saw the second, and I definitely thought the second IM was better.

The characters were right out of the comic books and the story left me wanting more (really cool). This second attempt was very disappointing and did not follow any of the iron man comic books. Revealing the real identity of Iron man painted a target on Tony Stark forever. In the first movie, Tony grows up and starts taking responsibility for his company. In the second movie Tony is less responsibile than he started out in the first movie and more after selfish glory. He turns over his responsibilities to others or they take them from him, and he pursues a life of selfish carelessness. The plot is not plausable or fun. I wouldn't know how to fix this series going forward. It is as if the writer was trying to end it here.

And when is the public going to tire of computerized special effect crap? Sooooo overdone. Almost every character was some self-absorbed ego maniac.

I wasn't even sure this was an Iron Man movie, because the suit seems to be on screen for a total of about fifteen minutes. Downey Jr. went way over the top with his performance. I couldn't help but think that what he said with every twenty words could have been said with two. He's at his best in small doses. And Sam Rockwell? Lord, his performance reeked. I wondered when he would ever shut his pie-hole. He had diarrhea of the lips. He talked a lot, but didn't say a damned thing. This movie reminded me of the Batman movie with George Clooney and Schwarzenegger. A seemingly great cast, occasional cool action, but crappy acting and a juvenile storyline. It felt and sounded like all the actors got their scripts about five minutes before filming. This movie could have been so great, but Favreau totally misfired on this one.

Compared to his, there was no comparison.What I am confused about is this statement from the book\\"Jesus' real father was a Zealot, a rebel warrior named Judas.'Anyone have any responses to this?Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but difficult.","review":"I will agree with the reviewer that said \\"stick to the originals\\" This book touched on the ideas found in the later books and was a hodge podge of other matierial and became hard to get through the book. Otherwords, it became somewhat of a chore to get the book read. The other books are much better, although this book is not terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"left me behind","review":"I've never read Don Miguel Ruiz, but this book is no enticement. When someone with a poor grasp of basic science starts to use (or abuse)scientific terms (e.g. \\"condensed light\\"), I find it hard to stay with them, even if I try to read it as allegory rather than scientific fact. So much pseudo-science here, I just lost all trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh lordy..... No No No","review":"I truly don't understand these positive reviews!!You could certainly call me a Miguel Ruiz follower, considering I've devoured each of his books, leaving the margins covered with notes and bracketed passages. The underlying message of perfection, along with the analysis of domestication has truly opened my mind to living life \\"BEYOND FEAR\\". But oh my God, what the hell is this book?I was expecting a continued dialogue of his eye-opening philosophies, but instead I was bombarded with whack-job theories about civilizations far preceding ours with nuclear power? WHAT???I'm sorry, It's like any religion.. Drop the Dogma, get down to the heart of what needs to be said....This book was a complete dissapointment (spoken from a guy who will be re-reading Don Miguels books for ages)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too ambiguous....","review":"I found this book to wander around in circles. Your best bet would be go right to the source - read \\"The Four Agreements\\" by Don Miguel Ruiz himself, and you will find the simplicity of his readings more beneficial - it's direct and intertwined with relations of the agreements with all aspects of life - home, friends, work - it's a wonderful philosophy, so to speak. Then read any of his other books and you will be pleasantly enlightened."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Harm Than Good?","review":"Basically, I am going to agree with the previous negative comments. I have read all of Ruiz' works and some others and this is just another case of someone trading off another's name. I, also, could not even get through this thing. If you are looking for self awareness stick to the basic books by Ruiz."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back. Does Don Miguel know about this farce?","review":"There is no truth in this book. It is written at the magical and mystical levels of development found in children under 10 years old. If you want to read about aliens, spirit possession, and gods of the pyramids, and Atlantis, then you should go ahead and read this. I suffered through the first third of the book before tossing it.If you want to know about enlightenment then read \\"The Voice of Knowledge\\" by the real guy - Don Miguel Ruiz. He does not write a foreword nor a single line in her book nor mention it on his website. I only bought it because he was listed as author. I think we are all entitled to a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this book even authorized by don Miguel Ruiz?","review":"This book was horrible!!! If I was don Miguel Ruiz I would sue her. I have read his books and always felt enlightened by his teachings. Reading this 1)I could not get into it and 2)I felt betrayed because don Miguel Ruiz really rocks & she is psycho. Do not buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly a guide but solid principles & teachings","review":"\\"Beyond Fear\\" does not go into \\"how to steps\\" of achieving freedom & joy but it certainly guides you through principles that are consistent with Don Miguel Ruiz teachings. In essence, people of power are those who are open, loving, and nonjudgemental: for them the universe is a place of wonder, exploration and adventure.What I liked most about the book is the way the author, Mary Carrol Nelson, weaves elements of Toltec knowledge & ceremonies into the book, along with biographical content. She describes personal experiences by Don Miguel Ruiz & his significant other \\"Gaya\\" that changed their lives. I liked the book! I would read anything by and about Don Miguel Ruiz....Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitious hodge podge","review":"There certainly wasn't anything new offered by Ms Nelson that one couldn't get by reading the original offerings from don Miguel Ruiz.

Stick to reading the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost my respect for Miguel with this one","review":"I recently read The Four Agreements. I really liked it. I decided that I would like to read something else by Ruiz. I picked up this book and flipped through it in the bookstore. First of all, you find a bunch of crazy stuff about egg-shaped auras ripped off from Castanada. Then you find him saying he received a vision about Jesus having a wife and child who lived in France that he actually took from \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail.\\" Then you find out really what an intellectual lightweight he is when you read that Charlemagne melded Christianity to Roman Power. Excuse me, that was Constantine---not Charlemagne---neither he, Ms. Nelson or any of the editors caught this most basic historical blunder. Basically, Miguel goes from writing a very insightful little book (4 Agreements) to full-fledged historical-revisionist, New Age-guru crazy lunatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing....","review":"I basically agree with most of the reviewers with negative comments. I couldn't finish the book. I've read and re-read Ruiz's books and they helped me a lot. I don't know why Ruiz let Nelson publish this book which obviously gave misunderstanding, confusion, or frustration to the Ruiz' fans and had a negative effect on his teaching. Also, I'm sad to see that so many people misunderstand that this book is written by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick To The 4 Agreements","review":"I've read The Mastery Of Love, The 4 Agreements and The Voice of Knowledge, and it is no exaggeration to say these books had significant influence over my life and through careful study of Don Miguel's ideas, my well being has improved substantially over three years.This book however, is a substantial diversion, and it delves much further into New Age ideas that lie on the fringe of academic thought at best. Mary Carroll Nelson lost me, and I couldn't get through more than half of this work before casting it aside permanently. I certainly would not recommend this to everyone, especially not people who stay grounded in academic circles. It may be valuable to the more whimsical minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original teachings from the master","review":"Beyond Fear is packed full of insight, guidelines for living, and incredible truths. I was led to Beyond Fear after reading the Four Agreements, which I found to be trite and too \\"slimmed down\\" for my taste. It seemed like dumbed-down re-wordings of the essential truths in Beyond Fear, which packs so many strange and wonderful ideas into a book that I return to it again and again. It is the original book of don Miguel's teachings - to \\"Billghs\\" and others who say \\"stick to the originals\\": Beyond Fear is the original. This book came first, and is the blueprint for the others. Read it again and you'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"A friendly Warning","review":"Beware: You may be in danger of loosing respect and credibility for Don Miguel Ruiz after reading this book.

A note to any producers reading: if your band is already famous, then a sloppy recording of them singing live with several of their drunk friends might be considered an \\"inside\\" moment.

Buyer be warned - Purchase only if you're the obsessive-compulsive type album collector that MUST, MUST add this to your Smiths collection.

Yes, they measure how much time students have left. That's the good.The bad? Everything else. The buttons are hard to push. The build quality isn't that great. But the worst part for us is that the little stands on the back break off very easily, so they basically lie flat, with the numbers facing the ceiling, which means students can't see the numbers very easily.The problem is that plastic parts on the back break because they are too thin. This has happened to just about all of the timers we bought--one by one, they are becoming useless.And I don't think that these are all that cheap.

It can count up or down. I do not believe it stops beeping at any point once the alarm goes off (at least it continues to beep for 5 minutes). This might be a pro or con depending on what you are looking for. The neat little clip/magnet on the back was something I wanted in a timer, but on this Taylor timer, the clip broke within two months of occasional use. The plastic is cheap, so that is probably what is to blame. Overall, I'd suggest another timer because the clip/magnet was really what I liked in this cheap little timer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I use it to time my instant ramen boiling time.

I cringe to think if you were trying to get to 60 minutes, the maximum on the timer. Also, I have my timer permanently set for 1.59 minutes and cannot clear it to go off. There is no off button and it does not clear by itself; when you run it and it comes to 00, then it goes back to the time you had set. No clearing it at all after it runs. DON'T BUY THIS TIMER!

The clock still works fine, so it's getting power, just won't heat at all.

It shuts off after two hours. I am the only coffee drinker in the house and by the time I get to the last cup, it still tastes great. With my old West Bend coffeemaker, the coffee started tasting old and burnt by the second cup.It is very affordable and I don't think you could do better for the price. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because It doesn't come with the \\"no drip\\" carafe that the smartbrew 2500 comes with.I still don't have a problem with it dripping as long as I lift the lid, but it would have been nice to have the newer carafe.I absolutely love and recommend this coffeemaker.So far, so good!!

Luckily we decided to try it; we're glad that we did as it makes exceptionally good coffee.We have had none of the problems described by previous reviewers. The carafe unfailingly snaps into place under the coffee spigot; we've had no spills. Maybe we got the odd good one? Who knows.There are three issues and missing features that caused me to rate it four stars: the amazing oversight of a water level gauge, lack of a timer and small drips from the carafe when you pour.I wouldn't pay $100 for it but the $60 that we paid now seems more than fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs much improvement","review":"I got this coffee machine to replace the KitchenAid machine that was recalled.

I use the detachable faucet at my sink to put water in, and I would've had to scrawl my own line. Why?Then, this sounds petty, but the carafe poured much too slowly. It irked me that the spout was small enough that coffee seemed only to dribble out.Finally, I have our coffee maker positioned next to the sink, below some cabinets.

The characterization is a bit broad-stroked, but very effective, and the plot very tight. It makes you laugh while biting your nails through Armeggedon, and leaves you feeling good about the world (!).

I would have given this a 5 star rating except for the fact that it feels as though it carries on a little too long.

But as Armageddon steadily approaches, as prophecied by Agnes Nutter the Witch, Aziraphale the Good Angel and Crowley the \\"Angel who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards\\" are just starting to realize that maybe it isn't such a good idea.In the meantime, babies are swapped, the Witchfinder Army investigates and the Four Horsem- Bikers of the Apocalypse, Hell's Angels of course, along with the four other Bikers of the Apocalypse and the four teenage Cyclists of the Apocalyse all converge to Lower Tadfield in Southern England where it's all supposed to happen.With a plethora of characters, puns round every corner and hilarious footnotes, Good Omens is not only another version of Good vs. Evil, but is also a pure delight when it comes to train your zygomatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like potato chips, you'll have to get your own bag* *book","review":"I believe I have just finished reading this book for the eighth time. This time I read the paperback edition because my mom felt that since I'm now living away from home, I should have my own copy of this book. I have read it once or twice a year since Mom discovered the hard cover edition at a used bookstore. It is inconceivable for me to believe someone would actually give this wonderful book away, but I'm glad they did because I may never have found out about it if they hadn't. Each time I read it, I discover nuances I hadn't noticed earlier. As a teenager who is still in an educational system, I find that as I learn more in general I find more in this book. It is one of the wittiest and, to borrow a phrase from Adam, brilliant books I've ever read. It is perhaps THE best book I'll ever read. I only wish there were a few more stars with which to rate this book. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"This is a fun read, a humorous take on the apocalypse. It isn't as entertaining as the best of Terry Pratchett but readers of his work shouldn't skip this work, written with Neil Gaiman early in both their careers. It definitely feels more Pratchett-like than Gaimanesque so his readers will feel very at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"About as far from \\"Left Behind\\" as you can get!","review":"I stood in the bookstore for hours reading this. I couldn't put it down until I knew how it was going to come out. I mean, you never know in these kinds of comedies whether they're going to destroy the world or not. You just know it will be funny.On a religious note: This is not the Bible. This is first-class entertainment. Don't take it as the Bible. And don't think they're belittling the Bible either.

You just have to have a sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does for religion what Douglas Adams did for sci-fi","review":"In the manner of laid-back british sarcasm, which so often makes for pleasant reading, it's easy for an author to overdo it and force the language into Douglas-Adamsesque epithets. (eg Starship Titanic) Luckily, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchet have not let anyone down here. Good Omens for me, does for religion what Douglas Adams did for sci-fi with \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide...\\". Not only is it clever, zany and just witty enough, but the author's paint a pleasant story with wonderful characters as well. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED if you're a fan of Douglas Adams.

A week later I bought the paper back edition and mailed it off to him. Two weeks later I receive an email from my friend. I QUOTE: \\"You [insert nasty word here], you did that on purpose. There I was. On the bus during rush hour. Strangers all around me. And am I sitting there staring straight ahead, making no eye contact with anyone like the rest of the passengers? No, oh no. Not me!

Good Omens written by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman are hilarious and witty in this joint venture. The prose is seamless, you can't tell who wrote what because the writing styles meld into each other. The wit is what you would expect from the dynamic duo. For those who have a sense of humor and find blasphemy hilarious or at least funnt, this book is highly recommended. I never thought the apocalypse would be so modern and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The apocalypse is coming...","review":"...and it's funnier than ever. Hell is sending baby Antichrist to earth for the final battle. But between mixed-up Satanists, an angel and a demon that have grown rather fond of the world as it is, and the world's most adorable Hellhound (and many, many more...), things get a bit complicated. Gaiman and Pratchett have created a wonderful story filled with the most amazingly odd characters and the best take of good and evil I've read in a long time.A light and funny read, highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and exciting","review":"This book was right up my alley. Pratchett and Gaiman did a fantastic job of being consistently witty to the point where I had to reread some of the paragraphs to keep up.

Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Possibly the Best.Book.EVER.","review":"This is the only book where I've actually worn through copies. My Harry Potter and Discworld books get beat up, sure.

I'm thinking it's time I get the hardcover, because I'm less likely to destroy it.If you liked \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" -- this is as good as that, if not better. Like Hitchhiker's Guide, it's one of those books that tends to embed funny thoughts in your head that somehow surface in every day life. I have threatened my houseplants, and every time I'm stuck in traffic I wonder if there isn't demonic influence going on. I've read the classics, and perused the \\"books everyone should read\\" lists. But, in the end, Gatsby and Emma aren't nearly as awesome of a character as Crowley; and if you look past the humorous presentation, there is a lot of truth in what Gaiman and Pratchett wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"I paid $35.00 for this book, I loved it so much.","review":"Yes, it's true.

A hip, up-to-date demon who does not really understand his fellow demons (nice artistry, but...); he and his angelic counterpart are in the same position as two Cold War agents, one CIA, one KGB, after antagonizing each other for years -- home base is far away and they know each other best. There are some passages in this book that will make you laugh out loud; there are others that will make you wonder just where they meant the book to go. It is that oddball form of Brit humour that informs _Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ and its ilk.

No, it's not like Monty Python.Story concerns a child antichrist who doesn't want to start Armagedon. Instead, he wants to play with his dog. That's wicked? That's sacreligious? That's nothing!The old theme of a reluctant Christ/antichrist was much better handled in Hal Hartley's indie film, Book Of Life.There's one good line in this book, about Ygor \\"clocking overtime\\" because there's no thunderstorm. That's it.As an example of \\"trying too hard\\" to be funny, near the end of the book, a character flies through the air on a scooter, wearing a pink helmet. Why pink?

LOL as the saying goes.4 stars because:1 - It is dated. A recurring plot is the transformation of tapes left in a certain car. Young readers will be puzzled - what exactly is a tape deck and why would it be in a car?2 - It is VERY obviously a takeoff on Douglas Adams. Nothing wrong with that per se, but anyone who has read Hitchhiker' Guide will realize this was two authors having fun with this writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my Favorite Gaiman","review":"I'm a big fan of Neil Gaiman, but this may be my least favorite work of his. This is because GOOD OMENS is written as a pure farce, where all the characters act in a silly and unbelievable manner. This novel features a very large cast of characters, and almost none of them are fully developed. As a result, I didn't find this novel particularly engaging.GOOD OMENS is very funny in spots, but I think the authors are more interested in being clever than telling a good story. That's okay for a piece of short fiction, but the cleverness wears thin in a 400-page novel. I enjoyed the beginning of this book, but got tired of it after the first hundred pages. Many compare this book to HITCHHIKER's GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, but keep in mind that this novel is over twice as long as HITCHHIKER.If you've never read Gaiman before, my advice is to read NEVERWHERE or STARDUST first. Those novels will give you a better sense of his enormous talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read with some great humor","review":"This was my first (and definitely not my last!) book by Mr. Gaiman and Mr. Pratchett.The premise is a rather novel idea of the birth and young life of the one who will cause the end of the Earth. It takes you through the prophecies of Agnes Nutter, a witch from \\"way back when\\". You have two main characters who are \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" and quite lovable. There are too many characters to describe here but all are well detailed in the book and you are drawn into their stories with each page.There are parts of this book which are truly hilarious and a box of tissues is a good idea if you tend to cry when you laugh very hard! The story is a wonderful \\"good versus evil\\" one, though in the end, most of them seem to win and go on with their rather unusual lives.I recommend this book highly if you want a wonderful laugh and charming story that keeps moving along at a good pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the funniest book I have read in years!","review":"This book is very funny, as you might expect from a team of Terry Pratchett and a member of the Monty Python cast.

In this wonderfully hilarious account of the Apocalypse gone wrong, we are introduced to angels, demons, the anti-Christ, hellhounds, witches, witchhunters, a psychic, lawyers, satanic nuns, professional descendants, tibetans, the Lost City of Atlantis, space aliens, a burning Bentley, misprinted Bibles, and the four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse. These characters somehow intertwine into an entertaining story that makes perfect sense until you think about it and break out laughing. For everyone who likes books that will leave them with a grin on their face, Good Omens should be on their night stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Apocalypse arrives humourously","review":"When I first began to read this book, I had no idea that by the end I would have laughed more reading it than I had during the past year.

Even though I'm only halfway through the book, I fell in love with the characters, (Aziraphale & Crowly;am I the only one to mention the angel?:) they're incredibly funny. As I was reading the book I could actually see it as a film, it would make a great movie. But, as most books like this go unnoticed by the big shots in Hollywood, it will probably;A: never be a movie.orB: Script Writers will SLAUGHTER it.It's really sad, 'B' describes what befell \\"The Lost World,\\" which I still get mad about.

And, in the words of Shakespeare's Hippolyta, This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard. But it's brilliant! Nobody defines characters like Gaiman, nobody is quite as wackily hilarious as Pratchett. Gaiman enters just enough eerie weirdness into the book to perfectly counter Pratchett's craziness. But please stop relating it to Douglas Adams, it's nothing like him!

In fact, it was after several ranting reviews that I finally picked it up. If you're a diehard Pratchett or Gaiman fan, you'll very likely love it.However, for the rest of us, this is really not all it's cracked up to be. The characters are thin and one dimensional. A good lot of the jokes fall flat on their faces. The world's logic is extremely inconsistant within it's own scope. We all know that it's supposed to be absurd and rediculous from time to time -- and sometimes it does so well. Too many others, and it does so a bit too poorly.The most entertaining bits seem to involve the vast and frequent footnotes.All in all, if you're looking for a a classic Brit Humor tale about an eleven year old Antichrist, this book is for you. If this sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, ignore your friends and co-workers and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I've never read anything by Mr. Pratchett, but this is, In my opinion, Neil Gaiman's weakest work. It's as if the authors had gotten together to write a spoof of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy with angels and demons rather than aliens, and then could not come up with anything but silly banter and nonsense to fill the pages. The characters are quaint to to the extremes of being annoying and tiresome. The plot can be summed up in ten words or less.

I would have given it five stars, but it just seemed to take me a bit too long to get into it. I was expecting it to grab me right away with all the great reviews, but it took a little while. Anyway, this is the story of the quickly approaching end of the world. Crowley, a demon, and Aziraphale, an angel, have been on Earth for centuries just waiting for this.

They take the apocalypse, give it a thoroughly modern setting, and make it very funny. How can the apocalypse be funny? Read it and see.Unfortunately, the handful of other books I've read by these authors individually, don't live up. If you're thinking of reading anything by either of them based on this book's strengths, don't. Pratchett is too dorky (there really is not better word) and Gaiman is too dark and evil. Together though, they made a great combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looooved it!","review":"I have been very remiss in waiting until this late age to read this book. It's everything I ever heard people say it would be.Imagine that there was a bit of a mix-up when the Antichrist was born and he was subsequently off the radar of the Powers That Be and raised as a normal boy. Add to that one slick devil who's got his orders but isn't actually quite sure he wants to bring about Armageddon; a gentle, awkward, bibliophile angel; the adorable and wonderful dynamic between said devil and angel, who've only known each other since forever; the horsemen of the apocalypse in their fashionable 20th century incarnations; a book of absolutely true but hard to decipher prophecies; and a host of minor but entertaining characters.

Caught initially by the title, I first read \\"Good Omens\\" years ago. I return to it from time to time for its lovable characters, distinctive humor, zany plot, and especially for its moving conclusions - not in the least hackneyed - that love conquers all and there really is no place like home.

However, their quest is a \\"tall order\\" even for angelic beings.In this hilarious novelization of the end times, the anti-christ is a twelve year old boy (who is more concerned with environmental issues instead of ending the world), the four horsemen of the Apocalypse actually ride motorcycles (not horses), and the most accurate book of prophecy available was written by an insane witch named Agnes Nutter.Authors Gaiman (Sandman) and Pratchett (Discworld) have created one of the funniest novels I've ever read in Good Omens. Even with the \\"touchy\\" subject matter, you can't help but laugh out loud at the crazy experiences each character in the book must overcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've bought 3 copies of this book...","review":"...because they somehow end up missing. I suspect some of my friends, but when it's such great book, I don't really mind much, and I just buy a new one. I'm just happy anyone else reads this masterpiece. Yes, it's a masterpiece.I read this a couple of years ago and it still stands in my mind as one of the funniest, most intelligent and downright awesome books I've ever read. It's a wonderful mix of the surreal adsurdities of T. Pratchett and the darker, strange and also absurd of N. Gaiman. It's one potent mix, I tell you.I won't bore you with a synopsis of it, seeing as so many reviewers probably already said it far better than I ever could.I will however tell you that this is the first book I always recommend to people interested in the Fantasy and Sci-Fi genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful doesn't begin to describe this book","review":"I rarely write reviews on book, but this one was too awful not to write a review and warn other readers. I was looking forward to a funny book but found myself having to plow through the pages in hope that the end would be worth it. I am sad to say it was not, and consider the time I spent reading the book a colossal waste of time. I am disappointed in the time I wasted reading this book and am completely shocked by the positive reviews. I would strongly suggest to anyone thinking about reading this book to stay far, far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil Gaiman has done better","review":"I love fantasy novels and some of Neil Gaman's other works (such as American Gods) but this book is quite different. I found it's style and humor difficult to read and appreciate, and put it down after about a hundred pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! I blew my money on this????","review":"Calling Neil Gaiman... Calling Neil Gaiman.... Where is Neil Gaiman? After reading much of Neil Gaiman's work, I seem to have stumbled upon what has to have been one of the worst novels I have ever had the displeasure of reading. Neil Gaiman, Clive Barker and many others have a knack for writing that makes you want to take the day off work just to keep reading. However, this novel was predictable, dull, and devoid of all characteristics that would make most of us want to keep reading.It has been some time since I have been compelled to write a review of a book, but I hope that this review can save even just one more person from wasting their time and money. Do yourself a favour and pick up ANY of Neil Gaiman's other work (WHICH IS FABULOUS I MUST SAY!), but leave this on the bookseller's shelf to collect dust rather than your own. They should give these away free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run don't walk, away from this book.","review":"If you have read all of the other reveiws of this book you can now disregard them. The reveiwers must be serious binge drinkers. If your expecting Douglas Adams type humor in this book you'd be better of finding it in an L. Ron Hubbard book. I am a fan of Neil Gaiman's and thoughly enjoyed Neverwhere and his Sandman graphic novels, but this book was not in his style, and not up to par with his other works. This book was very predictable to say the least. The humor was stale, and the characters were lame. Save your money. This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let-down book with Terry Pratchett","review":"I read this book hoping to get the \\"Colour of Magic\\" or \\"The Light Fantastic\\" thrill of reading it, but was not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT IF MONTY PYTHON DID THE APOCALYPSE?","review":"This is a hilarious take on the end of the world (king james version). If you're a fan of 'Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy' or don't buy into the whole religion scene, this book is for you. There were times when I had to put the book down because I was too busy laughing out loud. But hurry and read this book, because the latest news is that Terry Gilliam is going to be directing the big screen movie version of this book. And if you don't know who Terry Gilliam is, then don't read this book. You will not like it. Of course, if you don't like this book, then you have the personality of a rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I was British ... ...","review":"then perhaps I would have the comedic aptitude to absorb this book in its entirety. I won't say I didn't laugh aloud a few times (which in and of itself is probably enough reason to read the book), but I also scratched my head several times at some of the phrasing and flow of the story. But, people seem to enjoy it. I'm just not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pratchett-Based Look at the Apocalypse!!!","review":"I loved this book. As a fan of Pratchett already, reading a non-discworldian book was a big step for me. I loved it all. From the Angel & Devil that were buddies, to the four hoursemen of the apocalypse. This is the kind of book that Christians should read with an open mind, and Athiests should read with a jeering smile on their faces. For more fun, read Revelation Immediately after you finish this and see how much you've learned!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh? I nearly ended the world myself!","review":"This is the funniest book I have ever read! If the world is going to end, I hope it happens like this.

This is the best book I have"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchhikers Guide to Horror","review":"If \\"The Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy\\" were writtenas an occult thriller about the apocolypse, this wouldbe it.Written by the authors of the Discworld series and theSandman comic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, dark, and thought-provoking.","review":"Wouldn't it be amusing if the world really did (nearly) end like this?? A laugh-out-loud, tounge-in cheek look at religion in the world today"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites!!!","review":"I'm a huge fan of both Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, and this book definitely combines the best of both worlds. By both worlds, I mean Neil Gaiman's ability to make even a somewhat simple story seem twisted(in a definitely GOOD way) and Terry Pratchett's ability to write very intelligent and yet, extremely, extremely funny books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still love this book, and","review":"... and I'd like to add something to my previous statment: If you hate a book, by all means it's your right to say so and why, but it's in general really unecessary to continue by insulting everyone who might have enjoyed the book. The focus should be commenting on the work, not on trying to denigrate people you don't know to make yourself seem cooler. Thanks, and happy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Omens!","review":"I am new to both of these authors. I had heard of them before but never actually read any of their work. After many recommendations I decided to pick this one up and couldn't put it down. I finished this book in a good three days and am quite pleased with it! The blurred lines of good and evil, the satirical accounts of Armageddon, and the fine philosophical questions and debates regarding human-beings and Christianity were marvelous! I cannot wait to read this one again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"One of the funniest starts to book, ever. That is a good enough reason to read it. As far as I am concerned, this is Gaiman's best prose work, I suppose that fact that he had such talented help on the comedy front might discount that somewhat, if you do not know who actually did what. Anyway, this is often hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and funny all at the same time!","review":"This has to be one of the most delightful stories I have ever read. If you enjoy quick, clever witicisms you won't be disappointed. The footnotes are as funny as the text itself. I'll be giving copies to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the test of time","review":"I first read Good Omens about 7 years ago, and promptly referred it to family and friends. It introduced me to the Terry Pratchett's subtle yet 'custard-pie-in-the-face' writing style, and this collaboration with Neil Gaiman adds the pique of black comedy. I don't think you can compare this book to any other author/genre/comedic group, not even to some of Pratchett's other works - it stands alone as a masterpiece of narrative and dialogue. Each time I re-read Good Omens, I am struck by yet another subtle reference to philosophy, history or simply another take on the human condition. I find that as I become more well-read, I discover that Good Omens becomes a richer and richer read, which cries out \\"classic\\" to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monty Python does The Omen","review":"This book is funny as hell! If Monty Python did their version of the apocolypse this would be it. This is one of the only books I've read that actually made me laugh out loud. If you don't have buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, witty and complex","review":"My favorite book...one of the funniest books I've ever read. Being a huge fan of both cheesy 1970's occult films and the apocalypse, I laughed out loud nearly the whole way through this book. It's filled with more in-jokes and jabs at literal biblical interpretation than you can shake a stick at. This book has it all! I think the negative reviews are coming from people that don't understand the references to \\"The Omen\\" or don't know much about the bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings out the best in both authors...","review":"This collaboration seems to bring out the best in both authors. It is continuously funny, in an effective way, and is particularly effective in taking on pseudoscience, which is an inherently comical field whose practitioners are painfully humorless. It's the end of the world, and not many of the characters are aware of what's happening or getting ready to happen any moment. Immortal radio comic genius Jack Benny used to have a running joke about how awful his film THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT was. Here's a sort of variant of the theme of Benny's film, updated to the 1990s. It's far from awful! In fact this is my favorite Terry Pratchett novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I've let over 10 of my friends borrow this book over the last nine years, and have had to re-buy about 5 copies to be able to hold onto a copy of my own. It's simply one of the funniest, most moving, most exciting, most re-readable books ever.Put simply: Try and find another book that as deftly ponders the meaning of being human, having free will, and what choices we are told to make in our moral lives day after day and can still make you laugh so hard milk comes out your nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissipointed","review":"I thought there were many caraters that has nothing to do the plot. Just drag-out the story. I also struggle to keep up with all the caracters. I fount four caracter well planned, but the rest was just there. I lost the story plot. Could not understand what one chapter/caracter got to do with the other. There are a fiew funne lines, but not worth reading the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and humerous","review":"This is one of the better books I have had the pleasure to read. The characters bring the philosophical concepts of religious and historical beliefs into a different light.The only part of the book that slows the reader down is \\"young Adam.\\" I wish these two great writers would have done something different with that.Other than that, I will and have most certainly recommended this book. Not only is it hilarious, but it does offer, and even forces,the reader to think about established teachings and ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a dry wit, and such a compelling plot","review":"I've now recommended this book to five friends, three of whom were intelligent enough to appreciate it fully ... and all of us (the intelligent ones) have read it several times, and are thinking of forming our own book club dedicated to ... Good Omens.Bravo Srs. Pratchett and Gaiman ... usually I despise collaborations but the two of you made the story sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A word to the humor-challenged","review":"To those few who found the book \\"amusing, but not laugh out loud funny\\" may I make a suggestion. Leave your house once in a while. You will discover an entire planet filled with people who are not exactly like you. Even more shocking, they may find something hilarious, at which you would barely chuckle. It's called individuality. Look it up...as soon as you are able to pull your heads out of your b***s (of course I meant books, get your minds out of the gutter! Then learn how to co-exist with people who do not agree with you on everything, without becoming judgmental. I think they call that \\"growing up\\"...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satan better hope that Terry Pratchett is wrong","review":"I disagree with the reviewer who said that the devout would hate this book. The self-righteous and those who believe that they have a direct pipeline to the Almighty will hate this book but for those who understand that claiming to know the mind of God is blasphemy and who understand that humor (though possibly ironic) is a Divine attribute rather than a demonic one, Good Omens is a screaming delight. Satan was, before the New Testement, one of God's associates. The relationship between the angel and the \\"demon\\" in Good Omens is theologically sound and howlingly funny. Read it and become enlightened."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Got Me a Warning from My Local Gym","review":"So I read this book at the gym, on the treadmill one morning, and I laughed out loud ten or twelve times, until the concerned looks of strangers became overwhelming. I suppose nearly everyone in the cardio section that day thought I was a nut, but I didn't care. Virginians aren't known for their senses of humor.It is really, really funny. I've read nearly everything by Gaiman, and a bit of Pratchett, and this is my favorite, without a doubt. If forced into choosing my favorite novels ever, this would be on the shortlist.Just make sure you read it in a nice private spot, or you might receive a stern lecture on \\"disturbing the other members\\" as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"like Douglas Adams?","review":"This was an engaging book, more so than some of the author's other work. The narrator's voice is quite similar to Douglas Adams' (author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), with an equal measure of Vonnegut. It's a quick read, which to me is a sign of a good story. Very Postmodern for you literary types. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So witty!","review":"Ah man, just finished reading it and all I can think about is re-reading it! Absolutely fantastic, with a great sense of humor. I can see why it's a cult classic! I just wish i'd gotten to it sooner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"I discovered this book when I was in middle school and re-read it when I was in college. Now, years later, it's still one of my favorites. Tons of people have borrowed my battered copy. When they see me re-reading it (something I do at least once a year) and snickering over the jokes, they can't help but try it for themselves. I've never found anyone who didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, just wish Amazon's Kindle Store Hadn't Messed up...","review":"Yet another book that was initially offered with a Kindle edition but whose Kindle edition has since gone poof! and disappeared.... I should have bought it in Barnes and Noble when I saw it, but had decided to wait until I got home to buy it on my Kindle2. This is more a review of Amazon. As for the book, it has fantastic, glowing reviews all over the place, and the sample I had downloaded sucked me right in..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of the world... as it should happen","review":"Quite possibly the funniest account of the Apocalypse ever written. If you can buy into the idea that the Spawn of Satan gets mixed up in a baby-switching caper, that the Four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse are not only alive and well, but among other capers marketing their own diet foods, and that the outcome of the eternal struggle between Good and Evil boils down to an angel and a devil who have more in common than they have different (including an appreciation of the good restaurants in London's West End) - then this book's for you.I have owned three copies of \\"Good Omens\\" up until now, and I have always passed them on, with the stipulation that the recipient do the same when they finished it. It's that sort of book- if it resonates with you, you'll want everyone you know to read it. If it doesn't, give it to somebody else just to get rid of it. Either way, you'll be doing somebody a favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not understand it","review":"I did not understand what this book was about. I do like Terry Pratchett a lot, but this book I did not like nor did I understand why he wrote it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential unrevealed.","review":"The book had great potential with respect to plot and characters. It DID have some very funny dashes of wit - presumably c/o Pratchett's input no doubt. However, I found the story rather monotone, predictable, and uneventful throughout.How could two such talented writters come up with this stroke of syrup? Honestly, I couldn't believe how terribley disappointed I was when I had finished it.I obviously don't recommend it, because it was terribly BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"Maybe I'm just in a bad mood, but these two guys were trying way too hard to be Douglas Adams, and it shows. For starters, they fail miserably. Imitation is the best form of flattery but outright plaigarism is illegal. A handful of funny bits but essentially nonsensical. Decent, brain-dead fare for a long train trip, but you'll be throwing it right in the bin once you arrive at your destination. You'd be much better of with a 'Hitchhiker' book."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars","review":"Have to agree with the previous writer. What a bust this book was, and it had the materials to be so much better. Aside from a couple guffaws and chuckles (in particularance towards the convolutination of the communicance of the perpelxinating military jargonance) this book was a bore, moved slowly, not as imaginative as it promises to be, and pages plodded by with nothing happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly funny.","review":"A very ill advised descision by the authors to include such done to death concepts as from the point of view of angels in the modern world. That's why I hated the RPG \\"In Nomine.\\"About the only main attempt at humor would \\"Ha Ha look at these supposedly celestial beings, and they're holding up ordinary jobs, ha ha ha. How twisted is that?\\"If you want to see a funny parody of the apocalypse, check out the website: Apocamon the Final Judgement. It's no where near complete, but its free and its illistrated, and it's far more amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money.","review":"Despite an attempt to emulate the Douglas Adams style of humor, this book is just not funny. It drags, it lags and it becomes more of a chore than anything else. I love Gaiman and Pratchett's writing when they're solo. Here it simply doesn't work. I reviewed the book when it came under consideration for a film and I think it would be as unfunny on screen as it is in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book, audiobook not so great","review":"I found the audiobook wouldn't play in several of my CD players #fail, the narration was good but not amazing. While the story is good, the audiobook added nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good omens","review":"Sorry to say that I thought this book was a waste of my money. I could not plow through it, and I rarely give up on any book. I couldn't find any sense in what was touted as a FUN read. Not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Accurate prophecies on the end of the world","review":"I find a lot of fantasy comedy rather forced, but this excursion into the land of the apocalypse is clever and funny. It's a case where having two authors involved in a book really seems to have paid off.The Antichrist is born - and both Heaven and Hell are in a race to make sure he does what THEY want. However, Agnes Nutter, Witch and Prophet has seen all this coming and has got her descendents to make sure that the best well laid plans can be thwarted - or at least twisted into a new shape.I enjoyed this novel. Its one of those books that the more you think about it you realise that it rips off a lot of well known horror movies and adventure stories and to top it off is packed with relevant social commentary. Having said that though, they don't stop you enjoying a story that will make most people laugh out loud a few times before they know they've even done it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 10 favorite books","review":"This book makes my list of top ten all-time favorite books. Not only is it hilarious, it is intelligent and original. I laugh to myself just thinking about the story. I'm wondering why this hasn't been made into a movie yet.

Note that the timer only counts down, not up. Also, the magnets are in the middle of the back of the timer, so when you attach it to your fridge and press on the bottommost buttons, the timer wobbles or falls off. The workaround is to attach a couple of little rubber feet or a stack of masking tape to the lower part of the back of the timer to stabilize it, but the buyer shouldn't have to solve a design flaw like that.But again, you get what you pay for, and as long as you're not paying all that much for this, it's perfectly adequate. Cheap workmanship is fine, as long as the price is also cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"battery nightmare","review":"I absolutely loved this timer for the first year I had it. I loved the number keypad and big buttons. But, then the batteries began to go bad. It used 2 button cell batteries, which I needed a very small philips screw driver to get out. It took me about two months before I remembered to get the batteries out, bring them to the store and buy matching ones. When I finally did put in the new batteries, the contacts bent and a wire wasn't making correct contact. When I fiddled with it, the contact wire fell out, rendering what once was a marvelous timer, garbage. My advice: buy timers that use regular AA or AAA alkaline batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"taylor 10 key timer","review":"The timer is easy to use, and a very convenient size to carry around in a pocket.

Well, this one is louder, but there is little else I can recommend it for. I actually purchased two of these timers about 7 months ago, and have used them interchangeably, so neither has had much wear and tear. Nonetheless, there seems to be some kind of electrical malfunction at times, especially when I'm trying to set it - it often goes back to zero. Sometimes it just blanks out all together. Another problem is that the numbers on the buttons wear away very quickly. The two magnets affixed to the back are handy for putting it on metal surfaces, but one or both magnets fell off of both timers within the first couple months! In short, this timer is a pain in the neck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not crazy for this timer","review":"I do not like this timer. I thought the keyboard would be nice so that I wouldn't have to keep pushing the button to insert the time, but after it goes off it resets to zero so that you have to re-enter the time each time. Also, the alarm is unpleasant and does not ever turn off after a preset time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls off the fridge","review":"The biggest problem with this timer is its weak and unstable magnet mount. The unit moves when you press the buttons because the unit isn't flat enough to stick firmly. I had to put some plastic kitchen door bumpers on the back to stabilize it. As for the timer features, it is a rather loud unit. Maybe that's good for some, but it's pretty harsh. The buttons are nice and big, but hard to push. I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After looking quite a bit to find a timer with individual buttons for each number, I anxiously awaited receiving this is the mail. I had read the reviews and thought that despite some complaints about battery cost, it will fill my needs. Unfortunately within one month of owning it, I realized it was a waste of money. There are 2 major design flaws. First, originally it had a quiet, but reasonable sounding chirp. However now, after only one month, the chirp is almost non-existent. I have difficulty hearing it only 1 foot away in a quiet house. Unless it is physically on you, you will not hear it. Second, When mounted on a fridge with the magnets, you cannot easily push the buttons. The magnets are not flush mounted on the back. If you push buttons, it rocks and falls off the fridge. Save your money, find another timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had for 3 weeks and battery died - Can't find replacement!","review":"Long-life battery? Phewey!

But even if we could adjust for resistance to change, Vista probably still wouldn't be very popular. The reason in a nutshell is that Vista's interface is neither intuitive nor consistent with previous versions, making it hard to get anything of any complexity whatsoever accomplished (try setting up a wireless network connection). A new and illogical interface could possibly be tolerated if a good printed manual were available, but documentation typically is electronic. The \\"are you sure you want to do this?\\" popups are annoying at first. But since there are so many of them, people quickly learn to blow by them without even looking, which renders them totally ineffective. All in all, Vista users are going to face a stiff learning curve for little if any benefit.

You might have the highest spec'ed PC but don't count on it running fast.- Shutting down takes forever.In short, I don't recommend Vista. It's basically one slow mutha.

I could suggest much much better ways to handle this but would rather give advice and support to Linux as it is appreciated.I predicted by 2015 Open office and Linux will be on a equal technical footing with MS type products and only major stagnant corporations will continue to renew with Microsoft. YES Vista is just that lack luster.I find this OS just impedes programs, where it is not customizable to reduce annoyances. As I right this I am told the UAC is turned off again.

Most Wii games are unplayably dull to me as they involve 98% mindless fighting or shooting and 2% puzzles, This game is 98% puzzle solving and 2% fighting. The only flaw it has is the final level/puzzle which is quite short I found to be impossible to finish. It relies (unlike any other part of the game) on speed of movement rather than lateral thinking or 'brain power'. It's a shame that I couldn't finish the last ten minutes of gameplay on it but it's still by far the best Wii game I've ever played"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and extremely fun, Zack & Wiki should not be passed up","review":"Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure is truly one of the best and most entertaining video game productions that I have had the joy of owning. The level design is always original and the puzzles are some of the best I have seen.It is one of the few games that actually puts a smile on my face and draws out laughter during every level. Each puzzle is extremely satisfying to complete; the difficulty level is perfect, making you contemplate every possible solution.It's whimsical art style fits perfectly and the sound effects are great. The entire package is stunning and comes highly recommended to every Wii owner out there, child or adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true hidden gem!","review":"Zack and Wiki is the epitome of a hidden gem. Here you have a game that isn't going to sell very well, and looks positively absurd with a ridiculous looking pirate and his gold monkey friend adorning the cover. Well I'm here to tell you that this game is fantastic. No other game so cleverly uses the wii-mote to let you complete mind-bending and amazing puzzles. The puzzles are simultaneously difficult, but also intuitive in that you may be there scratching your head for a while, but very you'll eventually figure it out by just using logic and persistence. Everyone should go out and get this game and show third-party companies that wii owners will buy good third-party games like this.Check this game out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Sierra / LucasArts Adventures (if you're old enough to remember!)","review":"Fantastic game.

So, when I broke my leg, I decided to buy a software that would engage my mind and love of puzzles as an added distraction. Sadly, Zack & Wiki are a great disappointment to me. Now, it might have something to do with my being 60, but I dearly loved Myst and rarely resorted to \\"cheat notes\\". With Zack and Wiki, I've constantly resorted to \\"cheat notes\\", because the game dissolves so fast when you make a mistake, that there's little chance of learning from those mistakes.

It's such a great game! You'll wake up at 2:00 in the morning having finally figured out how to make it through the level you've been working on for hours. You really need to think and it uses the wii remote in a very intuitive way. I'm close to beating the game, and almost don't want to because I don't want it to end.I love this game because it is so fun to play, and even more because it was the deciding factor in me purchasing my wii (which brought me some other great games like Mario Galaxy).

And it's one of the more inexpensive games out there. Challenging puzzles, cute and funny characters, unique and creative storylines-- That's what Zack and Wiki is all about! Plus, this game makes GREAT use of the Wii Remote-- something that other games have struggled to do. Warning for the parents out there-- although this game is rated E and there is really nothing to report except maybe a little cartoon violence, the ending is somewhat sad and I had 2 inconscolable kids who had a hard time getting over it after being so involved in the game. I however, found the ending to be unique and extremely cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Wii Titles","review":"Great game! Wonderful art style. Hard to describe the game's genre.

I just wasted $26.00 on a cable that I can't return because of the store closing and it's no return policy. I had trouble finding the cable at Radio Shack. I have spent too many wasted hours on this product! In Troubleshooting there is nothing mentioned about how to get the sensor to pair up or what to do if the phone won't charge.

Kline?s character teaches at an exclusive all-boy?s school and uses the emperors of ancient Rome as examples of how one obtains greatness. The problem is that he never lets the audience know any of the great accomplishments of the supposedly great men. He says several times that greatness without contribution is meaningless.A plaque over the professor?s classroom door mentions the name of an ancient king whom no one supposedly ever heard of, yet his name has survived centuries and is mentioned in this film. One also wonders what Caligula and Nero contributed to mankind, yet they are remembered. I also wanted to hear exactly what does make an honorable man. The film was pleasant enough, but it lacked fullness, layers.For more on this film, you may visit:http://www.webspawner.com/users/marcielle/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly boring","review":"I expected a lot more, based on the reviews (6.8/10 on International Movie DataBase is a lot more than I would give this).

That was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Oh the acting is fine as you would expect from Kevin Kline and the rest, but the story is horrible. You can some it simply up in the idea that you can't really change the bad kid, but if you try that's all that matters even if you end up trading on your own morals to do so.

Mr. Hundert, a teacher at a prep boarding school, firmly believes (and rightly so) that it is a teacher's responsibility and obligation to teach students the Greek and Roman classics as well as the very first philosophical minds (Aristotle, Plato, etc) so that the students will grow up to be ethical and moral beings who can contribute to society. Mr. Hundert's belief is that it is a teacher's responsibility to not only teach students history, but also to foster a sense of utilitarian virtue within the hearts' and souls' of the youngsters. Mr. Hundert realizes that he is not only a teacher to these students but is also a quasi-father-figure who can mold the character of his students. I will spare you all of the plot twists in this great film, but suffice to say that this film is one of the greatest films that I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like massage but like carress","review":"If you want to learn massage technique, this is not for you.

I was excited about this product since it was a high-end collectible instead of a toy.There are however many flaws in it, which I will describe in detail:1)The product is marketed as being 17\\" tall, but that is only if you measure it from the base to the tip of the raised lightsaber. The Vader figure alone is barely 7-8\\" tall.2)The statue is said to be made of high grade resin. I could not find a single resin piece in the box. The base is plastic with screws, the figure is made of something similar to ABS plastic (hard plastic).3)The price was fair for a resin statue 17\\" tall but not for a small, hard plastic figure. Think of it as a figure from the Unleashed line with a large base.I would recommend to stay away from it and invest instead on a real high-end collectible such as the ArtFX/Kotobukiya vinyl figures (do an Amazon search for kotobukiya). They are about the same price, 11\\" tall and feature awesome sculpt and detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"DARTH VADER STATUE","review":"Very cool looking and very big.

If you like bright light in your room while sleeping then the standard digital clock is for you (I can't sleep like this)4. Controls are flimsy and so very old style5. You can't unset the alarm. You have to kill power to do that6. Works only on electricity (120 V) and the battery (not supplied) is to keep the clock from resetting when there is a black out.7.

You must set them separately.3.) There is no battery backup.4.)

Unlike so many of the so-called comedies of today I find myself laughing continuely throughout these films. L&H are also able to create these great films without the use of profanity, sex, or violence. This DVD contains a very good selection of some of L&H's best films. A very good job was done digitally remastering these classics and I for one, am very glad that they have been preserved in this format. Some people may feel that these films are for older people to reminisce about the \\"good old times\\" but I would reccommend this DVD to all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"If you watched TV, as a kid, in the mid 1950's, you will enjoy this DVD. The selections are timeless Laurel & Hardy and the \\"picture quality\\" is equal to vintage Black & White TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 out of 5 isn't bad...isn't great either...","review":"I'm not going to bitch and moan about the picture quality like everyone else here, I'm just going to comment on the films themselves.I thought the first 2 films on the disc (Sons of the Desert & Busy Bodies) were pretty funny. The other 3, including the supposedly Oscar-worthy Music Box...just weren't very funny.I liked 2 out of 5, so that's what I'm rating it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely funny","review":"Extremely funny. It gave me a good laugh. This one is not on a much as their other movies so it is a good one to own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do yourself a favor buy the uk release","review":"i rented this a few months back after hearing the neg. reviews.all i can say this is horrid.sons of the desert has fadeouts where there were none.obviously a tv print.the music box was recorded off tape you can see the tape creases.last week i received the l&h collection.all i can say is wow.all hal roach shorts and features.remastered uncut,original opening mgm logo.it cost me 140.00.it is a region 2 dvd,but if you get a phillis 642 dvd player about 70 bucks which plays all region dvds its fine.if you are atrue l&h fan yo have to order it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laurel and Hardy are funny...when you can watch them...","review":"The clips are great in this DVD, but unfortunately this DVD had some serious glitches - maybe a knock-off? Could not finish two clips because the 'freeze' screen thing happened. Had a couple disappointed kiddos on my hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as they ever were..BUT..","review":"..we who are fortunate enough to have this disk want more, of course! So, where are: 'Two Tars', 'Big Business', 'Towed in a hole'? The next disk I hope..in the mean time I enjoy.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Comedy","review":"I have been watching the Laurel and Hardy short films since I was a kid and I love them. The Music Box is probably the one that is the most famous, but all of the other ones are great too. If you want to laugh with some good old fashioned slap stick humor, pick up this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurel & Hardy's Sons of the Desert Plus-- DVD","review":"Saw this movie in the 70's and found it so funny and entertaining. It's about 90 minutes long. Sons of the Desert is the BEST Laurel & Hardy movie they ever made. When it came out on DVD, it had to be viewed and after 30 years it is STILL funny and entertaining. It's about how Laurel & Hardy, playing married next door neighbors and Lodge brothers can go to a Lodge convention even though their wives said no. It's the typical meek husband and overbearing bossy controlling wife situation taking place in the 1930's--- very funny and very entertaining the whole way through. The fact that 4 other short movies are on this DVD is a plus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Again a misleading L&H DVD. This is Laurel OR Hardy solo efforts.","review":"While showing you a picture of the boys from 1935 when they were in top form as a comedy team, St Clair Vision instead gives you un-restored (sometimes incomplete) solo silent efforts from a decade of two earlier. These early works are better presented in the KINO Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy DVDs & Hal Roach's Lost Films of Laurel & Hardy DVD set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic L&H Films Deserved Better Treatment","review":"What went wrong? The long-overdue, eagerly awaited \\"Laurel & Hardy\\" DVD should have been a lot better than the disappointing final product. \\"Sons of the Desert\\" looks a bit washed out compared to the Nostalgia Merchant video from the 1980s. Surely, Hallmark could have located a superior 35mm print - perhaps they didn't give a damn. Even worse, \\"The Music Box\\" has an unforgivable transfer glitch at the beginning that should have been fixed. By comparison, \\"Busy Bodies,\\" \\"Another Fine Mess\\" and \\"County Hospital\\" look pretty good, yet the latter short doesn't include the original Hal Roach opening credits! When considering the digital technology and archival material now available, one would expect these Stan and Ollie gems to match the excellent quality of the \\"Our Gang\\" restorations, but they do not come close. Hallmark should immediately recall this DVD and start again from scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be better","review":"While it is great to see \\"The Boys\\" on DVD, the quality is nowhere near as good as it should be. These are not the highly-praised German restorations, but are apparently recycled from tapes of \\"The Laurel & Hardy Show\\" of the late 1980s. \\"Sons of the Desert\\" has a curious fadeout/fadein after the \\"Honolulu Baby\\" musical number and a prominent digital tape glitch toward the end. \\"Another Fine Mess\\" has lite scratches throughout and an \\"RHI\\" logo on the beginning -- a sure giveaway to the TV origins of this material. With so much better material available on these films from Germany, why, oh why are we getting the inferior old versions here, in the country where the films were made?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Dare They?","review":"The prints on this DVD are, for the most part, the same old crappy prints we've been seeing for years on television & home video, even though Hallmark owns beautifully restored prints of most of Laurel and Hardy's best talkies. Guess they thought nobody would notice.Teach these bozos a lesson & buy the German DVDs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Ever since I bought a DVD player way back when, I've been waiting for something like this to come along.The films are restored very well and look great on DVD. The sound restoration is also very good. This disc is right on par with the Three Stooges discs being released from Columbia/Tristar.Let's hope there are more discs like this on the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sons of the Desert vs. Chaplin","review":"So Charles Chaplin is a genius and Laurel & Hardy are not. Anyway,that seems to be the consensusamong the intelligentsia. Maybe they're right--- I saw \\"City Lights\\" recently and found the final, gut-wrenching scene so intense in its pathos, it almost left me in a catatonic stupor for the rest of the day. As for the remainderof this tour de force, \\"City Lights\\" did not seem particularly funny to me. So,if your comedic taste demandsgenius, by all means take the maudlin road to Chaplin, i.e.,\\"The Kid.\\" If, on the other hand, belly laughs galoreare your preference, \\"the boys\\" (Stan & Ollie) will more than satisfy you--- especially in thiscompilation of their most hilarious films (\\"Sons of the Desert,\\" \\"The Music Box\\"), plus other side splittinggems. Also included is fascinating data on the team and their work, and on Hal Roach, the man who brought them together.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Coyote - A Wonderful Book","review":"Don Coyote is one of my favorite books of all time. I have just finished this book - again - as I have done every year since 1990. This book is such an easy book to read - it is very hard for me to put this book down once started - and every year I am re-aquainted with Don, Coy, and the Hyde family. I have recommended this book (and the author) to my friends and family and cannot wait to share Don Coyote with my grandchildren."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that students will dread, yet professors will love!!!","review":"I had to read this book for my college history course in World History. The book gave good factual events from an American who had gone to Russia during the five year plan in Stalin's regime. This book is an autobiographical account of an American man's life and marriage in Russia, yet I did not enjoy the deep amount of factual literature that was implemented into the book, since the author did not let the reader become intimate with his personal life or feelings. I felt that this book was more of a textbook than a novel. However, I believe that professors will most likely assign this book for their students, especially for the topic of the five year plan, due to the amount of historical and factual content embedded into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant","review":"An Angle's new album, The Truth Is That You Are Alive, is simply brilliant. From straight rock n' roll jams to well orchestrated compositions, the album is crafted in a stripped down and artistic fashion claiming an aesthetically pleasing feel. Through clever lyrics and moments of clarify and true realization, Kris Anaya wows, yet stating by the end, he is not as smart as what you think. The album is a masterpiece worth as much time as it takes to get into."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAND BAND!","review":"So I went by the reviews (which must have been posted by the band members) and bought this record. Worst choice I made this year. The lyrics are pretty much the same type of stuff I was writing in my notebooks back in high school. The music itself sounds like it should in an iMac commercial. Bland, poppy background music. Not special and the last thing you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best!","review":"What a superwoman! The most complete voice in modern time, placed in the most beautiful woman!The CD is a collection of songs that match her voice perfectly, and she use that voice in a way that I thought only Ella F. and Sarah Vaughan could do. I'm loosing contact with reality when I listen to this album.And believe it or not, this record, in fact no record at all by Angela, can be bought in Sweden!!! Shame!I'm in love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation","review":"If you look at this book in this picture, it looks to be white, and a normal look for OES. What I recieved is a old blue ritual that has some age to it, and in some cases the pages were stuck together. If it were not for the love of OES I would have sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"The Rev. Elder Nancy Wilson's very readable and engaging presentation is inspiring and gives the reader a glimpse into the heart of a lesbian and clearly Christian pastor. The book radiates the warmth of God's love and challenges the reader to a deeper commitment to discipleship. It would have been even better and would have received 5 stars had the publisher retained more of the material from the original work. Why did they drop so much out? A great book to read and give as gifts to friends and family who simply don't get what it means to be gay and Christian or who are looking for a way to deepen their Christian walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"find queer folk in scripture","review":"In a day when the marginalized are encouraged to read the scriptures for themselves,and not have them spoonfed or crammed down their throats, this is good news indeed. Surely a gay historian kept the notes for the temple decorations, and another told us about Vashti and Esther; Did David and Jonothan have a platonic relationship? And what about John? Nancy Wilson gives queer folk a whole new perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a present","review":"I haven't a clue about the context of this book as it was a gift that someone requested for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $ it's going for","review":"This book is completely useless and has no entertainment value whatsoever. Correction, every once in a while, when we're sitting in the office trying to decide what to do with the book, we open it for some piece of trite wisdom from actors, authors, scholars, and politicians. Of all the quotes, only the actors seem capable of putting together coherent thoughts. The rest spout off psuedo futurist predictions that aren't worth the time to understand. And for God's sake, DO NOT BUY this book for a friend unless you want them to have a hard time trying to return it for $. Frankly I'm dissapointed that I have to give this any stars at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ebookman EBM-900 Franklin","review":"I am not happy with this Ebookman. I bought it new and it was already obsolete. The mobipocket had V4.3 and to use it it required V4.8. I e-mailed customer service several times and followed their instructions but to no avail. I talked with Tech over the phone but they were still not able to get it running correctly. I wish I had never heard of Franklin Ebookman. All it was was one BIG headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I bought this basically for downloading and reading ebooks. It is not very user friendly and took and very long time to successfully download a book. But the worst part was that it does not have a back-light on the screen. So the screen is light gray and the words are light black. After 2 hours of reading an ebook I had an extreme headache due to eye strain! If they had given this device a back-light or changed the phont color it would be useable , but as it is I'm now looking for a new one to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Bought mine and was never able to use...tried to contact tech support with no answer or call back.

Stay away from this product unless you want to waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My sister loves it","review":"I bought this product for my sister last Christmas as she is an avid reader.

They have been one of my all time favorite groups for 15 years now. I have seen them live countless times, and I highly recomend that you all do so as well. As for their latest recording, it is poor. The song writing is weak. Don't write new songs just for the sake of releasing an album. I would rather see them release another live album with updated versions of their old standards, and more of the covers that they perform so well such as: Sympathy for the Devil, Born on the Bayou, Goin' Down the Road, Juke Joint Jump, Up on Cripple Creek, to name only a few. There are so many more that they have done over the years. The Radiators can be one of the hottest live acts on the road, but very little of their talent is revealed in their latest album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love the cover art, but found the disc disappointing. Maybe, I've outgrown the Rads, I don't know. I used to go see them and loved them back in the \\"Law of the Fish/Zigzagging\\" era, but the songs here just seemed silly. Fortunately I paid less than a dollar for it, so no great loss. A previous recent review I wrote led me to purchase this CD as I wondered what they were up to recently.I'm sure they are still good live, but I wouldn't bother with this particular disc. The art would make a great T-shirt however, and I'm not sure why the Rads don't offer one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Data","review":"This ISBN number references Vol 2.For those of us looking for detailed Order of Battle and TOE information this is an excellent book.Be careful the publishing quality is poor so don't expect a physically high quality book.Vol 1 gives very good OOB information; Vol 2 supplements this with good TOE information (manpower, vehicles, etc but NOT weapons); I think you'd need Volume 3 to actually get the details on weapons intended for each unit.This is a reference / research book. It doesn't contain any narrative or descriptions of battles."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRACELET LENGTH","review":"The bracelet is beautiful but I took a chance ordering with no length info.It is 7 1/4\\" long and I prefer 7 1/2\\" , but rather than returning it, I willgive it as a gift and be more careful in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shopping in NYC is not for the faint hearted","review":"Shopping in NYC is not for the faint of heart - you could spend all your time searching for your store or going in circles - especially in the village.

I like books that just tell me the best places to go for what I want.This book leans towards being a total reference, but offers the shopper plenty of options.The bargain shopper needs to know one thing - Century 21 next to the world trade center site. That is about where the unbelievable bargains end.

To do so, she nears to uncover what has really happened to Eve and Merilynn and what the core of the sorority is really about. That's hard to do with the strange way the sorority president seems to be watching her every move and treating her like a bug in a bell jar. However the strange chanting for the older sister's wing and the signs she keeps getting to leave and not come back, can not be ignored or denied.I liked this trilogy a lot, this is the third time I've read it, and Tamara's writing still flows nicely every time I've read this story. The regular sisters are nice but I will admit to liking the inner circle of Fata Morgana a lot more. I loved Mallory and Brittney a ton, they're always fun to read bitchy and witchy all at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"Was looking for a gift for grown children with children of their own.

I thought; \\"what a great deal!\\". It was a total scam. It's NOT informative, helpful or even funny. I found myself wondering; \\"Was he drunk when he wrote this?\\". The only good thing about the book is that it can be read in about an hour then used to start a nice cozy fire on a cold winter day when the power is out and there is nothing better to do. Great!

It's boring, generic and repetitive, with dull storytelling. The menus and presentation are atrocious. Maybe I'm missing something, a lot of people liked Assassin's Creed too, and well that was terrible.

I'm the first to dispense with traditional science and biology when it's convenient, since they're very complicated, and they don't cater to the emotional and spiritual needs of the ordinarily-minded person. A book like this one should give those of us who choose to turn our backs on \\"proper\\" science something to focus on instead in our search for health, longevity and freedom from pain. However, if we're replacing all the discoveries and benefits of science, it should be with something MORE intuitive, something MORE spiritually simple, than what traditional science and medicine have to offer. Otherwise, where's the alternative? If spirituality has to be so complex, we may as well just accept what we're running from in the first place: empirically measurable knowledge. I give this book two stars since, at 320 pages long, it's unlikely I'll ever read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anatomy of the Spirit:","review":"This book has such a promising beginning, with the most wonderful observation that \\"Your biography becomes your biology\\". A simple yet stunning summarisation of our cellular organism.For the most part there are many wonderful insights, but the text is often rambling, ambiguous and endlessly repetitious.The theory is very hard to understand, and there are many insignificant trite comments. Page 26 actually says that \\"If you are spiritually centered and call back your energy from negative beliefs you can eat cat food and still stay healthy\\"! This is obviously incorrect and a nutritionists nightmare.One of the most interesting observations in the book is by another author, the neurobiologist Dr Candice Pert; who states that, \\"your mind is in every cell of your body\\".

I've been able to integrate parts of it with my interest in Buddhism, acupuncture, psychology. I also believe that reading it influenced my ability to be cancer-free for the last 15 years and live life as a thriver, vs survivor of anything.I am so grateful to Caroline Myss for writing such a profound, unifying and beautiful book.

It explains the problems we may face in our spiritual development and how they are manifested as physical problems. I love how the author puts together the stages in christianity, judaism, and hinduism and illuminates us to the parellels she finds. I also love how she discusses the flow of spiritual energy and how it affects our physical health. If you'd like to read a fascinating book explaining this using a more rational (rather than intuitive) approach, read \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato. It explains things like \\"spiritual energy\\" and \\"spiritual\\" development by relating it to many contemporary theories in Psychology. Both books are absolutely amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Very Dissapointed","review":"I don't blindly accept or blindly deny what I haven't experienced first hand, but all this new-ageish energy healing stuff is very overblown. When someone says that there is an essential center of the body that is responsible for all disease processes (the fifth chakra), I have to be rational and be a critical thinker about it.Now I have experienced some strange things. And I know that the money isn't there to conduct the proper studies on alternative healing.

I found the parallels interesting and wonder if the similarities she perceives have their roots in mystic traditions that unfortunately gave way to the construction of organized religions. In any event, she made one statement that I suspect is the crux of spirituality. To paraphrase, \\"We were put here on earth to learn to manage our energy\\".

The film bluntly displays how your happiness could be impeded by your station in life and if you are a woman it's that much harder. There are no real villains in the piece other than the archaic mores set down for generations. Interesting, though based on a novel by Christopher Morley, the script was adapted by Dalton Trumbo who would later be blacklisted. Ginger Rogers, in a performance of great strength and nuance, more than earned her Oscar for her work here.

Martin attempts to stigmatize as anti-Christian and anti-spiritual such world religions as Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, the Baha'i Faith, and many well-established Christian denominations.Academic and intellectual integrity are sorely lacking in this pseudo-scholarly approach to populist theology. No defined basis for categorizing a belief system as a cult is given, writings of faiths are audaciously taken out of context to help make a point, few specific references are given beyond \\"high level official\\" and the like.This is a volume that does nothing to foster an understanding of various belief systems while attempting to poison the reader��s perspective of all but the most conservative of Christian viewpoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very prejudiced.","review":"This book was written by scholars who attempt to slam minority religions.

It is true there are groups a person should avoid, but I question some of the groups included here. By juxtaposition to the harmful groups, those that are outside of the accepted mainstream appear heinous.

He lended me the ones he had, and after a few days of study, I discovered that many of the references did, in fact, NOT exsist.

This book contains most of them. One should know the teachings of these religions. They can be quite destructive.

The authors mentality of my knowledge of Christianity is right, so 'everyone else must be a cultist' is not consistent with the teachings of the Christ that he espouces to follow.

Those with a discerning eye will recognize this is NOT the Christ-like way of love and hopefully will quit following man-made church doctrines (Matthew 15:9) and be happy when God lovingly sends someone to their door to bring a Scriptural thought to mind for a moment , go get their own Bible, and discuss something upbuilding together, in a mutual exchange of love for God's word.

He has created a definition of what he feels a cult is and applied it to those groups he doesn't agree with. Rather he creates a world that is run by the definitions of man rather than God. His foundation is not from the Bible, though his studies are well into it. Rather, his views stem from the Trinitarian doctrines, created at the Nicene Council, some time after the ending of the Book of Revelations. The doctrine is impure, it would be similar for us in our day the change the Constitution in a modern assembly and declare that the new version was the framers' intent.

If you haven't already watched Heat, watch it. That film is probably the most robbed film of all time - it should have won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editing, Best Actor (Robert Deniro), and Best Supporting Actor (Al Pacino). This movie on the other hand is neither original, exciting, and lacks the type of character depth in Heat. Comparing this movie to Heat is a huge mistake. In Heat, the character depth is incredible. It develops richly, the characters of the two protagonists, as well as at least 6 other characters. Takers, we don't care about ANY of the characters. Oh, and the main \\"Heist\\" is taken straight out of Italian Job. They don't even make any bones about it and mention that (better) movie in this movie when discussing the heist.

Meanwhile a cop, who does not use proper police protocol (imagine that in L.A.) is in an apartment building performing a bust. The Takers like fine drink, fine automobiles, fine cigars, and fine women. After the action scene the movie slows down. They exploded the helicopter too soon. Andy Sidaris says it has to be near the end. The cop was unlikable as we root for the bad guys. Unfortunately the movie never picks up to where it was as good as the opening heist. The story had nothing new to offer and I found myself getting bored with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced and filled with Suspense and Action","review":"This film is a rather fast-paced version of \\"The Italian Job\\" and \\"Heat\\".

Whenever he is on the screen, his persona and demeanor dominates the other characters.The conclusion of the movie leaves a lot of questions- but you can always create the ending you want to believe.Well-made film...although crime never pays.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My 20 year old daughter told me I'd like this and . . .","review":"I did.

Then there is about an hour of \\"how are we going to do it\\", but the last twenty minutes are exciting again. The action scenes in this movie are very exciting and fun to watch, there just aren't enough of them. The actual plot and acting are not enough to keep the movie going in between the action.

I missed Magic Johnson's performance back in the 1980 Finals against the 76er's when he started at center in place of injured Kareem Jabbar. This set contains that game in it's entirety, as well as many other complete championship games. It's a delight to look back and review just how great Magic, and those Showtime Laker teams were. There is only one thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars. The folks who put this together would have put many more smiles on customer's faces if they would have included at least one game with Chick Hearn calling the action. All the games here are as they were when they were originaly taped by the TV network that happened to be covering the finals that particular year. So we get alot of Dick Stockton, and Tommy Heinson- but no Chickie Baby. Chick's voice is so embedded in Laker lore, you can't help but notice his absence. Still, I highly recommend this set to all basketball, and particularly Laker fans.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Complete","review":"Well when i got the DVD i thought it would be the complete history of the Lakers even the years they didnt win the title.

It's got everything, a captivating storyline, amazing cut scenes, intense boss fights and more. Has a high replay value. It's one of the few single player games I have that I've actually put back in the xbox after beating it more than once.

Whatever the mechanic is, it's done well, but not as well (or as laughably over the top) as DMC 3. Here's the thing though, it's still great. And if you are a fan of the DMC series or just action/puzzle/platform/beat-em ups in general you are going to like this.

Dynamics range from \\"pretty loud\\" to \\"louder.\\" Rhythmic subtleties of the score disappear -- you don't hear what's printed in the score. Pedalling is cut and dried.

Because of their genetic programming she is in both physical and emotional agony since he rejected her.Why did he reject her? He rejected her because he felt that their first sexual encounter, when she is under the influence of an aphrodisiac, was too close to rape. Was it rape? Not really (but, she does say she doesn't want it like this). Does she blame him for this?

They just stayed locked in a house the whole time arguing about the same things over and over. And the book was poorly edited. There are a couple of passages that repeat literally word for word.

Clearing the timer and getting back to a clock display always seems to take one button press more than should be needed. The killer is that all of these button presses are around the EDGE of the timer, whereas the magnet/stand that should allow you to use it one-handed is in the MIDDLE of the back, providing no support for pressing those buttons. The second time I used it, pressing a timer button made it tilt against the front of the fridge, disconnecting the magnet, and dropping it six feet to the floor. Stupidly, I had already shredded the receipt, so I'm sure the karma was my fault anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor product","review":"Buttons stick (after only 2 months, need to use your nails to get them out and working), complicated secuence to reset (and I'm pretty good with machines..this is NOT intuitive at all!

This is really a book on the modern industry and its techniques and artists, with only a 12 page history at the beginning to cover all the past.

But, bury a bad-mannered girl who loses the ability to conduct her in a civil manner, by raising her hand to make her sentiments known for instance, in a topic about smoking, then all is well and good, right? Wrong. If this had been a book about anything else, we'd have been outraged at the manners of this child, yet, because it deals with second hand smoke, we tolerate it. For shame. Put this child in the corner, then let her voice her sentiments. Teach her some manners, then she can talk about others' and their right to smoke freely, particularly adults (whom she feels the need to criticize).

Murray advocates dismantling welfare in favor of no holds barred capitalism, which he believes will best eliminate poverty. The most interesting aspect of the work comes when the author pushes for complete government funding of college education. Sloopy research and partisan language weight down this rarely engaging tribute to the merits of the free market and the failures of welfare.

He makes most people relate to at least one topic in any one of his songs.Well worth the purchase of this book if you are a musician or starting to learn to read music I think most musicians would agree with it. It would be nice if we could get him to write more books on his songs that he has written over the years. Glad to have him back playing and writing music again.Thanks John"},{"rating":"2","title":"While not splendidly written, a unique and must read memoir.","review":"Berry Benson tells it as it was. He does not fill the pages with fluff, but merely gives a straightforward account of his trials and tribulations during the war. At first, I was skeptical about all that he claimed to have gone through, but after some research, his story holds true. Benson was just shy of 18 when he joined the Confederate army. During his service, he was a sharpshooter, fought under Gen. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, was captured and escaped TWICE: once from Point Lookout and once from Elmira. At times, I wished that he would have gone into more detail, and that is the only downfall of this book. For example: he goes into some description of Point Lookout yet fails to give a good picture of Elmira. However, his story is not one to miss and I suggest it for anyone wanting to read a more personal account of the war that is a little out of the ordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!!!!","review":"This book is perhaps about a family relative, still trying to make the ties to him.

It's amazing that Julie survived her childhood but there is no way she'd not carry the psychological scars of what was done to her. It seems that her grandmother probably did the same to her mother when she was little. The scariest thing is that her mother carried on'adopting' more children so was able to continue doing the same thing and ruining the childhoods and lives of others. I agree with some of the other reviewers, an epilogue would have been nice, just to know the 'adopted' children were removed from her and she would be kept far away from children in the future. It is frightening to know that there is still someone as sick as her mother out there, taking care of children.

Julie Gregory could have had something with substance, but after the first 100 pages,she was all over the road and totally lost it. The copies of the letterd and medical charts cannot be viewed (too small) and she wrote in a \\"fiction\\" style. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"Julie Gregory's memoir is astounding on many levels. Mainly the fact that she managed to survive all foroms of abuse (mental, emotional, physical, neglect) and managed to carve a 'normal' life out for herself. Her brave and honest account of her childhood serves to highlight the immense vulnerability of children and the difficulty in proving abuse has happened. After reading the book I visited the author's website and was appalled that the state system is allowing Sandy access to children once again despite evidence provided by different fields on her unsuitability of being a carer to anyone. I am surprised that she has not been admitted into a mental facility!! Truly grim, but a story that has rightly, and necessarily, been told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrific story that needed to be told","review":"I never knew anything about Munchausen by Proxy until reading this book. The book was written very well and I felt, deep within me, all the author had to go through as a \\"sick\\" person much of her life. She described these events so effectively that I was gasping as I read it. I am glad I read this because I am an educator and this type of abuse really has not surfaced in society. This definitely was a story that had to be told, if only to spread awareness about this unusual life threatening mental illness. I can imagine that writing this book, reliving the events that took place, and grappling with her feelings about her mother and father and whether or not to let the truth be told, must have been an extremely difficult task. In the end, it paid off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad Beyond Belief","review":"Julie Gregory must be an amazing sole to have lived this life and survived. I have heard a little about MBP but after reading this book, I want to learn more. I need to learn more. Julie's horrific childhood consisted of abuse and torture...of the body and mind.

The DS fits in it so securely and I really like how it will tilt at different angles for maximum viewing.

If you're going to buy one book on the subject, buy this one. The information is priceless, dispelling the notion that a nuclear war is impossible to survive. (But of course, would you want to?) Why does China have facilities for so many people that they continue to build today? Even with the Cold War over, the detailed explanations give an understanding of the miriad of possible scenerios, many of them applicable today. All bombs and radiation events are not equal. How much time do you have? What supplies do you need? Under what circumstances do you pass out the Potassium Iodide? Years of field tests make this book the authority."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could give it six I would!","review":"How to put it plainly, this book is an ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE for anyone even remotely interested in empowering themselves in a Nuclear War.

This is a mystery surrounding the murder of a cat therapist. The sleuth is a rather dim-witted out-of-work actress now catsitter. The suspects are cat therapy clients and a giggalo husband (Romanian defector). The story is not at all believable - not the plot, not the characters, ... eh, maybe the cats' ailments.

It is one of the better books I've had to read in this field. There are many examples to go along with the theories being expounded. The author presents the importance of play in the educational development of children, in an insightful manner. In addition, the author doesn't beleaguer the reader with long, boring, details. The material is written in a way that respects the reader's intelligence. Finally as a college student, I don't really have time to read unnecessary materials. This book gets to the point and I appreciate that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the Right Pieces","review":"I concur with the previous reviewer that this is the best book on NFL history ever written. It has all the right pieces: good research with relevant detail, but no so much detail that it clutters the prose; excellent biographical sketches without being too laudatory; and an astute command of the development of the game via strategy and innovations. Most sports' histories get wrapped up in platitudes and overstatements; not here, it stays on track and cites the highs but doesnt ignore the warts and unseemly parts. It is fluid writing with a comfortable pace and well organized divisions by topic. An absolute must read for those who delight in the colorful history of America's favorite spectator sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"A history of football for every serious fan","review":"This is a real, serious work of history; not a Sports Illustrated coffee-table ornament which simply glorifies the sport. The book traces the history of the sport from the early 1900's to 2004. It spends most pages on the Rozelle-era; there is no doubt the author thinks very highly of Rozelle and one may think the book is biased too much in that direction. The story of the NFL after Rozelle receives almost a casual treatment. Which takes away nothing from the read-worthiness of the book.

It works great and is so affordable. I don't think it takes too long to heat up at all and the hose losens up after the first two uses. It is so portable that I would consider taking this on a road trip if need be. I no longer iron the old fashion way. This is so much quicker than ironing. The only thing is I wish it did work longer than 20 minutes. That is the only con I have with the product. But if you are just getting an outfit ready for work this is all you need. If you are doing more at a shot, then you will need to refill it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Medium-Size Steamer!","review":"I just received my GS4 (amazon regular shipping arrived in just 3 days!) and I am very impressed! I have had smaller, hand-held steamers before that just don't get the wrinkles out, and I didn't want to get a huge, clunky industrial steamer. The GS4 is a very good size and does a nice job. I used it last night on five suits and a few silk nightgowns and everything came out wrinkle free pretty quickly without needing to refill the machine. For me, this is much better than paying for dry-cleaning all of the time when things just need to be freshened up. It comes with a over-the-door hanger that is very helpful when you put the base on a chair (the hose is about 4 ft long and won't reach everything from the ground). I would recommend this steamer to anyone with garments that can't be ironed without being singed or anyone who is just unskilled at ironing--you need no skill for steaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great if you read the instructions!","review":"I've seen people in here whining that it spits water...It doesn't if you FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. There's like 3 tags on the thing that say \\"don't fill above the maximum fill line.\\" They mean it. Really. And it also says \\"if you are steaming in a low position, occasionally stretch the hose up to remove condensation from the hose.\\" If you don't...it'll spit water. Duh.All that being said- I love this steamer. (Although I got it at Target for $29). I use it for sealing synthetic dreadlocks, and it works wonderfully.Oh, yeah, it also works on clothing too."},{"rating":"1","title":"As much work as ironing","review":"For the price, it IS amazing that this steamer does anything, which accounts for all the rave reviews. This little number is not real powerful, so you don't get the effortless, quick steamer results that most of us seek. The steam output is low, so you go over and over the garment, with little improvement. Forget about using it on linen. Even on thin cotton, it creates tiny spider wrinkles. You have to hold the hose vertically to prevent water from spurting, which is awkward and dangerous, as the hose gets HOT. You have to have a door near an electrical outlet. Then the hook doesn't fit over the thickness of the door, nor does the hose reach the item hanging from it. It is as much work as ironing, but with ironing, you can eventually achieve the desired result. The steamer is compact, heats quickly and doesn't take up much room. I returned mine, but there may be a few people who like this steamer."},{"rating":"2","title":"best thing invented since Downey wrinkle reducer","review":"This compact steamer works like a gem, especially with a product like Downy Wrinkle Reducer.

I generally like Conair products, but not this steamer.I don't even fill the water to the MAX line, and the steamer spurts water all over my clothing, AND it drips on the floor; and I wait for it to fully heat up. I could deal with that if it did a decent job steaming, but it is marginal at best - and I've tried it on barely wrinkled cotton clothing, not heavier fabrics/drapery/bedspreads. The steam doesn't feel all that hot - I've accidentally ran my hand in the path of the steam and it isn't uncomfortable at all. My mom has a steamer that she bought at Costco for about $40, that blows this thing out of the water - instant wrinkle release, no drips or sputtering, excellent results. Guess I'm headed to Costco soon to see if they still have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"This did not do what it said it would do..I couldn't get the wrinkles out..I returned the item, Amazon refunded my money as they are so gracious to do.

This unit has been in my mind since then due to its good price and good amazon review. Finally got it weeks ago, hoping to use it for the holiday.

I filled it exactly to the maximum line and it spits all over the clothes. You have to hang the clothes high up to be able to keep it from spitting more than it does.I could have two shirts ironed and done while waiting for this machine to heat up! It's also very noisy and sounds like it's going to explode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't replace your iron.","review":"Bought this today after researching it online. It took a little too long to heat up, and after using it for 20 minutes, I wasn't impressed. It takes about as long to steam a shirt as it would have to iron it, and frankly I was disappointed with the results. Sure it removed most of the wrinkles, but didn't leave the smooth look and feel of being freshly pressed. As someone said earlier, if you think this will replace your iron, you're sadly mistaken. My iron is coming back out, and the steamer is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's what I get for being a cheap-o","review":"I figured I'd save money and buy this steamer as opposed to something better constructed, more effective, and easier to user (and closer to $200). It took me ten minutes to steam a plain blouse and not very well at that. To add insult to injury there was hot water sputtered all over my blouse and on me. I'm bummed. I'm going to return this misbehaving water spout as soon as I can beat it back into its box. Then I'm going to do some fact finding before I dump my salary into another steamer and I suggest y'all do the same! And if you buy this POC I recommend wearing oven mits and blocking out a good chunk of your valuable time to get through your crinkled wardrobe. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Finicky","review":"I've had this product for a year or so, and I've held onto it because I liked it better than the travel steamer I had before it, but it has a lot of problems. I can't fill it with more than a few cups of water or it spits up boiling water rather than steam, causing several burns on my hands and arms. Running it on so little water means I run out after only a few garments and I have to refill and wait 4-5 minutes for it to heat up again. There's no way to clean out the resevoir, except to steam vinegar, and then it's very difficult to get it to stop smelling like vinegar for weeks after a cleaning! Now it's developed a leak and leaves puddles on the floor. I'm shopping for a better brand to replace this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This steamer sucks!","review":"You get what you pay for, but in this case, this wasn't even worth the $26 I paid. It only works intermittently and when it does, the water runs out so fast that you risk scalding yourself trying to add more water. It sputters and spits and mostly wets my clothes rather than get any wrinkles out. Don't waste your time or money with a cheap steamer. I had a Jiffy steamer which worked awesome for years but I guess the calcium build-up finally killed it. I'm going back to spending a little more money to get a steamer that works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic steamer, and easy to use, too","review":"This is a great steamer. It did make the gurgling sound when I used it, but it was only when I held the steam nozzle close to the main part of the steamer. The door hanger is great, and everything is easy to use. I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"using my neighbors - and will be buying one shortly","review":"I just got four new backdrops for my portrait studio...with lots of creases. I was looking a bunch of different steamers online and had no clue what to do...should I just get an industrial steamer? I had no idea. Well, I didn't have enough time to order one and get it in time to use the backdrops for an upcoming shoot, so I called my neighbor to see if he had one. I just got half of a backdrop done using this steamer and it's doing the trick. I've never used one before, so I really have nothing to compare it to. But what I do know is that when I've got several 10ft x 20ft backdrops and this seems to be doing the trick...I'm happy.It also seems to be easy to handle and stable, which, when working with steam is a must.In summary, I plan on ordering this very model in the next 24 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"ConAir steamer","review":"I've had the product for a month.

I purchased this Conair Fabric Steamer months before I opened it to give it a fair try only to regret not opening it sooner. It is just amazing. Now I can only hope it keeps working for a while before I go from impressed to disappointed. Garments iron with just a stroke or two of the arm depending on the kind of fabric.

It might be too soon to say but for now I'm Loving it and keeping my fingers crossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I had used the industrial-strength steamers in the past, but this one works just as well at a fraction of the price.

It is cumbersome and though it took wrinkles out, it is no substitute for ironing."},{"rating":"2","title":"inexpensive and does the job","review":"I'm glad i got this, its inexpensive and seems to do a good job at steaming. I think it will be a useful addition in my household. a few complaints, it takes a while for the steam to get going, and the tube is a bit short so it was hard to reach things hung up high, but for the price i think its worth it, and much better than trying than other steamers i've used."},{"rating":"1","title":"CORD TOO SHORT!!!!","review":"I make many purchases from Amazon and very seldom have returned anything, but I guess I should have read the other reviews before buying this steamer! I wanted to avoid having to set up my Rowenta iron and the ironing board to do a quick pressing of a garment. The steamer MAY have performed well if I could have used it, but the cord was too short (6 ft.)to reach the outlet. Since this uses an \\"over the door\\" hook for the steam nozzle, I guess Conair thinks everone has an electic outlet right beside every door!!! WAKE UP CONAIR!!!! My Rowenta iron has a 10 ft. cord! I was very disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes the Garmet More Wrinkly","review":"OK, so I was excited about this new purchase, however, the steam took out the wrinkles, but removes any starch and hard pressed fabrics. You wear the garmet for 1/2 hour and then you have triple the wrinkles. This product is a good idea, but in reality it doesn't work like you think it will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, but it won't replace your iron.","review":"I read the reviews, and decided to give a chance to this steamer. It is simple to operate - fill the steamer with water, plug it in, wait a couple of minutes. I waited for a while hoping to get the \\"continuous steam through high-velocity jets...\\". Nothing like that, though. Just a weak steam that WILL NOT take the wrinkles out of most shirts or trousers. So don't expect this piece of equipment to replace your iron or visit to the dry cleaners.However, I believe this could work fine with special care (maybe silk) pieces. But don't expect it to save you time, as you have to go slowly over your clothing - just as you will do with an iron.I give it 2 stars because of its price (saw it on CVS and Kmart for around 30 bucks) and how easy it is to use. And although it won't replace the iron or dry cleaners, it can become handy for some materials that shouldn't be ironed."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this","review":"I bought this because there were a lot of good reviews, so I expected to get a good outcome. What I got were wet clothes. It just makes your clothes wet, it doesn't remove wrinkles. Yes, the steam is hot, but with all the water droplets coming out of it it doesn't make a good steamer. I held it upright, I always make sure that the hose is straight, but the water just keeps on coming out which makes your clothes wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not remove wrinkles well and is dangerous","review":"After you have the steamer running for a while, it starts to \\"spit\\" hot water onto the fabric you are steaming and subsequently on to the floor and anything else below. Not only does it get the fabric wet, its very, very hot water.There is also no where to rest the handle in between garments. If you set it on the base it turns the unit off.I would not recommend this product. Takes just as long as ironing. Go for a higher quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Ineffective Steamer","review":"What an awful product! Going to the Goodwill today. Steam leaks out, hose is stiff and inflexible, kinks easily.

Don't bother with this model!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after only owning a few months","review":"I knew when I purchased this that it wasn't going to last me a life time but after only using it 4 times it broke. Problem? When you rest the hose head on the hook it has a hard time staying there, it slipped of course and fell to the floor to break into a handful of pieces. Not worth it, now I will be willing to spend a little more money for one that is better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow work","review":"I have used the steamer once, and was disappointed at how long it took. The steam comes out weakly and splattered water on the garment several times. I was just trying to take the store creases out of a new pair of lightweight cotton trousers, and it took a lot of going over to get it done. I used to have a small hand steamer that put out a real blast of steam and worked much faster. This one will probably work on heavier material like drapes, but it will take a very long time. I wouldn't buy it if you plan to use it for anything other than very delicate items, and it seems like a lot of equipment to lug out for that job. A hand unit makes more sense to me, and you wouldn't have to maneuver that long hose. This is just one more large thing to store. I wish I could return it to Wal-mart, but will probably give it away and buy something that is easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"I ordered the steamer based on the mos recent good reviews. My primary use for it was to steam my work clothes, which mainly consists of business casual items. It worked very well the first day, then the days following it, it began to spit a significant amount of water. My pants were SOAKED and couldn't wear them AND it spilled a puddle of water on the floor. I tried giving it a chance by reading the pamphlet that came with it, and attempted to troubleshoot as per their instructions. Well, it didn't work! Did the same exact thing the following day, and decided to just return it. Too bad it didn't work because the price and compact size was exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have tried it for 2 years","review":"This system is just horrible, spits water all over clothing doesn't take out wrinkles, every time I try it I'm just praying it will work like it's supposed to and it never does.Just not a good product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to get the wrinkles out entirely","review":"I've only used an expensive one while out of town at a friends and was so happy with it.

And this unit creates steam rather fast going from cold to steam.I have a rack on my ironing board that I prop the handle into. One thing, there is not a steam off switch so the steam keeps coming out when the handle is put up so keep your hands clear of the head when not in use! Other than that I would recommenced this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other steamers are soooooo much better","review":"I've used a lot of good steamers--this is not one of them.1) Takes forever to heat up2) Spits water3) No place to put nozzle (get one with a vertical pole)4) Hose too short5) Calcifies after 1 use and no easy way to clean it.I'm returning mine and getting a better one.

The first time I used it I plugged it in, left the room for a few minutes, and came back to found it had leaked water ALL OVER my laminate floor.......enough water that it warped the floor a bit. It leaks every time.....now I just know better than to put it on anything but tile or concrete. To make matters worse, it doesn't do a good job steaming clothes. There is no way to control the steam and it sputters water over everything. I had a little handheld Sunbeam that quit working after a few years that did a much better job than this piece of junk. I hate this product and will buy a new steamer as soon as it's in my budget again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Steam is weak and you must hold it up high or it'll drip all over the item being steamed.Item being returned as I type this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Garbage","review":"I bought this so that I could steam iron out the wrinkles on my linen curtains.

I would never recomend this item to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Pain In The Neck This Thing!","review":"I used this twice and it was 2 times too many. For a larger steamer it doesn't remove wrinkles as well as I would like. It was cumbersome which would be okay if it was a steam demon but it didn't perform well. The hose became stuck on both occasions so it took me 15 minutes just to get the hose off to fill the chamber. It totally calcified after one use, sitting for 2 weeks. If Conair were smart they would allow the entire white hood to be removed for proper cleaning and emptying. My unit also spit out water like mentioned in some of the other reviews. Disgusted I threw this thing out. I know a hand held smaller unit will work just as well as this dumb thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"This product does what it says it will do.

SLOW WARMUP TIME","review":"I read all the rave reviews here and bought one of these with confidence .. BUT was most disappointed .. the warmup time is a full 8 min and then you only have limited steaming time. But worse than all that is that you have to remove the hose to fill the base with water and it's all made of plastic .. hard to open and easy to break. I'm returning mine and going to try the mid priced Conair Ionic one .. hoping for faster warm up time and a sturdier unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it so far","review":"I hated the wrinkled look of my sweaters, even when new and even though I fold them properly in my closet.

First time I used..worked okay, took awhile to get the wrinkles out of an average 80% cotton blouse..longer than I thought it would but for the price compared to the much more expensive steamers, that's what was expected. 2nd use and it sputtered, spewed water all over my shirt constantly and it was a complete mess. Had to steam even LONGER this time as it was producing more water spewage than steam and the shirt was completely wet with so much steam and all the sputtering of water. Checked settings, hose, water level, instructions..no use. Completely unwearable shirt and unusable product. Not happy and am returning."},{"rating":"1","title":"messy!","review":"This product is cheap comparing to the others, but it doesn't work, so I guess its expensive since my shower steam does a better job than this little guy...

It didn't take the wrinkles off but left my clothes dump to the point that I couldn't use it anymore at the same day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems","review":"When I received this item I had a death in my immediate family and was not able to open it to return it on time. The item had been used prior to me buying it even though it's advertised as new. There was a calcium build up in the inside of the container. Another thing is that beware that none of the attachments are included, which was my fault I guess I should've read but its a good heads up. I've never had a problem before with anything I got from Amazon but it really pissed me off that it was used before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"didnt work well. took too long to get hot and because the coil is so long it took forever for the steam to start"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to use","review":"I thought this would be simple to use. First of all, even if I hang my clothes up to steam, I like to have a hand free to hold the sleeve and move the item while I steam. With this Steamer, I had to use one hand to hold the steamer and the other to hold the steamer wand... that left no hands free. Not to mention that the hose was tight and short and wasn't easy to maneuver.

I thought since this was a Conair product it would be quality. I was wrong on both fronts. It takes 20 minutes before the steam starts, and then there is not enough power so while your steaming water drips on your clothes. I would have returned it, but my wife through away the box. I have used a garment steamer in the past, and I have friends that have one. We agree that the key to a good garment steamer is 1200+ watts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conair GS4 Fabric Steamer","review":"I am really disappointed with this product. I gave it a couple of tries and finally gave up. The hose is too short to reach things like hanging drapes, it sputters water onto the clothing.

I bought a new shirt and was hoping to iron out the creases in it before wearing it to work. It did a partial job of removing the creases but they were still visible after multiple passes.I bought a much cheaper portable steamer a while back and that does a much better job.

It fell woefully short in many respects. It seems to me that Ms. Faron has learned all she knows from watching a Discovery Channel special or movies, such as The Sting, Traveller, or Paper Moon. It provides nothing in the way of original insight or research. The author's writing style is disjointed and confused. It jumps between subjects quickly without segues. I can see how non-writers can be interested in this book, but as it sells itself as a guide to help an author with character and plot development, I expect a little more than \\"You might want your character to do this...\\"I do admit that the title is fully fitting.

I usually find a shortcut or feature that I previously did not know about such as being able to assign command line output to a variable, etc. The chapter on Implicit Rules is always a nice refresher for the few times I do write a Makefile.Overall, this book has been a good reference and with a notable author as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, beautiful, touching!","review":"Great cd.

She spoke about the endless nights and endless days of the Artic, the cold and the snow and the ice. It promised to be a meditation on both the inner life of a writer living in relatively isolation and on her discovery of the riches that lay within that dark and cold world.Imagine my disappointment after handing over $... to find a book that was neither poetic nor particularly well done. Ehrlich's metaphors gush without precision. Her historical writing skills are dismall. I could barely get through her retelling of what by all accounts is a riviting history of human exploration of the Artic. The best parts of this book, which desperately needs an editor, were here own narratives. But they could not carry the three hundred plus pages saddled on them. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deceptively beautiful and powerful","review":"Gretel Ehrlich's wonderful book has been a nightly treat, savored at the fireside. Since the lives of the Greenland Inuit are so remote from daily experience, it takes quite a bit of adjustment to enter into their perspective. Ehrlich accomplishes this through an obsessive, recurring immersion, reminiscent of her hero Knud Rassmussen. She went back to Greenland seven times, for goodness sakes! The focus she achieves through these revisitings, and our chance to re-encounter characters and experiences, builds a powerful emotional bond. I felt a real loss when I had to say goodbye to these characters for the final time. This is a deceptively beautiful, powerful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a surprise.","review":"Having previously read and enjoyed two of GE's books, I was excited about the gifting of this book. I first mired down when the author begins quoting other's works ad infinitum but kept slogging through as I enjoyed her descriptions of the area and the people in her own unique way. Again, more pages and pages of others' works. Then, even more and more pages of other's work. When does a work stop being the author's and, perhaps, when should the work be titled an anthology? As a writer, I do marvel at the author's descriptive prowess and recommend her early works."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written, much content fabricated, a work of fiction","review":"This Cold HeavenI read this book with great anticipation, both because I enjoyed Ehrlich's previous writing and because I was with her during some of the events she discusses related to her Arctic travels. When this book was published, I was surprised and appalled to find the writing was often sloppy, and much material had been fabricated or blatantly \\"borrowed\\" from other sources. I don't know if Ehrlich counts on people in the remote places she writes about NOT reading her books, or if she dashed this off in haste. Perhaps she is suffering from literary arrogance. In any case, ethical reporting and nonfiction are not her strengths. In the future, she should stick to fiction and poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diary-summary book that is hardly exciting...","review":"I wish this book were better!

Only plus this has over ironing, is there is no risk of getting iron too hot and ruining your fabric or putting a stain on it. And no need for board. But other than that, its a lot of work.

Further, it's pretty much impossible to find a soft cup/non-underwire that does all of the above.This bra is supportive, comfortable, pretty (the lace in the cleavage really does look like a cami under tops) and your breasts don't look like 'uni-boob.'

The front is also great. It lacks in support a bit (I have DD) but I suppose that will happen with ANY bra that has no underwire.

If you are looking for the traditional gaming style of fixed camera angles while moving your character around or being able to move your character with a fixed camera behind your character and move around the map in a 3rd person point of view, like in Resident Evil 4, you might be disappointed. This version of Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles is a similar zombie killing adventure with a point and click House of the Dead game play. For quality gaming, play with a gun adapter (Perfect shot, for example). The game was delivered sooner than expected, always preferred. Definitely worth a play if you enjoy zombie games or any of the House of the Dead series. This customer's experience from purchasing and receiving to playing of the game was everything he thought it would be and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could'ave been better.","review":"Overall, this is a good game. I got it looking for a classic arcade horror shooter for the Wii, and I got what I paid for. Like I said, it is a good game, but there are a few things that keep it from being great. One, is the level of difficulty. And I'm normally pretty good at games. Two, is the fact that there is literally every thing that could be zombified, zombified and put in the game. Now for most, this is a good thing, it shakes up the experience and keeps things from getting repetitive. But I would'ave liked to see a plain old zombie game, where you fight plain ol' zombies. To sum it all up, for me, it was good, better with the Wii Zapper and two people, but could'ave been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun But Short","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this game and would have to say it was definitely one of the most fun 2 player games I have ever played. I also enjoyed this game taking place in the scenes of other games. It brought back happy memories. My only complaint for this game is how short it was. In 2 player mode there is only about 4 hours of play time. There are single missions you can do as well, which may be longer, I'm not sure since I didn't play them as I bought it for the 2 player aspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"On rails train wreck","review":"After enjoying RE4 so much, this one was a disappointment. The on rails feature does all your walking around and room scanning for you. I constantly found myself fighting it to slow down or get a second look at something, but you can't. The ability to rouse enemies, then backtrack and set up and ambush isn't there, and you can't go back for extra items once you have passed an area. In short, you feel confined and robbed of your ability to set up a game strategy. What good is a rich environment if you can't explore it? It's just boring shooting over and over. I played the first few levels, but will ignore or sell back the game from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just get RE4","review":"If you are a huge Resident Evil fan, like me this game is not worth it. I purchased this game thinking that it was all my RE games but like house of the dead. I was mistaken, I beat this game only for the added story, they left out major scenes from every game. If you are looking for a good game that is completely worth it, Resident Evil 4 is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely playeable","review":"I rented it because I wanted some game to play on the wii that would use a gun. This seems to the the only actual game choice that I could find. Pleas don't suggest that the crossbow practice is a game. I is barely playable and I wouldn't recommend it. I got the wii for my wife and so far there are no good games for it. I will see what old game cube game I can find and just forget the gun till someone bothers to make a real game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.....why a rail shooter?","review":"I loved RE 4...I don't understand what was gained by making it a rail shooter.

It may be that we just don't enjoy \\"rail shooter\\" games, but both my husband and I really disliked the game. So much so that we went out and bought a PlayStation 3 System. There just aren't enough good games available for WII."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its NOT Resident Evil 4","review":"So I was completely addicted to Resident Evil 4 and then I beat it. I enjoyed every blood gushing minute of it. So I figured I would get Umbrella Chronicles after I finished with RE4. What a disappointment! The controls are tough to use (compared to RE4 anyway) and you can't control where you're moving....the game is controlling you instead. I'm just not a big fan. Since you have limited movement, you have limited opportunities to pick up herbs and ammo. If you walk past it and possibly miss it, you can't turn around to go get it. In my opinion, compared to RE4, this game pretty much sucks. Maybe some gamers like the format but not this one. I can't wait until RE5 comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second thoughts on purchasing RE Umbrella Chronicles...","review":"As a Resident Evil fan myself, I wondered if I should purchase this RE Umbrella Chronicles or not. But by going on [...] and looking at the gameplays, and by reading some of the comments some people have posted...I'm glad I made a wise choice of not buying this game. Before I even looked at the gameplay for this game, I thought the gameplay of this game would be like the rest of the other RE games I played...but I was wrong. Like what previous people have posted, this game is just like house of the dead on the arcade. When I buy a game, I want to experience the full story, levels, figure out puzzles and experience the whole game. Instead of buying this \\"not so good\\" game, I instead bought RE Archives and I'm glad I made a wise choice. So if your a RE fan like myself, you would know the difference between the two games =)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for 2 players","review":"Good for older kids and adults. A lot of gross stuff and blood! Seems hard without 2 players. Also the characters are very whiny for being zombie killers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another rail shooter with poor controls","review":"I've played this with and without the wii zapper and was disappointed. It plays like House of the Dead or any other rail shooter, but with really crappy accuracy and poor responsiveness to controls.Head shots just don't seem to work. The aiming reticule doesn't line up with the way the zapper feels like it should. You basically have to aim lower than it feels like you should. Squeezing the zapper trigger in a rapid fire fashion does not work. The trigger only trips every second or third time when you squeeze it quickly. Even if you use the wiimote without the zapper, shots just don't seem to connect.The voice acting is a crime against humanity. The only redeeming value of this game is the graphics. That's the only reason I gave this two stars instead of one.Bottom line, if you really want a good zombie shooter, just wait for Left for Dead on the 360 and you might be happy. But RE Umbrella Chronicles just isn't worth the $50 dollar price tag. At all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umbrella Chronicles","review":"Don't like the format that this game is set up in, Resident Evil 4 is more my style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"This game is a waste of money.

I don't understand why the other reviews are so good?! Do you people even play this game prior to submitting a review?I am just going to end this by saying..... it sucks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame...","review":"This game is sad. It is an arcade shooter not and rpg, action adventure like many other Resident Evil games. This is the kinda game that you can play for 15-30 minutes and then get sick of, or run out of quarters. Albeit the wiimote works well on its own or with the zapper it just... kinda a crappy game. I'm glad i bought it at Gamestop used with 2 guns so and was able to return it all for cash.tl;drBuy it at gamestop used and then return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this game because I was looking for a game my boyfriend and I could play co-op, and I was really disappointed by it. We both love the other RE games and I figured this one would be similar to the rest. I was WRONG. While it did allow us to play co-op, the game also moves you along on its own. You follow a set path and shoot, but you have little control over the speed of movement or the direction your characters will go. It makes it difficult to pick up items on the way, and there were several times when I'd be stuck in one direction while a zombie was chewing on my shoulder behind me - I'd have to wait for the game to turn me around before I could shoot the bugger. To me, having control over my characters' movements is a big plus. I am going to give this game another try after I get a zapper, hoping that the game will get at least a little better as we continue through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles","review":"I expected this game to have the same level of graphics as Resident Evil 4, but it sure does not.

Definitely better than darkside chronicles"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Well, I was a tad skeptical about buying this game, but I'm glad I went through with it. People need to understand that this is not RE5; meaning that you shouldn't compare it to RE4. This is more along the lines of a Time Crisis mixed with a House of the Dead. You do not control the movements, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad thing. There is plenty of Resident Evil background from the previous games, so for hardcore fans, this is a must. There's only one major downside I can say about this game: Not enough playing time. I was hooked to this, so of course I finished the game in the span of two and a half games. There is good amount of replay value, however.4.5 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just dissapointing...","review":"I would be lying if I said that I was a RE fan, my first game was RE 4. I loved RE 4, was fascinated by it and understood why RE was so successful. Umbrella Chronicles was a MAJOR disappointment. The fact that I don't control the character is annoying; I save that when I go to the arcades and play House of the Dead, which is fun but it's an arcade game. I paid 50 dollars + tax to play a game that would make me think. This game is so mindless that I feel my brain cells dying. It was just a waste of my time. Since I first started that game I just didn't like it.I gave it a chance and lost hours of my lifetime that I'll never get back. Don't buy this game.

Resident Evil 4 is nothing like the other games in the series to date, and if you loved playing it, there's no guarantee you'll like this one.

This game is terrible, don't rent it and definitely don't buy it - but if you really want it I'll sell you mine.The graphics are decent but there is NOTHING to the game. You can't control your character, monsters just pop up on the screen and you shoot them. That was great in the days of Atari and Coleco Vision when you were the talk of the neighborhood just because you had a game system other than Pong. It doesn't take advantage of the Wii system in any way. In addition to shooting monster you can shake the Wii controler to fend off attacks but there is really no strategy, no interaction, it just sucks.

However, be warned, it is not like other resident evils. This is a SHOOTING game, not a puzzle/action game like the others. It is very much like House of the Dead, but with more depth and goodies. I have played it for over 20 hours, but most of you will not play for that long. The game will likely take about 8-12 hours to beat all the sublevels and main levels. It does have replay value in that you can upgrade guns, somewhat like resident evil 4. Very fun with a friend as well, because you share health and must work together. However, I would not buy it for $50 plus tax. I got mine for $38 brand new. Look for a deal if you want to buy it, or just rent it and you could beat it in a few sittings."},{"rating":"2","title":"No where as bad as I heard it was","review":"Although before buying this i heard it was terrible to play single player, i have not seen any truth to this. It is much harder to play single player simply because there are just as many enemies as when you play it co-op. And don't get me wrong, it's fun to play single player mode but 100 times more fun to play with a friend.

It takes work for the man to handle this book, because it will cause him to review or remember things hidden or passed that he may not want to recall.

Aberg writes in such an understated manner about the solitude of prison life and drug addiction that these poems ARE truly shocking. And, yet, like James Schuyler, he's a full blown romantic in love with the world. While the subject matter may be dark, the poems sparkle in the mind with light. Aberg has learned to paint what he knows in a few deft strokes. You want a good book of poetry to teach in your MFA classes? Order this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting idea, but poorly executed","review":"I was certainly not expecting anything equal to Jane Austen's, nor even Georgette Heyer's, writing; but I did hope not to have quite as many jarringly out of period words or phrases jump out at me as did. Nonetheless, I would have given this another star or two, because the setup of the mystery was interesting enough, if the author hadn't decided to make drivelous, nonsensical \\"magic\\" the cause of the mysterious behavior of various characters. That is most certainly not in keeping with the spirit of Austen's books and characters. It was an interesting idea for a book, but was so poorly executed that I won't be wasting any time or money on any other books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"From good to bad, a whole range","review":"Good element: Elizabeth and Darcy \\"feel\\" like they fit Austen's characterizations pretty well. The personalities are lifted directly out of A&E;'s movie adaptation.Medium: The language is very uneven: mixed with very good Austenesque sentences is standard Regency romance fare plus modern terms like \\"gloppy\\" and a servant in danger of being \\"fired\\" instead of \\"dismissed.\\"Bad: The \\"mystery\\" is so simple I had it figured out within a few pages, then found the rest of the book boring while it dragged to a conclusion.Really bad: The element of witchcraft which totally dominates the story. Don't call it \\"paranormal\\" or \\"supernatural\\" - it's plain old witchcraft and it is a cheap solution to a \\"mystery.\\" Austen, as a clergyman's daughter, would have recognized it as evil and never have added witchcraft to her stories, and Eliza Bennet would have known to stay far away from it.Conclusion: Give this author a miss. Read the Jane Austen mysteries by Stephanie Barron instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Get Real","review":"I agree with Elizabeth on her review of this book and just want to add my disappointment with the supernatural solution to the mysteries in these books. Jane Austen was able (especially in Sense and Sensability) to have someone act totally out of character and still come up with a plausible resolution to the story without going into what amounts to \\"black magic\\". This author did a tremendous job of creating a story, staying greatly in character, almost staying in the 19th century line of thinking, but to solve all the problems she set up, everything fell under the \\"folk magic\\" category which conveniently (for the author) eliminated any need to be clever. I prefer a book that gets me into a situation or series of situations that I can imagine no solution for and then is resolved in a fantastic, though believable manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A *very* silly plot, but a series with potential","review":"This is the first of the Pride & Prejudice follow-on series from Carrie. Both of the first two books have VERY silly plot lines, even as she writes with grace, a sense of the 19th century, a good feel for the Pride & Prejudice characters, and so on.I recommend you start with book THREE: \\"North by Northanger\\", and read all future works by Carrie. Read the first two in the series only if you are given them as gifts and don't want to appear ungrateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Tolerable","review":"This is an okay book for a light read, but very hard to picture the Jane Austen's characters in that role. Elizabeth and Darcy were VERY bland. I missed the intensity Austen was able to create between them. They were very out of character in many ways. If it had been different characters I would have enjoyed it (a bit) more. Although, maybe I wouldn't have ever read it otherwise.

I was delighted with the opening chapter! Unfortunately, half way through it quickly turned plausible motives and intrigue into outright absurdity.Caroline Bingley's mind is controlled via a Lord-of-the-Rings-esqu way. Elizabeth and Darcy have their first married fight over the existance of magic. And Darcy, Bingley, and company are all placed under the influence of supernatural forces.I wanted the book to continue with Austen's story, but the story doesn't follow in her vein. Sorry, Elizabeth battling other worldly forces isn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit out of character for Elizabeth Darcy","review":"I was disapointed in this book by Ms. Bebris. It is all about the occult. I found Elizabeth Darcy's interest in the occult and \\"praeternatural\\" abilities to be a bit inconsistant for a Jane Austen character! The use of the supernatural made the book a little more than unbelievable. When I took creative writing in college we were warned not to use the supernatural in plots because it made the story unbelievable. Yet now-a-days it seems almost impossible to pick up a novel that doesn't delve into the occult or astrology. This book is easy to read and easy to guess what will happen. I just came away from reading this book disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst book I have ever read!","review":"No one should be able to write a book based on another's successful book, and use that book to sell their book.

The story was interesting and I loved how even though Elizabeth and Darcy differed on the reasons for what was happening, they still worked together to solve the mystery. I enjoyed reading this book and can't wait to start reading the next book in the series. My only objection is about the supernatural aspects but I still would recommend \\"Pride And Prescience\\". If not for the supernatural aspects I would've given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"I happened to stumble upon one of Carrie Bebris's books at Dollar General. I enjoyed it, and have since read the entire series (thus far). This is the weakest book in the series, but is not terrible.

Certainly worth a read to set the stage for the rest of the series, and is entertaining on it's own."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"The \\"Elizabeth and Darcy\\" part of the novel isn't too bad - really it's not much worse than the other Austen adapters out there - and this could've been an enjoyable little diversion. But the \\"whodunnit\\" part of the book - meh.Perceptive readers will have strong suspicions of the who-will-do-it before page 20. Before page 100 you'll probably figure out most of the why-do-it and how-do-it. If this isn't bad enough, the plotting is so poor that the author has to rely on a really lame plot device to make the solution even remotely plausible.This book had real potential - I wanted to like it, so I oculd get all the books in the series - but fell sadly short. I'd maybe buy another by this author only if I were stuck in an airport with no other choices, and then only if the price were deeply discounted."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to Jane Austen and her fans","review":"This book is boring and poorly written.

I should have read the reviews here instead of relying on the cover blurb.There is nothing wrong with writing a mystery with a supernatural twist, but it was totally unnecessary to attribute it to a Jane Austen character to whom this sort of activity would be totally foreign.Jane Austen went out of her way in \\"Northanger Abbey\\" to spoof horrid novels and make fun of impressionable girls who take that sort of thing seriously, rather than looking upon such stories as silly though thrilling diversions.To imagine that she would attribute serious interest in the occult to the generally practical Elizabeth Bennet was absurd and disappointing. Perhaps if the author attributed the interest to a Katherine Morland Tilney having a relapse, I might have bought it . . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dreadful book!","review":"I loathed this story.

I have to admit that I was very curious about this game since I have never played an Army Men game before. I thought to myself if everyone is buying this game then the game could not be bad at all. Well thanks a lot everyone for stearing me down the wrong path. To start out with, the graphics reminded me of the old Chip and Dale Chipmunk Rescuers game for the original Nintendo. This game dones not even come close to taking full advantage of the PS2's power. But you know, I could put that difference aside if the game turned out to be a challenge. Well, it took me about 2 and a half hours to finish the whole game which i guess for my own sake was good since it actually bored me so much that I went back to studying. The only good thing I can say about the game is very easy to learn how play and the short movie segments are somewhat funny. It is games like these that I wish to myself that I didn't sell my old Nintendo."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is definitely worth picking up!","review":"This is one of the best Army Men games to date. The graphics looks really great, and the game controls are right on. The best part is, this is the only PS2 game that has COOPERATIVE mode!

Some, but not many, of the short stories are entertaining and were fun to read. Others were so far beyond my level of comprehension, I will never understand them. Perhaps the instructor will be able to point out the value of why someone wrote about the subject and why they made it so complicated to read. I prefer reading true stories, presented in easily understandable sentence structure, not a maze of long complicated words describing something so boring. Also, some of the words were so far out that I think it's probably been 100 years since anyone ever used them. Maybe I'm just not the scholarly type.

I was surprised how crisp and down-to-earth it sounds, production wise. It's actually folk music that's very spiritual and only slightly exsperimental, though often melodic. 'I only want to love you', which may not necessarily be a love song, is my favourite track. His vocals on the song are good and it has a great melody. There's some acoustic gospel tinges on this album and there's a jazzy number (track four). The last three songs (message/seed/promise) are more psycehdelic.The lyrics are all about Mike's spiritual journey, though some could be interpreted as love songs. None of the songs are bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a true blue fan","review":"The Moody Blues lost a key part of their sound when Pinder split from the band, and although there have been some good songs since, in my opinion they haven't been as consistently good as on their first 8 albums. But this LP reminds me of every part of every Moody Blues record that I didn't like, and I'm a HUGE fan. The lyrics here are quite good, but good music this album is NOT. It's also not well produced and the background singers are dreadful. If Michael Pinder had been hoping for this to launch his solo career it certainly tanked. This album has only two things going for it: It's rare and it has nice cover art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Domo! Hilarious, cute, and lots of content for the $$$","review":"We acquired this DVD at the Japanese department store in Epcot at DisneyWorld in Orlando. It was $15.99, and is worth every penny - not only will you find many hilarious episodes of Domo and his friends cavorting in their usual style, but included with the bonus content there are the winning submissions from the Domo Animation Contest - people from all over Japan created their OWN Domo adventures - and many of those are as funny, if not funnier, than some of Domo's professionally written and scripted jaunts. In short, if you are a fan of this sort of thing, you will be hard-pressed not to enjoy every minute of this DVD. My son and I watched it all the way through -- twice -- and still plan to watch it again soon. Order it while it is still available, and ensure yourself many enjoyable evenings of laughs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"refund or send another please","review":"Got info back from you thank you and if you can either send me another DVD or refund that would be great thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a surprise","review":"I must confess I started watching the show for its trash value, but the novelty wore off very quickly when it became obvious that the show was cruelly ridiculing the girls. It became somewhat painful to watch the abuse spewed by the questionable \\"TA's\\" or the transparent setups to embarrass them at whatever cost.If I kept watching it was because the show cleverly (maybe accidentally) captured the girls' vulnerability and heart, and allowed us to gain a better understanding of them beyond the faade of loud cursing and cat fights. Some of the episodes were incredibly touching, and I found myself rooting for the girls with all my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Broke Students or Cheap Skates!","review":"I used this book to get me through Europe as well as plan my backpacking adventure, and I thought it was great (especially for London). I barely had enough $ to afford the plane ticket to Europe, much less spend more on other things. The restaurant recommendations were especially useful in places like Athens. It was condensed enough (probably too condensed for some) so that I didn't have to waste time tracking things down. If you are short on time and money, this is the book for you. If you have money and more time, this book isn't for you then and you should upgrade to Frommer's and the like.

With the help of the book, I felt very exciting to be able to setup my own tomcat server and web.xml and develop and deploy my own JSP and servelt in MVC pattern without any help from other IDE like WSAD. The only pity I have that is that the book left all the advanced topics to vol 2, but I have feeling that the vol 2 will never be published. I did send a email to the author about the release date of the vol 2 but did not get response. I could not wait for vol 2, and I have to trun to other good book to fill up the gaps in my knowlege."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Total Beginners","review":"If this is the first time you hear the words servlet and JSP, then this book is for you. Basically, with this book you can run your first servlet and JSP pages quick. However, if you've done some programming before, this book does not provide anything useful beyond that point.In a nutshell, good for total beginners, but no in-depth examples or real world applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Can't-Miss Experience","review":"Too often it is assumed that documentaries must be controversial things--forcing constant debates, a clash of ideals. \\"Birds of Norfolk\\", however, proves that these films can instead merely please (as well as educate).Providing stunning footage of England's Norfolk habitat, the film offers viewers over 90 minutes of rare birds and botanicals, sea creatures and meadow-dwellers. Through clever camera-work and simple narration the message of conservation is offered easily--and does not challenge patience by becoming too much of a testimonial. \\"Birds\\" is environmentally conscious but aware also of its audience. There is no lack of interest here.And, with peerless cinematography, the story that unfolds is one all will wish to see again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful--may lower your blood pressure","review":"A blend of gorgeous photography, pleasant classical music and leisurely narration, this DVD is a nice, family-friendly diversion for wildlife lovers. Norfolk in this case is the original: the Norfolk on the northeast coast of Britain, and it teems with a wide variety and dense quantity of interesting birds. As a guide for someone planning a bird-watching trip to the area, this DVD is perfect. And for the birder who can't make the trip, this is a drier, warmer substitute. I particularly appreciated the narration, which adequately described the area and the birds (seals, adders, butterflies, flowers and a few people too!) without imposing too much, or trying to be clever or cute. The shots linger nicely in this one, allowing the viewer to peacefully observe the birds' behavior. If that's a good afternoon or evening of entertainment for you, this DVD is just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"long long time waiting","review":"product is ok but the company lead time ssucks---1 month from order date--ridiculous glad i got some from somewhere else and faster"},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought it from curiousity...","review":"I'm taking it because they say it's good.

I also got tired of watching episode after episode of Angelique being scripted to cause evil and death in everyone's life and felt they were overdoing her part just to showcase her beauty and perpetuate the writer's lack of imagination.

The book looks at several different arenas in which the aristocracy is removed from preeminence. Then it goes through the aristocracy's struggle to find a place in this new Britain. Cannadine illustrates the decline of the aristocracy with many examples of individual aristocrats' stories. I enjoyed this book mostly because of these stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"The book certainly makes it clear that the heyda y of the titled elite is passed. As an American I had no idea the aristocratic class in Britian had become so financially obsolete. I was aware that their wealth and political influence had declined but until reading this book I was quite under the impression that the majority of Britain's old, landed families still had their wealth and land. I had no idea those who were still prosperous were in a shrinking minority. It was an enlightening and also sad story to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Deliver on Moeller","review":"After two viewings I put my copy on ebay and sold it.

As an \\"Ultimate\\" collection though, it falls way short. It's a mess of a package. Scrambling eras, scrambling studio and live. It could work I guess, but not here. Why include \\"Keep On Choogin (live)\\" or two versions of Fortunate Son, when so many great tunes are left off. Where was \\"Change in the weather\\" or \\"Someday never comes\\" for example.Another thing I can't stand is when a record label chooses to combine material, such as, Sting and the Police greatest hits or the Tijuana Brass and solo Herb Alpert collection.

The Long Road Home takes some of the best of CCR and mixes in a few of the later Fogerty songs that best fit the CCR style.I wonder about the sequence which has the upbeat Centerfield following the dark Bad Moon Rising. Fortunate Son, one CCR political statement, might have been a better choice to follow Bad Moon. As an aside, it is amusing to see the TV jeans commercial with the audio taken from Fortunate Son.Even if you have all the CCR and Fogerty albums, this combination of CCR and Fogerty is worth getting. This album puts it all together to make a coherent whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be SO much better...","review":"This isn't even close to 'ultimate'. I loved Creedence, and I still do, but I have all these songs on Chronicle. After 40 years, Fogerty rates a first-class anthology, filled with Golliwogs material, those hard-to-find Fantasy solo singles, some Blue Ridge Rangers material, the original Asylum versions of 'Rockin' All Over The World' and 'Almost Saturday Night' (and 'You Got The Magic' as well) and any other odds and ends we can scrape together - 'My Toot Toot' perhaps? This comp is only marginally better than all those awful Fantasy repackages, and I'll be saving my scratch for the real thing - if it ever comes."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"A brilliant walk down the long road home.

It only lasted for around 2 months of maybe 20 hours use total before it broke. I would suggest not using Sonic Impact speakers at high volumes since it shakes around and scratches the surface of your table top with the rear stand. Also, it doesn't last long when it starts to rattle around. The sound can get incredibly loud without distortion though. However, doesn't last long and doesn't sound rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for landfill","review":"I got these speakers, and they worked for a short time. They quickly gave up and I gave up on them as well. I just pulled them out again to see if I could get them to work, and figure out what was really going on. What is happening is that the amp is cutting out. I can get them to work on minimum volume and thats it. Above minimum the amp cuts out and the speakers turn off. I have two sets of these and this is true for both of them, so I have to presume its a general problem. The speakers on my lap top are louder and clearer.I am currently storing these in my trash can.

Its a great relief to remove them. The price is good, but unless a person needs closed headphones and cant spend more, I would not recommend them.

I would not rank this album with recent efforts of Sara Evans, Trisha Yearwood, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling Good","review":"Good album. Sherrie has a great voice with a lilting Aussie accent. The album is mostly about love and relationships. Some of the songs:Following a Feeling - good, high energy songSomethin' Missin' in the Kissin' - very sultry, kind of sensuousIn the Meantime - wholesome, encouraging song about how the early individual dreams of a young couple may not have come to pass, but they are now content to build a good life together.In Our Own Sweet Time - an assertive song about there being no need to rush things or plan out the whole future right now, just enjoy time together now. Good guitars.Back Where I Belong - has a good beat, a toe tapperTime, Love and Money - song about how there just never seems to be enoughBrilliant Mistake - fun song about happily finding a good man by \\"mistake\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading...sure to better yourself","review":"I just finished reading Shalom Freedman's Small Acts of Kindness. It is MUST reading for any person wanting to better themselves, regardless of their religion. Freedman shows us by personal example how to be a better human being and how to improve everything around us.His positive attitude towards all of humanity is a great inspiration and his willingness to help those less fortunate than himself truly indicates that he is a man to be admired.Anyone looking for ways to better themselves and help others at the same time must read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extravaganza fan","review":"I am not so much a Stackridge fan as an Extravaganza fan. The talents that came together briefly to make this album were outstanding and it is quite simply my favourite album of all time, any genre. It is the combination of great songs, many of them written by Rod Bowkett on this album and the interplay of keyboards, sax, clarinet, flute, violin, drums, lead and base guitars that make Extravaganza musically exceptional. There is such a variety here with wonderfully whimsical, humorous lyrics and three great instrumentals. There is a feeling of spontaneity and ingenuity. The overall sound is both very full and intricate. In the thirty years since I first bought this album on vinyl in the UK, I have yet to come across anything as satisfying as a good listen to Extravaganza. As a reference point for those that have not heard Extravaganza, the closest to the feel of this music that I can think of is evoked by 10cc's Original Soundtrack album."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD HEADPHONES","review":"These headphones are extremely comfortable, have wonderful sound quality, are very durable, they are flexible, look nice, have a long cord, come with an adapter, and for this price I don't know what more you could get!

They are totally uncomfortable and oversized for a normal person (the one with a head diameter under 12 inches). I can't imagine who wears them at full size.

I was very pleased with them!Here's why: for one thing, they're very comfy. They fit right on the head, and they were gentle enough on my sensitive just-pierced ears. I also loved the long 10 ft cord- it gives you lots of freedom. The sound quality is GREAT!The only flaw I found was that there are volume controls on each side of the 'phones (for each ear) and I didn't really see the point in being able to turn one ear's volume up and the other one down.Other than that, I enjoyed these headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"flippin awsome","review":"there is nothing wrong with these in any way, they are so awesome.....>>they are soo comfortable, you can wear them for days and not get uncomfortable>>great sound!! great bass, these things know how to handle it>>effin long cord, (10 ft) very good if you wanna start moshing. lol. i use it's longness for plugging it into my computer cause the tower is on the ground, other headphone cables wouldnt reach far enough for me.>>individual ear volume, and mono/stereo switch (not needed, but convienent)>>the cable comes out of one ear, much harder to get tangled up.BUT there is one not so good thing.....>>they dont go CRAZY loud like most headphones. they go a little above a loud listening volume. this is good and bad i guess.....phillips doesnt want you to blow out your eardrums, but that should be our choice right? lolBUY THESE, YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Headphones","review":"Good head phones for a decent price.

They're large enough that they sit over my entire ear which make them much more comfortable for extended wearing and the sound quality is good.I primarily use them when I am at my computer: music, games, etc., but recently found that they make excellent headphones for taking on airplanes. They have a stereo/mono switch on them. If your airplane has those those dual input jacks that separate the left and right channels (forcing you to buy their headphones or listen through one ear) you can just plug these in and flip it to mono. Sound will then be pushed through both sides.

This set up will eventually pay for itself in power savings. As a bonus, it sounds as good or better in my computer audio system.Initially, the amp was really bright and harsh, but I let it run with an input signal for 72 hours and the sound improved significantly. I wasn't really a believer in \\"break-in\\" for solid-state electronics, but the sound did improve over time. I have a separate high end system, so it's not just becoming accustomed to the T-Amp.The T-Amp and power supply combination isn't especially attractive, but it fit in with the rest of my hardware environment. I see that there is a version two T-Amp with power supply close to the price I paid for the amp and separate power supply."},{"rating":"2","title":"How 'bout that! Small, but oh my. . .","review":"I'm very pleased with the little jewel of an amplifier that Sonic Impact puts out. The first one I purchased failed within hours, but Beach Audio replaced it promptly, and I have been using it on a nearly continuous basis for weeks now. The clarity of sound is outstanding and rivals that of any sound system I have owned (and I've owned a few!). I bought a power supply (14v 2+amps) from Fry's Electronics to power it. That was a wise decision, as I now get about all the sound I can safely wring out of this little unit. I coupled it with a pair of JBL Control One speakers, and when disappointed with the lower end (hey, forgive me; I'm a string bass player!), I added a powered sub-woofer. Now my CDs and XM radio broadcasts are reproduced with clean power and sound fantastic. So much belt for the buck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How do they do it???","review":"How can a low-priced amp possibly sound this good. This is the best kept audio secret of all time. I have mine connected to a SACD player through a ASL passive (tube)pre-amp. I turn the volume control on the SI all the way up and adjust volume with the pre. The sound that comes out of my high-efficency Horn Shoppe Horns is nothing short of amazing. Wide soundstage, incredible imaging and totally no audible noise. I own two and I'm looking for a third to hot-rod. Caution: If you are going to use in a home stereo rig, the speakers should have an efficiency of 90 or better to get the sound levels you'll want.

My 16 month old son loves it and watches it intently every single time. Becky and Dave are indeed silly but consider the age of the audience. I wish the video would stay focused a little longer on the garbage truck doing it's thing. They show it often but cut away so quickly. My son does not care so much for the parts with too much conversation. (At least not yet). He just wants to watch the trucks. I think the video is educational and is definitely worth purchasing. I'm the one with the complaints - I'm sure my son loves it. He carries it around with him just to look at the garbage truck on the cover. When I say that we are going to watch it he sits down and waits and does not get up till it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave and Becky are at it again","review":"Dave and Becky explore the world of garbage collection and recycling in this instalment that is typical of this popular video series. Maybe because there are fewer types of trucks, there is more horseplay than usual and less information. In contrast to a previous reviewer's child, our toddler prefers \\"There Goes a Fire Truck\\" which has the opposite tendency -- more explanation and just a few antics. The garbage trucks are interesting, especially the automatic truck that has an arm that lifts the containers and dumps them, and there is encouragement to recycle as we visit a recycling plant. We have about ten of this series and I'd rank this toward the middle of the pack; though it's still worth watching, our child views this one less frequently than others."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This is an awful video.

Overall, my son loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster at the garbage dump","review":"This video briefly touches upon the workings of a gabage truck and the dump site. The main characters Becky and Dave act silly most of the time.

Not at all appropriate for a 3 yr old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Age-inappropriate previews; silly characters","review":"I was really angry to see an animated Batman video previewed at the beginning of this video. The preview showed one character waving a gun and several scenes of fighting, including a vixenish woman karate kicking someone in the chest. I don't let my kids watch that stuff and really resent it being stuck at the start of a kid video aimed at a much younger audience.The two characters in this video spend a lot of time clowning around and generally being a little dumb; we liked the \\"Where the Garbage Goes\\" video much better (don't know if it's available; we got it at the library). It has lots of truck and dump footage plus recycling plant scenes without the goofy sideshow act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough garbage trucks in action.","review":"Even though this is one of the only garbage truck videos I have ever found, I wish it had more to do with the trucks than the two stars of this movie.

Too much time was spent watching Dave and Becky act silly. Not enough time was spent showing how the garbage trucks work on the inside. For instance, an animation showing how the compactors work inside the trucks would have been much more interesting than watching Dave being tossed inside a garbage pail. Also, too little time was spent discussing recycling. It was more of an afterthought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garbage truck fan","review":"My 3.5 year old son loves this video. He can now recognize different types of garbage trucks. He knows where the garbage goes when the truck leaves. He knows that it is dangerous to play in dumpsters.

The mother of two young boys (4 and 2), we have accumulated EVERY video in this series. They are all live-action videos (not animation) narrated by an ever-friendly, enthusiastic (almost child-like) male/female couple. The videos are engaging, insightful and go into the processes of everything from sanitation/recycling to construction work and race car driving school. My oldest son watched them and was enthralled since he was two (and eagerly explained all he knew to firemen and sanitation workers and police officers he would meet). Young children seem to enjoy seeing and hearing the big vehicles, and as they get older (Ages 3-5), they gain more insight into the actual workings and duties/functions of the vehicles.

To tell you the truth, I hated it so much I haven't read any of the captions or text. And I can't think of a soul I know to give it to. I guess it's a Salvation Army donation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This book does an above average job of covering various aspects of trading. Short of perfection, as if there is such a book, it does cover basically all aspects of trading. If I were looking to get into trading or investigating how to start this is where I would begin. I don't think that it's anything new for most accomplished or experienced traders but they would still learn something new from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy high and sell higher","review":"is the basic theme of this book. Mr. Lukeman offers a common sense approach to daytrading.He points out the technical tools that should be used to assist in making trading decisions. Using his guidelines,I am convinced will work. You will not get the entire move,but if all works well the meat of a move will be yours .This is an excellent book that reinforces the importance of risk management ,having a positive mental attitude and only to trade where the technical tools are in your favor and confirm your judgement. I recommend it to beginning as well as intermediate level daytraders."},{"rating":"1","title":"We all know more than this market maker","review":"If you're looking for insight into how a market maker works an order, or uses his knowledge of order flow, or anything regarding Level II - forget about it. A waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep analysis of hard-making daytrade methodology","review":"Daytrade is not an easy sport for anybody. There are a lot of particular daytrade technics in this awesome book from the risk management to the proper achievement of the entry and exit of a daytrade position and lots more. The author knows the \\"edge\\" what every daytrader want to be and share it. The strict rules produce profitability but only if you can keep it of course. You can use these rules as is or you can extend it. I highly recommend this book for wannabies and pros as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHUCK IT!","review":"This book really should be called: Day Trading for Dummies. It is so basic and offers little insights any of the other books cover. The dude is so full of himself that he put one of those pretty boy close-ups of himself on the cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading at least twice...","review":"I think I've read most of the books on daytrading out there. Too bad, I could have read just this one along with perhaps John Murphy's \\"Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets\\" and Velez and Capra's \\"Tools and Tactics for the Master Day Trader\\".Josh Lukeman very unselfishly shares his valuable insight of the daytrading game. Imagine how powerful your trading would be if your last job was being a market maker for MSCO. Lukeman gives you that insight. Obviously, a few of the reviewers above didn't \\"get it\\" because they were too busy looking for a simple solution to their trading woes to support their beliefs that someone else (the market maker) is to blame for their losses.If you're mature enough to accept responsibility for your trading, this book will give you the edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Market Maker's Edge","review":"Any of the techniques described in this book are available to anyone. However, these are tactics that are probably explained better elsewhere. I still feel those just getting started should read a book like this, but the title of this book is a misnomer. He does not provide any detail on what \\"The Market Maker's Edge\\" is. He certainly doesn't give away any secrets about what market makers do differently that gives them an advantage over the average day trader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Effective","review":"Josh will cover everything from fundamentals to technicals.

It is a great way to learn how to make profits in the market instead of giving money to the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"good primer, but buyer beware","review":"This book teaches the basics, but you never have the experience you need to be successful until you have actually done day trading. No book can teach you those hands on skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book- misleading title","review":"This is a good book if you do hot have other trading books on your shelf. Otherwise, I didn't find any other insights in this books that aren't in any others. As far as the \\"market maker's edge\\", it didn't expose very much about how market make's trade. It cover's a lot of the strategies used and covered in most good trading books, i.e. support/resistance, indicators etc. If this is the way that mm's trade - then I guess this book is accurate. But I would like to know what leads mm's to move a stock in one direction or another, how do they work in concert with each other to effect moves in a stock etc. Those insights I would find useful in my trading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading title, average book","review":"This book has absolutely nothing to do with \\"market maker's edge\\". I'm an advanced trader and would be interested to see things from a market maker's perspective. This book ended up telling me to \\"trade with the trend\\" and \\"cut my losses early\\".If you're a beginner, might be helpful. But then again, there are tons of other books that teach you the same stuff better. I recommend the book called High Probability Trading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack of all trades","review":"Covers a little bit of almost everything, but none more that scratches more than just the surface. I did find one chapter useful: the economic indicators and expected reactions of missing or exceesing estimates. Otherwise, the rest of the book covers only the most basic chart patterns, candles and indicators and will be fairly useless to most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"The MOST WORTHLESS book on investing I have ever read!","review":"One quote from the book sleeve is \\"Lukeman explains how market makers work, what they think, and where they consistently find the profit and risk protection opportunities overlooked by other trader.\\" -- A TOTAL LIE. In the 286 pages there are 'maybe' a dozen incidental references to Market Maker behavior/activities, each of 2-6 sentences in length. The treatment of ALL other aspects (e.g. TA in particular) are so superficial ... its just amazing this book could get published ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Perspective","review":"I am really enjoying this book! Learning how the Market Maker's view stock trading is giving me a new perspective on the market. Josh Lukeman's book covers the bases from Risk Control, Spotting Trends in the Market, Technical Analysis, to the Professional Trader's Psychology. I know my nose will be in this book often. Another good book which deals with the psychological aspects of trading is \\"The Tao of Trading\\" by Robert Koppel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I bought this book to write a research paper for college.

I loved the story and the characters. Logan and Zara are well-matched and interesting, and the story keeps you eager to find out if they can settle their differences. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. The sensuality is done with good taste. I read it in one sitting and hated to see it end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I like this book. The story between the hero and heroine was good. Strong conflict. If you like futuristics this is good and if you don't it's still good. There is not a lot of scientific stuff there.

It is *MUCH* smaller than I expected, and can only hold 1-2 sets of dice. I gave it to my neice, who's only got one set. The quality of the bag is GREAT, it's just really small. This is good for keeping a couple of dice for someone new to the hobby, or a special set of dice. The seller was AWESOME, so don't hesitate to buy from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember The Alamo!","review":"Let me say this: this dvd is not what most people would expect from the title at all. If you are a student of military history, forget this dvd. Less than two minutes are devoted to the actual fight. Basically, it says a young Tejano boy is asleep in the Alamo, he hears his mom shout that the Mexicans are attacking, there is some shooting and hand to hand combat, and it's over. From this dvd you would think the Mexicans attacked once, and the Alamo fell. Want to learn about Davey Crockett? He's barely even mentioned. Jim Bowie? The same. Forget about the last stand at the chapel, the line in the sand, heck it doesn't even mention Santa Anna spared the women, children, and the slaves. The reinforcements that made it to the Alamo? Not mentioned either.However, if you do want to learn a different perspective on the Alamo, this isn't a bad dvd. It focuses exclusively on the contributions of the Tejanos to the independence of Texas."},{"rating":"2","title":"An In Depth Investigation Into A Sacred Mystery","review":"Upon reading this in depth, and graphic account of the mysteries of the stigmata, I was inspired to investigate the phenomenon in a far more focused, and intelligent manner.I'll be the first to admit that in the past I viewed the stigmata as little more than a medical condition on the lesser scale, and horrid act of self-mutilation on the higher.Upon reading this book however I began to see the sacred stigmata for what it was, a miraculous, and painful test of human faith in the man known to the world as the Christ, Jesus of Nazareth. This book (set out in almost a textbook fashion) details the visions, and stimatas of a number of already well-known, and documented stigmatists such as Anne Catherine Emmerich, Padre Pio, and Saint Theresa.This book gives a detailed account of a lot of their \\"afflictions\\", etc. and is a definite must read for anyone interested in the sacred stigmata, and it's meaning for the world as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"George Russell was a jazz arranger who later got into free jazz and eletronics: check outELECTRONIC SONATA FOR SOULS LOVED BY NATURE.In 1958, though, he made this terrific album with stars like Bill Evans, Max Roach, and John Coltrane. New York New York is a swing portrait of the big apple as the jazz capitol of the world. It does include some standards, reworked by Russel, as well as his fine, progressive swing compositions.Russell is not well known, and more jazz people should get hip to George. He was flexible enough to work in many genres, experimenting liberally, as jazz grew. If Russell has a stamp, it is his work's ability to convey a sense of time, place and mood for his chosen subject.Check George Russell out. This would be a great start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Prose","review":"\\"Somebody's Daughter\\" is tremendous in its unflinching portrayal of Korea, adoption, the relationships between mothers and daughters, and the relationship to one's self. Lee's prose is gorgeous, poetic, precise, and compelling. I finished this book in one sitting and was left breathless at the end.Lee's talent as a writer is evident in all aspects of this book. Well-researched and well-rendered, \\"Somebody's Daughter\\" should be on every reader's bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to fly","review":"I don't know how I seemingly had such a different experience as the other reviewers. I'm a normal kite buyer as far as I know. I've flown kites as a kid, and I bought one to fly with my daughter. We had another older kite that broke and bought this one as a replacement, I'm no expert, but I did all the normal things one does to fly a kite, ran into the wind, had a one of us hold the kite 20 yards down wind and threw it up into the air. We've tried in low and relatively high wind conditions, and it was always easy to get started, but we were never able to get it to stay in the air. In low wind, it would just drop once you stopped running, in higher wind, it would zig and zag all over the place and eventually nose dive to the ground. Like I said, we've had fine luck with the older kite we had previously, but after 3+ tries with this one, I'm back on Amazon looking for a kite that's easier to fly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy fun","review":"My first kite - and first time flying one.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you are simply sacrificing sound quality for a novel gimmicky form factor, and at these Walmart prices it means a HUGE sacrifice in sound.I listened to one of these at a local shop and it was enough to make me cringe.Godawful!Stick to a simple 2.0 or 2.1 self-powered computer speaker system by Logitech, Altec Lansing or Klipsch from forty to a hundred and forty bucks and you'll be fine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the art?","review":"Another book that seems to carry the tag \\"the art of\\" but not have any real art.

After reading this sycophantic gloss, you'll actually feel like more of a groveling Batman groupie; Mark Cotta Vaz excels at superficialities while denying the reader true criticism. Simply, there is little understanding of the artistic mind and what we have here is nothing much more than 50 or so production pieces of art, most of which do not differ from the final product to any appreciable degree.For instance, a little foam-rubber mock-up of the Batmobile takes up an entire page. Also, Cotta Vaz thinks a quote from Nolan such as \\"Gotham City is like New York on steroids\\" is a revealing statement. I give one star for a smattering of info. regarding various props and the reasoning behind them. But even this is something akin to a DK \\"Visual Guide\\" not an exploration of a film's artistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its no episode 3 art book........","review":"I got this book expecting it to have many concept drawings such as the the star wars concept books, and with that in mind, i was throughly dissapointed to find it was nothing like that. it was more so the making of the movie and shots of car sculpts. It does have alot of info about the making of the movie, so if your into that, this book is for you, if your into concept, stay away...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. Not only does it include very few of the conceptual design artworks from the movie, some of the artworks are displayed in the whole page that you can't help but wondering, did they run out of photos, pictures when composing this book? Also, without the inclusion of the film's script (which they published as a stand-alone scriptbook) I feel like I've been ripped off my money. I hope the Art of the Dark Knight book doesn't suck like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salon quality brush!","review":"I ordered this brush (and the larger size as well) because my hair stylist uses it and I always love the way my hair feels when I leave there.

Not completely objective.","review":"This book does offer some good general information but use caution when using it to evaluate a cruise company. I admit this is a very hard thing to do... but it could have been done more objectively. Having sailed numerous cruises, I was a little shocked to find the reviews glowing on one particular cruise line. The other competing lines were being given very dry, somewhat negative reviews, instead of an accurate desciption of the ambience they deserve. Wondering why... I finally read the dedication... and may have figured it out... it is dedicated to the founder of that glowing cruise line... he died in 1999... and the author thanks him for their friendship.DO NOT use this book as the sole authority on what cruise line to sail. Talk to as many previous cruisers as you can find. Then get a travel agent that has invested some time studying the cruise industry.Cruises are wonderful... it does pay to be informed properly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No big Bang!","review":"Because of the completeness of package, e.g. selection of adapters included and more.

To my surprise, it was by almost $12 w/free shipping.It arrived and was surprisingly easy to install. The only negative and why I didn't give it the full 5-star review, was that it is significantly smaller than 4 feet. More like 3. I'm not sure what the discrepancy is, but unless they get a lot of returns on a product or complaints about the size, there really is no reason to stop selling it or change the packaging.In any event, if you are looking for this, definitely get it. There were a few cheaper ones in the used section but given the seriousness of an item like this, I didn't want to chance something that was listed as \\"like new\\".Comes with several adapters, a leak tester (which is basically a soapy solution to check for air bubbles), and the pipe sealant.

I'll give 'em an extra star for that.Now the full version of Vista that came on my new notebook computer is alright.

My soldier friends, who aren't exactly leftwingers, were so disgusted they still won't even mention W.'s name.He talks about \\"the President\\" as if the office conferred a halo on its occupant--but when he mentions Clinton, the grand dignity of the office somehow vanishes.He says \\"Fundamentalist Christians don't seek power\\"; that's a lie which can be refuted by a simple list of names: Falwell, Robertson, Graham....He asks \\"Why do they hate us?\\" and then says it's \\"irrelevant.\\" Well no, it's not irrelevant--not with Manhattan in ruinsI'm trying to believe you people have some decency in you, but it's difficult, when you swallow such obvious lies and say, \\"Delicious!\\" It's hard to believe you're being honest, when your reaction itself must be a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do \\"they\\" hate us?","review":"Read this book and then you'll know why.Bennett's basic thesis is that only the United States has the spine and integrity necessary to lead the world on a righteous, moral path. Considering this comes from a guy who has been preaching morality and virtues for well over a decade, while at the same time being in denial about a gambling addiction, would be very amusing if it weren't so pathetically sad.This is typical proto-fascist drivel designed to drive conservatives into a self-righteous frenzy to fight against and kill the terrible other. In that regard it reads quite a bit like Mein Kampf, instead this time Muslims are the enemy that need to be exterminated in a final solution.Do yourself a favor, get a brain, get a moral compass, and reject this racist trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you mean \\"We\\" Mr. Bennett.","review":"If there is one thing I can not stand it is arm-chair generals like Mr. Bennett. How goes on and on about war and his opinions about how to win a war, yet this man never served in the military. In the end, his idea of morality and war in this: I support war, just as long as I don't have to fight. Opinions like Mr. Bennett's make me think that it is time this country had national service so rantings like these would be tempered by reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember September 11!!!!!","review":"This short easy read is a great overview of the reasons why we fight this war on terrorism. Dr. Bennett has a knack for clarifying issues dealing with morals and virtue and he does it again in this book. America was brutally attacked by Islamist terrorists on its second \\"day of infamy\\" and as it did on the first one it will again rise to the occasion in defense of freedom to defeat the enemy the world over. \\"Remember September 11!\\" will become the battle cry of the Nation in the war on terror. Read this book to better understand the reasons why we fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"narrow minded dogmatisim","review":"There are a few good points made in the book. But a lot of this tome is an angry, narrow-minded diatribe against independent thinking. Yes, these so-called Muslim fundamentalists (they are terrorists, not Muslims) that attacked America are a true threat, but so are dangerous \\"intellectuals\\" like Bill Bennett who would happily trash the Constitution to get all terrorists and free-thinkers locked up, to boot. We need to work together to protect America; William Bennett\`s book shows that he has no real idea what American freedom really is, or why we fight to protect it.

The message is basically, if you love your country, agree and support what your government does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very sad","review":"Bennett's own logic undermines itself. He is in essence arguing that to be a truly patriotic American, one must check your brains in at the door and unquestioningly accept everything our government tells us.

It's time that we rediscovered that to appropriately confront those in power is true American patriotism."},{"rating":"1","title":"What drivel....","review":"Well, what can one expect from a guy who once berated a kid from a podium for wearing a Bart Simpson shirt.What I don't quite get, though, is why Bennett wrote this? Is he looking to whip the rabid conservatives into a complete frenzy by showing them the true nature of those evil lefties? Reminds me of the way terrorist leaders recruit suicide bombers.I recently discovered that Dr. Bennett got his Bachelors degree from my alma mater, Williams College. As I remember, Williams had always had a very powerful pluralistic tradition (\\"moral relativism\\", Bennett calls it). I am rather ashamed that it produced such a self-righteous, hypocritical whiner as Dr. Bennett. It also seems that English 101 wasn't quite as good back then. Otherwise, the professors might have taught Bennett that phrases like \\"superior goodness\\" and \\"fake facade\\" are not exactly the best of English.

He's just the kind of guy you expected him to be, but he's giving away scant insight into his life beyond the bare facts. There's little self-examination in these 200 pages and what little there is reads like Peter Parker thought bubbles. The \\"amazing\\" ups and downs of Stan's life seem to have caused no mental struggle or anguish and the rumours of feuds with Kirby and Ditko are dismissed in a couple of paragraphs. Apparently Stan didn't know they were upset!All in all, more a coffee table book or an extended self-promotional essay rather than a genuine autobiography."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Stan Lee, but not this...","review":"I am not a Stan-hater.

But Stan is a legend, & if his writing looks corny now, remember, he was writing primarily for 8 to 13-yr-olds, until Marvel caught on in high schools & colleges. I probably learned (or wanted to learn) to read from Stan's writing in the FF & Spider-Man. That being said, this book is soooo boring. No real details, just a vague remembrance of his life. What is not said is often more interesting to speculate on. His co-writer/editor is a relentless yes-man. No, I didn't want to hear any anti-Stan tirades, but some balance would have been nice. Quotes from his collaborators & competitors would've been good too.

First, this guide does not give any test-specific information, such as how many sections there are (2), how long the sections are (45 mins and 60 mins) or what will be on the exam (grammar then reading passages). It is merely a big book of standardized-style French questions with answers only (ie A,B,C), but no explanations of correct and incorrect responses.

I'm not sure what the capacity of the insert is - perhaps 2oz - but it's only enough to burn for about 10 minutes. It's hard to get into the romantic mood if you have to keep refilling your candle with messy, smelly lamp oil every 10 minutes.I was expecting the insert to be open at the bottom and the wick to reach the bottom of the bottle. Then I'd fill the bottle with lamp oil and my candle would burn for several hours. That's not what we're buying here.The stem part is 5\\" long.

I'm happy to add this new CD to my collection. A strong yet sensitive lyric has always been one of the hallmarks of a David Wilcox song, that and his smoky voice and confident guitar work. Heck, I guess it all comes together for greatness. On this release, check out the especially poignant and memorable \\"Deeper Still.\\" Also terrific are \\"The Whisper of the Wheels\\" and \\"This Tattoo.\\" I really love the simple sound of this entire CD -- nothing fancy, nothing over-produced, just honest emotion and melody -- the things that make music worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Elsewhere","review":"If you're looking for music from David Wilcox (the sensitive singer/songwriter from North Carolina, not the gutbucket bloozman from Canada), you should pick up 2 of the best CD's of the 90's: How Did You Find Me Here and Big Horizon. Wilcox reminds a lot of people of John Gorka but the more apt comparison is to James Taylor. The title track is about the only thing here that equals the best of those albums: an acoustic blues that showcases the singer's butterscotch vocals. \\"With your tongue in your ear you say come and I come walking/a glide in my stride/what you whispered well it keeps me satisfied.\\" Them's lyrics! On the other hand, David should stay away from overt comedy. When he's not trying to hard he can be very funny, but then there's a (rap?) song about Sex and Death which is way off the mark. He's one of the few artists that I used to buy a new release from without even listening to it. But that was then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashamed to be in the same uniform","review":"I am not sure what these soldiers were called to do. It was a difficult road, yes, but it was a war.

I walked a lot of the same dirt and endured a lot of heartbreak right along with them, but I would also give my life in a second to provide my new Iraqi friends/family with the possibilty of hope.

I can only play it after a fresh reboot because there is something wrong with the copy protection scheme. Searching the web for solutions found nothing except other people with the same problem.The other thing that has been a setback is the fact that it doesn't save my game position. To get used to the somewhat different movement used in this game, I'm practicing in the Manor, but I have to start over from scratch every time I go back. I have not yet had a big enough block of time to get through it all in one shot, but at least I'm getting used to the movement!As for the play experience, so far so good. I'm new to this type of game, so it is still challenging for me to find the keys to the next stage of play. The main reason for my low rating is the DRM problems.

If you're a grown up who, like me, thought you were buying an enjoyable game whose primary challenge is puzzle-solving, then you're screwed. The game is gorgeous, easy to learn, and easy to play. The levels and puzzles are challenging and fun. But when I came to the first BIG boss, the T-Rex, I got destroyed. And then again. And again. And on and on and on... It's one of those shooting sequences where you have to hit EXACTLY the right sequence of keys, at EXACTLY the right millisecond, and then do the whole thing over again several times. If you make the slightest mistake (there's ZERO margin of error here), you're dead, and have to start all over. After 30 or 40 tries, I said \\"screw it,\\" and packed up the game.

Hum.. some googleing and I realized that many persons were in the same case than I and that the problem has been noticed beginning of June...3 weeks later, Eidos hasn't released a patch yet!! What the heck? Their only answer for now is to overwrite a folder WHILE the game is running! Nice, I'm not playing at the same resolution than my desktop so each time I alt-tab, my icons on my Desktop are getting foobar. Moreover, their \\"solution\\" does not resolve the problem for the autosave in the manor: all the progress I made seem lost.

If she changes direction, so the the direction in which she will be sent by the WASD keys. Why anyone would decide this was a good thing, I do not know.Using the grapple hook is an exercise in frustration as the Q key sits right next to the TAB key.

Perhaps some of the concepts of persistence are missed by the first reviewer in context of .NET and certainly with the impending object-spaces microsoft technology much of this may be moot. I certainly do believe that GUI's are very much tied to the business model (ESPECIALLY in .NET apps) and I have benefited tremendously in perspective by applying the database conceptually as another view to my business model.At any rate, excellent theory and interesting approaches to implementing a persistence architecture.

The only sign from the detector was a short bleep, which I didn't think anything off until it was too late. The bottom line is that this detector does not have good long range detection, and if you do hear something chances are you've already been clocked! It is a nice detector if you want to be aware of emergency vehicles, some construction signs, and some cops with old equipment.

His choice of vocalist is not good at all, this guy just does not have the energy that I expect, most strained and unskilled.The people in the crowd seem to be dead or sleeping little wonder. the fact is I have always enjoyed Michael Schenker, but without a vocalist the caliber of Phil{UFO}Mogg. This band sinks Like a german U-boat. Even the soul felt playing of Schenker can't save this DVD from the bad sound and poor vocals. Do yourself a favor if your a UFO fan, pull out the old albums and have a listen, save your money better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I just received my copy and being a HUGE Michael Schenker fan since the 70's, I must say this is a big let down. First the sound quality is horrible, whats up with that in this day and age?? Compared to many other concert DVD's I've purchased this one by far is the worst sounding. My next nit is this: Where's Michael Schenker? The camera is shooting everyone BUT MS. Maybe a better description of this disk should be: \\"If you look close and quickly, you might notice Michael Schenker on guitar\\". I can really do without his bass player's drama and posing, obviously has some major self esteem issues. It seems to me that MS gets maybe 20/30% camera time. This is HIS concert right???They could have found a better crowd for shooting a live concert DVD, this crowd was, lets say, non existant for a better word. My advice is to save your money. I'm still a big MS fan, always will be, but this disk just does not due the man justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"I think this is quite a good dvd from MSG. Chris Logan does a suprisingly good job on covering different lead vocalists other tunes. I wasn't sure what to expect vocal wise but he does a good job covering Barden, Mogg, and Bonnett vocals. The best performance on the dvd for me is into the arena. I think it's very well done. The poorest performance is Only you can rock me. It's not a perfect dvd. The crowd isn't all that enthuastic but the performances are good for the most part. It's not the video for Strangers in the night but it's much better than a bootleg performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone fire the editor, please!!","review":"We have here 14 very good songs from MSG; we have Michale sometimes even smiling to the audience, something rare indeed; we have an amazingly skillful bass player called James Jones (I guess)... but we can not see none of this, because the edition is so blinding fast, that it is utterly annoying, and it seriously damages the hwole watching experience of this concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I gave this 4 stars and not 5 simply because there's no Mogg.

Anyhows, I saw this DVD and bought it. Big mistake! Why does Michael just stand there on the side of the stage looking like a statue. Bill Wyman mastered that. Then the camera is a mile away. Lastly the solo to \\"Rock Bottom\\" was so bad! UGGGH! Muting and turning the volume low is not how to play it! That just broke my heart and to this day I'm super pist about this crap!

Please!","review":"This CD is Well Worth the money, and Good value, But it makes quite fustrating listening: 90% Of the music is first rate, espically Nina Simones' \\"Sinnerman\\", but as previously mentioned, the CD on the whose is too short, and you're left with the impression of having read a really enjoyable book, just with about Five chapters missing. This does not spoil the overall experiance of the CD, but those tracks are obvious in their absence - It Feels like there should be more. Overall, This is not a CD worth buying if you have a tight budget, and expecting great things. If you enjoyed the film, and can spare the case - this is one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Eclectic Collection","review":"Like a few other reviewers, I agree this cd is too short!

So I kept an eye open for this CD. Finally, I found it, bought it, put it in my CD player, skipped the songs, and was shocked to see that all the terrific music I remember from the film was drained. And when there was good music, it was shortened down to about 50 seconds.Only tracks 5, 6, and 2 save this from being a total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas Crown is as smooth as silk!","review":"Right after seeing the movie, I knew I had to have this soundtrack. One of the best I've ever heard, and I never tire of hearing it- I play it so often! The music is silky smooth, and I loved Windmills, Everything, Sinnerman, and all the jazzy instrumentals. Caban is the only track I skip over, mainly because it just annoys me. I sure wish though, that I had the extended version I heard about...Because the cd doesn't have all the music from the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the movie... a very pleasant surprise.","review":"Like many others, I purchased this CD primarily for Sting's cut of Windmills but quickly found the rest of the CD enjoyable as well. It has a nice balance between Bill Conti's original score and classic tracks like Sinnerman. I recommend both the movie and CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If the songs are what you want, go ahead and buy this CD. If, on the other hand, you're after a substantial chunk of Bill Conti's original music,forget it! Go and see then film instead. They've left out all the best bits of it, most notably the music which runs from the point at which the crate enters the museum store, through the burglary and up to Crown's arrival at home with the stolen Monet. All the tracks which are included are too short and if your attention span is longer than 3 minutes, you might find this irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this music!","review":"I love this movie and love this music. I have wanted to buy the music since I first saw the movie years ago. Happy to have finally purchased it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Though missing some pieces,still worth it to me.","review":"I first saw the Thomas Crown Affair on DVD about 2002 or so. I was quite depressed at the time,and the film was a good pick-me-up. Much like Last of the Mohicans, it's one of those films where the score and music are both integral to the film,and well worth listening to on their own. The reason I'm giving it four stars (instead of five) is because--as others have noted--it's missing some pieces from the soundtrack. They should release the FULL score and people should be aware of what they are buying first,before they buy. Fortunately people can play the samples before purchasing. It is still worth my money,IMO but obviously if one of your favorite pieces are missing, then you will be understandably disappointed and should check first before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT soundtrack","review":"I agree with some other review, I wish this was longer, but what is here is really great.

The first was played during the breaking out of the horse at the beginning. The second was during the hot dance scene and the major mistake was not including the music from the love scene following the hot dance scene. Maybe a second CD is coming - we can only hope. Meanwhile - does anyone have any info on the songs above? Artist's name? Anything? Otherwise what music that is on the CD is quite good but - geez I hope that the missing songs surface somehow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Bill Conti?","review":"Yes, yes, you get to hear Sting doing an adequate cover of the famous song from the original movie, but I can hear Sting doing adequate covers any time. What drove me to want the CD was to hear more of Conti's driving score and to hear it alone without the movie -- which is very well done. You get about a minute and a half of 5 pieces here. It's hardly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cocktail party music...","review":"I had heard snips of this soundtrack at someone's patio party...thought I should have it...it is a great backdrop to a small gathering and is sure to get people talking...the music is a great pace and if you have seen the movie, it will conjure up all the scenes you love...well worth the buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thomas Crown Affair Soundtrack","review":"I could tell you that this soundtrack is the best collection of soft and smooth Jazz but too truly understand what I am talking about you shoud have a listen to the previews.

But I do have to agree with some other reviewers regarding the length of some of the tracks.The first four tracks run the 3-plus minutes (or more) that an average song runs, but all of the other sequences run one-and-a-half, to two minutes only. This is disappointing, because some of these songs are very jazz-cool (if I may sound a bit like William Gibson for a moment). I keep hitting the repeat button on my CD player because, as one of the songs suggests, one listening is never quite enough.I'm not disappointed with the purchase -- I just wish some of the songs went on a bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exotica","review":"This cd provides the most eclectic mix of jazz, carribean and european music I have ever heard.

When you find you like the CD, you will have to get the movie and vice versa. It is one of those rarities that everything fits together really well.

With only half the music, I would hope it would only be half the price. The songs at the end are good, but each is only about two minutes long. As soon as you get into the song, it's over.

Repeat that to yourself OUT LOUD, right now. \\"This is a film I need to avoid.\\" When you pass it at the video store, repeat that to yourself out loud. Don't worry if people hear you - If anything, maybe they'll get the clue and avoid it, too. If you're lucky, maybe the video store will stop carrying the film, thereby averting possible disaster for tens of people who might be tempted to rent this video and waste their precious youth watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for martial arts seekers","review":"First of all, this movie is not co-directed by yuen woo ping. Woo ping acts in this movie,and from the lack of fight scenes you can tell he didn't have anything to do with directing. Don't get me wrong though, this does have some very interesting scenes. For example, monster father and son standing on top of and controlling some airplanes. Or their complete disregard of the laws of physics. Bottom line. if you're looking for a woo ping directed martial arts masterpiece, you'll want to look elsewhere.

Tsui Hark is a good writer people,a nd you don't know satire when u see it? He takes so many elements: Sci-Fi, wacky hong kong comedy, martial arts and john woo bulletfests, and overloads them with cheesy melodrama. Peter Mak takes all these elements and weaves a lightning quick stupid movie that you can't help but like. I've read many reviews that it has underlying tones about the Chinese takeover, but that's really reading into the film too much.

Apparently Richard Skinner did not think we'd be interested in that--I read the whole book and still have no idea what country she spied for, how successful she was, or how she eventually got caught. Any time I found myself getting caught up in the story, Skinner abruptly changed narrators.

The content of some chapters had a very vague connection to the subject and were not necessary. Enough detail was not given in several chapters. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"such promise but lacked purpose","review":"This book was very exciting at first, as Skinner chose to reveal the character and life of Mata Hari through the eyes of others in her life, each chapter from the account of a different person... however he lost track from that orginal idea and once I finished the book- I didn't feel like I had learned anything about who Mata Hari was. It nearly had nothing at all to do with her. It contains some lovely character sketches but there is no story. And he gives Mata Hari absolutely no personality, even in the chapters from her own point of view. There are some interesting histories thrown in on Picasso, absinthe, and other era points of interests but they are so out-of-the-blue... I felt like at the end all this random information would somehow tie together but it never did. I wish he had had an editor who pushed him a little harder because he is a talented writer and the concept had so much potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth or fiction?","review":"This book was very disjointed. Each semi-fictional chapter about Mata Hari's life was followed by a chapter about an aspect of her times. I learned quite a bit about dowsing, the invention & use of the Zepplin balloon, the Orient Express, the roots of cubism, & the history of absinthe. Unfortunately for Skinner, I found these interspersed chapters to be much more interesting than the chapters dealing directly with his primary subject. His style of writing left me confused as to what was fiction & what was truth. In addition, the story is told from so many conflicting points of view that it is impossible to piece together a cohesive picture. Stick with the non-fiction biographies of Mata Hari for a more interesting & cohesive read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but sooooo Many Errors","review":"Yes, this book is packed full of facts and photos that will delight any Ford enthusiast and it will provide hours of interesting reading.Having said that, it is also the most poorly edited book I have ever read. Seemingly every page has numerous errors of every type. Not just simple typo's. Many pages include photos of vehicles that are mis-named or from a model year covered in another chapter (a 1974 LTD being marked as a 1973 for example). The author's spelling, grammar and syntax is poor (note to George Dammann, when making a comparison of two things, use \\"more\\" and \\"less\\", not \\"most\\" and \\"least\\").In the beginning of at least one chapter, the opening text columns are in the wrong order, making the reader sift through everything to read properly.If you can overlook all of this, the book is enjoyable.

Arthur Conan Doyle, Harry Houdini, HP Lovecraft, and Marie Leveau are part of a secret society of demon-busters dedicated to fighting incursions of the Lovecraftian mythos into our world. There are cameo appearances by famous mystics A.E Waite and Aleister Crowley. The problem is that first-time novelist Wheeler isn't really up to the task of fleshing out all of these colorful characters. Conan Doyle sort of works as a real-world incarnation of his literary creation and Houdini is not bad, but HP Lovecraft rings false as some kind of steampunk technomystic, and voodoo queen Leveau comes across surprisingly bland. There are also some serious anachronisms. At one point, Lovecraft is described as using a \\"transistorized\\" device. Transistors? In 1919?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting idea but a bad story","review":"Wheeler's attempt to cross from screen-writing to novel writing is a disappointment. He has not grasped the intricaces and nuances of the medium, instead treating it like a television project or movie. The vocabulary is limited, the intelligence of the reader is underestimated, and the characters fail to ring true. By using almost exclusivly famous names of the begining of the last century, it almost feels like an article in People magazine about \\"celebrities\\". The reader cannot really relate to these people and therefore is always left feeling on the outside. I fear this is the sad result when stale, uninspired storytelling of the visual media invades the written world. Anyone who has decried the banality of TV shows will see this in The Arcanum. Now, having said that, the story of the Book of Enoch and the Lost Tribe is an interesting concept. Given more practice, perhaps Wheeler could actually produce a decent book about it. But not this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Novel is Not Historical Fiction...","review":"I need to repeat that because it's important: This novel is not historical fiction. The characters could have been anywhere, anywhen, and the story would have been exactly the same. The setting was a matter of convenience so the author could get the players in place and move straight into the plot - which Wheeler did.This novel, despite having some amazing characters in it, isn't a character driven book. It's a story driven book, and - like the setting - I got the distinct impression that the author chose familiar personalities who not only could contribute to the plot, but who didn't require so much explanation that the book would have needed to be another 50+ pages.The story is fantastic and well-paced, and one hell of a fine read. It's not what you might expect, so leave your expectations at home and hang on for a wild ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad, Mr. Wheeler","review":"I usually love books set in this time period.

The literary lions it used as characters were woefully untrue to their realities, especially H.P. Lovecraft. Set in 1919, it references transistors, which weren't invented until 1948.

In fact, I banished it from my bookshelf. It's not that the writing style is bad, but the plot gets ridiculous with no hope of redeeming itself (unless the ending was that Lovecraft ate some bad oysters and it was all a dream fragment).I suppose you can sum up the book as \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen meets a Sunday afternoon Call of Cthulhu role-playing game scenario put on by eight graders.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Book of Acoustic Guitars","review":"There's a lot of info in this book but there's a lot that is missing or incomplete.

My only complaint is that they have yet to add many of the smaller niche guitar makers over the years and the burgeoning market in house brands is not well covered ( Airline, Supro, etc). Otherwise it has most of the information you'll ever need. Don't take the pricing as the absolute word though, the market fluctuates a lot and prices can be dramatically above or below what is quoted in this book. Use it as a baseline and you're fine, at least you'll always know if that guitar your friend or neighbor wants to sell you is junk or of some value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book","review":"I use this book along with the Blue Book of Electric Guitars from the same publisher as a reference and starting point to price vintage guitars to purchase for my collection.

One track even utilizes a stretched tape! I don't know if this was a case of the original master tapes' deterioration of if RCA used sub-masters that had been done for reissues; at any rate, you should avoid this CD like the plague and be happy that Collectors' Choice did a \\"Best-Of\\" compilation with excellent sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away","review":"i thought this would be good but wasnt sure it would work and it wasnt good and it didnt work i love metallica and im into rap but this wasnt rap just a bad singer and bad musicians stay away from this noise"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the many reasons I hate rap.","review":"How can the kid below this review say this album can be \\"great\\"?

The shrub attachment cuts small swaths (6 inch) and therefore is not recommended by me for large shrubs and bushes. I use my large gas powered trimmer for that (but that weighs a ton and is hard on your arms and shoulders), so for the occasional quick trim I use the cordless. The grass attachment works well around large plants that are not capable of withstanding a hit by my string trimmer, such as lilies and gladiolas. It works well in these situations but requires you to get on all fours to use it. The only other drawback is the run time, which is about 20-30 mins on a full charge, but that is fine with me since I only use it sparingly.

Nevertheless, a strong narrative voice and a few red herrings meant that I read the middle section of it quickly. It was just the beginning and the end that dragged when the narrator spent so much time telling me again and again that there was no murderer to catch. An effort to salvage the \\"mystery\\" of the novel via a couple of sardonic messages from the corpse to her erstwhile friend feel like a half-hearted attempt tacked on at the last minute.

Unlike Kerr's \\"Berlin Noir\\" trilogy, however, Amis' \\"Night Train\\" completely misses the mark as his plot drags, his character is unbelievable, and his attempts at American lingo and mood fail dismally. He should go back to what he's good at: modern fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amis takes you into the night, and leaves you there","review":"An incredibly weak effort from a stylist and humorist of genius, 'Night Train' simply rejigs themes and ideas found in earlier books (the musings about the relative importance of motive in police investigations are directly lifted from 'The Information') and attatches them to a cliched, uninteresting narrative. The prose is somehow both crude and over-stylized - it seems like the work of a pop-song lyricist rather than a crime novelist (or a literary novelist) - and the extraordinarily bleak resolution really is very hard to swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant language, but where's the finale?","review":"Having been bowled over by Time's Arrow I don't side with those who say Amis is all virtuosity, but no heart. Night Train doesn't help my stance, though. Here, again, the sheer craft is fantastic, language stronger than NYPD Blue's and a character who is certainly more meat-and-bones than Patricia Cornwell's 'pop-open-the-chablis' doctors, and yet I missed something badly. Kept re-reading the last three pages to find the clue I missed. Apparently there isn't one. Apparently you can shoot yourself in the mouth three times.

Amis has created an urban nightmare in a generic metropolis, filled with what would be considered B-movie characters under a less proficient linguist; however these people grab your interest from page one and don't let go until well after the haunting climax.I highly recommend this book and would hope Mr. Amis is considering a sequel in the same vein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of his better efforts","review":"Amis is one of my favorite authors, so I was disappointed with Night Train. It's nowhere near as good as The Information or London Fields. It's awfully jarring when the American protagonist uses British expressions--Americans put angels on the top of the Christmas tree, not fairies, for instance. As an American woman, I don't find Mike Houlihan realistic. Amis should stick with clever British males, because nobody does that better."},{"rating":"2","title":"marty does it again","review":"this book is more a philosophical inquiry into human existence than it is a detective novel. try to seek out Janis Bellow's \\"review\\" on Night Train - you will be illuminated by her insight: the complexity of Amis' playing field (both of style and theme) here.p.s. linda hamilton's reading is superb! her audio version of the book foreshadows a great screenplay (possibly a movie deal?) for night train."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"Short and sour, this is a story of an unconvincing suicide mystery investigated by an unconvincing woman \\"police\\" in an unconvincing Chicago.

What a disappointment! A good beginning slows to a slow crawl, and the ending would be a welcome finish to the whole sad mystery, except that apparently even the author could not figure out what happened to the victim, and so sort of mumbled the ending in a pretentious manner, no doubt hoping that the reader would be fooled into believing that the ending was just too clever.

I admired his writing, and I enjoyed it. I can't always say this. Still, Amis needs a briefing on lithium and manic depression--he must have picked up some shallow facts from his PDR or talk shows. This part did not ring true. In the end, the problem is not whether Jennifer killed herself, but why she did. I'm generally good at playing CLUE, but where are the clues? I don't get it--does anyone?

If she's supposed to be both, it didn't convince me. These inconsistencies are found throughout the book. At first the odd feel of the character intrigued me, but then I just started to be annoyed by her. The plot, dealing with a suicide investigation that Mike has a personal connection to,leads to an unsatisfactory conclusion.

The book dishes out philosophical questions and insights with such force (and much of the writing is good enough to be forceful) that you find yourself looking for something deeper which just isn't there.Really, the most interesting (and humorous) aspect of the novel is its ridiculous attempt to take on the voice of a female, American cop. She seems to have a much better fix on Anglican culture. The grasp of what is America, from our slang to our national mindset, is so incredibly bad, that I had to wonder if it is intentional...kind of joke. But again, I think I'm probably looking for more than what is really there.For a wickedly funny book that lacks all the pretense, has actually a lot more to say, and is knowledgable (and immersive) in its presentation of modern America, _Florida Roadkill_ by Tim Dorsey is very much worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent read","review":"I bought this book at an author signing in Palm Beach on Friday.

They all refer to \\"nazis, Rastas, apolitically uncorrect doctor\\" and use the same metaphors--roller-coaster rides. I found a copy and could not believe the Australians were publishing such trash.

Whether this keeps you awake all night or puts you to sleep, you'll have a hangover and a need to swallow more of Dr. Greenwald's potent passion potion."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Hell is Going on Here?","review":"Many months back, when I was on a brief trip to Florida, I naturally checked the local bookstore, part of a chain. To my surprise, there was a large pile of this book, with the apparent author accosting everyone who came near his card table and telling them this was the best read since the late E.A. Poe. Once I had paid for it, he cheerfully inscribed the cover with an illegible scrawl. I tossed it into my bag, where it sat for almost a year before I noticed it. After 40 pages, I could not believe my eyes. The plot, characters, dialogue, atmosphere were so fraudulent that this must have been a vanity publication out of far-away Australia. A new wrinkle from a would-be writer whose only book stinks. After reading these reviews, I agree with others who said that all of the complimentary ones contain the same wording, obviously sent out by the author. Phooey! END"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Spear A Dull Instrument","review":"After reading it I wonder if I read the same book that others talked about. This is one of those novels that is so bad, you end up reading it just to find out how it ends: One dimensional characters, pseudo-science, the usual Nazi occult conspiracy, a plot that gets sillier by the moment --- hell, even the Hell's Angels are in this one --- and a entirely predictable ending. In other words, Young Frankenstein meets Jane Fonda meets Austin Powers. Ironically, Mr. Greenwald writes well enough to keep the pages turning but I ended up finishing the book for the wrong reasons. Something like reading a comic book for the art. If World War II genre is what you like I would suggest John Katzenbach (Shadow Man), Loup Durand (Daddy), and anything by Alan Furst (but especially The Polish Officer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay.","review":"It was interesting how the spear works and how it got into the hands of the Germans.

I'm not a fusion junkie, but I enjoy it occasionally. This is not one of those times.

A company called entel in europe makes the same radio today only in europe. It is called the eurowave and operates on the licence free pmr446 frequencies. When the radio arrived it would not turn on. Since there was no possibility of warranty I took the radio apart and discovered that the battery contacts were not installed properly. Now it works fine. The radios is constructed well and audio is clear. I like the small size. On the downside it used AAA batteries which do not last as long as the AA batteries. I use rechargeable AAA nimh batteries which work fine. All around great radio...too bad it is no longer manufactured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Worst investment ever.

It's a real guy teaching you what he knows in the best way he can, which is refreshing and authentic. I own almost the whole set now, and I am not disappointed. One of the advantages of this series is that you can go through it in small steps and review the previous material. The last 10-15 minutes of this DVD provide some of the most insightful teachings on magic and the craft that I've seen anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Change","review":"This was my first real purchase for Headphones outside of the Walmart shelf-type, I have been using the Sony MDR-G42LP, which would give me a headache and hurt my ears after wearing for a couple of hours. Using the Panasonic they are very comfortable and the sound is incredible for the $40 price, when I first started searching I knew I would be spending around $60 or more, and then came across these. The optional extension cord gives me a lot of freedom to move around and not worry about jerking the cord out of its socket, the cord is thick and seems unlikely to snap or short circuit easily. As Opera Buff said there is a little too much Bass, and I also noticed a tiny bit of static when I am listening online, which is the only thing keeping me from giving it at 5/5. But overall I really enjoy these headphones and look forward to having them work for more then 6 months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cans","review":"I picked these up a year ago and was so impressed with them I picked up another set just in case.

If you plan on getting a pair do no buy them here on Amazon at the $89.99 price as they are trying to rob you. It may sound like a much more expensive set of phones but that doesn't mean you need to get robbed by a seller, and it is not being sold by Amazon themselves.

There are lots of illustrations, although the quality of some of the pictures is lacking.If you're a cook or someone looking into healthier eating, it may not be exactly what you're looking for. There are a couple dozen recipes at the back of the book, but explanation on ancient food techniques related to the recipes leaves you wanting more information.If you're just curious and interested in the way the Old World esteemed and prepared food this is probably just the book for you.

Nothing has been changed, except the elimination of surface noise. Listen to the riffs as they were laid down here, before they were imitated into rock cliches. Was Green imitating the great Chicago bluesmen? Of course, but he listened more effectively than most. A raw, beautiful album that has engendered decades of debate as to how he got that tone from his instrument."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AUDIO SURPRISE!","review":"What fun to finally have a superior CD stereo remaster of the Epic album of \\"English Rose\\" by Fleetwood Mac in Sony's new Blu-Spec CD mastering format! This is not another format to worry about. It's a new improved mastering system for the standard 44.1 compact disc format utilizing Blu-ray technology for the digital mastering process. I have found the sound \\"warmer\\" and having a nice firm bottom end on many of the Blu-Spec discs I have auditioned compared to previous CD incarnations. This particular album by the original Fleetwood Mac, with Peter Green, has never sounded better in any format! At this time these discs are limited editions and only released in Japan. I don't know when and if Sony will make this or any other Blu-Spec CDs available in the US. Get it while you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality and excellent price","review":"I bought this for my wife and she loves it.

I've seen the dress in person and it TRULY is BREATHTAKINGLY stunning! The lace, alone, in this modern age (although no longer available) would be over $10K ALONE! I plan to copy some of Grace's elegance in my very own wedding...a Rose Point Lace garter, the beautiful Juliet Cap...all I can say is this: It's not a Grace Kelly Bio--this is strictly dedicated to the dress and it's making: fabrics and laces used and how they were all put together. Truly and informative book besides being a wonderful reference as well as a Keepsake. At LEAST 5 stars on this. Check it out..you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a good book about princess Grace wedding","review":"i think this book does not give us a different view about Grace Kelly. It is only a book related to the wedding dress and some miscelaneous comentaries about her life. You can find some good photos about Grace, but nothing else. If you are a great Grace fan like me, perhaps you would like to buy next book about Grace : Grace Kelly, a life in pictures, by Pierre Henry Verlhac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitchin Trance","review":"This is probably my favorite trance CD of last year.

Our humble prof has culled scant evidence from a few scratchy glyphs on a Roman coin that's more aerugo than coin and subsequently woven a richly detailed tapestry of arguments and counter-arguments. Were the author as knowledgeable in ancient numismatics (not to mention, ancient astrology) as one is led to believe, he would require a whole lot more than a ram with a vague star over one shoulder to construct so detailed an argument. What we have here is truly a silk purse woven from a sow's ear. Now, pray tell, what will the Dr. Molnar make from Mme. Hog's other ear?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not engaging","review":"It is of course interesting to wonder what might have been the astronomical event that was interpreted as the Star of Bethlehem.

They fit fine into my regular pinch-pleated drapes.This product was a good choice for me.October, 2012 edit: I wanted to say that the pins did not hold up very well over time. Part of the blame may well be with the type of drapes (rather heavy) and their condition (poor).

In the next chapter, it will continue to talk about the already deceased ruler, and what he did 20 years prior. If you can handle this, order away.

I expected to discover a wonderful family experience of four people locked for days in a car; I really wanted to know these people. I expected an enjoyable trip. Instead, Mr. Sullivan gave me a synopsis of every book he'd read about Lewis and Clark, and more trivia than I wanted to know. This author even turned a brother/sister backseat conversation about Barbie into a mindboggling trivia fact sheet. Mr. Sullivan, I wanted to know you and your family; instead, I'm afraid I learned only about you.

I love books about cross-country travel, but this one had so much of what I considered just \\"padding\\" to fill pages. There were a few gems in the book, but not enough for me to recommend it to someone.

The book represents a great concept poorly executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"When I began the book, I didn't like it. I didn't care about Lewis and Clark and their expedition. Then I thought, give it a chance. I believe everyone and everything deserves a second chance. Boy, am I glad that I did! I absolutely loved it! I hated that it ended. I did learn a thing or two about our interstate system, and this spectacular country of ours. I wish it never ended.

Instead I found myself wading through details too personal to empathise with (why should I care that Multnomah Falls is special to you because you once met a woman in an New York elevator wearing a Multnomah Falls belt?), underwritten by endless references to Lewis & Clark (if I'm as interested in them as you assume, wouldn't The Journals of Lewis & Clark be a better purchase?).Yes, driving for miles on road trips can be dull, but there's an art to reflecting that in an interesting way that engages the reader. Like the reviewer above notes, it's as boring as watching someone else's home movies, and indeed as annoying as a road trip that gets off at every exit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to quit reading it","review":"I very rarely quit a book without finishing, but this one I did. Not only is it edited very poorly, with many irritating misspellings and words out of place, but the author mixes up names of towns and cities. This leads me to believe he didn't ever really know where he was or what he was doing. For instance, he seems to have difficulty determining which Dakota he is in at any given time. He also drives alot from Indiana into Missouri, mysteriously tele-transporting himself over Illinois somehow. I'm sure there were many other mistakes I could have caught if I had actually finished the book. But the worst is the author seems to be the type of person you would never want to go on a road trip with, too boring, not a fun family, not a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross Country","review":"The author jumped around too much in his narrative.

The author packs his family into a rented car and drives across the continent while musing about the history of American roadtrips, starting with Louis and Clark and ending with his own. Unfortunately, it's quite a rambling book, and it would be hard to imagine anyone but a well-known writer being able to pass this off to a publisher. Frankly, most travel blogs are better written than this. Still, there's a lot of interesting trivia that he spouts while driving his family (and readers) batty with his incessent ramblings about spilt coffee and other things too minor to warrent writing a book about.

I read the chapter 3 times to make sure I did not miss what they were talking about. And needless to say I did not skip a beat. They simply did not explain what they were quizing you on. I know a little about computer repairs. If you are an expeinced computer technincion this book might be ok for you because you could pick up on the mistakes.

I ordered a 1/2 size larger than her shoe size (they fit perfect but to make it threw the whole year I think a full size larger would have been better) The full suade sole is nice and soft for a good movement of the childs foot. The liner with leather upper gives perfect breathing for a child that might have sweaty feet when they dance or run around in these shoes. The thing that was the final decision for us getting this spicific shoe is that around the top is elastic instead of a string so that if it is a little big or whatever it will fit and hug the top of her foot.We love this little shoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"My son received this for his birthday just a few weeks ago.

However, the book was so shallow that it couldnt even hold my interest long enough to finish it within 9 hours. Another reviewer hit it on the head regarding the 2-dimensionalism of the characters.Shadow (the female lead) still pines away for her first love. However, the author doesnt provide any character or past detail to make this even remotely believable. Therefore, his role as an antagonist or heartfelt love is zero.Also, with this book you have to pay real close attention. Major story elements for which one would normally expect the book to elaborate on does not happen. Some examples are Shadows capture, her past with her father, her relationship with her sisters etc. etc..The author takes more time with secondary chacter relationships which are not interesting enough to be worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a western, just another romance novel","review":"I was disappointed when I found this was just a romance novel dressed up in Western clothing.

This is the type of book that makes me ashamed to read Romance. I didn't even finish it. The heroine's kidapping situation and treatment were completely implausible. The hero's bizaare infatuation/love for this woman was unfounded and made him, pretty much a weirdo in my opinion.

The card that was sent was white and clearly stated a slower (by half) write speed. If you look at the picture above, the card is black and states 15 MB/s. In the Sandisk specifications this is for both read and write. The card that was sent clearly stated 15 R MB/s and 7 W MB/s. Sorry, that's not the same card. I sent it back and Amazon was quick and responsive as usual. After a refund they recommended I order another card at the same price and a different vendor. They even covered faster shipping for me.

And, after most of them: This transaction is now closed; please fill out our customer satisfaction survey. Either the staff can't read idiomatic English or they just don't care.

(Directions have detailed warning) I used a spray bottle with one capful of baby shampoo and tap water to apply and clean it. Used coffee filters as lint-free cloths as per the directions.

I always had people asking me for the time at the Fire Academy hoping the day was almost over! I figured during this time I would break it or from my sweat, water or any grueling drill they put us through it would get ruined. Well I have gone through fire one and fire 2 wearing this watch and the both of us have still survived! I gave it a good test,that is for sure.

There is a lot of great and original music out there, and this album is not part of that group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"First off, I found that this VCR offers a very extensive array of features. The only things that it lacks are a clock on the front display and VCR+ programming. Other than that it is great. Good picture and sound, with a nicely arranged remote. Also provides great quality for recording. Overall, if you're looking for a good second VCR, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give this one star only because I have to.","review":"While this book had cute pictures, that's about the ONLY thing it had going for it. The book sounded much too mechanical to be enjoyed and it didn't, in any way, capture the true essence of the movie. I don't recommend buying this to read for a small child because it will be a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"How badly written can a book be?","review":"This book is so badly written it is unbelievable! How could any publisher allow this book to be published? Didn't an editor review it? Didn't Disney hire an accomplished writer? Disney should be ashamed of itself for publishing so lousy a book. Especially when the movie was so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the movie instead","review":"I have absolutely nothing against Disney. The movie with this title was funny and fabulous.The illustrations appear to be taken directly from movie stills. This is okay in itself, as the movie was visually appealing. The prose, if it could be called that, appeared to be lifted directly from a script synopsis; a very bad idea. Imagine a lackluster, deadpan play-by-play of every sequence in a film read back to you by someone with all the imagination of a court stenographer. I guarantee you will be as bored reading this to your child as your child will be hearing it.If you, too are of the opinion that children's books should be not only visually appealing but stimulate interest, imagination and language skills, then this is one to pass up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pictures, otherwise very dull","review":"My daughter loves Lilo and Stitch. I should have read this book before purchasing it. The movie can get away with some complicated ideas as it is narrated after all. The book tries to hit the high points, which could really confuse a child. My daughter knows the story and she kept asking \\"where's so and so?\\" or \\"what happened to...?\\". So I basically use the pictures and tell the story in my own words. Then again, if I bought a book, I shouldn't have to do that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great metal disc!!!","review":"An underated classic. This is a great metal record from 1983.

In both cases the problem was exactly the same - uncontrollable, LOUD, persistent static from the right speaker. As soon as they were turned on it began, like the static between AM radio stations. Sometimes it would pass after a while, but any attempt to adjust the volume only made it worse. It was so loud and so bothersome that the kids usually chose to play their games with the speakers turned off. After complaining, I got two replacement sets from the dealer but the problem was exactly the same. Even on the very rare occasion that they functioned properly, the sound quality was mediocre at best. What can you say about a product when four out of four sets fail? Don't buy them!!! In the end I threw them away and went with Creative SBS 380's on both computers (which sound terrific, btw)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great book!","review":"The Wreckers begins with 14 year-old John Spencer when he is with his father on the ship THE ISLE OF THE SKYE.

John and his dad are on cargo ship to take wine to another place to trade. There was a storm and the crew saw some lights. They thought they were leading them to safety but once they went to the lights, the ship became wrecked...I liked the books suspense.

It's about a teenage boy who is supposedly the only survivor of a wreck, and finds himself in a village of \\"wreckers.\\" However, he soon finds that not everything is as it seems, and knowing who to trust and who to fear becomes vital for him as he learns more and more about the history and rituals of the village. I found that the hardest thing about reading this book was not the \\"nautical\\" terms, as many think, but not cheating by skipping to the end of the book! It is most certainly a mystery, but delightfully it also has the ever-present elements of action, adventure, mythology, and historical fiction. My only complaint is that it tends to either drag or go a bit quicker than it might. But I do, however, stress that this is not a reason to put down the book and forget about it...everything eventually comes beautifully together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wreckers","review":"This review is about the book \\"The Wreckers\\".

It does a wonderful job, and it is very easy to empty the bag. It is also light and handy to grab at any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly powerful lightweight vacuum","review":"I bought this product because I wanted a lightweight vacuum for in-between cleaning with my cannister. I was surprised by the power and cleaning ability of this small vacuum. I have two cats and this machine picked up more hair, etc than my cannister cleaner. The motorized brush is as good as any other I've used. The head is smaller than a full sized vacuum and of course it doen't hold as much dirt in its cup, but it still does the job very well and you don't have to lug a heavy cannister up and down the stairs. Only have it for a short time, but I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty neat Lil' vacuum!!","review":"I bought this to vacuum the kitchen, bathrooms, and touch-up the carpet between heavy duty vacuuming with the Kirby. It works for this for sure! The handle feels rickety but it is functional. The handle is a little loose so you can pop off the handle to use it as a hand vac, which works really nice. I wouldn't rely on it to clean carpet as the sole mode of cleaning but for hardwoods or vinyl it's awesome!You can keep both batteries charged since the charging base will allow that BUT if you only need to use it for 15 minutes or so I RECOMMEND keeping one without a charge since in the manual it says a battery will eventually not charge and you just BUY ANOTHER ONE. No. I wouldn't. That way you already have a spare battery. But it depends on your needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka Cordless Vacuum","review":"I don't know how I made it before having this awesome cordless vacuum.

At the beginning it was great, but when I cleaned the whole house I had to recharge it in the middle of my cleaning. Also, even if you use it with the cord it won't work properly, it really needs to recharge for another hour or so. After the first year it would spill out the dirt on the carpet in the middle of my cleaning. I kept it clean but still it would spill out things, especially when you sit it to recharge. Concluding, it didn't work that well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T DO IT!","review":"I though the shark was lousey! Boy do I miss my lousey shark. This thing went over the same cheerio 5 times until it just shredded it up and spew it in 100 tiny pieces all over the floor. We tried it on carpet and hardwood.

No wonder it is half price on Amazon. Hopefully, it's discontinued."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BEST BUY","review":"WITH TWO DOGS AND DOG HAIR EVERYWHERE IN THE HOUSE, THIS GREAT LITTLE SWEEPER IS THE BEST PURCHASE WE EVER MADE.

I decided to splurge and bought a $100 Electrolux Pronto cordless vac. It did well on hardwood floor, but could not pick up in the grout lines of tile, and I couldn't even get it to roll on any type of carpet. I returned it and bought the Eureka 96D for $30 instead!It has even better pick-up then my previous one. The very best feature, for me, is that it can go from hardwood to tile to carpet so easliy. It picks up fairly large pieces in the kitchen, including wheaties. I use it for touch-ups on carpet, in between deep cleaning.I have recommended these Eureka cordless vacs to friends and family and will continue to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing suction","review":"It blows.

It isn't. It's almost useless. We've boxed it up and are giving it away.Pros: light weight, two batter packs, easy to assemble, certainly picks up pretzel size and weight particles.Cons: Leaves behind lost of particles and all dust. Picks up even less if the particles are next to a wall.Will post a video if I can work it out. There's one spot along the baseboard of our entry doorway that collects larger dirty/paint/rock particles as shoes pass over it. The vacuum couldn't get one single particle up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cordless vacuum!","review":"I bought this cordless vacuum (Eureka 96 D, newer version)a couple months ago and I love it! the suction is good and it's very light weight(looks good too!). I have a 4yr old at home and there is always crumbs of everything on my tile floors and this little vacuum does a great job picking it all up. It also works good on carpets (not as great as your original powered vacuum) but its great for quick pickups and it definetly replaces a broom!... by the way I gave it 4 stars because, even though it's a good vacuum, It wont go underneath furniture too low to the floor, like the swivel sweeper, (but the swivel I will never buy again because I had to replace it twice, so dont buy it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for small pick-ups","review":"I would not make this my only vacuum cleaner (unless I lived in a New York City apartment) but it is great to use for quick clean-ups.
