Some of the December nights dipped below freezing and I was glad I had the plants in their little greenhouses.

She grows a huge garden each year, so this was great for her. I could see it being an issue if you live in a windy area, but she has a sunporch patio area, so that won't be a problem for her.

He suggests early on that readers mark up the margins or keep a journal - good advice! I kept a list of pointers as I read to prioritize later. The author notes astutely that no lawyer is likely to do a full practice makeover, but anyone can read this book and come away with 3-4 things they can do immediately, at little or no expense, to improve their practice. By incorporating Riskin's suggestions, in manageable chunks of 3-4 at a time, any lawyer can expand their practice and (best of all) make their practice more satisfying.

Whether Mary Ramsey can \\"belt one out\\" doesn't matter. She has a beautiful voice and is a talented instrumentalist, and the songs on this album are fun and at times moving. This was my introduction to the Maniacs (I'd heard one song with Merchant and don't enjoy moody, somber, and flat), and it's enough to keep me listening. My favorite songs off this album are the upbeat \\"Rainy Day\\" and the lyrical \\"Across the Fields.\\" My only complaint is \\"Shining Light\\" is a little sappy. But all in all, this is a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"New album, modified lineup, can't bring it home.","review":"10,000 Maniacs first album with new singer Mary Ramsey is listenable and promising. But as a stand-alone effort it falls short of the Maniac standard set with Natalie Merchant. All the songs have catchy intros, but instead of building and climaxing they wilt and die. Even the perky cover of Roxy Music's \\"More Than This\\" tapers off after teasing the listener for a minute or so. This new incarnation, like many of their songs, show signs of promise. The question is can Mary Ramsey learn to express herself as a singer/lyric writer a bit more deeply and sustainably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try!","review":"After Natalie Merchant left the 10,000 Maniacs, the band was destined to die. Mary does a good job of trying to sing like Natalie, but she just doesn't cut it. Nice try, but they all might be better off going solo like Natalie did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Natalie Merchant may have been the lyrical muse of 10,000 Maniacs, but this album (and Merchant's solo works) show that the compositional genius rested with Buck et al. I bought this album on a whim, not having heard any of it, and I was very plesantly surprised. Even without Merchant's distinctive voice this is very definitely a 10,000 Maniacs album, with all the distinctive melodies and arrangements we expect from the band. It's a pity that the reformed Maniacs haven't gotten the same press that Merchant has, as I think their post-breakup musical output has, in general, been superior to hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing without Natalie!!","review":"These guys are nothing without Natalie. Sorry guys, but Nat wrote practically all the good hits you had, she had the chrisma, she was the band. Mary you're good, but you are not a Maniac. This band should have changed their name after Natalie left because this new sound does not compete with the original sound. Its like the way it is when you drink diet soda, the sugar is missing. Well Natalie is missing and it just is not nor will it ever compare to the original sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"one should only purchase the CD 'Used.'\\"Ruins\\" is lacking!

Really Weak","review":"A fine effort by the band but the lack of a strong vocalist puts this CD on the shelf. Mary couldn't \\"belt one out\\" if she had to. Every time I listen to the CD, I imagine how good it could be with a strong female front- i.e. Eliz Elmore and you know who!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All 10,000 Mainiacs are DEAD","review":"How the mighty have fallen. The loss of Natalie Merchant has sucked the life out of a great band. The 10,000 Maniacs have gone from a powerful, poetic rock band to a sleepy, elevator-music band. The songs are forgettable, tired, and all sound the same. While I will cut the band some slack because it is their first effort, this is NOT an encouraging sign for the future of a band that produced such amazing work on albums like _In My Tribe_ and _Our Time in Eden_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just close your eyes and listen...","review":"Yes, Natalie is gone. No, 10,000 Maniacs did not go out with her. This album is indicative of a band searching for a new identity since the departure of their high-profile lead singer. I really like the identity they've chosen. If you are doubting that the band has any good left, listen to Across the Fields, Even With My Eyes Closed, and More Than This. They are as good as any of the Maniacs' former singles. This album is truly a beautiful masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Natalie who?","review":"I'm soooo sick and tired of the comparison of Mary Ramsey to Natalie Merchant. Mary's cover of Roxy Music's classic \\"More Than This\\" is, quite simply, beautiful. She does it in her own simple, smooth, and sultry style. As a matter of fact, her version was the first I'd ever heard of this peerless and dreamy song. Roxy Music's original will always be the best, but the 10,000 Maniacs version stands tall in its own right, too. Hey, there's a reason this song was such a popular radio play in the late 90's.There's no need to be so harsh on Mary Ramsey's singing talents ... besides, most of her critics wish they could sing half as well as she can! So, enjoy this song and the album for what it is, a nice work from a talented group of musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Among the Ruins","review":"It's no accident that the band titled the album \\"Love Among the Ruins,\\" as replacing a lead singer is not always an easy task, especially after two of the band's highest selling albums. However, Mary Ramsey stepped in and far exceeded expectations. The band's cover of \\"More Than This\\" was the highest selling single in their career, as well as in the catalog of Geffen, and the opening track \\"Rainy Day\\" is agruably one of the best songs the band has ever written. It's a shame that the band was overshadowed by their former lead singer, as this album proves the talent remained in the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad bad","review":"Movie is horrible bad acting bad effects is just sooo bad it will put you to sleep...I love how low budget movies drop the boom mike in the picture...the only bright spot is the beatuiful jackey hall ."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it.","review":"There's nothing I can say except I wish I could give it no stars.

This movie make Return To Sleepaway Camp look like a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Awful! The picture quality is third generation VHS at best. How can Amazon.com pawn this junk off on people. The only survivors are the people who get through this dreck. The picture quality is so fuzzy, it's headache inducing. Also, because it's a cheaper Dvd-R, anytime the camera moves, the picture pixelates and tiles. If you just have to see the \\"lost footage\\", buy the old Anchor Bay box set as it is included on a fourth disc inserted into the set. The Sleepaway.com website says this was a \\"Labor of love\\". If it's love, then Ike Turner edited it, and is forcing you as Tina the viewer to watch it. Horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I am a huge fan of the Sleepaway camp series and rushed to order this when it first came out. I immediatly started watching it as soon as it arrived. Within the first three minutes, I knew that I was in for a long ride. The video quality is horrible for a DVD release. The Anchor Bay releases of the first three films are far superior in every aspect. This is basically a compilation of scenes from the first three films. Again, the video quality is very poor. The audio quality is just as bad. the new scenes add nothing to the plot and are not worth the time we waited to see them. There is a reason that the orignal Sleepaway Camp 4: The Survior footage was disgarded, because it is awful. As a fan, I feel that I must watch this at least once in cannon with the series. I cannot recommend it past one viewing though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great quality video","review":"Awful movie would not recommend!

It is really great book! Actually it describes all steps how to become a graphic designer: with which software you should be familiar,which skills you should have, which schools are good at this major. A pretty big part of the book is devoted to the career opportunities: props and cons of being a freelancer or salary paid designer, which companies are interested in qualified graphic designers and what should graphic designer expect after graduation. In the end, book tells a little bit about the future of this perspective major."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving it.","review":"I am very happy with the book and am loving it.

The rest of the Balkans are completely not in there.Also, it would be nice to put Greece in the Eastern Europe book as well as the western. I know it isn't thought of as Eastern, but the Geography kind of makes it a good place to visit while going through the Balkans.P.S. Prague is NOT a trainwreck!!!

(It was approx $55 when I ordered a few months ago) I first attached the straps cause I've never worn a strapless dress. The 2nd time I dared to wear it strapless (check out the transparent bra straps and bodytape that sells on Amazon). I thought strapless dresses only looked good on broad/straight shoulders, but this dress looked good on me and I developed a better body image. Mine is the XL size and yea, I can't hide all my weight (that's unrealistic) but it makes me look much slimmer and beautiful. I'm getting the pink one now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous and fitting","review":"The shipping was fast, and the dress was true to size. It fit perfectly.

This book just doesn't have the same feel as some of his earlier books. In this one, I had a hard time liking Spenser. He has a drinking problem. He's no longer just a gormet. He's a glutton. Finally, Spenser feels a little better, but only after a short visit with his girlfriend. Give me a break! By the way, Susan (his girlfriend) was a pretty shallow character in this novel.The weak plot isn't anything we really care about, even though it's supposed to involve some pretty steamy stuff. Instead, it's about some pathetic, unlikeable people who do stupid things---not very exciting. Luckily, it's a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting hooked on Spenser","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio cassette of this book, while traveling around town. I prefer not to get the condensed versions of the books where you miss the development of the story and characters and get only the basics. While this book did get a little too sentimental, I have to say that it was for the better. To get the insight into Spenser and how he feels in lieu of always getting the stony detective that defeats all his enemies and solves the crime was interesting. I thought the story itself was intriguing. Okay it wasn't as complicated as plots can be, but I definitely didn't find my interest wandering. I have read one Spenser book and listened to a couple of others on tape, and I have to say that this book will keep me going. If you haven't read or listened to a Spenser book before I do not feel that you will be lost out jumping into this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Recordings","review":"Bruno Hoffmann gives a great performance in this album.

But it was getting annoying continuously filling up the water tank. So purchasing the extra-large water tank was the perfect answer! Now we can brew a few delicious cups of coffee before filling the tank up again. Caution: it's rather easy to break the water seal and have a leakage.

Some of the information is obvious (the Bible is ancient), yet the author coveys it in a meaningful way (therefore, it is good to read it more slowly than we would read a modern novel). (Those are not quotes, but paraphrases.) This book gives: practical information for navigating through the Bible, explains the similarities and differences of the 66 books of the Bible (there is a reason the books are in that particular order!), and gives an overview of each book of the Bible in easy to understand, conversational style.

I had the original Stanley for years but having to take the handle apart to change blades is time consuming and the blade was never rigid enough. This tool is larger but that is OK for me as I think I have better control;. It is also heavier but at the same time feels substantial in your hand. Best of all it works, blade pops right out and retract easily. If you want to just flip the blade end for end that works smoothly too. I did lubricate it with 3 in one when I got it because of other reviews. I may order a few more for gifts so mine doesn't \\"disappear\\"!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife!","review":"After loosing my Stanley utility knife, I found this while surfing around Amazon and decided to give it a shot since the price was reasonable.

The blade is easily extended by squeezing the grip and retracts in a snap using a button on the side of the knife. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"I was a bit skeptical upon buying this, because of the spring loaded button that retracts the blade...and at first i thought the knife was great. however, i am a carpenter, and i use this very frequently every day, and have been for 3 weeks, and its already starting to not retract the blade fully when pressing this little button. it seems it is not very durable, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product. Great design.","review":"This heck of a tool is an incredible time saver for drywall installation. I can have a fresh blade with a click of a button. The knife is also hefty in your hand and very comfortable to hold.

I would give it six stars if it was Made, IN the USA instead of Taiwan. But it seems to be a quality tool nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"All it needs is some WD-40!","review":"I bought this knife three weeks ago and it was a perfect fit in my hands, but after a day of using it, it began to get too much friction to close all the way.

We use them every day, but not all day and not hard. It is a great knife from comfort and ease of use. I like the easy retract button and a simple squeeze to extend. The autoload functioning of the new blade is great.But at the price, you go through them too fast. The mechanism for extending and retracting wears out pretty quickly. The mechanism get sticky to the point of becoming non-functional. Have tried making sure was lubricated and all that. No difference.It really is too bad that the feature that sets this knife apart from the field fails so quickly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolest cutter knife EVER!","review":"This is the coolest cutter knife I've ever used. It is fairly compact, fits my hand well and the push lever to open the knife is set at just the right angle for me, with the pressure needed to extend the blade hard enough so a child couldn't open it, but an adult can. The BEST FEATURE is that the knife blade slips back into the knife and is hidden away when you let go of the lever, making it the safest cutter ever. I bought two more of these knives for family because it is such a great invention. This knife really is a step ahead of the rest of the cutter knives on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hnady Tool","review":"I use this for cutting up boxes while working at the local library. I like the large handle. Some of the 'ordinary' cutters I have used tend to stick when sliding the blade in and out. As a result, I often leave the blade exposed when not using the knife. This one works easily, so I am more likely to retract the blade before setting it down.Changing blades is quick and easy.

I fidget with mine all the time: open, close, open, close... I thought I would have broken it by now if it were built poorly, but it is holding up great.

It barely functioned to hold the bottles of wine as touted, and I found it hard to bother with something so small just to hold a few bottles.

Guess what--there's zero information about the Hemingway haunting in this book! In addition, old Ataulfo of Madrid has less words wasted on him than an asthmatic's version of Handel's Halleluja Chorus. Instead, what's offered here is a rehash of old stories (and old theories about what ghosts could be) with insipid, comic book illustrations. Why this is called a \\"field guide\\" with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon--be it birds, plants, or mushrooms--is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists.

The time might have been ripe, but the music and the creativity were all too green. The lyrics were trite. The stale musical fills not only lacked horribly in creativity, they were repeated and repeated to an agonizing degree--a case of substituting quantity for quality.\\"August\\" remains a musical gem in my collection. Had I not known the quality of which Adam Duritz is capable, I might have given this second effort a marginal second star. It just isn't within me to reward complacency, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"As The Crows Fly","review":"Recovering The Satellites is the Counting Crows follow-up to their monster hit August & Everything After. While it is not as immediately accessible as their radio-friendly debut was, this album is a step forward creatively and artistically. The sound on the album is richer and more dense and Adam Duritz's lyrics more searching and mature. The band really came into its own with this release. Songs like the \\"Another Horsedreamers Blues\\" which contains a heavy orchestration and biting lyrics show their growth. The band still knows how to grab your ear with the hard driving \\"Angels Of The Silence\\", the strong title track, the soaring \\"A Long December\\" and the jangling \\"Daylight Fading\\". The best track on the album is the sweet and touching \\"Goodnight Elisabeth\\" which Mr. Duritz sings with understated grace. While it isn't the classic their debut is, the band showed it wasn't a fluke and they lived up to the potential that the first album created."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"everyone seems to like rts the least of the counting crows album's. it's got such different music from theis first album, or their latest album that it's kind of hard to accept. but that is really the point i think. listen to these lyrics. many of them are just plain hard. not softly sad, depressed or whiny like some say of the other albums, but hard, angry, demanding. you can't just listen to this album time after time like aaea. this guy is screaming at you. ok, not all the time, but those first seven really, ah, get one's attention.at least it's not just the stuff one usually hears on the radio. and its obvious that the radio is not starting to change, no matter how much it rains. cc gives one a little reality, and who cares if it's not happy, it's still reality. but folk isn't really in right now, so don't expect any rave reviews from the critics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bewildered of Bristol","review":"Why knock one of the most innovative bands of the last 30 years? This band has captured the some of the intense feelings of joy and pain which come with living. Adam has written beautiful, poignant songs which are light-years ahead of the crap churned out by most well-known artists these days. What does it matter if Counting Crows produce a song which is inspired by Adam's life experiences, when they are such an accurate reflection of life and love?There is no sense in comparing AAEA with Recovering the Satellites as the two are very different albums, yet in their second album Counting Crows have produced something just as magical. Listen to both albums, they never fail to bring me out in goosebumps - they are truly stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing album","review":"This is Counting Crows best album by far, I love both August and everthing after and This desert life, but they just don't compare. Some people loved August and Everything After because of their new sound, no one else has Adam Durits voice but the #1 mistake people make when they think that a band is great is that they only have a small spectrum of music. CC is quite broad in Rock, Blues, and Alternative music. Recovering the Satellites definitely show you their power of rock, which is my favorite type of music. just so beautiful. my favorites are catapult, angels of the silences, children in bloom, recovering the satellites.

Also, most locations are in California and Nevada (Because this kid can think of many cities because he is so intelligent.) Very few remarks are about the music, but Adam's 'hair extentions'. Does it take a detective to figure out that this is the attempt of a strong mind to express him self forceably? We can easily see that this boywho called CC fans \\"people with no lives\\" himself is too smart to listen to a band fronted by a guy who's self-confidence is so low that he must wear a wig.

The songs sound a little noisy in general; it seems to me it's kind of an \\"experimental\\" album - as thought they were trying new things. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be good. I bought this CD not knowing any of its songs, and it was a disappointment... if you really like them, though, it's not a total loss: there are some great songs, such as \\"Mercury\\", \\"A Long December\\", \\"Walkaways\\" and Goodnight Elizabeth\\", but I guess that's all there is about it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWEFUL!","review":"Why is it that this guy would think that anyone could care what he has to say about anything?

Every song listed is worth listening to repeatedly. \\"Long December\\" which is a great piece by the Crows is probably the most widely heard song on this CD; but it is not the pinnacle of the Crows talent. \\"Mercury\\" is probably the best and most unique song on this disk. The song is less than two-minutes in length, making the listener long for the track to keep playing. The Crows ability to create a CD where every song is worth hearing is phenomenal. Their debut album _August and Everything After_ propelled the Crows to a national level. They are continuing to gain fame with _Recovering the Satellites_ and their two other incredible CDs. _Recovering the Satellites_ is by far the Crows best compilation of songs on one disk. The CD is worth every penny spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU NEED THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I don't understand how anyone could hate this cd. I love it.

It is music to be appreciated alone... powerful, life-changing, rich, complex, textured, unique, and quite simply the best Counting Crows CD as well as one of the best CDs ever made.

Marlene Steinberg has simply repackaged antiquated theories once associated with multiple personality disorder.

What therapist writes session summaries in such a non-clinical fashion? Try as she might, Sparks fails to connect with young adults by using colloquialisms and outdated slang--apparently she still thinks kids use the same expressions and street terms she used for \\"Go Ask Alice\\" (a fake diary, I might add). She also favors cute nicknames using alliteration, and she over-uses italics and ALL CAPS to emphasize a point. It's virtually unreadable! I have been in therapy for depression with several different doctors. Depression is a serious illness with social stigma still attached to it. The author is doing a disservice to readers by trying to make her writing 'hip' and as a result trivializing real issues for teenagers today. At least the lawyers made her add the Epilogue (disclaimer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"So unrealistic it's pathetic.","review":"This book seemed like it would be interesting when I first saw it. I had read many of the other books that Beatrice Sparks had \\"edited\\" and thought they were pretty good. (Even if she may have written them as some people think) But this book was horribly unrealistic.The phycologist was too cheesy, and the main character Sam was too happy despite his many problems. The point that set it over the edge for me was he \\"hi-fived\\" the phycologist because he was oh-so-happy to be able to talk to her. Real people that have just spent 3 months on the street after running away are not that suddenly happy.Take my advice, do not read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"more rah-rah than a cheerleader","review":"i started this book very optimistically and energetically. i was disappointed to find that sammy seemed to leap out of his depression and problems as if they weren't killing him. he seemed like a completely different person halfway through his session with the doctor. this seemed very unrealistic. is this the result of editing choices, or was this child really so easily pulled from a life on the streets to a happy normal teenager, only by focusing on positive thinking? it should have been made more clear at the beginning that the dr thought this was a mild case of depression. i suspect other teens might wonder why they can't leap out of debilitating, clinical depression with as much ease as the teenage sammy did. additionally, the italics were heavily overused, as was exclamation points. it was tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"my reading book","review":"almost lost is a true story of an anonymous teenagers life on the streets.

And the exclamation points were so overused I felt like throwing up.When someone is as complementary as she was to Sammy, everything they say seems fake. It's like a random person that you don't know coming up and telling you how smart you are. They don't know you. They probably tell everyone they're smart.

For the past 4 years, since I've been using it, I haven't had a day's problem. Yes it's slow, but I just make sure to fill it before the reservoir gets too low and I never run out. And to date, I haven't had to buy new filters. They last years. It truly has saved my life and restored my health.

When it came time for me to consider a water filtration system for my home, I immediately investigated options and was delighted to find the reasonably-priced Gravidyn system on Amazon. Coupled with the free shipping it was soon apparent that this was the best option: the standard for the international red cross had better be good enough for my family! When the item arrived at my workplace, I couldn't help but assemble it and test the unit, and not only did it pass my own taste tests, but those of some very demanding colleagues at my office. I anticipate years of service, and with the reputation and stability of katadyn, I expect that parts and replacement filters will be readily available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective batch on a usually good product","review":"I have owned one of these gravity filters for over 8 years and have never had a problem. This unit sold at Amazon is the same one I've had all these years. We used ours overseas while doing missionary work.I ordered a new one recently from Amazon so we would have one while on furlough in the USA. Sadly I have returned two of them because the spout hole has been drilled too large. It's actually a bit oblong. It leaks if you don't tighten the spout down tight and leaks if you tighten it down because the washers collapse into the hole. I called Katadyn after the second time and asked for a new lower bucket with the correct size hole. They could not do this and told me to return it to Amazon.Amazon has been great with the first exchange and now the return. It's just too bad that they got a bad lot recently. Hopefully you won't get one that is defective like the ones I got. It is not supposed to leak around the spout. If it does, return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as everyday filter as well as camping/emergency filter","review":"I bought one of these over the ceradyn or berkey because the ceradyn didn't fix taste or odors and the berkey doesn't seem to be passing the tests annually so it's hard to know what you're buying. The gravidyn is good for 6 months with basically unlimited capacity. My wife said it eliminated tap water smell/taste in NJ so she's happy with it. The tap is a little small for me, it takes too long to fill a water bottle for example, I'd prefer one with a higher flow rate. This is why 4 stars instead of 5.I've only had it a couple of days and flow rate filter wise, it's ok so long as the top 'bucket' is full. With 10L in the top, I got about 5L in the bottom in like 3 hours. Once the top gets down to half full then the flow rate slows significantly but it's still trickling through.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. It'll stop us buying bottled water now and will help if we need to clean water if there is an emergency."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive replacement filters","review":"Learning about water filtration/purification has been a daunting task. I thought I found the perfect solution until I actually opened the package of the gravidyn. What surprised me is that if you want to continue eliminating chemicals in your water, you have to replace all three filters every 6 months at $59.90 each. There is not a separate carbon filter just for chemical removal. So every 6 months, you are paying $179.70 for it to work as stated. The unit is made of cheap looking plastic, and even though it may not leach BPA, my hunch is that it is leaching other chemicals.

Lightweight and great sound. I've found that I had to -turn down- my music by about 60% because they amplified so well. From my experience with an electronic noise canceling headset (also from Sennheiser), these earbuds have passive electronic noise canceling feature. When you put them in your ear after plugging them in an audio headjack of something that is on, you'll hear some 'electronic buzzing.' If you're not used to it, it can be annoying. But once the music is on, its fine.Cons: the rubber they use for the headphones is 'clingy,' not like the normal plastics on most wiring that is generally slick. These earbuds have a sort of soft rubber which lends itself to stick to some types of clothing. Also, the wind noise the wiring causes is a pain. Running outdoors, 'fast walking' (like 3mph), or breezes will cause a whistling in the headphones.

After letting the first pair dry a couple of days, I noticed they worked but were lacking bass, so I figured I ruined them. I got my new ones in the mail and then decided to salvage the rubber earpieces from the old set.

They are so thin and flimsy that even when conforming to my ear, they rapidly fold and the earbud falls out of my canal and ear!I think I'm going to pick up something else.

I tried it on my last cross Atlantic flight, it works great, more than what I expected, it reduce the noise up to 80% with excellent sound quality, not too much to carry with you while traveling, not bulky you can sleep while you wearing it, it is much better than Sennheiser PXC 300, which I tried and I was so disappointed.I'm impressed with this ear buds and I wish that it come with a carrying case."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brillient upgrade from my stock Creative zen Headphones!","review":"I got there today, the sound is fantastic, a friend of mine have the BOSE(R) QCZ/GB Triport Headphone that cost150$ and these tiny ones sound almost as good!, and much much more than the stock Ipod or Creative ones.the only thing is, for some reason I got the CX 300. not 300s!I have no idea why, and I paid full 69.99 for them, so I give it 4 stars, cause it could be better probebly (300s), overall for now, the 2nd best phones iv'e tried. I dont know about running with them, but I can't run with the Zen Micro anyways.Another thing is the cord, its a bit short but I manage.One last thing you should now, when walking out side in the wind you hear whispers, but if you turn up the Vol it outgrown by the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice sound & comfy","review":"I am really happy with my ear buds - they work great and are very comfortable.

The sound is awesome and they block out alot of the noise in the background. In fact, sometimes I can't hear anything that my friends are talking about when the speak in high tones.

From the yoke (where the bud cables separate) the left ear bud cable is 7-1/2\\" in length. The right side bud cable is 21\\" long. That's quite a difference. The CX-300 is designed to be worn behind your head.I wish the cable measurements had been printed on the package!!I wrote Sennheiser if it was possible to it send back and have it modified to a symmetrical length. Their answer was to consider their CX55, CX400 and CX500 if I wanted symmetrical cables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I recently purchased these earbuds after returning a pair by sony. They have much better bass response than sony. The highs are clear and distinct. If you don't mind speding $300.00 for the shures, get them. For the rest of us the sennheisers are a great buy. I believe the complaints buy some reveiwers are due to improper use. The buds must have a good fit in the ear canal to sound good. Attention must be paid when changing the silicon pads. If they are not pushed on all the way around the rim they will fall off."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth the money","review":"These are great headphones. I've spent more than this on some and these are by far the best. They are comfortable and seem to stay in place better than others. I think the asymmetrical cable really helps with this.

No where on the order was it stated that I could not return a defective item."},{"rating":"1","title":"they stopped working after six weeks... buuut","review":"Loved 'em, blew my Sony's away in both sound quality and comfort. Maybe the cord was a hair too short, but that's better than being waaay too long.However, this Thursday the right ear just stopped working for no reason... I cleaned 'em off and inspected them for cuts - they're in perfect shape! My other Sennheiser headphones have worked great for years, but these are my first plug-style ones and I'm really annoyed. Especially since I got mine for $39.95 in February from Amazon (via 8th Street music) and now they are almost $70!If they repair/replace them I'll be fair and let you people know, but until then beware!UPDATE: Sennheiser repaired these for me quickly and for free! Great service, and my wife has been using them without incident ever since. I'd up the # of stars to 4 (since they're not nearly as good as the Shures I replaced them with), but I don't seem to be able to."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST!","review":"Absolutely awful sound! The earbuds have to be jammed deep into your ears (which hurts) to eliminate the tinny sound. And although there are three different size buds, none of them sit very well.

The rods are solid iron, done well, but the paint is not staying on, it was already chipped all over all the pieces as soon as I took them out of the package (carefully), the smell is nasty, but that will air out and the design? I love simple, but this is so simple, it has nothing to it. Iron rod that is rounded at the end (hard to see from the pic). That's it. I am very disappointed in this purchase. The only good thing about these is that I have very little room between windows and the wall and these ends are so short (really nothing to them), they actually fit for my needs.

While the others were all unmistakably fantasy series, Majipoor is clearly science fiction. On top of that, despite being an old timer, Silverberg himself is no legend, except in his own mind. Seeing him with the likes of King and Jordan was laughable. Then I looked more closely and realized he was the editor. AHhhhhhhh.The same sort of this shines here. A once decent, if not remarkable, series is being plumbed again, in the hope that it will produce another gusher. Sadly, the well is dry.

The water spills into a filter, collecting the debris.I bought this hoping I could replace a messy weekly water change with a slow drip, daily water top-offs and regular gravel vacuuming (sort of a poor man's continuous water change system). Unfortunately, this vacuum doesn't provide much suction, so you have to dig the end down into the gravel and try to catch any bits floating away to make this work.The filter really does catch dirt and debris, but compared to my regular water change kit (the one with a hose that you screw onto a faucet), the process is very slow and not as effective.

The best songs are definitely the ones that feature Rindy Ross's sexy vocals and sax work.Here's the down side: at 50 minutes, they could have included a few more songs. Valerie and Williams Avenue are two great ones from the first album that I would have liked to have on here. Another one or two from the last (and most underrated) album would have been welcome, too.Liner notes are okay, but a bit brief. Mention a little of the history of the band and well-known songs.

I contacted Netgear via email through their website and their response was \\"too bad for you\\". I can't understand why they won't take the thing off the market. It was the most expensive router I've purchased and to have such a short life and apparently uncaring manufacturer's reps is unforgivable to me. I won't ever buy another Netgear product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Netgear = throwing away your $$$ and time!","review":"I purchased the Netgear N gigabyte router and after about 6 months it bit the dust save for the green light. So I replaced it and just this week my Netgear access point did the same thing. Tech support can't get it running; it's DOA.Don't waste your money and time.

However, after 7 months, it has unfortunately caught the same disease as others where none of the lights aside from the \\"On/Power\\" light are on. As others have gone into pretty good detail before, I'll spare those notes here as my situation is completely the same as theirs.There are other better routers out there and for less. Those are your best bet over this one as NETGEAR apparently didn't bother to finish this rough draft of an idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it worked, died after 6 month as did the replacement","review":"Netgear refused to replace the replacement.

I will research and find another brand with better customer satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good router that doesn't last","review":"The Netgear RangeMax WNR854T was easy to set up and worked flawlessly for a couple of years, but it stopped working suddenly. My Netgear type b is still kicking, so it's not necessarily the company. Although a power surge might have fried it without me noticing, this was a relatively early wireless N offering, and I don't think they had it right, yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER","review":"Mine lasted a whole year, WOW!Take the time to read through the other reviews before you waste your hard earned cash on this product.I think my next router will be anything but a netgear, this is my third different netgear router and WILL BE MY LAST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JK","review":"Please do yourself a favor. Do not buy this product.As previous reviewers noted, this product goes dead after about 6 months. I already replaced one because it was within the warranty period. And yesterday it went out again. I called their customer service, but the guy told me I cannot get a replacement because I am out of the original warranty period.I did not know this router has a problem they cannot fix and wont do anything about it. This is not an isolated problem as you can read in many previous reviews. Please do not buy it and any other product from this company. And spread the word to your friends and family members. They should be punished for marketing this defective product and refusing to address the problems of consumers who bought this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be better if more support is available","review":"As some of you have mentioned, I was going crazy with the connectivity issues.I would have a pretty solid and stable connection for a few hours and thenthe connection suddenly drops for no reason. Then I tried to reset it like 20 times to get it back up, but no luck half the time.I was just about getting ready to go back to Best Buy to return it, then I found somewhat of a solution from one of the reviewers.First of all, make sure you have installed the latest firmware that is available out there.And then \\"set each piece of equipment that will be attached to the router with a static IP\\". This was mentioned by DSF so all credit goes to this reviewer.Ever since then, I've had no more connectivity issues at all.If you are having same connectivity problems like I had, please give this a try.

For about six months. Now only the green power light comes on, and it doesn't work at all. Apparently that's a common theme with these routers. I have never had a router that didn't last 3+ YEARS.

Choosing and setting up the wireless security, which everyone should do when using wi-fi, was also quite easy.Our old \\"g\\" router had an advertised range of around 1,500-feet (ha ha) but was only good in our home for about 20-feet (maybe due to interference like wires or devices in the path), while this new one covers the whole house, a fully-strong signal three stories up and 50-feet over and no repeaters needed, which very nice. Looks cool, too, as my daughter noted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dead one","review":"I upgraded from a Linksys 802.11b wireless router to this model. Setup was a snap, and I get a 3X increase in download speed to my home PC connected via wire (not a wireless connection) over my Optimum Online cable service. This alone was worth the cost to me. The boost when I'm wireless is great too. Another huge improvement is that I had to reset the Linksys router every other day or so, because the wireless access would not work after a day or so. This new Netgear router just keeps working. It's been about 6 weeks now without a reset. I am a totally satisfied customer....BUT after a couple years my router died too.. just like all of the other people who've reported that their router died. So I guess this was a bad choice. I do not recommend you buy this product. I will never buy another Netgear product."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT Performance, Nice Design","review":"Seattle, WA USAI read all the terrible reviews on Amazon and Newegg about this router, but the challenge sounded fun, so I went ahead and ordered it. Yes, steady connectivity is crappy out of the box, BUT, if you read the bright yellow paper with a yield sign shouting \\"READ ME BEFORE INSTALLING..\\", you'll stay calm because you'll know to upgrade the firmware right after getting it connected and you won't have any problems. This isn't a huge deal and should be done by nature with any new software/hardware. We upgraded from the WGU624 and performance has noticeably increased.

It worked fine for 6 month before it went dead and only the green power light works. Search and you will find 100s with the same problem online. The Netgear support does know about the issue but has no solution. You get the offer to purchase premium support for min $65 for the next 6 month but this will not fix the issue.As there is no solution if you pay for a new one you will get the same issue again after some month. Therefore the best solution may be to stick to a company that sells you a working unit and the proper support for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Power Adapter","review":"Less than 6 months of use and the power adapter goes nuts, starts making loud noises, and heating up. Went out and bought a D-Link router and have had no issues thus far. Customer support for Netgear was literally zero help when it came to getting me a replacement power supply. I was not willing to risk a fire hazard for a product that lacked the basics of a reliable electronic device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inherent defect in this product","review":"This is my second try. The first stopped its wireless function after 10 months. This second one has now gone 15, but stopped transmitting wireless signal yesterday. Looking at other reviews, you can see that there is a problem with this product. I cannot say anything about their other routers, but if you value reliability this one should be avoided.Late breaking news: On a lark, I updated the firmware (the cat 5 ports on the router still work) on March 24, 2009, and, voila, the wireless started working again! I find this almost incredible, and cannot imagine how it can be explained other than by a nefarious code that purposely was set to disable the wireless after a certain period! Talk about 'planned obsolescence'. Needless to say, this does not change my overall opinion of this router, but it does add a strong negative tint to the entire product line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died, and the replacement Died","review":"I purchased this router one year ago. Since then it has just died. I sent it back to Netgear and they sent me a new one. That took me offline for one week. Plus I had too pay for shipping the replacement router. That one died in about six months. That is two routers in less than twelve months. Good range and data rate when it works. Super fast is the only reason it got the second star.

I am on my 3rd router which just died, this time after 3 months. Just not reliable at all. And Netgear Support, well I know I know they are trying, but the language issues along with the fact that their tech skills are not comprehensive makes me cringe every time I have to call them..

No internet connection, all hell breaks loose, and lo and behold just the one yellow power light is struggling to stay on. Same issue 8 months ago, and that one was a little over a year old. I guess this is a common burn-out issue. The ONLY reason I started on this NETGEAR path was because the unit was one of the few that had built-in gigabit connections, AND the price (of course) was right. Since then, I've been able to take the defective unit back and swap it out without doling out more bucks. If I had to pay anything, I would look for another manufacturer, like D-Link or Linksys. This unit is on sale at Frys right now for $109, so in a bind I swapped it out for a new one HOPING they have fixed the DEFECT. Isn't it nice to be part of the R&D team of guinea pigs for Netgear? Still waiting for my paycheck from them....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Buy This","review":"After 6 months started to fail on occasion, but could be fixed by rebooting.

One day I got home from work and only the power light was lit. No network activity lights. Tried to unplug for 30 seconds and plug back in. Tried the reset button. Could not log into router. It was dead. I've trusted Netgear product's for many years and this is by far the worst product I have ever purchased from them. I must say this router was by far the best router I have owned until it died randomly. However, due to the horrible product life I would definitely recommend not purchasing this router."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb for a few months, then useless","review":"This was an incredible router - both wired and wireless speeds and connections were strong, stable and fast - until the power completely cut out on it. After an hour with tech support following incredibly inane requests, I received a replacement (at $16). That replacement was defective out of the box - sending malformed packets but otherwise appearing functional.This means that with this router, you won't be able to upload to Youtube, Revver, Flickr, or even have your Tivo update through your network connection. Everyday browsing will work for the most part, as servers typically ignore malformed requests. You will, however, get to see quaint Google error pages that few people see - it's the original Google logo with a \\"Your browser is sending a malformed request\\" error.I've downgraded firmware, upgraded firmware, disabled SPI, changed any setting imaginable - but it looks like Netgears suffer from an intrinsic hardware flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Technical Support, Poor Customer Service","review":"I wish I had researched Netgear more thoroughly before I bought my wireless gear from them. I regret it. Despite good editorials, their products break down with astonishing regularity. If that isn't bad enough, their scripted, plastic technical support seems to be designed more to deliver infuriating platitudes and block the customer from getting any meaningful resolution to their problem (that might cost Netgear an extra nickel) than to be sincerely helpful.Consider this a \\"danger sign.\\" You may choose to ignore it, but be ready for the consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible device, terrible response","review":"I bought one of these, and like many others here and elsewhere, mine just died.

My problem is that when the router re-boots, for example after a power outage, it changes it's default ip address from 192.168.1.1 to 10.0.0.1Trying to use customer service is a nightmare. If they understand you, they simply follow a script about hard reset. That does not fix the problem.

Netgear RangeMax Next WNR854T is a defective router right out of the box. From what I've read here, if yours works out of the box it won't be long before it's dead!

I literally haven't had to touch it in the 8-9 months I've owned it, which is more than i can say for the highly regarded wrt-54g that it replaced.Speeds are great for N, although range is a bit disappointing, but no worse than the linksys. I run daily with a 33% signal, and still have good speeds, so I'm happy.You can get one of these dirt cheap now, and if your looking to get into 802.11N on the cheap, i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this bad boy.Replacing the firmware is not optional though, do it right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad company","review":"I used the router, Netgear WNR854T, for 367days.I could not use it any more after that time because it has troublesome.The company said that they do not manage any place where it is repaired and recommand me to buy a new one.It is one of the ridiculous companies.Now I have my old-router of the other company, i bought 5 years ago, and it works well still.

For me that is a pain. I am the systems admin here at work (so I know what I'm doing) and here I purchased a Linksys Wireless-N and have had zero problems with it. Needless to say I'm going back to Linksys. Worst router I have ever owned. Also if you have an xbox 360, this router does not like to communicate with it.

Netgear should provide a longer warranty if they are going to produce sub-standard products. Better yet, perhaps Netgear should produce a higher quality product with better customer support.

However, mine does not work...and provides a situation worse than being completely dead...it stops passing ~50% of the packets through the WAN port. If I leave it off for a day, it can be used again for a while.I suspect a poor thermal design that lacks air flow to be at fault. I've cracked the case on my to open it.

As has been said, no, I'm not a newbie, no I'm not particularly bitter or angry and I have no vendetta. That said - I was quite happy to get this product, as my prior G network had always been plagued by instability and interference. The device set up easily and provided excellent coverage. My elation was short lived when I discovered that it would stop responding every fifteen or twenty minutes, dropping connection to my laptop, my wife's laptop, my daughter's mac mini, my Smartphone - you name it. You can access the admin web page over the wire, but not wirelessly (because nothing is actually connected). Netgear told me to update the firmware, but there is no firmware update (I'm on the latest version). In short, great concept, lousy execution.

It appears that something burnt up internally in the router, even though I had it on a good UPS.Netgear usually has a great product, but this one failed completely. I've had other Neatgear routers that have lasted years, so I'm not sure what's wrong with this product, but I would definitely recommend not buying it.

After a few weeks all of a sudden I was getting dropped connections several times a day which I blamed on my ISP. If I unplugged the router and recycled it the connection would come back again before dropping for no reason. I did a search for \\"Netgear dropped connection\\" and was flooded with people with the exact problem I was encountering and nobody had any idea how to correct it, including Netgear.I decided to cut my losses and just buy a competitors product which I got going in minutes and event the print server popped right up.

Sure, I could have contacted Netgear and gotten a replacement, but judging by the fact that other reviewers had the REPLACEMENT router die too, I figured better to just chalk it up as a lesson learned and try something else (Belkin N1 Vision).

Initially, I had difficulty getting file sharing to work with a computer running Vista.

It is a delight to read erotica that is fleshed out (no pun intended), and the pieces in this collection truly work as stories even when they are not overly sexual, as do some of the better selections in Maxim Jakubowski's Mammoth Book series (I'm thinking of THE DRESS, CUCKOO, THE NAUGHTY YARD, THE STORY OF NO, and so on). There are some big names in this one, Zane, Nelson George, Tananarive Due, Timmothy B. McCann, Shay Youngblood; and some returning favorites who are even better the second time around, Leone Ross and Preston L. Allen. Leone hinted in BS # 1 that she had a kinky side, but in this one she leaves no doubt that she is a straight up freak. Preston manages again to tell a story that is both captivating and stimulating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brown Sugar 2","review":"This book kept me hot and bothered for weeks.

Using the supplied headphones I can clearly hear even questions from the back of the class which I could not hear during the lecture. There is no need for an external mic, the internal mic is more than sufficient. The ease of uploading files to my computer is simple and quick. The instructions do not seem to include sufficient operational info, but the device is fairly intuitive to operate. This recorder does everything I've seen in others, but better and in a smaller light weight package. The only caveat would be there is little warning of a low battery. It is simple to replace the AAA battery. I simply always carry and extra in the bag I carry to class. This recorder exceeded my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly good product","review":"I have been using this product for a couple of weeks. It is convenient and pretty easy to use. The instructions are not always clear, especially in how to download data from the voice recorder onto your computer, but it can be figured out. My biggest complaint is the battery cover. It does not fasten securely, so that when you hold the recorder in your hand even just the slightest touch to the battery compartment cover can cause it to open and the battery to pop out.You will definitely need an external microphone for recording. The built-in mic is very noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Instructions, Poor software","review":"The Olympus WS-200S is a cool item-great size, great technology. BUT!

I thought it would be a great tool to help him learn the alphabet, etc. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected. When the dial is moved to the left, the toy speaks English and when it's moved to the right, it speaks Spanish - extremely confusing for a small child developing language skills. I checked with the catalog's customer service and their item is only in English so even though it looked the same, it certainly wasn't. I didn't see Spanish mentioned in the Amazon listing or in the customer reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who sent them on this strange wild journey?","review":"I read this beautiful book when I was in eighth grade. Legend of Lost Earth is a combination of science fiction, negative utopia, and Norse mythology in which a society known as the Earth Worshipers strives to escape from Niflhel, the eerie, futuristic, dungeon-like world in which its members must live. Although a wondrous adventure in itself, the book had another curious aspect. I began reading Islandia, Austin T. Wright's celebrated epic, shortly after I finished Legend of Lost Earth, and in my imagination, John Lang bore a striking resemblance to Giles, Hope Campbell's protagonist. Legend of Lost Earth is an inspiring tale that I continue to remember well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working a few wks after purchase","review":"This was a refurbished DVD player.

No longer. Any fine quality knife or scissors has to be forged. I have a few old knifes from Henckels and they are fine, quality tool steel, drop forged. Now I'm not saying these are worthless just not top drawer. There are still great knifes out there just beware the sticker shock. As these will be a life long tool look at the price with a view towards that. Look at Wusthof for a good example or some of the Japanese small manufacturers or A.G.

The \\"anvil\\" is cheap plastic instead of brass, the catch sticky, the handles cheap plastic.

I'll not start with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the negative reviews- these are handy!","review":"I bought this set of scissors about 6 years ago and they work just as perfectly now as the day I bought them! I reach for them CONSTANTLY! The variety of sizes is wonderful. Yes, the handles may be plastic but that does not mean they wear out or break - they are very durable. They've stayed sharp, they are easy to clean, they have not loosened at all where the joint is located and the larger scissors are very sturdy and strong! I've cut small wire with them and they stay super sharp and undented! Awesome gift! In fact I'm going to purchase another set for a Christmas gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"scissor set only ok","review":"this scissor set is not as sturdy as i was expecting from a henckels product. the all purpose scissors work well but the pruning shears are very light weight and the open /close mechanism is very cheap. i dont htink they will last too long. probably why they were less expnsive for same set in other mags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp & Precise","review":"Yes, I admit that I am very picky about scissors.

There are classical references which I find laughable but I guess someone else might find them romantic. The poetry is not very good, but I appreciate Richard Amory's attempts. Throughout the books the theme is how a young white man learns to accept his gay orientation through meeting and having sex with Indians and older white males. His 2 other books are also good. The movie was pretty bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"I remember when this story was FORBIDDEN! YIKES!!!!!!

As a Bewitched fan I really looked forward to reading this book. Boy was I disappointed. It is hard to read-looks like they just slapped it together with no thought to continuity.

This book is filled with random collections of series facts, and has almost nothing of interest for fans of the show.Practically nothing on bloopers, no interviews, no gossip, just one list after another. 80 pages worth of episode synopses, a list of drinks that they consumed??? Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this by","review":"Hopefully this will pop out of the universe for it is no plus for Bewitched fans. The most boring television book I have ever read, not to mention containing errors. This is how silly this book is: there is a huge section devoted to recipes. For instance, in one episode, Darrin says his favorite food is some stew with noodles. So the author has a full recipe for that. And it goes on and on like that. One of Darrin's clients makes Irish Stew, so there's a recipe for that. Uncle Arthur tries to conjure up a napoleon so there's a recipe for that. It goes on and on. What a waste of paper. There are about four different episode guides, as if all the episode guides on the internet aren't enough. Very little fun in this book.

The chuck works fine, it has good speed control, fine balance and excellent battery life with fast charges. I like the generously sized bit holder in the front.My only complaint is one of ergonomics. While using the drill it is very easy to turn the inner torque adjustment ring and the drill will slip when you don't want it too. I should be harder to move since you often hold the drill there when using two hands and it is very annoying when it moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I couldn't be happier.

Almost immediately, one of the batteries started to underperform and within a year, I was essentially down to one battery.

This toy is very easy to put together but it ends there, it is impossible to keep together. It is poorly constructed and the cars keep getting stuck going up the ramp. They have supports but they are completely useless. It took me an hour with Mega blocks to construct my own supports and get the toy to work by then my son lost interest in the whole thing and was racing the cars on the kitchen floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie on RFK","review":"This movie is excellent for a film version of Bobby Kennedy's life.

But based on the fact that nobody else in the world has seen it, I should have known better. I thought the movie was so bad, I could not finish.The writers have chosen to rewrite history in many ways. First, RFK apparently had schizophrenia because his reality was very distorted. JFK kept appearing to RFK throughout the movie. The most interesting thing is that RFK only speaks in a Massachusetts accent to his brother (or brother's illusion). As if distorting reality is not enough of a crime, the movie accuses Lyndon Johnson and the CIA of killing John Kennedy.Read a book on this fallen Catholic leader.

As far as I'm concerned Danzig is the Misfits, he wrote everything! and if I'm not mistaken Michael Graves who does a fine job did alot of the writing on the new stuff.

Without the original lyrics that Glenn Danzig created, the music is hollow and doesnt have that horrorshow feel to it that the old music did. This album is a real disgrace to the original Misfits and is highly advised to not waste your money on newbies that think they can talk about death and get fans.

Piece of factual information: Glenn Danzig wrote all music and lyrics for The Misfits, why would anyone think that he could leave some of that behind? This album and the other one they did sicken me. The Newfits are with out a doubt the biggest embarassment and inside joke in the music industry. Please don't buy into it. Get the Danzig Misfits.

This album tries to recapture the Misfits sound by using simple and fast song arrangements, with dark lyrics and lots of \\"Whoas\\", but it just lacks a soul. Danzig used the influences of Elvis, B-movies, and early punk to create something original. This album just goes though the motions. It seems like Jerry Only is more influenced by 80's hair metal than Elvis or punk. The melodies are so cheesy. A real Misfits song like Astro Zombies sounds really influenced by oldies (specifically \\"Blue Moon\\"). New Misfits songs like Speak of the Devil sound like Warrent was singing them.It's like the new Misfits are ripping off the old Misfits. The new Misfits know on the surface what makes a Misfits song, but overall it doesn't come off as authentic. Kinda like comparing Pearl Jam to Silverchair.(They still put on a great live show, though)"},{"rating":"1","title":"its KROQ material","review":"great cd if you like tunes called dammit....they dont have a zero stars option....shame shame,you call yourself misfits fans...go static age"},{"rating":"1","title":"The mifits who?

Graves' voice bears a stunning resemblance to that of Glenn Danzig's, but the band as a whole suffers without Danzig's writing and musical talents. However, \\"American Psycho\\" is much better than it is given credit for by longtime fans. The album is chock full of catchy hooks and B-grade horror movie lyrics, and the rhythm section of the band has grown and Graves' voice sounds fantastic. Standout tracks include the title track, \\"From Hell They Came\\", \\"Mars Attacks\\", \\"Hate the Living, Love the Dead\\", and the excellent \\"Dig Up Her Bones\\".

I don't mind the song Monster Mash as much because Jerry Only is singing. See, I totally respect Only and Doyle for the fact that they are still going hard as ever... Get a new name! OR drop ... Michale ... and have Jerry sing then at least the band would be fronted by an actual misfit! ... buy [the] MISFITS Collection 1&2, as they are more or less all encompassing of the REAL MISFITS career!

Swarwosky is inept as an interpreter, and there is very little that is redeeming in the orchestra's playing. But compared to the Luxembourg group (which usually provides decent performances) in the Britten, they are superstars. The sound is so incredibly bad for the Saint-Saens, with a really wretched piano sound, little enjoyment is to be had (and the strings sound scrawny, too).Ugh.

Later on I purchased this cd in a used record shop. Talk about a gem covered in dirt. From the take off track Grounded, your attention is caught. Rocking guitars, powerful lyrics and quite simply GOOD MUSIC is all it takes to grab you. Garrison is not about glitz and glam. She's just a gal with her guitar and a bit of soul.

This score is an excellent compilation, much of which is based on the same few basic melodies. These deceptively simple patterns unfold into a beautiful variety of music. Check out my favorite track from the album \\"Haunted Piano #1\\" for a sample. \\"Running the Bath\\" is probably most representative of the overall tone and feel of the album. Levity's brevity (gwah hah hah!) is the only downside. All but 2 of the tracks fall into the one to two and a half minute mark, making some of them seem like samples instead of full tracks. Given the ambient nature of the pieces they really should go on longer. Definately go for it if you are a fan of the Eels or any other tingly, experi-pop-orchestrock. Keep in mind most of the album is instrumental, in case you need \\"singing or guitars\\" to enjoy music."},{"rating":"2","title":"E is incredible","review":"I can't believe how well put together this score is, as well as the two tracks that E sings in.Track number 9 is great.

It's painfully hard to watch, unless you drank so much in your adolescence/early 20s that you still have the mentality of a 13 year old. Myers is constantly spouting off cheap half brained catch phrases (Intamacy or Into me I see) and throwing up so much toilet humor, that you can tell he's trying hard to compress this turd of a script into a diamond.

The story is weak but in comedies like this the characters and jokes are often more important than the story. Unfortnately, Guru Pitka is nowhere near as funny as Austin Powers for instance, and the jokes often fall flat, with some exceptions.

(with Graham Gordy, in case you're interested).In deference to its other stars - and/or victims - we'll forego identifying them here, but the writers and director Marco Schnabel should not be let off so easily.As for Myers, he hasn't looked this uncomfortable since the last time he found himself standing next to Kanye West."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly bad","review":"There is a reason this has 15% on RottenTomatoes, a score reserved for the worst of the worst. When this was on TV recently I decided to give it a shot.

You can tell easily when they are trying to put in the jokes, but you're just left scratching your head. A prime example is the guru rides into a room on an electrical magic carpet. Then somebody from the set (e.g. videographer) enters the picture, gets on it, and rides off. Not funny, just pointless.It was the most I could to do watch 15 minutes of this.

Then there's all the jokes we've seen in previous Myers films that aren't so funny the 4th time around when they appear in this flick. Guru Pitka (Myers) is not funny or likable.

It worked fine for the adult, no real complaints there. It was much less useful with the kitten, however. The blades on this clipper are actually quite thick (in all directions, really) and so it is extremely difficult to navigate a kitten's small nails. It also makes it much harder to see how much of the nail you're actually cutting. And if your cat is even the least bit squirmy, well forget it.

I'd recommend trying out another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality product","review":"Overall I had no problem cutting my cat's nails with this trimmer, but after owning it for only 4 months the thing simply disintegrated in my hands!

I don't mean that the pivot joint came undone, the plastic broke clean through without even making an audible 'snapping' noise.

The story is straightforward. It's telling is remarkable. Christopher's voice is detailed and detached, it's precision unsurpusing in someone who has devoted his life to the examination of details and rigors of objective thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing","review":"I have never written a review before but felt compelled, in this case, in the hope of sparing someone else the torture of this book. The storyline becomes more preposterous as it progresses culminating in the last quarter of the book in a mishmash that seems to be either a dream or a hallucination. I forced myself to finish it since, after all, it is a mystery and I wanted to know the ending. However Ishiguro seems to insist that all is real by transitioning to a believable (albeit very disappointing) ending. In effect, he appears to be saying: \\"that's my story and I am sticking to it\\". When I finally put the book down, I felt I had been cheated of the time it took to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read Remains of the Day I was excited to see that he had written a new book. The first chapters were interesting as they described his boyhood friend and their days of play.The final chapters were disappointing. Expecting to find his parents after 22+ years of no contact really left me amazed that he expected to find them. Improbable and this got in the way of the enjoyment of the story.It was as though it was written by a student of his, using his signature. I won't rush to read the next one if this is what I can expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily Forgotten","review":"Not as good as Ishiguro's other works. His very best was Artist of the Floating World, followed by Remains of the Day. This book follows the career of a Shangai-raised Englishmen who becomes a detective. Like all Ishiguro's book, the narrarator has exagerated sense of formality. The sense of denial and the sort of \\"elephant in the middle of the room\\" truths that lead to great ending in Ishiguro's other books never materialize in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"sillier and sillier","review":"The book begins well but becomes sillier and sillier. Conversations are stilted and rather inane. Relationships - such as between Christopher and Sally - never develop in any believable way. By the end it is ridiculous. He leaves Sally for 2 minutes and then goes off to find his parents who have been missing for 30 years! Meets his boyhood friend in the most unlikely of places! Come on.... It is hard for me to believe any reviewer would promote it unless they are basing their appreciation of the book on the author's former works. If an unknown author had submitted it, I doubt any publisher would have touched it. I am finishing it only because the reader - and I am reading it on tape - is very good and I want to see just how unbelievable the ending is."},{"rating":"1","title":"promises much, but sadly fading towards the end","review":"The first few chapters promise much and the intriguing encounters between Christopher and Sarah were captivating. However, the plot gradually degenerates into an incredible story of a senseless Englishman braving through Japanese shells and bullets to search for his parents, whom he believed were held hostage in a shanty town in the middle of a battlefield in wartime Shanghai for 30 years. But perhaps the most \\"intriguing\\" part is how the western community in Shanghai seemed to expect Christopher to bring world peace with the solving of the case of his parents' disappearance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Like many of the others who have reviewed this novel I adored Remains of the Day, which is somewhere near the top of my 50 favorite books of all time. The books have similar themes - an isolated man who misses all life's cues and clues. Where they differ is that When We Were Orphans is both thoroughly tedious and quite preposterous. I notice that most people click that a review has been helpful when that review is positive. Fair enough. Don't take my word for it. But do at least try to borrow the book from the library rather than invest any money in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An epic mess","review":"This book is such a grandiose mess that I must remind myself of Ishiguro's great works, such as Remains of the Day, which show what he is capable of as a writer and artist. When We Were Orphans is a small, unpleasant, soapy story set against a gigantic and wildly improbable canvas, as if that will somehow give the story social weight, political size and personal meaning. It doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite Boring","review":"I had to plow through this book, which made no real sense after a while. It was soo boring. Full of nonsence information. I always felt that a book that was short listed for the Booker prize could be something more... well ... exciting. It was just boring and it had no real point to the whole story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"A couple of years ago when this novel was first published in England, I purchased it at Heathrow Airport before getting on my flight home. Unfortunately, it was the only book I had on the plane. Otherwise, I could not have gotten past the first 20 pages. This is one of the worst novels I have ever read. The plot is implausible. The prose is strained. The characters are wooden. It insults the reader's intelligence over and over. Ever put a joke in the middle of a college term paper to test whether your professor would really read what you wrote? I wonder if Ishiguro let someone ghost-write this novel to test the integrity of book reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating read","review":"I admire Ishiguro for writing a risk-taking book, most unlike any I have read befire. Unfortunately, this novel fails in its objectives, except for itself being a unique piece of fiction.The protagonist is an english detective, who appears to be completely delusional about his current circumstances, and who is willing to take these delusions to great lengths. Because of this, the plot eventually becomes irrelevant to reality. This is when the book shows its signs of brilliance, when the plot is recognized as meaningless and the major themes take over in a Chinese battle.Unfortunately this brilliant culmination hardly makes up for the rest of the novel. Besides the poor/meaningless plot, the novel does not have a single character the reader cares about. The thematic sequence, during which the book finally seems to be about something, is all too fleeting. Soon after the plot returns even more absurd than before. It's a truly frustrating experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ishiguro rests on his laurels","review":"\\"When We Were Orphans\\" has a plot like a third-rate TV mini-series, full of implausible developments, improbable coincidences and loose ends. Ishiguro seems to be trying to make some point about the nature of evil - but quite what it is just doesn't come across. Much that would help us to understand the story is simply glossed over and hence the reader is simply left with too many unanswered questions - though do we care enough about the characters to want them answered?. Christopher Banks is the kind of emotionally constipated, self-deceiving character that Ishiguro seems to specialise in. The growing relationship between himself and Sarah Hemmings simply does not convince. Having read and very much enjoyed Ishiguro's earlier novels, I am extremely disappointed with this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whodunnit with no who and no it","review":"After being dazzled by his previous works \\"Remains of the Day\\" and \\"A Pale View of Hills\\", I was left disappointed by Kazuo Ishiguro this time around.The book starts out great -- an historical whodunnit mystery about a boy whose parents are kidnapped in Shanghai in the early 1900's, who then returns years later to find them.But this book can't figure out what it wants to be... it's a mystery for awhile, then a romance, then a psychadelic journey into the mind of a sick man. In the end, it fails to satisfy the reader on any of those counts.Furthermore, Ishiguro does a poor job of bringing colonial Shanghai to life in the mind of the reader. That's a real shame, given that Shanghai during this period was one of the most exciting and stimulating cities in the world.Nevertheless I remain a devoted fan of Kazuo Ishiguro. Let's hope that he gets out of this slump and that his next book is as good as his earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Failure","review":"I found this novel to be an interesting failure for two reasons. First, one can't tell if it is the author or the narrator who is incompetent. Second, assuming it's the narrator, the point of his history and delusions remains obscure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of plot holes","review":"I'm guessing that Ishiguro must be on some kind of medication when he wrote this novel. The prose and narration, while top notch, could not compensate for the numerous glaring plot holes.Reading this novel requires one to suspend his disbelief at the events unfolding. The most glaring one is how the protaganist, the renowned detective Christopher Banks, returned to Shanghai after 20 years, to find his missing parents, and for some reason, believes that they are still holed up in a slum house. He also stumbled upon his childhood friend after 20 years, Akira, in a war zone. These, and the way many other things come together for Banks strains credulity.The bright spots in the novel is the little girl Jennifer who is adopted by Banks. Unfortunately, even this lone bright spot was only expanded on until the end of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps I missed something.","review":"I couldn't make the connection between the rave reviews on the dust jacket and the writing within. Since the book is loosely a mystery, I wasn't able to toss it aside -- naturally, I wanted to know what happened to Christopher's parents. In the meantime, though, my reading was peppered with exclamations of disbelief and disgust as I forged my way through the book. I never did decide whether the tepid writing and unnecessarily obtuse timeline were more frustrating, or whether it was the ridiculous behavior of the narrator, whose decision-making abilities bordered those of a squirrel. I found the ending to be trite, and many of the characters hollow. Overall, not a positive impression of my first Ishiguro."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disapointment","review":"Reading the reviews in Amazon is usually much more informative than reading the marketing blurbs that appear on a book or frankly many of the reviews that appear in the press. The fact that this book was considered for the Booker award, the most important British literary award, is simply shocking. It points out that selling books is like any other business and therefore let the buyer beware. There are few books that I have reacted to so negatively in the last twenty years. The fact that many readers still appear to love the book and consider it a \\"masterpiece\\" is the only true mystery of this book for me. I suppose many people expect a great book from a popular and successful novelist, but this book in my opinion is a waste of time. It is a silly, illogical book that is also weirdly racist in its belief that the Chinese soldiers involved could have cared at all about this preposterous Englishmen and his missing family. It is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"honestly!","review":"How do we get this man to quit writing his tortured nightmares? I thought he had completely exhausted the tortured nightmare in \\"The Unconsoled\\".Enough already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shanghaied!","review":"A major disappointment -- A fan of Ishiguro's earlier work, I really wanted to like this book and forced myself to plow on through but found so many elements that were outrageously ridiculous (the use of the magnifying glass by the adult Christopher, for example; I found myself laughing out loud!) and unforgiveably irrelevant (the fits of giggling by Christopher and Akira in the ruins) that any loyalty I had developed for these characters in the first half of the book was completely destroyed in the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"I admit--I don't get it.","review":"OK, I admit it...I just don't get the point of the book.The prose is well written. But for what purpose? Page after page of somewhat tedious, wandering details. If I hadn't read other reviews, I would be even more baffled. I was ready for a subtle and complex book, but I guess it's too much so for me. It's not a detective story of course. Maybe it's the author's self-analysis? I dunno."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Remains of the Day","review":"I picked this book up because I enjoyed Remains of the Day. The book is, however, arguably the worst book I have ever read.A slow to non-existent plot drags interminably with page after page of tediously detailed description and converstations that do not advance the story one bit.I kept wondering if this was a first novel, brought back to life in order to cash in on the author's current celebrity. It reads like a teenage first try.Simply dreadful. Now, I wouldn't touch any other product by this author with a barge pole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply dreadful","review":"I have not enjoyed a novel less than I enjoyed this one for many years. Totally unconvincing, uninteresting, and really just silly. To be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogical and unbelievable","review":"How can a book have such tightly-controlled writing, yet such an illogical, unbelievable and frustrating plot? The narrator is a detective, yet we are given no details on his professional triumphs (we're just told, repeatedly, he's a great detective), and, judging from his lack of memory and inability to focus on essential clues from his past, no reason to think he has the mental acuity to be such a brilliant detective. This novel is both too tight and too loose at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"'When We Were Orphans'-highly recommended","review":"Ishiguro's latest, 'Orphans,' begins on very familiar ground. In fact, a good portion of the book is devoted to the introspection and introspective analysis that often typifies Ishiguro's work. The protagonist explores his past, and specifically his memory of it, to attempt to arrive at an understanding with his present. This journey transforms the novel into a full-scale detective story, giving the novel a compelling and gripping climax to a brilliant story. A most entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"shame","review":"This book was never good but at least at the beginning one might have the impression that the story could evolve... well I was waiting and waiting but things went straight downhill. What is this book about? The protagonist is not interesting in any sense. At the part where he goes back to Shanghai and looks for his parents (disappeared 18 years ago and he thinks they are kept in a house still held captive) while there is actual fighting around him and thinks he found a childhood friend I thought this guy is simply insane, really a mental case and since this is a memoir of his none of which I have been reading is true. I was disappointed to find out that the writer did indeed believe that the events depicted could have taken place. The whole book is such a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Shanghai","review":"Sorry to say that I think this fine writer simply lost his way on this one. After an enticing beginning the whole fabric quickly unravels. The random blind alleys of the plot were not only boring, but infuriating and often totally unbelievable.I finished the book out of respect for his other better works, but can in no way recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"I just finished reading \\"When We Were Orphans\\", and I was very disappointed. I found the storyline to be silly and unbelievable. What a letdown this was."},{"rating":"1","title":"perplexing","review":"I try not to be swayed by pre-pub blurbs nor even reviews, but the raves for this book drew me to it, only to be disappointed. It has the oddest combination of sweeping and miniscule pallette. On the one hand, Christopher's inner life is stuffy and confined, almost a cliche of the male English spinister, his passions so tightly cloaked as to be painful, yet the action-sweeping across continents-encompasses war, the machinations of the opium trade, and an excrutiatingly drawn out campaign to solve childhood mysteries. The subplot of Mr. Banks' adoption of Jennifer, while affecting in itself, seems contrived to give resonance to the orphan theme. In the end, I couldn't reconcile the small inner world of this strangely withheld man with his adventures in a the world beyond himself, a world filled with almost numbing action and intrigue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable plot line.","review":"I love \\"The Remains of the Day\\" by the same author, but this book was horrible. The plot line is unbelievable. It's like the author didn't even try to convince you that this things could actually have taken place.I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:Books I love or at at least really, really like:We Need to Talk about Kevin.Tell the Wolves I'm HomeWhen the Emperor Was DivineThe History of HistoryThe Remains of the DayWe Have Always Lived in the CastleThe Night CircusWater for ElephantsThe Sisters BrothersThe Poisonwood BibleBooks I REALLY hated:The Bear in a Muddy Tutu1Q84The Buddha of SuburbiaA Visit from the Goon SquadSun StormA Long Way DownWhen We Were OrphansThe Haunting of Hill House"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler alert - the technique is not my thing","review":"Unreliable narrator technique is not my thing.I loved Remains of the Day, and picked up When We Were Orphans as soon as it came out.

No thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Insider's Perspective","review":"I'm the keyboardist for Maxwell's Demon. Prometheus is our first album, dating back to 2001. It's a 39 minute tone poem based on Ayn Rand's novella \\"Anthem\\". It's a tremendously complex, intricate, dark album reminiscent of Anglagard, early Anekdoten, and King Crimson. It takes several listens to fully absorb it. The production quality is superb, in our humble opinion. All of the instruments are analog, as are the recording and mixing equipment used, so it has that magical 70s sound, even on CD.Here's the part that Amazon will probably edit out. They are charging too much for this album. Without much effort, you can find our band's web site where we list another retailer that sells it for several dollars less. Just a friendly tip from your neighborhood prog band.By the way, you might also be interested in our new album, \\"Diablo\\". It's darker, more complex, and longer, with even better sound quality.

The other movie in the series is Puppet Master VS Demonic Toys. Granted, I still would have bought this is if I knew for sure that, that movie wasn't in this collection because I wanted the Puppet Master movies. I do understand why though, that movie isn't in the collection, and it probably has something to do with syfy (sci-fi) owning the rights to the movie, but still.

This is one of the biggest tops to flops that I've heard in some time. Not that the Remedy CD was exceptional in my opinion, but it was good... There is no song on this CD that can match \\"Red Alert\\"... Also missing is the Reggae influenced tracks... This is a total mix-and-match beats paradise. The music is highly confusing. The blends of sounds just don't match. And I was left with a strange look on my face after listening to it. The only track that I can say that I fully liked was \\"Just one kiss\\". Other than that, I can throw this CD away. In what is seen by a creative CD by many, I guess I'm in the minority because I just can't get with this one...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing good time","review":"The Basement Jaxx will surely be shoved into the forefront of British dance music you can <i>dance</i> to, seeing as how Fatboy Slim has gone chilled, Underworld and the Prodigy are MIA and the Chemical Brothers are still working on a fourth.This album is easily the most retro (read: FUN!) since Beck's \\"Midnite Vultures\\"; everything from the day-glo packaging to the blips and noises in the grooves makes this an album you must have to just get a smile on your face.The Jaxx had a tough task with following up \\"Remedy\\", an undeniable house masterpiece, but they do the job admirably with \\"Rooty\\": the only complaint I'd have is with its slight 43 minute length. Nevertheless, this is a gem, the way life should be: sunny, danceable and \\"groovy.\\" Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good, but no need for arrogance!","review":"Oddly, I agree with the two snobbish reviews below who say \\"Rooty\\" doesn't live up to it's promise. After pulling out all the pop stops for \\"Romeo,\\" which is already my single of the year, the Jaxx seem rather torn between the styles of Missy Elliot and Marshall Jefferson. The CD suffers from a lack of concentration, and no other song here matches \\"Romeo\\" for exuberance or immediacy.As for those wanks who think you have to be \\"intelligent\\" to listen to \\"real\\" house music, well, let's all just have a laugh at their spineless arrogance. House is about bringing people together, not being exclusive. Loosen up, ya scabs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic, electric, funk madness.","review":"I have owned this album a few precious hours, but in that short amount of time have realized that Rooty is just as special as Basement Jaxx's previous offering, Remedy. \\"Where's your head at\\" is my immediate favorite but \\"Romeo\\" and \\"Broken Dreams\\" (both of which when juxtaposed with one another evidence the supreme range of Basement's sound) are quickly enticing. If you liked Remedy, you will most certainly like Rooty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tres Funky","review":"As America's taste gets more and more hip-hop oriented, it's refreshing to see Basement Jaxx unleash this, their second CD of slammin disco/house grooves. Quirky and ahead of its time, \\"Rooty\\" has enough hooks to sink Jaws: the CD sets the tone with the slammin' single \\"Romeo\\" and the groove doesn't let up for the remaining 45 minutes. \\"Rooty\\" is leaner, meaner, and tighter than its debut \\"Remedy.\\" Give this a whirl on your CD player; you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can not stop listening to this CD","review":"This whole CD is great.

There's the big beat in-your-face production, but the sounds are all sweet and poppy. There's a few decent cuts like \\"Jus 1 kiss\\" and \\"Get me off\\", but most of it is just inane noise. I really hate this type of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"apart from the few singles, alot of mindless dribble","review":"this album is not much like the previous remedy cd, the singles are ok and show the basement jaxx that everyone knows. Although i found the single \\"where's your head at\\" kind of annoying the other singles \\"romeo\\" sounds like vintage bj music same with \\"just 1 kiss\\",\\"do your thing\\" and \\"get me off\\" was an ok techno song.The rest of the cd is a bunch of mindess dribble mess that go absolutly nowhere, songs like \\"breakaway\\",\\"crazy girl\\" and \\"SFM\\" are good examples and are skipable, unfortunatly i own this cd thinking it would be like \\"remedy\\" and i never will listen to this cd in its entirety again and i sadly admit this is one of the worst cd's i own but not the worst, that would probably go to daft punk's homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The?","review":"I remember when Basement Jaxx actually sounded serious and not goofy and stupid etcetra...What is this?

It was obviously produced to appeal to the mainstream \\"pop crowd.\\" Basement Jaxx first CD wasn't all that good, but at least it was more about making music that's different than most. This stinking \\"Rooty\\" CD is the exact opposite. It was made only because it's what everyone wants to hear these days. Terrible. When I check back later for who \\"agreed\\" or \\"disagreed\\" with this review that I've written, I have a strong feeling that \\"0 out of 100\\" will have agreed. This is because none of you pop-heads who disagreed with me have heard of Autechre, and you're most likely too shallow to explore music other than what the \\"cool\\" people listen to. Too bad for you, because the most stimulating and wonderful music out there in the world today is the stuff you haven't heard of and don't care to hear of.

The best song on the cd is Mr. Brett in my opinion, They are totally dissing ICP and Green Day on the track. All tracks are good other then 313 and the two other instrumentals. Snot's Lyrics (All Written by Lynn Strait exept for Deadfall) are very to the point and emotional about problems faced. Tecato is about the Drugs that Lynn did, and he said \\"Everytime I use I lose\\" so thats what he thought. The Box was written in a Prison while Snot was signing their contract.A great CD by a Great Band Rest In Peace Lynn + Dobbs"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Lynn was alive (RIP) he could not have done better.","review":"This is one of my favorite discs alltime. It has funk, metal, and rap, all mixed into one. They are heavier than Limp Bizkit, although they may not appeal to say Sepultra fans, because of the funk guitars. The best songs are Snooze Button, Joyride, and My Balls. I love how much Lynn's voice changes throughout the songs, and this is a must have for anyone who likes Korn, Incubus, Orange 9mm, or Ultraspank. It is definately a good purchase and you will be satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"a TRUE classic!","review":"No...this is not nu-metal. This is not punk. This is not Metal. This is SNOT...a band that had, or has for that matter, no equal. They were able to create one of the most energetic, unique, and awesome sounding records in the last decade. They can not be lumped into any one category, especially the dreadful category that is nu-metal. There are many elements of many different styles of music that are mixed into one album, and all done to perfection. I am sad to say that I was not able to see them live. I was a the Ozzfest in 98 when they were but, I hadn't heard of them, until a week or so after the show so, I paid them no mind. HUGE MISTAKE on my part!

The printer is fast and produces crisp, clean output that rivals laser printers in the $500 range -- and beats any inkjet printer, hands down.

It was very easy to setup, and the price is impossible to beat. No regrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven toner","review":"I bought this with an extra toner cartridge a year or two ago. I never really used it (I have another perfectly good laser printer), but my mother has been using it. Recently I switched laser printers with her and I noticed the left side of pages printed with the SCX-4100 fade terribly. I tried a lot of things to fix it - I removed the toner cartridge, shaked it. I used the other toner cartridge, but have the same problem. It's just not worth the hassle and frustration. My Brother HL-2040 prints nice and dark and even (I've been very happy with it), so I think the SCX-4100 will probably go to goodwill.edit: OK, I just realized I bought this over four years ago (wow, time flies), and I bought the HL-2040 less than two years ago...

Of course, the toner price is the catch. Tot up the total cost of ownership before you buy.My gripes? Well, the mail in rebate is a nightmare. I havn't managed to claim it despite diligently following the instructions. It feels like a scam. Secondly, although it is not marketted as Mac compatible, these days that's simply not good enough. I have just brought a new mac into the house, and having no support from Samsung on this is bad. Worse still is that there is a mac driver for it, that they withdrew a while back. Of course, no help from their support.Overall, you get what you pay for. Good value I suppose, but you'll pay for toner in the long term, and don't expect any bells and whistles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy; very bad quality, very expensive toner","review":"Do NOT listen to the others; they are probably Samsung workers planting postive reviews. The truth is, this printer has very terrible print quality, and the worst thing is (which no one else mentions) replacement toner cartridges are very hard to find and extremely expensive. This is a scam since each cartridge prints far fewer sheets than any other laser printers or copiers. Do NOT buy this. Get a better brand like the American HP or Lexmark or Japanese Sharp or Okidata."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive but good","review":"This printer is an excellent value. I bought it for about $130 (after rebate) and have been using it trouble-free in my home office for about 3 months. The print quality is surprisingly good for a low-end printer. Printing speed doesn't seem to reach the claimed 15ppm but is fast enough for home use.Beware of a few catches though. The default copy setting produces rather inferior copies. Setting the source to photo/text and increase the darkness makes better (but slower) copies. The LCD screen is very hard to read.

I find that this format is helpful for the modern \\"organ based\\" curricula currently used by many medical schools.All sections that I have used thus far are well written and fairly easy to understand. At times, the important topics are lost in minutia, but that is to be expected in such an exhaustive work.

Very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call it the Guide to Creating 12 Hour Shifts","review":"This literature is heavily biased to 12 hour work shifts. Not practical at all and very skewed. As an Industrial Engineer I have spent many years dealing with 24-7 manufacturing operations and there is much more data that supports 8 hour shifts for high fatigue situations than this book would lead you to believe. Was looking for data and alternatives and got neither. Lots of fancy words and conjecture. If you do not need the facts this book will impress your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have two of his three books and.....","review":".............I think he does a wonderful job at putting these works together. The only bone I have a the moment is that Mr. Walsh tends to make all his victims heroes/saints/outstanding figures of society. That cannot be true. All victims are not saint-like. Conversely, the bad guys have no worthy trauma in their background. Cut and dried, bad is bad, no slack from Mr. Walsh.

What a horrible mistake I made in choosing this novel to read on my vacation. A true waste of my valuable time.This novel had absolutely no character development, ridulous plot lines and an unbelievable ending that was forced and just plain stupid!! I waited for the excitement but it never materialized. Just so, so, bad!!!!I saw that the people that enjoyed this book gave favorable ratings simply because they have read the previous 8 or so books the O'Shaughnessy's have written previously. I can understand a certain loyalty but lets face it... this is nothing more than a soap opera on paper.Really, Really, Really bad guys......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time!","review":"I've read every Nina Reilly book the O'Shaughnessy sisters have written and eagerly awaited their newest book. What a disappointment! I found myself skimming the pages just to get to the end.How did Nina get so stupid between the last book and this one, i.e. mysteriously \\"losing\\" her car keys, leaving her briefcase in the backseat, etc. She makes one poor decision after another. Paul needs no detective skills because information \\"mysteriously\\" falls into his lap time and again. The remaining characters, Brandy, Angel, the Cruz's, and the Vangs left me feeling apathetic.What happened to character development, action, and suspense, as displayed in previous Nina Reilly novels? Hopefully the writers will take their time with the next book, leave out all the boring filler pages, and return our heroine to her previous self."},{"rating":"1","title":"It fails as a litigation novel","review":"As a practicing attorney I savored the idea of being able to endure a long flight and read a novel written about an area of law that receives scant attention in the popular press: professional responsibility. Unfortunately, I think I picked the wrong book and ended up with a dimestore \\"chick-flip.\\"The authors spend so much time trying to make women identify with the needs of the female main character that her rather interesting legal problems sound like a voice-over from a tampon commercial. Since one of the authors is a lawyer, she puts in just enough law to give it some credibility. Unfortunately, either they do not think their readers would be interested in a serious litigation novel or they want to push what appears to be an improbable plot line on the readers, so people who would be genuinely interested in the plot details are left hanging, angry, and thinking the whole story is improbable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Unft","review":"There sure seems to be no shortage of loyal fans of this series, but after my first Nina Reilly read, I am at a loss as to why. 454 pages in paperback might have benefited greatly from being about half that. I don't think writers are paid by the word, but when you read sentences like \\"Nina went with the evocatively named lemongrass-skewered sea scallops\\" you can only shake your head.Or how about the denouement ... where her lover is about to topple over a railing ..., looks at Nina, smiles (SMILES? As you're nearly falling to your death?) and says \\"love you?\\" Really bad stuff.The trial (during which I was rooting mightily for disbarment) scenes are void of tension or interest. Like another reader, I skimmed quite a bit just to get through it - I did shell out [money] after all. It became almost a perverse challenge to finish this. God bless the O'Shaughnessy sisters for getting away with this kind of writing, but they won't [draw] me in again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I usually relish the chance to read a new Perri O'Shaughnessy.I thought the main plot line was somewhat unbelievable. If Nina is such a hot shot lawyer, and of course we know she is from the previous books, she would not leave her briefcase containing suchimportant files, in her car overnight.The female police officer and the female prosecuting attorney are just totally unbelievable in their language and approach to Nina. Very stereotypical, we don't like beautiful smart women.<P..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introductory video","review":"I have been reading about the Pilates method for a long time but since we do not have Pilates classes in my part of the world, I wasn't able to learn more. I bought this video hoping to get introduced to the method. And I must say that I am very happy with my purchase. The instructions are very clear and the tape provides ample time for the viewer to master each movement. Since I have not seen a live Pilates class, I cannot say whether this is a good introduction to the Pilates method but whatever it is it works great. After a few sessions, I really started feeling the effects, I felt longer and more flexible. And what's more, a few days ago I went to a physical therapist for a back problem and the exercises she recommended were all parts of the method introduced in this video. The only thing that made me give 4 stars is that it is a bit long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent instruction","review":"I felt this was an excellent introduction to Pilates. It does seem slow moving but it gets the job done as far as the results. I also have Living Arts Beginners Mat workout. It's fast paced compared to this but I didn't feel I got as good or as deep a workout as with Lynne Robinson's video. I have over 30 years dance background and 19 years yoga and I have just got interested in Pilates and I'm more impressed with this video than the Living Arts one. The neck in the LA one is in an unnatural position most of the time and is strained. I felt Lynne's instructions were gentle but effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing for the rank beginner","review":"I didn't get very far with this. Ms. Robinson begins with an inspiring talk about what pilates can do for you and then lies prone on a mat talking about what she's doing with her muscles. I couldn't follow the explanation. I admit that my abs are ridiculously weak and I am not knisthetically gifted. Those with some previous exposure to pilates may benefit from this video, but it's really confusing for an out-of-shape beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, Intriguing, and, Yes, Down-to-Earth","review":"For a thoughtful overview of ufos, entertaining for the devoted ufologist and educational for the beginner, this is a great guidebook to the forms and patterns (I loved the section on flaps) evidenced by unidentifed aerial phenomena. The drawings are amazing, the text is down-to-earth, and these two well-known authors are very informative. Every school library should pick this one up, every parent should buy it for their kids, everyone would do well to buy this for some good bedside reading.

I perused mine over lunch that day and confirmed that \\"Inside Out\\" is little more than a glossy, book-length version of the weekly internal newsletter--peppy, vapid, and grindingly dull.

It's too fragile and thin for that. Fly it in your front room as I do and you'll have no complaints. It'll be well worth the investment.

On this VOX recording, Horenstein peforms the 1890 version of Bruckner's score!There is something haunting about the less than perfect sound of the Vienna Symphony. In addition, the reverberant mono sound obtained by the VOX engineers adds to the cataclysmic mystique of the music!In my opionion, Horenstein along with his mentor Wilhelm Furtwangler, are among a select few who interpret Bruckner the way Bruckner would himself!If you like Bruckner and decide to purchase a complete set, my only recommendation would be Jochum's EMI set. Remember, Bruckner was an organist, and he had pipe organ music in his blood when he composed his massive orchestral canon!

Schuller, it is easy to assume they are so upbeat because they've had an easy life. This insider's account of Dr. Schuller's life makes it plain that that has not been the case and upon further reflection, one realizes everybody faces their own set of challenges in life. In fact, a person becomes a positive influence for good by overcoming challenges. Dr. Schuller's son in law authored this book so he knows his subject matter first hand.I have been an admirer of Dr. Schuller for a long time. His insightful wisdom has helped me in numerous ways to experience a better life than I would otherwise. Reading this book helps you to see the connection that one person's overcoming has a ripple effect on many other lives. Dr. Schuller's victories were victories for those of us who have learned from him. He has been used of God to motivate, inspire, and bless. I pray that I will be such a vessel too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"This is the only rewinder found at my local Best Buy, so I bought it.

The curved handle allows me to choke up 1-2 inches for a conventional feel if I need the extra control, or I can just grip it and rip it. The extra leverage is noticable on inpact and the handle doesn't transmit anywhere near the shock of my old steel handle. The smooth curve of the head also allows for nearly mar-free nail pulls, even out of cedar facia - a nice bonus.If the hammer lacks anything, it might be a touch more difficult to toe nail into a top plate (from below) due to the rectangular head, but thats all I noticed after a week of framing.

I have never heard anyone breeze through the 3rd movement of the Tchaikowsky like this man. Simply unbelievable.Of course, if it was just about speed, he wouldn't be the violinist that he is. Gitlis is one of the most impassioned musicians I can think of, whose love and mastery for the violin does not overshadow his ability to serve the music.Is he the best in all of these concertos? Such a concept is incorrect in the first place, since there can be no \\"best\\" interpretation. Is this set worth being a part of anyone's music collection? Undoubtedly.Incidentally, Amazon France has many more of his CD's, including the one with Martha Argerich mentioned in another review.

You should get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"43 seconds !!!","review":"I'm giving this 5 stars despite the fact that Ivry Gitlis makes a blatant mistake 43 seconds into the Bartok concerto. He couldn't stop to do another take? The conductor didn't make him start over? The producer didn't make him start over? What the [heck] is the matter with these people!The sound quality is too good to be a live recording. There is no excuse for a flaw within the first minute of a studio recording. I don't care if that odd note at 43 seconds was intentional. I consider it a flaw.If you're familiar with Bartok's second violin concerto, you know how beautiful that opening theme is. Ivry Gitlis should have nailed it.Now that I've gotten that out of my system, I must concur with the previous reviewers.

I have bought 3lb bags of generic carbon from a seller here on Amazon and that stuff works just as well.The difference? On this product they break it all into tiny little bits compared to the cheap stuff is usually in pellet form.personally I have considered even grinding or blending (in a blender) the cheap stuff to see if you can achieve the same consistency as the more prepared stuff from this company or Marineland. Not that I can or can not prove ot really makes any difference.Personally I am going back to the cheap stuff. I clean my filter every two months and replace the carbon then and like I said can't see any difference.

I've had exactly the same problem as everyone else - skipping really badly; didn't matter which position I selected in the carousel. I think I was able to watch 3 movies without disruptive skipping over the last 1-1/2 years. Though I did purchase another one once I realized this was a problem, I kept trying to see if I could figure out what was wrong with the Phillips. I initially thought the DVD was dirty or defective, only to find it played fine in my portable DVD player. I finally disconnected the Phillips and am ready to toss it. I won't even donate it to a thrift store for fear that some family may look forward to using it only to be at least as disappointed and frustrated as I was.

If you're trying to save money you may think that such a flaw is ok. Well, IT IS NOT. It is painful. I have 3 kids jumping around, and, from time to time, it is used to pacify or reward them. Such a wait complicates that process. (The preceding example is not intended to make this a \\"Daddy\\" review) Stay away from any DVD player where a reviewer mentions the slow response time. It's not worth it. Go get a second job if you have to but spend a couple hundred more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK!!!!!!!","review":"This was my first stand-alone DVD player and what a disappointment is has been.

This is a total piece of trash, I would not even give a product like this away for free. When I first purchased this model, I went home, plugged it in, and the tray would not open! I then took it back to the store and got another one. This time, I am encountering the problems that everyone else has listed--skipping and freezing--even for new discs. My success rate with being able to play a disc from start to finish without problem is less than 50%, which is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.Even worse, I wrote Phillips a scathing letter with no acknowledgement from them whatsoever. I was going to send it back to them to get it repaired, but after reading the reviews below, I won't bother. I'll just pitch this in the trash, so thanks to everyone for saving me the postage.

This player starts skipping about an hour or so into a DVD and sometimes will even lock up entirely. I have to switch over to my PS2 to watch the rest of a DVD, it's incredibly annoying.I called Phillips customer service. Even though I had registered my product, I was told that my only option was to replace this unit with the same model AND it would cost me a bunch to do so. No thanks, I'm going with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible DVD player","review":"It is very difficult to get the player to play many of my DVD titles that work just fine elsewhere.

We purchased our Philips DVD player as part of the home theater package. We love the receiver portion of the theater package but hate the DVD player. I think Best Buy wishes I didn't purchase the 4 year extended warranty package because it is going back for the second time in five months and I have every intention of taking it back every time until they know me by name. My procrastination and the long lines at Best Buy have stopped me from taking it in months ago. If you own one of these, don't think that it is the DVD disk that is bad because every time I thought it may have been a bad rental, we ended up plugging in our portable DVD player and finished watching the movie, with no troubles. So, if you are looking at buying a DVD player, take the advise from many others and look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this 5-disc DVD changer - Zero Stars Rating","review":"Unfortunately, this is an example of deceptive advertising on the part of Philips.It is billed as a 5-disc DVD changer. However, it is a ***manual*** changer. You have to physically press a button on the unit itself or the remote control to get the unit to play the next disc in the sequence. It will not automatically go to the next disc.Further, the unit's internal programming is poorly done. It can take over 60 seconds for the unit to respond to a command, such as: open the disc drawer to insert/remove a CD or DVD, or to simply load a CD or DVD to play.This is a very poorly designed unit, with very poor performance in terms of its user interface. I certainly would not recommend this unit to anyone wishing to purchase a multi-disc DVD/CD changer, regardless of the price offered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure junk","review":"I thought a manufacturer like Philips would be roughly equivalent to other major brands. The 782C is pure junk. I couldn't play 75% of DVDs I tried. Commands took a looong time to execute. And when you entered another command while it is thinking about the current command, it could lock up. The CD mode played all the CDs I tried, but compared to my CD-only Sony changer, it was like going back to the early 80's in technology.On the otherhand, my JVC DVD worked excellently and played all the DVDs I couldn't watch on the Philips 782C."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS - Philips needs to recall this piece of junk","review":"I have had the same problems as the other reviewers.

His pace and rhythm were far too slow and dull to capture the most out of these pieces. If you want to hear a richer and far better treatment of the Goldmark concerto (a very underrated work in my opinion and one that certainly deserves wider exposure), as well as livelier interpretations of Kreisler, I recommend Itzhak Perlman's recordings of these pieces. They are well paced and snappy without being played too fast and truly bring out the best in Kreisler and Goldmark."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few spins required","review":"Yet another classic album no question. Joni M's view of the world from her TV armchair in 1985. As always with there is a great match between music and lyrics with this artist. Fantastic vocals. NOT DATED. Most listeners will now be comfortable with the modern style sounds that may have been off-putting for certain fans at release time. It takes a good few listens to fully assimilate Joni M's records not because of the instruments but because her music has unusual chord progressions and rhythm. She is just on a different musical plane to most artists. So under appreciated. Doubters should simply listen more but most folk won't. No weak tracks here at all. Again."},{"rating":"1","title":"De-Klein","review":"Far from her best...so far it is hard to recall that she ever produced her best while listening to this mess. Klein is short for DeKlein in my book. His bland overcooked production turned Mitchell from her most exciting path (her jazz explorations) to boring MOR dreck. Why she continues to use him as a producer remains a mystery. As a longtime Mitchell fan I often feel robbed of several years that could have followed through on the promising directions of Summer Lawns and Hejira. Instead he lead her in a downward spiral and finally inactivity. His track record speaks for itself, producer of an audiophile who's who of bland singers marketable only to the absurd egos of audiophillia, who typically listen to snippets of sound, rather than whole songs, let alone whole albums. Sadly his latest victims are Luciana Souza and Raul Midon, both of whose talents he has squandered, as sis his norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Joni, return to your accoustic folk sound","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Joni Mitchell.

This is Joni's Ray-gun Era protest album. If you remember, televangelists were found to be bilking millions out of their members, the Dynasty lifestyle of conspicuous consumption was in vogue and cigarettes could still be purchased from the old mechanical pull-knob machines. Fast forward to 2000--Rod Stieger still does a pretty good self righteous reverend and holy hope is still \\"in the hands of snakebite evangelists and racketeers and bigwig financiers\\". And it is still Dog Eat Dog, more of us have waken up... And, in all, Joni's experimenting with the likes of Synthesizer Scientist, Thomas Dolby has produced enduring music that the techno/trance/trip/hip/deejay crowd should take note of especially for the way she and her collaborators were innovating.

The idea was to circulate the air & remove some of the musty odor. 1)the purifier vibrates the floor, causing increased noise, 2) the musty odor has not decreased,the air does not feel/smell crisp, 3)if you turn the machine off or unplug it the filter clean sensor resets itself, as if you put a new filter in. Which is not good, that means you have no idea how dirty the filter is."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor!","review":"This air purifier is advertised as having a charcoal filter, which is needed to remove smells from the air. It has only a 'dusting' of charcoal on the prefilter, which doesn't remove odors for long enough to be useful. The design is also bad: the air intake and outlet aren't well separated, so after a little use, it is putting out dusty air into the room. It might be good for those who need only a HEPA filter, but they're not likely to want to breathe dusty air!The online description of my model was inaccurate, too. As I understood it, I needed to get this model to get the charcoal filter; but actually, this model had a remote and was programmable, which I didn't want, and all [both?] the models with this round shape have the same poor charcoal filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flippin' LOUD!!! Don't Believe the \\"Quiet\\" Part.","review":"This unit and the programmable version 17000 are NOT at all quiet. I foolishly bought them sight-unseen (or sound-unheard) because of Honeywell's advertizing claims of quiet operation. They are LOUD my friends, so much so that I can hear them three rooms away on the lowest setting. Forget about setting them on high, the noise level is intolerable. At least the programmable unit lets you set a timer to turn it down or off automatically before you get home so you don't have to do it manually every day. I feel that I was deceived in order to make a sale. I guess 'quiet' is a matter of opinion. It IS quiet compared to an atomic blast."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quiet","review":"i purchased this item a while ago and returned it immediately. it's not quiet and is very bulky."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as quiet as Honeywell claims","review":"I bought this model because it said Ultra Quiet on the box and even bragged about how it achieved such a quiet motor. I'm rating this 2 stars because I feel Honeywell did not live up to what they advertised. On the lowest speed, this thing was still loud enough to hear over my t.v. set. On speeds 2 and 3 it vibrated my hardwood floor and was obnoxiously loud! I tried using it downstairs on the carpeting, but was still annoyed at the sound, so finally returned it. I checked out a larger Honeywell unit (round / appx. $239) and it was indeed very quiet on the lowest setting. I will probably spend the extra $$ on that one. Whatever you buy, try it out in the store first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lifesaver for people w/pets & allergies","review":"This is an affordable godsend.

Keep up the good work!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"QuietCare for Medium to Medium/Large Rooms","review":"This is an excellent unit. Thorough air circulation, programmable, and I like the filter status indicator.The only problem I have with it is the noise. For this purifier to be true to its name with the low setting, use it in a room that is 20' x 20' or greater. When I am 10' or less from it, I can hear sharp and high-pitched sounds from the airflow. The big sound of air whooshing doesn't bother me, it's the higher stuff.I also have a large EnviraCaire HEPA unit that has comparable purification with a lower airflow note.To use this in a smaller room I run it 15-20 min. on med or high; then I can come back to the room and switch it off. Of course mileage will vary depending how easily allergens get back into the room.

I can't understand why reviewers are saying they got through this book in 2 days. This book is so jam-packed with information and details that if anyone reads it within 2 days, they are skipping ahead to the murders and not reading all that came before. It took me a week to read this book,and grasp it all, and it was quite good. Mr. Walker makes no bones about the fact that he loves his mother and adored his brother. That's different, and perhaps nuts, but also interesting. And it takes a LOT longer than a day or two to read this book. I know: took me 3 hours to read \\"A Stranger Beside Me\\"; took me a total of 6 hours to read the three books out on Darlie Routier; took me a month to slough my way through the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. This is NOT a quick read, but is worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to follow!","review":"Very interesting read from an insiders perspective!

Its a cliche but I laughed, cried and my heart ached for this family. If you want to know the REAL story, Kent Walker is obviously the best source since he was raised in the center of this madness. I wouldn't waste a minute reading any other book on the Kimes saga. This book is the one to beat. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"I put it down.","review":"There is nothing redeeming about this book for voyeurs of dysfunction.

HA! He comes off almost as dispicable as the mother and son. Knowing what a con his mother was, he subjected his own kids to Sante's schemes. He sounds like a real low life and I am sorry I contributed to his coffers. He is only out for the money, as he said many times in the book. As for the book itself, it was filled with lots of details and irrelevant facts, but certainly was not an insightful piece of work. The whole story was depressing just knowing how uncaring and dishonest people can be to each other. This book needs to be written by someone who is NOT telling us the murderers are really good way down deep! YUCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grifters and Murderers - A Chilling Story","review":"An amazing account of the life of Kent Walker. From childhood to man, you will read the bizarre tale of Kent growing up with a mother and brother who beame the most notorious con artists and infamous murderers in recent history - Kenny and Sante Kimes. His chilling story takes you inside his family in this spellbinding account of living in the midst of insanity, fear, and ultimately murder! The book's captivating story makes it a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book in Need of an Editor","review":"This is an interesting story, but could have been told in a more gripping manner by editing the length by slightly over one hundred pages. There is much repetition throughout. Some portions move linearly in time, but the reader may often be caught short when there are sudden inexplicable leaps backward in time. One gets the impression that Harper-Collins wanted to get the book to press quickly, so did not allow one of their fine editors to spend sufficient time with it. This book is likely to only appeal to those die-hard \\"True Crime\\" readers, especially those who enjoy re-reading the same information repeatedly and relish hearing tales of psychopathology from a participant's viewpoint. One does get the feeling that one would not want to be involved with any member of this family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary","review":"I stayed up until one in the morning to finish this book, and the only thing I could think about is that it is scary to have people like Sante Kimes running around. I could hardly believe anyone was this self-serving and evil. I felt sorry for Kent at first, but as the book went on, he showed (and admitted) that he was as greedy as his mother was, although not to the same extent. Its shocking that he would subject his family to this woman, and its shocking that his wife put up with it. I am also surprised he didn't have to serve time as well. He's lucky he didn't. I'm sure he has his money now, though. It is a well written book, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE REAL DEAL","review":"This is the best true crime book ever written. Kent Walker with Mark Schone take you through and incredibly gripping true story of what it's like to grow up as Sante Kimes's kid. From the first page I was hooked.

Thank you Kent for sharing a very personal story I'll never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Too much has been written about this duo and most of it isn't worth reading.

But that doesn't mean the headphones are bad, it means the source is.These things are very comfortable ive been wearing them for over a year, still kicking hasn't broken at all. It has a detachable wire which comes in handy. The adjustable size also works fantastic. There is nothing wrong with these headphones.Price vs quality ratio these are the best.

Check out Ditching Mr. Wrong, by Nicholas Aretakis. I recently had to read a stack of dating books for a writing project, so I've had a chance to compare every relevant title out there. In Ditching Mr. Wrong, Aretakis betrays the \\"secret handshake\\" between guys and lets gals know what tricks and traps to avoid when single men are on the prowl. If I had a 20-something daughter, I'd buy Ditching for her instead. The viewpoint in He's Just Not That Into You is, in my eyes, a tad misogynist. Ditching, on the other hand, shows women how to quickly vet a Mr. Wrong so she doesn't waste her time. It's also chockfull of fun tips, quizzes, and checklists.

His relative obscurity might have to do with his lifelong dedication to teaching (at the Paris Conservatoire). At this same institution he studied the little-known piano works of Faure (former director of the institute) with the composer himself.

Unfortunately and ironically, Weinman has about as much experience designing Web sites as my 8 year old, who dabbles in HTML!What is even more amazing is that she admits her lack of experience in the introduction to her first book. Stating, she NEVER even created a Web site, YET there she is telling the world how to design web sites all the same! Weinman may have a background in graphic design, but graphic design and Web design are two different things.To see just how much Weinman's Verve, Vivacity and Vision is crap, visit her web site.

You can't go wrong with this book, but Siegel's is a bit \\"meatier.\\" He presents more typographic advice, but tends to hand down rules as if from on high. \\"Killer Web Sites\\" can be a bit snooty, but it's also usually right.

Very little fly fishing in this movie. If you are into watching a bunch of guys sit around and talk, by all means buy this video immediately. The actual steelheading footage in this movie looks like it was pieced together last minute. Short 5 second clips of them holding steelheads. The longest sustained fly fishing footage in the video (20 seconds) was showing a guy tangled up in his line who had never spey casted before.

There are many sample letters, sample conversations with patients, formats for oral presentations, formats for writing a medical journal article and more. I'm using it now with a Japanese researcher here in the US as she prepares to present her research at a conference.

It was recommended by my doctor, whom I now regard as somewhat of a quack. One of the more ludicrous claims the books makes is that constricting one's anus _more_ than the 100 times per day recommended is not suggested and can lead to health problems. I can say with absolute assurance (pardon the pun.. continuing) that constricting the anal muscles MANY more times than simply one hundred times daily has had no adverse effect on me whatsoever. In fact, I'm constricting it right now as I write this, and I've been doing it all day, almost non-stop. Certainly totalling upwards of 1000 times.In other words, the book seemed very attractive to me based on its subject matter due to what I already brought to it from personal experience, yet I received no new information whatsoever and, in fact, a great deal of MISinformation was, instead, imbued.Thanks for listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"changed my life","review":"I was very skeptical, being in law enforcement and all, but my wife \\"forced\\" me to read it as I was short-tempered and high-strung.

I haven't read it cover to cover, but I've digested a good chunk of it. A significant portion of it is dedicated to reprinting USENET posts, where Nishigaki posts his ideas to a depression newsgroup, and every other poster gets completely and utterly baffled. The first few chapters are just this sense of back and forth. Then it launches into heavy theory, written in that zesty sense of \\"Engrish\\" as seen in the description. Its method for combating depression is something that I have yet to even consider trying, but as a general humor book, this is probably one of the funniest and most bizarre reads you'll encounter.

But when you consider not only the animation--which is as good as it gets--but the music, the cultural references, they really do stand out as important works of art.We don't edit offensive things in art museums, or important novels because it would be like altering history.

You screwed up and you're going to have to fix it by issuing brand new sets with new art or a sticker on the box indicating the new pressings so I know that I'm buying the unedited versions.

All I can say is that I was especially careful with mine and still it broke off. Now the filter is useless. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this filter.

That is the death spot on the device. My friend had the regular Katadyn Hiker, and it was basically the same product only it lasted much longer.

For one, you can get \\"Privacy Director\\" from the phone company. Anyone who calls you from a non-caller ID enabled phone must state their name and you get to hear their recording if they choose to ring through; you can then decide to take their call or not.

I left it alone, ran some errands and came home to a loud, screeching sound from the phone! I disconnected the TeleZapper and all is well.

Now, I might get one every 3 days, and I don't think it is a computer generated call. I have the Telezapper set to advanced mode (3 tone disconnect signal). The reason I gave the unit 4 stars is because the unit was delivered with a dead battery. Please be aware of this. When it is connected to your phone line, you should hear the disconnect tone when you pick up your phone. If you don't hear the tone, then the battery is dead. The battery was easily available at my local Longs drugstore.

I had the blocker service on my phone, purchased through the telephone company. It did a great job of filtering out calls from telemarketers. But, what I didn't know was, it also filtered out calls from phone cards and all 800 numbers. I have some relatives and friends that have either phone cards with limited minutes or an 800 number they use. The blocker service I had wouldn't let these calls through.

As another reviewer stated below, after a couple of years, when using my cordless phone, I started to hear static, then eventually, I heard a very loud, annoying pulse tone which the person I called also heard.Assuming the line noise was due to my phone/DSL line, I called my telephone service provider to check the line. I was thinking of changing my DSL line filters or buying a new phone (assuming some problem with my Panasonic 2.6 GHz phone). When I figured out this device was responsible, the Zapper went immediately into the garbage.Not sure what started the problems (bad battery?, latent defect?). In the end, am not sure how effective this device is as I still received plenty of unsolicited calls. In any case, this device was not worth the trouble and cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add a New BatteryTo This Purchase","review":"you'll be glad you did.my Telezapper arrived today. lots of talk on here about them not working.it's true, and it's about the battery. this is how you install a fresh one:remove the two small screws in the bottom of the unit.remove the casing, and make sure you're replacing with a CR 2032 battery.when you peek inside (and that's all there's room to do)you'll see the round battery sitting in a small housing unit. one side of that unit has braces, and the other side is open.use a long thin object and push the battery out through the open side of the housing unit.slide the new battery back inside the housing, with the writing on the new battery face down.you should be all set.like i said, my unit just came today, but i have high hopes now of getting my Sundays back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Kay Parking Sign","review":"Big hit with my daughter.

This was such an amateurish film, I could hardly believe it was being shown in a movie theatre -- it looked more like a film school project. The point-of-view of the story bounces around (either told by a narrator or told by St. Therese herself), the acting is terrible, the cinematography is worse, and ultimately, the story is so poorly told that I'm sure it did not do justice to St. Therese's life. The movie version of her story is still waiting to be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Little Flower","review":"The Little Flower blooms with this film. It tells the story of St. Therese.

A bit expensive at $35 a pop, but it's Amazing!!! Surreal at times and puzzling as you try to get yourself inside her mind. Gorgeous with a captivating performance by the lead. You will learn a lot about her spirituality, her doubts/struggles, & relationships with her sisters & Sisters.Therese"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"This movie is one I would be embarrassed to see with Catholic friends and would avoid seeing absolutely with non-Catholics; it is one of the worst acted films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Honestly, I've seen high school plays with better acting and dialog than this. At every turn, it is cloying and revoltingly sentimental, what the French call 'mièvre.' It is something you might expect to find in a down scale religious bookstore, right there beside the silly luminous statuettes of our Lady of Lourdes and plastic St. Christopher car ornaments.I am an orthodox Catholic who loves the Church and I simply hate to find products like this that imply believers are simpleminded philistines. How anyone in the Vatican could recommend something so poorly done escapes me unless the person in question was a secret Mason interested only in undermining the Church's credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt like it at all","review":"This movie is ridiculous and a terrible protrayal of St Therese, based on the countless books I have read about her.

The trouble is, one doesn't really learn anything about the saint as this movie clumsily copies and pastes sections from The Story of a Soul leaving out major parts. It plods along and meanders to nothing.

The acting was amateurish and the dialog was stilted and unnatural. I have great love and respect for St. Therese of Lisieux because she was tender yet courageous, gentle yet determined, and most of all, holy in spite of intense personal trials.

The most important thing to know about Therese is that she was called to the priesthood, and was denied any opportunity to follow her vocation due to RCC obsessive misogyny and sexism. DeFillipis, of course, doesn't mention any of this, and, in fact, follows standard RCC procedure in turning Therese into a safe, ineffectual, harmless, powerless Barbie Doll.

That brought back memories. Being ex-military I could also relate to lots of the story. I liked the exciting pace, and was never bored. Some stretches were too Harlequin romance novel for me, though. I just rolled my eyes, skipped the couple of sappy lines here and there (and most of the epilogue) and moved on. All in all, it didn't spoil it for me, but I knocked a star off for it. A little hanky-panky is fine, but when we're moving to reunite families and crying over children and squeezing tears out all over the place, it's just too much for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friggin Amazing","review":"This was a well thought out book! I absolutely love James Rollins. It involved a Soviet ice station in Antarctica that was abandoned 70 years ago. It was discovered by a U S sub that inadvertently came too close to it. A sonar image picked up movement inside the structure and the crew went in to investigate. They discovered references to a Grendel which the ice station was named after.The Russians come in and try to retake what was theirs and the battle begins. This was an excellent book and I HIGHLY recommend it. It was hard to put down and I sat up late at night reading as late as possible..........."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an exciting and enjoyable read!","review":"A hidden research station in the Arctic Sea certainly makes for a thrilling setting! Rollins' characters are fully described and come to life within the book's pages. The monsters add a lot of excitement - and Rollins balances the facets of his plot quite well. Of the varied cast of characters, a few really stand out - the deaf Amanda and the surprisingly sympathetic Russian admiral, in particular. Though, I think Bane, the wolf-dog, particularly stole the show!Rollins' talent really lies with creating great, twisting plots, lively characters and weaving in fantastic elements in very lifelike scenarios. It all combines for a fun and thrilling read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Over-The-Top Mayhem And Adventure","review":"Ice Hunt is another enjoyable over-the-top adventure with a tough guy hero, damsels in distress, and great bad guys. The whole set-up is cardboard - but it's wonderful cardboard, ha ha. The action comes fast and hard with one startling twist after another. I keep thinking he can't possibly keep it, but he does, almost leaving you woozy at times.Once again Rollins saves his novel with innovations such as the lost Soviet ice station, cutting edge WMDs, and an even more spectacular secret that I won't spoil. Much like Deep Fathom, Ice Hunt is most easily described as James Bond meets Indiana Jones and a barrel full of fun.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete action packed story","review":"This was my first James Rollins book and I was very impressed. Mr. Rollins uses a good amount of facts to make the story seem real and there is a good amount of action. The thing that impressed me the most was the finish.

I am so glad I did. In 'Ice Hunt' he takes adventure to a new level. The book's intense, the main subject very interesting (cryopreservation), and it reads like a combination of 007, Indiana Jones, and Dirk Pitt. A well rounded--and researched--adventure sure to please anyone with a taste for quality adventure.I have to agree with the Amazon reviewer, though. The cover art gives it a somewhat hokey look (mass market?).Most highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably wonderful THRILL ride","review":"This was one the first James Rollins book I ever read and have been HOOKED ever since!

I was tremendously excited and thought I was in for a great read. But about a third of the way through I began to detect serious warning signs of deterioration. The plot becomes labored, the situations redundant, the willing suspension of disbelief more difficult, the characters more cartoon-like. And those Grendels---after a while they're simply silly. I became bored. It kept getting worse until I finally, sadly, angrily threw the book in the trash.The book contains a fair number of errors a decent editor should have been able to catch.Rollins has considerable potential, I think, as demonstrated by the superb first part of the book---before the scene shifts to the ice island.

I'm not an electrician, but I've got a minor in electronics and have worked under an electrician in the past and I can tell you it is truly scary to have an AC transformer in an ungrounded metal box. There is a reason why this device is not UL approved, and that is because it IS NOT SAFE.So I cut the cable and installed a 3 prong plug and it took a 375 watt load for about 5 hours before the whole place smelled of ozone and the case was too hot to touch.

It probably hums when I use the blender too, but the blender is louder. It's very heavy for its size, but I carry it between the kitchen and bathroom regularly and it's fine.It arrived quickly and was very well-packaged. The plug doesn't fit the US mains but it comes with an adapter. I think it would enable US appliances to work in the UK with the correct plug adapters but I haven't tried that yet.Overall I am very happy with this product, but slightly nervous of the humming and whether this means it is dangerous.

I doubt you will find more difficult problems than those this author gives, and your teacher would have to be a sadist to test you with problems harder than these.

For a religion-oriented person this book may be appealing, but her frequent reference to \\"God this, God that, God-God-God,\\" is distracting to me, so I did not read very far into it. I would gladly DUMP the book at a resale site, only they're SO cheap (often under a dollar - see Amazon's \\"Marketplace\\" list) that it's not worth the bother to package and ship it. I can just give it away instead, to one of my 'religion' neighbors - they may be delighted with it.No offense to the religion-oriented folks anywhere. My mother was an atheist: Roman Catholic-raised, (terrorized/abused) drop-out/runaway, so we did not get the religion-indoctrination in our home -or- the god-programming routine that seems to compose so much of our species' \\"permitted\\" (trained) \\"belief\\" systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this!!!!!!!","review":"My wife had cancer and talked to this woman on the phone.

This modern day story/stories deal(s) with issues that this age group faces on a daily basis. In addition to seeing how others deal with an issue, the reader gets to be a part of the process. This book, similar to the choose-your-own-adventures in structure, also adds an element of how some choices can lead to good things and other choices can lead to not-as-good things. Fortunately, God can work with each situation. Readers, who love fast-moving, plot-based stories, will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe The Wrong \\"Kline\\" Cited","review":"I can't discern the precise purpose/audience of this volume.

He cites the important work of S. J. Kline on \\"conceptual foundations\\" of integrative work (1995). But he seems (I may have missed it) to overlook the book Interdisciplinarity by Julie Thompson Klein (1990). I would strongly recommend that semi-standard reference (along with Wm. Newell's edited anthology Interdisciplinarity: Essays From The Literature) as much better orientation and starting points for a \\"familiarization tour\\" of the complex field of interdisciplinary endeavor.The above is only my \\"considered opinion.\\" True, I studied both anthropology and literature, then wrote on interdisciplinary endeavor, then taught it in college.

All of the gripping surfaces on these gloves have exposed seems that are vulnerable to everything that is handled thus giving way to immediate thread ware. Needless to say once the thread wears the glove falls apart.If I had three months of use out of them I might not have given such a bad review however, these gloves began falling apart after about two weeks.

Moving wood, picking up weeds and gripping power tools were just a few of the tasks. I must say these gloves worked like a charm. It fits well and feels good. Not sure how the lined Kevlar comes into play but my hands are splinter and prick free. I also treated these gloves with no respect and they are still kicking.Cons: A problem I have with these gloves is how easily they can absorb water. I use them for moving my garden hose and it soaks up water like a sponge. Takes a long time for it to dry too. Additionally, if you are sweating a bit in your hands, it doesn't wick the sweat off too well. It's best to air dry these gloves after strenuous use."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy to cut for \\"cut resistant\\" no better than leather gloves","review":"tested these against the standard leather work gloves that Costco sells in three packs for 20 or 22 bucks.

Clearly you're not going to apply the tool directly to the glove, its not that strong but pokes and scrapes and errant cuts are a lot less likely with a pair of these on. They're quite warm though, so if using them in a hot climate get two pair so you can switch off and let one pair dry while you wear the other. In the winter, they're nice and warm for work gloves but you can still handle a nail or other small item.

The album is nothing more than a collection of sugar souless pop albums that I bet Steve Howe still feels ashamed today! In the mix, add some of the worst ballads ever written.

Later, I listened Alpha again but still it didn't sound any better than last time. Third listening time told me the truth! This is a exciting and reflexing album. You won't maybe love this when you listen to Alpha first or second time, but you should continue and find a real Alpha's heart. Asia's debut is classic and it is difficult to be not compering Alpha for it. In opinion, Alpha is almost as good as Asia. Sounds has changed dramatically and some people won't like these new and fresh sounds. All Asia's musicians have still excelent skills to play interesting music in their own way. Downes and Wetton duo have written 10 songs which are simply fine and shine songs. My favourite tracks are The Heat Goes On, Never In a Million Years and Open Your Eyes. The end of Open Your Eyes song is one of the Asia's best and it shows clearly their unbeliable musicial skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive but flawed","review":"This tissue holder is very attractive and matches other bathroom items that we have. It works particularly well if you have brass fixtures (e.g. faucets) in your bath. However, it is important to note that this is a COVER for a tissue box, not a container. The holder has no bottom. If someone reaches to pick it up, the tissue box stays on the counter and they have only the holder in their hand. What is even more important is the fact that if you slide the holder across your counter top, it will scratch the counter. (We have Corian) The scratching occurs because the metal edges are directly on the counter since there is no a base on the holder to elevate the metal edges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid beginner course - if you have patience","review":"If you just want to play this one in your car as you drive, don't bother buying it - on the other hand, if you want to learn Japanese effectively, and plan on taking the time to study, this series is the best out there.I used this for a year before moving to Japan, and its method of giving you an 'example sentence', showing you where the noun/verb etc goes, basically giving you a 'template' so you can create your own sentences. From experience, this is exactly how you must learn a foreign language. The CD isn't cluttered with English sentences - it is all Japanese, which is what you want.Listening to the cd alone will help tune your ear to Japanese, and as you are learning, you will be able to pick it up more and more as you go along.

So read no further if you care about such things.On a technical note, unlikeHelvetica, which I also watched on Amazon's Video on Demand, this film sound was plenty loud enough on my laptop's built-in speakers.My main complaint is that the movie makers falsely injected drama into the story by playing loose with the facts, as a little post-movie research revealed.The film repeatedly showed a graph of the Donkey Kong scores with Billy Mitchell's 1982 score at the top. In fact, Steve Wiebe beat that score in 2003, and when his taped, million-point score was rejected, he was still the official Donkey Kong record holder. Moreover, when Mitchell submitted his own tape, beating Wiebe's new record set at the FunSpot event, it was initially accepted (as shown in the film) but ultimately rejected (omitted from the film), leaving Wiebe as champ.I like niche documentaries, but this one didn't measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever.","review":"Seriously.

I don't want to say too much or cast too many opinions of things in this movie, because I don't want to spoil anything, but I definitely have respect for Steve Weibe...and all of the gamers in this movie for that matter.

Through the documentary I learned that - for some- Donkey Kong never went away. The documentary focuses on the lengths to which people will go to gain a bit of notoriety and it also allows the viewer to meet some interesting characters.The tension in the film comes when an upstart gamer from Washington state - Steve Wiebe - challenges the long-held record of the legendary Billy Mitchell. The film portrays Wiebe as a likable everyman and Mitchell as an evil schemer. The attempt at the record is all that happens in the film, but it's still quite interesting; the viewer comes away wondering why people become so absorbed in their hobbies and whether such hobbies can ever be healthy.The King of Kong is an interesting, unique documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious characters!","review":"What a great film.

King of Kong follows these people, including one man who got a \\"perfect game\\" of Pac-Man (every dot and every ghost).Good if you like documentary movies, interesting people, or arcade games!

(I won't go into details here because there is not adequate space, but you can Google the movie and read all about it if you're curious.)This was obviously done for dramatic effect, but when you're slamming somebody and calling their character into question by intentionally misleading the audience, that's not cool. Note that I have no affiliations with Billy and have never met him. However, I know several people who have met him (at the classic gaming expo events), and they say although he can be a little arrogant, he's a real nice guy and nothing like what the film shows.It's still an entertaining story, but just like television, don't believe everything you see."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand the hype!","review":"This movie has a lot of hype surround it.

I tend not to cook on this diet since most recipes contain some ingredients that are not allowed. The reviews were favorable so I ordered the book. The recipes though are not appealing to me and seem to be really out of date. They don't reflect the almost 20 years since that have been such a renaissance for the culinady field. It Doesn't make use of any of the new, varied, ethnic ingredients that are available now. The look if the book is also not appealing. It looks like 1989 (or earlier) in the oldfashioned typsest and hideous cover, althought I know it should not be judged by that alone.

Even the expensive shopping store, Whole Foods, sells it for $5.00. It has enough for one good mask or two if used sparingly. This product has a high glycol content. It does a really good job of exfoliation. Glycol peels in salons are a semi-intense experience. You are getting about the exact same thing with this peel. It exfoliates, semi-deeply and has some tightening effects. I wouldn't say it is a tightening mask, but has some effects of tightening. It works well for me and I am 36 years old. I have been using the product line for about a year and a half.

But, the matter is far more complicated than I anticipated. I definitely need to study this book in detail a second time around.

Such a time waster.Contacted Support and they said the card was never tested with Thermaltake. Unfortunately, there isn't a list of compatible docks, so, roll the dice!Unfortunately, I gave this card too many chances to work and the Return Window has shut.

The obvious and uninformed anti-logging approach to the national forests of Appalachia sounds really good, but come to the Daniel Boone and you will understand what devastation this has brought us. Uncontrollable wildfires, outbreaks of insects that threaten whole habitats and species, and economic hardships on an already depressed area. Management of our forests for multiple uses is essential. At the same time, the author interviews and praises the wife of a logger who brags about diameter limit cutting, which is just a fancy name for high-grading, which further degrades the forest.If this topic interests you, read the first couple of chapters, and then move on. The rest of the book is the same old droll that the public is barraged with on a daily basis. This book sure had potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toiletworthy","review":"I've read scores of books about photo history and criticism but have rarely encountered such an unbearable load of relentlessly postmodernist-deconstructionist-postcolonialist-genderbending cultural theory.

But please, if occasionally a cigar is just a cigar, can't the same be true of a humble photograph? Alas, no. At least not to Clarke, who sees every photo as built on a foundation of past political incorrectness, which he proceeds to survey like an archeologist examining the strata of a Pompein latrine.

It flows evenly, it rhymes, it tells stories about human beings' lives, feelings, and struggles.

All the costume are the classic 'ballgown' princess style, and most of them are ugly, as a matter of fact. I enjoyed putting my face onto these models, but I was disappointed that there were no costumes I really liked to put myself in.

I enjoyed \\"The Killer Angels\\" so much that I voraciously read all of Jeff Shaara's other books (I still have to read \\"The Glorious Cause,\\" but it just came out, give me time).Basically, both father (Michael) and son (Jeff) have a gift for accurate historical fiction. They both research the subject well, and pour themselves into the period and mindset to write very accurate historical descriptions that are true to the historical people they are based on.

The Shaara's know how to get into the minds of these individuals in a very real and human way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost","review":"Jeff Shaara is not his father, but considering that fact, he did a good job in completing the trilogy. Any book about the Civil War's last days is sad, and Jeff Shaara has done the best fictional work on that time period. I think Killer Angels was more novel, which made it come alive better, and The Last Full Measure was more historic, with less fiction: some people like it better the more accurate it is, but to me Killer Angels really made it easier to understand the different characters' points of view. That does not mean that The Last Full Measure is not an exceptional book. I just can't think of it as a continuation of the matchless work Michael Shaara started."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Read","review":"This book should appeal to those who enjoyed The Killer Angels. The most difficult task for the history-lover is getting beyond the made-up dialogue in historical fictions such as this. The author's tight adherence to historical fact and chronology make this task easy; the novel therefore suceeds as both an interesting personal drama of the principal characters (first) and well-written and very readable history (second). The novel is strongest when it is analyzing the thought process behind a character's actions (e.g., Lee's moves during battle). I also commend Mr. Shaara on presenting a fairly balanced view that does not favor the merit's of either side's cause too strongly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I was reluctant to read son Jeff's books after reading The Killer Angels, but I'm glad I did. He is a wonderful writer, with a clear style and an eye for the details of the men who fought so many years ago. Perhaps The Killer Angels is a better read, but both of the yonger Shaara's books can easily stand on their own merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Abridged Tapes of the Last Full Measure","review":"The book may be excellent, but I would avoid the abridged tape. There are so many discontinuities, the tapes are very confusing. Example: Tape 2 ends discussing 11 May (the Wilderness). Tape 3 begins on 29 June with Joshua Chamberlin in a hospital recovering from a wound. How did Joshua Chamberlin get wounded? If you listen to the tapes, you will not know. During the scene in the hospital he receives a promotion for gallantry at Petersburg. The tapes never discuss this gallantry. I am very curious why Jeff Shaara authorized this abridged version when he could have had a complete audiotape made.Stephen Lang has an excellent accent but overemphasizes depression and sorrow throughout the story. Every sentence seems to sound of this.Avoid the abridged tapes. Insist that Jeff Shaara make a complete set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got it Wrong","review":"Among the Civil War generals you find the most overrated general in American history--Robert E Lee and the most underrated--U S Grant. And here Shaara falls into the same rut of idolizing Lee and dumbing down Grant. A great injustice has be done to Grant through large swaths of American history and Shaara ham-handed treatment of Grant in this novel is more of the same. For a fuller and more accurate portrayal of Grant (non-fiction) try Jean Edward Smith'sGrant."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last full measure of mediocrity","review":"I still cannot understand how this fellow should be allowed to cash in on the genius of his father. The Killer Angels is a masterpiece work. If this is the only way the son can make a living-by cashing in on the brilliance of his father to write these pale cut and paste forgeries-then God help us as readers who waste the twenty dollars. Why can't we cherish the great work as opposed to being subjected to the K-Mart selling of the TRILOGY. There is no trilogy. There is only the KILER ANGELS from this family."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Full Measure","review":"The book seems fine, but the paperback book, purchased new recently from Amazon.com by my son-in-law , has a problem.

I really like the way he uses such detail, but for a ten-year old, some things are a bit to . . . well let's just say to intense. But still, I think Jeff Shaara deserves a very good honor for writing this anominously liked book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Affecting Novel on the last years of the Civil War in the East","review":"This is the novel that it seemed that Shaara came into his own. This part of the Civil War was incredibly brutal and Shaara depicts this well. The campaign that Grant and Lee waged was epic and Shaara brings out the humanity of these two men. This book seems just a notch below the \\"Killer Angels\\" and is superior in many respects to \\"Gods and Generals\\". It is populated by a very human Grant (this book made me want to read more about him) and a very ungodlike Robert E. Lee who propel the story. Chamberlain and his struggles are also depicted and are very relevant because his actions in the last year of the war were as heroic as his actions at Gettysburg. Appomattox is also depicted very movingly. Hopefully this novel will eventually be made into the definitive Civil War film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good end to the series","review":"For anybody who has read the first two books in this series this book wraps up the series beautifully. While this book does stand on its own and you do not have to read the previous two, I highly reccomend it. The battle scenes are well illustrated by the author as well as the horror lee must have felt of not being able to feed his troops. I think the best thing in this book is the choice the author made on the characters to center them on: Lee, Grant and Chamberlin. I highly reccomend this book as well as the whole series (Gods and Generals, The Killer Angels & The Last Full Measure) to anybody even if you are not a huge fan of historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I have just completed reading this book, finishing the three: Gods and Generals, The Killer Angels and now this... the series is an amazing depiction of the men who fought for both the Conferate and the Union. I cannot remember the last time that I have so enjoyed a book to the point that I am now scanning the internet to find more books about the era. A great way to experience the most dramtic time of our history without being bogged down by the strategies - but seeing it from the human condition that these men fought and died in. Highly recommend not only this book, but all three as a wonderful introduction to the men who fought in the civil war, their own struggles and personal conflicts.

Although it appears to be a great, extremely helpful book, being based on the chief, presenting complaint, the problem is twofold for American users. First, it uses American Heart Assoc. 2000 guidelines, not 2005, despite being published in 2005, and the AHA guidelines have changed significantly. Second, the book uses British units of measurement (for ex, cm of water, rather than mmHg for blood pressure). This book would be wonderful, a blessing, if it were up to date with current AHA 2005 guidelines & written for U.S. users. You can probably still gain value from it, but should be very familiar with American standards of measurement & current AHA guidelines before reading it, so you can read with discernment."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE ENERGY AND FORCE","review":"This is the best of Nitzer Ebb.

I give it two stars only because I gave up after about five chapters and may have missed something of value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthy book but so what!","review":"I found the \\"End of Time\\" extremely disappointing particularly after reading the recommendations on the back of the book. I never knew Jon Turney, John Gribbin and John Barrow to all be so wrong. This book completely lacks any discussions of what a timeless universe implies, indeed it wasn't until the notes that it was clear what the author meant by it. The \\"End of Time\\" is full of pages of argument as to why there is no time, but it's done in a very dull way for the lay reader, and, as the email printed in the notes shows, his thesis has far too many holes to convince more conventional physicists. There was absolutely nothing on what timelessness actually means, no speculation at all (which as a previous reviewer noted may be because there's nothing to predict). A highly worthy but dull book. I shan't be keeping it on my shelf"},{"rating":"1","title":"Science Fiction Not Science","review":"I found this book rambling, difficult to understand, and not particularly well written. The main thesis that all that exists is NOW (see the other reviews for more detail) was not proven in the book and, as far as I can see, cannot be proven empirically (mathematical proof without experimental proof is not adequate). In my opinion this book's theories belong to the realm of science fiction. If you want to let your imagination roam, anything is possible. Maybe everything is an illusion. Maybe I am the only thing that exists in the universe. Maybe there are all sorts of simultaneous universes that are constantly breaking in on each other. Etcetera. If I tried hard enough, I could probably support each of these ideas with concepts from quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity.I don't think it's unusual for theoretical physics to cross the line from science to conjecture: This book is in that tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would have been a great book.","review":"Bummer presentation with no pedagogical structure/path.

But a very unique and riveting hypothesis..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parmenides and Zeno resurrected","review":"I am always looking for a physics book that will enable me to evolve my perception of reality. This is not one of those books. Mr. Barbour makes an unconvincing attempt to convince the reader that a priori concepts such as causality and time are just an illusion. In the preface he states that he knows that most of the readers will not be able to finish the book, but if you read it to the end then all will be made clear. After suffering through the first 5 chapters, I skipped to the end and was convinced that he is wrong, and that time and causality are not an illusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes no sense","review":"I did not read the entire book. I don't think I could have gotten through it. I picked it up in a book store and read portions of it. Since this is a book intended for the lay reader this was sufficient to tell me whether the book was worth purchasing.I am not a physicist, just an educated layman. The book uses a whole bunch of scientific jargon to say nothing. To provide a convincing argument that time is an illusion Barbour must find some alternative way of explaining all those phenomena that we explain using time, like why firecrackers explode after the fuse is lit. He does not do this.I would recommend that anyone intending to buy this book first leaf through it at a library or book store. If it makes sense to you then more power to you. Go and buy it. Otherwise do not waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it no stars, if that was an option","review":"I am a lay person who reads a great deal of books about time and general/special relativity. Unfortunately, I was duped into buying this book by the reviews on the back of the book and the snazzy cover.However, the author simply rambles on and on and on, and never presents any scientific or mathematical proof that his theory is correct. This is quite simply the worst book on this subject that I have ever read. The \\"End of Time\\" has reinforced my position that I will never again buy another book in a bookstore without first having read the reviews on Amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It!","review":"I read a variety of books on Physics, Astronomy and other topics.

His narrative is very good, and he definetively motivates the interested reader. However, my impression is that he took good care of the first chapters of \\"The end of time\\", whereas the last part of the book dedicated to quantum gravity and DeWitt equation was written quite fast and without care.The beginner get confused. And if you are a physicist, or engineer with some knowledge of modern physics, you cannot grasp the essence. It is too qualitative.It would be interesting if any of these guys that claim to understand relativity and field theory target a book to a regular exact science professional.Nevertheless, I recommend the book to the reader interested in physics; it is motivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of time","review":"I have a strong mathematics/physics background and I found this book poorly written with almost no logical structure. I do not believe that the author proves anything. The hype does not justify the book. To wade through the text and find that there are no real, comprehensible and understandable arguments to support the title was a big let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Payoff","review":"I read this book when it first came out, and I just finished reading it a second time. With any difficult subject you keep tabs of the arguments as best you can, hoping that by the end the pieces fall into place for you. And even if they don't you still hope to find out how it can be expected to influence the subject it covers. Sadly, neither of these came to pass. The author's \\"time capsules\\" seem to describe snapshots of the universe in absolute time, but they include not just what we would call our actual universe but any possible configuration of the universe. We experience the most probable of these time capsules. But if time is an illusion what does it matter to us? What changes? What insight does it provide? The book may have been better off if it were written in a more technical manner for experts or with more analogies and descriptions for lay readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evidence of Mind Decay","review":"Try as I might, I have not been able to find any ideas within this book that add insight into the nature of our Universe. The author presents a tangled viewpoint which cannot be proven or disproven due to the fact that it suggests nothing.While reading this book, I was reminded of \\"The Physics of Immortality\\" by Frank Tipler. Although the Tipler book was far more entertaining and original, both books appear written by \\"scientists\\" who are trying to construct some sort of supernatural framework in which to justify an unstated religious viewpoint.The best religious texts contain little science and the best scientific texts contain little religion. I am always disappointed in a book which tries to connect both and winds up subtracting from the beauty of each."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I too expected more of this book based on prepublication advertising. It is not a book for physicists, but for philosophers. It does not compare well with other excellent books of a similar nature. To state that there are new physical principles in this self indulgent rambling is a misguided statement. If there were any concepts worth considering the author would have made predictions or suggestions of how they would be tested or the impact that his ideas would have on the scientific community. A revolution is needed against this type of book posing as a exposition of a new physical principle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time itself was never so convoluted","review":"This book was one of the worst I have ever read in my life.

Some of their stuff was uniquely creative and inspiring. So it was with great anticipation that I opened up this DVD.From reviews, I thought the absence of the orchestra in this would be fine, but I find the concert missing elements - it seems hollow and relatively uninspired. There just isn't energy here. Too bad, because the material - the original songs - are truly great. They could take you places, but the original tracks are better than this concert.There are maybe 2 dozen 'must-have-in-library' DVD concerts out there (Diana Krall, live in Paris, Pink Floyd, Pulse, U2, Vertigo, Norah Jones, Live in New Orleans, Peter Gabrielle, Secret World Live, Bela Fleck, Live at the Quick, just to name an eclectic few that are special)- this is not one of them unfortunately.

After viewing this disc last night I walked away disappointed. The video quality is excellent, the audio quality is good and the performance is great. But the editing of the video was terrible. It appears that the editor stuck with strict 100 frame chunks, which means that about every four seconds you are looking at a different performer through a different camera, without regard to what the music or performance is doing. This makes for a very hery-jerky performance that is very tiresome to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is for all Moodly Blues fans","review":"What a great DVD.

The Moody Blues (without founding members Mike Pinder and Ray Thomas) perform all their great songs in a 2005 show. The problem is elsewhere: without any purpose, the camera is moving almost all the time and can not concentrate on a single thing. The editing is excessive as well: each shot last just about five seconds (see for instance the intro for \\"Isn't life strange?\\", with about ten shots from various angles only for the opening flute solo). It is impossible to concentrate on a singer or a chord progression. I can not imagine a worst scenario for such a good performance spoiled by too much technique and useless visual effects. Undoubtly a very good performance by the Moodies; but a very bad filming creates a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Top Notch Performance","review":"All I can say is get this one.

As far as the quality of the shooting, it was high school direction and photography at best. Most footage was sloppy and 95% of it was of Justin. First time Justin appeared the least bit interested in his performance (as he has for the past twenty or so years looked like he was just punching a proverbial clock with a let's-move-on-to-the-next-venue-and-get-that-over-with-as-well attitude) while John seemed bored.

Nonetheless one comment : on the back cover it states that this DVD is \\"standard version presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of their original television exhibition\\" I'm not that sure as after viewing the entire dvd all the cartoons seem to have been trimmed a bit on each sides of the screen. This is very unnerving for a \\"collector edition\\", so much for quality..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wacky as ever...","review":"Wacky Races is a classic that is not only nostalgic but also continues to entertain. The bonus features are decent, with a few commentaries and pop-up trivia episodes and a couple of brief but enjoyable mini-documentaries. But buy this for the episodes themselves: as crazy as they ever were. The plot is paper thin and is essentially a premise for sight gags, predictable villainy and of course a very, very fun race. Don't expect 21st century animation, complicated stories or snarky pop-culture humor. Instead, there is good, funny, and always entertaining mayhem from weird characters and the wacky vehicles promised by the title. This is a good bargain and a well-presented DVD set. 5 stars for being exactly what I remembered and expected!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great spoof and wacky adventures","review":"Wacky Races was Hanna-Barbera's hilarious cartoon spoof of the 1960's comedies \\"The Great Race\\" and \\"Those Daring Young Men in their Jaunty Jalopies\\". The characters are all here; the perfect hero, the lovely damsel, the wacky inventor, the evil villain, plus an assortment of new characters including cavemen, gangsters, monsters, a WWI flying ace, soldiers, a hillbilly and his pet bear, a lumberjack and his pet beaver, plus many more. I must admit that the scripts are a bit sluggish now that I'm an adult (a bit repetitious and far-fetched), but what the heck...it's a cartoon for goodness sakes! This and George of the Jungle were the two reasons that I stayed inside on Saturday mornings. When it comes out..RACE to the store to get your copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wacky Races a real classic","review":"Each episode of Wacky Races contains that quack of a racer, Dick Dastardly, and his not-so-faithful sidekick, the toothy-grinned Muttley and their Mean Machine car. Who will you root for? Professor Pat Panding in his Converta-Car? The Ant Hill Mob, the pint-sized mobsters? Peter Perfect in his Turbo Terrific? Let's not forget that Southern Belle, Penelope Pitstop in her Compact Pussycat. So many cars, so many wacky races and so many dirty tricks from Dick Dastardly.This classic tv show is a favorite for \\"kids\\" of the 1960's and early 1970's like me.

Time flies, but the fire in the heart is still there, I suppose. So nostaglic it seems, but that's a well calculated project by Stallone. It succeeded, per box office and reviews here. Only around ten minute of boxing scenes, but for sure very captivating. In particular I like the motivational core message much. Twice from Rocky's mouth to win his son back on the street and to get himself up during the game, \\"It aint about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward.\\" In short, recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pound for Pound","review":"Once again, the meat hater comes out of retirement. He doesn't hit any meat in this movie, but he is great. It's just lunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should hold you off till Rocky 7","review":"Having never seen any of the Rocky movies before this film, I can rate this movie objectively.Obviously, story is rare in extreme sport movies, boxing, football, and the like; let alone in third sequels - this is to be expected. Rocky Balboa doesn't even attempt to draw us in the story, and I'm glad for it. Story or not; the movie has roughly five characters, your typical moral comeupance, and paints a good picture of a boxer's prime in the aftermath. The first half an hour has Rocky walking around saying \\"hi\\" and signing autographs to random people, the second act has Rocky eyeing a cute girl and her son, and the last half has some of the cheesiest boxing sequences availabe via camera.The movie is not an aim for success, but another in a big trilogy to bring us into Rocky's interesting world and I respect the film for it. However, if you've seen the trailer, you've pretty much seen Rocky Balboa in it's entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankfully a Lot Like the First One","review":"I liked the feel of this one from the very start. It is at times openly repeating Rocky I, which lends this movie it's progenitor's integrity, while still throwing in homages to the later movies without being tainted by their cheaper hooks. It's an emotional walk down memory lane with Rocky that quickly culminates in one bone-crushing fight.Stallone deserves credit for bringing this character to us, and this movie showcases all his talents (he wrote, directed, and starred in it) richly.No surprises in this one, but if you like the best the Rocky series has to offer, this film offers the chance to experience it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of it's legendary name","review":"The writing isn't that great and the acting is hit and miss, but this is one of the better Rocky films. Stallone ended the series on a high note with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply that good.","review":"I saw the first Rocky movie in the theatre. It impressed me enough to see the next four sequels in the theatre. And with ticket prices what they are, that is saying alot. So now I am in my forties and Rocky Balboa hits the theatre. I took my son wanting him to share the same feelings I did when I saw the original. I was hoping it wouldn't be a Rocky V and I got my wish. Sly got the character right! My eyes welled and a lump in my throat, I smiled that I got to share this movie with my son. Thank Sylvester Stallone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best since #1","review":"This is the best Rocky since the first one. Has all the heart and emotion of the first 2 and none of the fluff. In fact, if there wasn't a fight at the end, I would have been just as happy. (although the fight was great!) Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fitting tribute","review":"I have to admit, I was worried that this could not be done...I thought it couldn't be believable...that Rocky was just too old...but I have to say, I was wrong. This film was a wonderful tribute to Rocky's humble beginnings. I loved the music, seeing all the old places again...it brought me back to when I first saw Rocky as a little girl. Try this one, even if you have your doubts. You won't be disappointed. The only sad thing about the movie was that Adrian was gone, but even that added something special to the nostalgic look back at where Rocky began."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky Balboa is Great.","review":"Rocky Balboa is a great film one of the best in the series. I highly recommend it for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smart end to the series","review":"After the mild disappointment of Rocky V this sixth installment is the dignified ending to the series that fans were previously deprived of. Stallone does a great job of reminding us all just how talented he is as a writer, director and actor. A masterfully understated performance much more in keeping with the first two films. This is exactly what the fifth film aspired to be but didn't quite manage. Great performances and a rather believable story. What a great ending to a great sequence of films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky's Redemption","review":"\\"Rocky Balboa\\" saves itself and is good enough to make up for the horrid 4 and 5. The story goes back to its roots....that the championship is in the journey, not winning the title itself.Rocky's now a widower, having lost Adrian to cancer, and has a shaky relationship with his son. He's living a quiet life in retirement, but still feels that he has something left to prove to himself. He gets his chance and another bout in the ring with Mason Dixon.Like the original Rocky, this time it's more about a spiritual journey than the sport. Some of us have come of age along with the series, and it's great to see Our Hero go back to his roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky Balboa","review":"\`Rocky Balboa' is a pretty credible addition to the Rocky series which has a decent story, decent direction and decent acting from Stallone. Considering he wrote, directed and starred in this film that's not bad going at all. Following Rocky as he fights a comeback \`exhibition' fight with the reigning world champion, this film has plenty of fight scenes and Rocky training with the usual rousing soundtrack to add to the atmosphere. Stallone shows Rocky's motivation for wanting to fight again and his relationship with his son to good effect and the whole film builds on the Rocky franchise, whilst also redeeming itself against some of the more dubious sequels. Overall, if you're a fan of the Rocky films this shouldn't disappoint and if you're new to Rocky you can still watch this and get some enjoyment out of it without being aware of the full back story. Worth a look.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky. You Will Be Missed...","review":"Like so few movie heroes I've grown up with since I was a kid, Rocky will be missed the most. This film was done in true Rocky form. With cast members like Burt Young, Tony Burton, and archive footage of the loyal and ever-steadfast wife to Rocky, Talia Shire. And of the lengendary and beloved Burgess Meredith, Mickey, and my heart warms as I think of Mickey as I think of my own grandfather who was just as hard on me.Rocky was a household name. And EVERYONE knew who Rocky Balboa and the Italian Stallion were. The same person. Legendary, unforgettable, and the utmost hero when you needed one.Thank you, Sylvester Stallone, for bringing us this Legendary Hero. Rocky. You Will Be Missed... But loved forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sly's Great Rocky Finale!\\"","review":"Sylvester Stallone directs and stars in this 2006 drama.Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa returns to the ring to fighta young heavyweight champion.

I recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of the ending...lil spoiler","review":"I could only emphatically echo all of the other five star praise.

Talk about going out on your terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky Balboa and Ikiru","review":"I saw Rocky Balboa several times now, in the theater, and twice again on DVD. I respect the film more every time I see it, and I thought I'd write something about it and send it along. Rocky Balboa reminds me a lot of Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, one of my favorite films of all time. It's about one man overcoming his own sense of nostalgia, the negativity all around him, the false authority of bureaucracy, and finally finding peace within himself. The film depicts Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the snow, much as Kurosawa used the weather, and specifically a snow scene, to depict the moment when his main character finally gets in touch with himself in the present. I wonder how much of an influence Ikiru was on the film? Rocky Balboa is truly a masterpiece film, both for its screenplay and execution on film. It will stand the test of time as a classic, along with Rocky I."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as any other rocky movie!!!","review":"Yesterday my mom and I went to go see the new Rocky Balboa movie because we love all of the others. IT WAS AMAZING!!! Anybody who didn't like this movie needs some kind of help. Sylvester stallone is in the best shame you can be at age 60. This movie makes you appreciate all the other rocky movies even more. If you havn't seen it yet, get some tickets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT ENDING","review":"ROCKY BALBOA IS A VERY, VERY ENTERTAINING AND EXCITING FILM. THE FIRST 20 OR SO MINUTES OF THE FILM, PAINTS THE SITUATION AND ESTABLISHES ALL THE CHARACTERS, THEN IT IS TIME TO ROCK'N ROLL. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SEE THIS AS JUST A BOXING PICTURE, BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT. ROCKY BALBOA IS ABOUT NOT LOSING HOPE. IT IS ABOUT NOT GIVING UP.

I left the theater thinking \\"Rocky Should Have WON!!!!!\\". I had the same feeling I had after not watching number one for awhile and going back and seeing it. After watching the movie again on bluray and doing something ive never done before (watched all the extras)I decided I think the ending is just fine. There is another ending of the movie that is in the extras that while it felt good it didnt leave the same depth and contentment that the movie version had. I must say this is one that should have been made instead of 5. (even though I liked 5)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCKY BALBOA I STILL LOVE YOU","review":"I went to see this movie with a \\"show me\\" attitude. Having seen all the Rocky movies I was certain that Sylvester Stallone was to old to cut the mustard. Needless to say I left with the an entirely different feeling. Rocky Balboa has not lost any exciting moves. The movie was a true Rocky fast moving hard punching drama. Yes, I was waiting for the theme song and Rocky to fly up those Philadelphia stairs. Not disappointed in any aspects of this movie. It was real, it was captivating, it was ROCKY at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment.","review":"Rocky Balboa is the final installment of the Rocky films and boy was I disappointed! I just hated this film, Adrian is dead, Rocky is working in an Italian resturant, he is estranged from his son, and he tries to make an ill-fated comeback in the boxing world. This film was praised so much by critcs and fans so I thought, well I've seen all the Rocky films - why not give the last one a try? I remember watching this in the theatre and just dreading every moment. Stallone looks miserable (nice plastic surgery, not!), the writing is absolutely corny and stale and the premise is depressing. I really tried to like this film but I felt something was missing. Stick to the first 5 Rocky films, those are worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I can't say much more then what's already been said. I watched it 4 times this weekend. Great guy flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Knockout","review":"Sylvester Stallone is back on top of his game for Rocky Balboa, the final installment in one of the greatest series in American History. After recovering from the ignominy of Rocky V, Stallone has finally managed to recapture the feel of the original movie. The film is a masterpiece, the final boxing scene inspired. The movie, while a bit cheesy at times, was truly moving, well acted, well written, and even very funny, when it chooses to be. It is mainly an homage to the original film, which works itself out by engaging the audience in the sense of nostalgia that the character of Rocky himself feels. The parallelism is terrific. Even the name works perfectly - the series starts with Rocky and ends with Balboa. All in all, a great movie that anybody and everybody can enjoy. I could think of no better way to end the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Condition, Great Movie","review":"This DVD was in great condition when I received it, and it still plays well.

But overall a good movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie I've Ever Seen That's Not That Good","review":"That's what my son told me and I agree with him 100%. I wish I could give it 10 Stars. This movie has great pace and it isn't sappy. Stallone could have easily gone in that direction. He actually understated much of the emotional aspects of the story. The acting was classic Stallone...no Oscar nods here, but so much more enjoyable than the crap that took home the awards this year. Let the artsy fartsy crowd have their Oscars and pontificate about global warming, why they hate America and how their Socialist agendas will save the world.Rocky Balboa was made for America. I don't know about anyone else but my heart needed this movie. This film has more heart than anything I've seen in a long time. There's no other way to put it. The Rocky franchise now has a fitting and honorable conclusion. So, Sly, I salute you for what you have given us. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good sequals","review":"What can you say sly has milked the Rocky theme for all it's worth. Still the movie was great, classic Rocky. A ice guy and a champion. The most humble of athletes. I love Rocky, he is an idol of insperation. No matter how much he gets beat he still comes back and gets even or wins. The loss of Adrian was a bummer, that made it hard for him. I loved the movie, It was more three Demensional than the last 2 Rockys. Good job sly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes up for Rocky 5","review":"This movie wraps up the Rocky saga in a much more palatable fashion than Rocky 5 did. The most pleasant surprise in this film is a kinder, gentler Paulie. In Rocky's swan song fight he doesn't win, but goes out with dignity. A must for any Rocky fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific - what movies were meant to be","review":"We just saw this and it's a terrific film; well-written, well-acted, and well-filmed. It's inspiring, but more than that, it's *real*. The final 'Rocky' easily measures up to the original movie, and we'll certainly be recommending it to family and friends. Sly Stallone has given us a winner with this one, and it's probably worth seeing on the big screen more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie - don't miss this one!","review":"I have a lot of respect for Sylvester Stalone. He's a talented artist and a wonderful writer and director. I loved this last Rocky movie...and I didn't really think I was going to.

I found the historical introductions to the chapters to capture my interest and the material in the chapters to be thorough and logical.

This is the only reason I gave just two stars instead of three or four. This book would benefit from more examples too. Examples and problems are essential to learning physics.Besides the lack of answers to problems, this book is a little better than average. It is written with great clarity; it never leaves you lost or confused. I used this book for self-teaching. It works well for self-study but I would suggest supplementing this book by buying a book of worked problems or finding some on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent SD Card","review":"I have had failures with two Secure Digital Memory Cards of a different manufacturer in my Digital Camera.

Of the book's many virtues, the one I appreciate most is the justice it does to the extraordinary role of German-Jewish women in the development of social welfare and women's rights organizations in pre-1933 Germany. After I read this treasure, I reflected on another book I read entitled Great Jewish Women; unforgivably it profiled Goldie Hawn and Ann Landers but had nary a mention of truly towering figures like Alice Salomon, the founder of modern social work in Germany, and \\"Soup Kitchen Lina\\" Morgenstern, whose herculean, selfless and pioneering efforts on behalf of veterans, children and women were all the more admirable given the anti-Semitism of the times. Kaplan's book provides a sorely needed perspective on what really astonishing achievements are all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Rocks!","review":"I learned of this film from a personal friend who loaned me a VHS copy a few years ago, I have looked for it ever since and finally found it on Amazon.

It blows my mind every time I watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Culturally Interesting","review":"I purchased this DVD after hearing the soundtrack, which I immediately loved. I found the movie to be an average story, however it is very authentic in terms of the actors and location. Nothing is worse than having to bear through fake accents and mannerisms. Not to worry here, the actors in this movie are 100% Jamaican and provide a richness to the script that exceeds the actual story line. From what I understand, the movie also holds historical value as it projected the main character (singer Jimmy Cliff) into the mainstream, which subsequently propelled reggae music outside of the Carribean."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have grindhouse jamaican film","review":"I was glad to see this film re-released when it was because the remastering on the dvd alone is incredible. The film stars Jimmy Cliff one of the greatest reggae music stars ever, and the film is about his character arriving in Kingston Jamaica to pursue his musical dreams. But things go sour when he ends up having to do battle with the corrupt police department, a crooked music industry, and swindling dope dealers.

I intend to return the sunglasses for exchange; we'll see if they'll do this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great condition","review":"This was bought as a gift for my mom.

Sadly, like some others, the reverse side of the discs were blank; half the movie is missing. I ordered from Comp-U-Plus Rockland, for $18.10. Today it's $16.99. I'm going to try another vendor at about twice the price.I did contact Amazon by phone to register my displeasure with the way they post reviews. Their practice of lumping all reviews for a movie together makes it impossible to tell which seller is shipping defective discs. The seller I chose has a 97% positive rating and ships many kinds of products, and none of the recent feedback comments were about this movie. Order from them at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"North and South","review":"The collection North and South was great, full or history and a great story line.

However, large chunks of the story are left out of this \\"complete\\" series. For example, DVD 1 ends with Madeline's marriage and DVD 2 begins with Orrie limping and George getting married. What happened to the Mexican War where Orrie was injured and George met Constance? That's just one of the glaring ommisions in this INCOMPLETE series.I actually tried three times to get one that was complete and had to return the DVD sets each time.

I know many people said that they took the marriages out of the DVDs but my copy has them on the DVDs. However, getting back on topic here. This series just inspired my generation on the American Civil War. North and South also tells the story of two families one a Northern Family and one Southern Plantation owner. For it tells the story of both points of view on the Civil War. North, South, and even the slaves point of view. Book 1 is events that lead up the Civil War, Book Two, is events around the Civil War, and Book Three is on the reconstruction period of the Civil War. Can two families remain their friendship through the years of conflict and struggle in American history? Brilliant cast and inspiring to say the lease. A true miniseries that will last a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the story but hate defective and missing DVD's","review":"The second book has a defective disk that hesitates and the sound is messed up.

I have this series on VHS and also the DVD set released in 2004, and it contains everything that was in the original miniseries. I bought the 2004 release in a used bookstore and some discs are more badly scratched than others, so I decided to buy a new set. A friend bought the 2011 release, and there are several scenes missing, as other reviewers have noted. I'm not sure why the two versions are different, but the one that says \\"Complete Series\\" (released in 2011) is not at all the same as the one that has (Books 1-3) in the title (released in 2004). I've also noticed that the reviews are the same for both products, which is confusing and misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"Loved this series when I saw it on TV, the DVD was good quality but it kept skipping and freezing not sure if it was the DVD or operator error but the quality otherwise was really good"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Completely Inoperable Collection","review":"I too am a victim of Amazon shipping defective material and refusing to stand behind the product.

I cannot watch disc 3 at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Books 1-2 are great, Book 3 awful","review":"It was great to experience watching the the first 2 books again after all these years. Book 3, however, was a total disappointment! You can tell they didn't spend a lot of money making this film-it looks like it was filmed in the 1950's or 60's. The storyline goes down the toilet and gets away from many of the main characters in the first 2 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it...BUT!","review":"I have loved this series since I first saw it on TV years ago and was so excited to buy the collection.

I too own it on VHS but I copied it many years ago from tv and the quality is somewhat lacking to say the least. I am in the US Navy and I am at my 18.5 year mark. I have shown it to many people worldwide who had not heard of North and South. Everyone loves it. It was and always will be my favorite movie of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in quality of product","review":"I am another customer who received a faulty product. It is really disappointing to buy the series and than find that you cannot even watch it because of all the problems with the DVD. In book 2 both sides A and B have skips, freeze ups, breakups of the picture. In fact on side B I cant even get it to play the last several parts of the episode. Like the others I am out of the return date even though this is my first viewing of the set. It sure doesn't seem fair that the company or Amazon doesn't make good on a faulty product. The series itself is great but the product is inferior. I waited a long time to get this series and it sure is frustrating not to be able to get to use it due to a faulty product. Is ther no way for someone to make this right?

I wish that the networks could find their way to do it today, but I know its unlikely."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful series","review":"The story was very authentic to the period. The actors were selected with great taste in who could do the characters the best. This sucked me in like a soap opera and I couldn't get enough. I had laughter, tears of joy, tears of sadness, and even some anger. I was very sad to see it end, and wish there was more to see. My hats off the the writter, producers, directors, editors, actors,,and all who had a had in putting this all together. One of Patrick Swayze's best, and I heard him say, his favorite.

Can Book 3 be the same writer?","review":"Another reviewer said that the Book 3 disc was worth using as a beer coaster and all I can say is that is so TRUE!!!Books 2 & 3 are excellent. I could watch them over and over but I'm not even sure John Jakes really even wrote book 3. Maybe a ghost writer did it for him? Even the characters don't act like the same people! I can't see Orry and Constance getting killed that easily and I can't see George and Madeline being that laughingly passionate!!!I'd rather they take out book 3 so it would be cheaper!! It was actually laughable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts????","review":"I love this movie and have watched it several times over the years. When I purchased this, wanting to show it to my children, I had no idea that liberties had been taken! There were parts missing from every section of the movie. When we finished one disk and put in the next, it was like parts of the movie were missing. We had a hard time understanding what was going on because key parts of it were missing. (George and Orry fighting in Mexico, George meeting Constance and getting married, The Mane's going to visit the Hazard's, Madeline escaping her husband (don't even remember what happened!), Ashton going to get rid of her baby in the swamp, Orry's mom dying (or did she), Mont Royal burning down!!! These are all things that were not on the disks that I received.

I was 9 yrs old when it came out and recorded both parts 1 and 2 on VHS. Sadly the quality has deteriorated over time and it is disappointing to learn that it is not available on DVD format.Wonderfully acted with a romantic theme threaded through the plot of a Civil War that nearly tore a nation apart.It is heartening to read that other members have fond memories of this mini-series and, like me, can't wait for it to come out on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I was a huge fan of the North & South Book 1 mini-series in the 80s. I finally decided to spend the $60 and buy the set. What a disappointment! So much was cut out of Book 1 that it wasn't even enjoyable to watch because there were huge gaps in the story and unless you had seen it before you would have a hard time following it. Anyway, DON'T BUY THIS DVD if you think you will be getting a complete Book 1 version.

Book 1 and 2 are wonderful, maybe fairly factual as far as the Civil War but the love story is so sweet. Patrick Swayze is just adorable and Kirstie Alley plays her part phenomenally! I totally agree with other reviews about the 3rd book of the series...don't ruin the first 2 book by watching the 3rd. What were they thinking? It cheapened the series. Throw that DVD to the dog to bury. Watch the first two, they are so worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book One and Two Superb - Skip Book Three","review":"Book One and Book Two were superior. Terrific Civil War saga. Book Three is should be skipped. James Read does a fine job. Lesley Ann does too although she does show her age. Most of the other characters from Book One and Two are gone which is a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost true to the book","review":"I bought this for my mother-in-law, who is a huge fan of the book.

Patrick Swayze is terrific as are all the other characters. A few warnings: there are a few actor changes throughout the series where you are used to a particular actor as the character and surprise, someone new is in the role. Also, the ending is a bit disappointing. But neither of those things diminishes the overall beauty of the story line and the wonderful job by the actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but good","review":"This is a good series but for the third installment.......my opinion is the same as others.

Pleasantly surprised to see number of of superb actors in minor roles. Interesting to see Robert Wagner and couple others as \\"bad guys\\" plus Lincoln was disconcertingly short...but strong A re stars and script was fantastic. Only true negative was flaws with DVDs--hard to remove, couldn't readily tell when some episodes were on other side and one was either scratched/not made right so almost wouldn't play. Finally got it to play by FF at 4 times speed/stopping and then FF again...skipped some things but able to view 85% with difficulty. Would have returned but deterred by poor weather.

We enjoyed the first two books of the series, even with it's shortcomings. However, they should have stopped at that point. Book three was a little over the top and all over the place. Resurrecting Bent was simply silly. Besides that, Madeleine and George becoming an item was a little disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faithful","review":"These were 3 wonderfully done miniseries. The cast is fantastic, and the settings all feel like the 1800's. The first mini comprises of the 20 years before the civil war, including the Mexican War. It sets up all the characters and has George and Orie meet and become friends. It sets up all future plots and stays focused on slavery. It stays pretty faithful to the book, and it is relatively balanced between the north and south point of view. The second mini comprises the entire civil war and ties up a lot of plot points. The cast stayed mostly intact, so there is good continuity between the mini series. The third mini was done much later with a lot of the cast gone. It takes place a few years after the civil war. It certainly is the least of this set. All in all, this is a fantastic box set that finally has all 3 mini series in print for the first time. It is a wonderful addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"North and South - The Complete CollectionThe cast is fabulous and the script easy to follow. This show allows the viewer to relax and enjoy a well produced story about 2 familes who hold a friendship which is tested when the American Civil War tears into them. One from the North and One from the South. Great costume and set design, with appropriate special effects. It is hard not to believe this could have really happened. A very enjoyable show and high class."},{"rating":"2","title":"North and South - The Compete Collection","review":"An interesting and comprehensive look at life as it was before during and after slavery in the South.

GREAT where's the credit card.It arrived and I couldn't wait to see it got home put it in the machine and settled in for a great evenings entertainment. OH Dear, the sound is not even in stereo, it is almost impossible to here what is going on even at full volume.The picture was also bad quality with lots of white lies and spots appearing. It would seem that this release hadn't been re-mastered in any way, shape or form. Altogether a generally un-impressive release of one of the best tv mini series of all time, and a poor example of classic old tv shows released on DVD format.

IT is a good quality product, and I enjoy what is there, however, there is a lot of the movie missing. It is advertised as the complete set, which includes all 3 books, but it lets out so much of the movie and drama, you miss much of the story lines. If it would not have been for seeing the movie beforehand, I would have been lost on much of the drama and stories of the individual characters. I think the advertising for the complete collection is very misleading, because of the omitted scenes. I would not recommend this to anyone!

The movie not only portrays the war itself but it also shows the family and what was going on on the home front, it didn't just center on the war. This is as I said my favorite civil war movie. I also recommend the Blue and the Gray, but I think this one is better.

He is so talented that when you read his books or see the movies, he makes you feel like you are there and you can easily get lost in the story.

One of them has 1212 minutes that is put out by ABC and the other has 1392 which is put out by Warner Brothers. I bought the epic that was 1212 minutes and was very disappointed. It was heavily edited to where it rendered the whole epic butchered. I watched the entire mini series in the 80's and love it. But, when I received the current version and started watching it I realized that a lot of the love scenes were missing. It had been heavily edited to where it didn't make much sense in places. It made the whole story line disjointed and you wound up having to guess what was going on between the actors. That is something I do not like doing. It ruined what was a terrific mini series for me. It was in my opinion a complete waste of money.

Romance is the theme of this story in Civil war times between several individuals who had to deal with a country rebelling against itself.

I do not own this collection my self, I only got the first and second book, because I found the third to be very disappointing. Now after reading the reviews it made me curious, so I went ahead and checked how long my DVD collections are. Well, together the first and second book are 1080 minutes and I noticed the third book is 262 minutes (this makes 1342 minutes). The \\"Full collection\\" here with all three books is 1212 minutes, so knowing that, it's pretty simple to figure out that they must have left 130 minutes out (!!!!!!!). That's over two hours!!! Crazy! I am SOOOOOOOO glad I got the first and second book seperately, because I don't want any scenes missing. I don't understand why they do this to DVD collections, do they think the viewers won't notice? If you want the WHOLE thing, don't buy this collection, buy each book seperately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life, Love and Loyalty","review":"North and South was a historically based production that brought the happenings of the 1840's to 1861 to life and I feel was one of the, if not the best learning tool of pre-civil war times. It was historically sound and followed the historical events as the writer of the books, John Jakes did. It brought life alive in that historical time and for me, gave me a much better understanding of what went on in the pre-Civil War years. I feel that having this all-time Mini Series in DVD format will open the doors to many more people and I would hope that in its production that both Descritive tracks and closed circut could be added for those who are blind/visually impared and the hearing impared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully infectious","review":"For those that don't know, Kylie is Australian. She featured in a soap opera, and was voted most popular personality of the year in 1988. Around this time Loco-motion was released, and because the soap opera was also extremely popular in England, Kylie was a hit there too. The album is pure fluff, but infectious fluff. She did 5 albums with Stock/Aitken/Waterman, all of which Kylie had no control over the content. When her contract was up, she moved into songwriting and producing herself. These personal albums are alot better, but at the time \\"Kylie\\" the album was released, you must remember that popular music at the time was all pretty much fluffy pop tunes. This album is still great. For pure fun and daydreaming about lost love etc, this is the album to buy. It's simple, feel-good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kylie The Pop Puppet","review":"Minogue's debut and biggest selling album (Album of the Year 1988 in UK). Starting with Number One single \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" which was written in ten minutes and recorded in 30 minutes, the album is full of catchy Euro-pop tunes, including 3 UK Number Twos and 2 Japanese top 5 hits (6, out of 10 tracks, became international top 5 hit singles!). All the songs were well written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman, the most successful producer trio at the time, except for The Loco-Motion, but there is no Artist Kylie but Kylie The Pop Puppet, and the fact that sound of this album does not differ so much from the ones of Jason Donovan and Sonia whom Stock Aitken Waterman also produced sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blase","review":"Kylie's one and only US album features the hit single \\"The Locomotion\\", a remake of the Little Eva classic. Most of the other songs are forgettable dance ditties that are made more unbearable because of her shrill high-pitched voice. Thankfully she never got to step foot in the US again after this brief attempt, because it will be tragic if she ever gets on US radio again.

With tracks like \\"Mayor of Simpleton\\" and \\"Pink Thing\\" (Which andy claims is about one of his children) this album will be stuck in your player for quite some time. One thing I've loved about Xtc is most of their music has the ability to escape the era it was created. Most of it is timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Biography","review":"This is an outstandingly researched work. The book is balanced and goes into in-depth details on the real Meyer Lansky not the Hollywood persona in countless films. I was living on Miami Beach from 1980-1982 and saw Mr. Lansky eating at the Big Daddy's restaurant on Lincoln Road. Lansky was a legend on then Jewish Miami Beach. Lansky made millions but died with only $300,000 in the bank. I heard many Cubans at the time say he had to repay the mob out of his own pocket for the loss of the Havana Riviera Hotel and Casino when the Cuban Government took it 1959 otherwise he would have met the same fate has his friend Bugsy Seigel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacey should focus on the royal family","review":"This is a very misleading book about a man who was so much more then what Lacey actually claims. His sources are very questionable, especially Lansky's crippled son Buddy. It was well known that Lansky's family had caused him much heartache and his son Buddy especially. He made some bad business decisions and his health kept declining each year. Lansky decided early to keep his family far away from the criminal world so if you wanna know about Lansky Mr. Lacey, investigate criminals, FBI bugs, trial transcripts etc. etc.All of Lansky's friends died wealthy and you know why? because that was Lansky's own damn money. Robert Lacey doesn't get it. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOULDN'T KNOW... NEVER RECEIVED IT","review":"NEVER RECEIVED IT!!! I emailed the sender and never heard from them either. My credit card was charged for this item. I am EXTREMELY disappointed and will never order from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Criminal revisionism","review":"I can only assume the applauding professional and amateur reviewers were swept away by Lacey's evocative descriptions of Lansky's surroundings and cultural background. Lacey's detailed study is, I will readily admit, finely wrought, but this book should have been sold as fiction. Besides totally whitewashing Lansky, \\"Little Man\\" is peppered with countless factual errors (e.g. Joe the Boss Masseria was not waiting for a late lunch when he got hit in 1931-- he'd already eaten a huge lunch), many of which bolster the author's fantastic characterization of his subject. Where is there any discussion of Lansky's operation in Covington, Kentucky? Why is Murder, Inc. mentioned only three times in this book when Lansky was crucial to Siegel and Lepke's killing-for-hire enterprise? I certainly understand a biographer's decision to lionize his/her subject, but this exoneration of a well-documented monster is criminal."},{"rating":"1","title":"biginner book","review":"I finished Coffin Corner, 2000, and hope it was her first.

The book has good graphics, but the authors have tried to cram in a lot of information. As a result, things have'nt been explained systematically.

Not a great fan of this book, sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skunkworks","review":"Skunkworks marked a key turning point for Bruce Dickinson (not to mention the eventually reunited Iron Maiden). Capitalizing flawlessly on his absolutely incomparable voice, all his works after this move up an echelon, meaningfully and superbly written to best compliment his terrific range and depth. Oddly overlooked during the '90s infatuation with finding \\"new sounds.\\" Working with some very talented \\"Gen X\\" professionals, this effort of the Master puts most of the era's contemporaries to shame. Whatever the chemistry, it's too bad the band didn't stick together for more albums. This is a \\"must-have\\" for just about ANY music collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard-core Dickinson fans only","review":"Things that make you go hmmmm... \\"Skunkworks is an odd album. I would'nt say that it is bad, but, it's not one of my favorite Bruce albums. However, a good select few are definitly worth the listen. Such as \\"Inside the Machine\\" and \\"Space Race\\". I think Bruce was really getting into flying airplanes and the music and lyrics kind of reflect that. We must remember that Bruce was doing exactly what he wanted to do with this record. He always wanted to try different things and I commend him for that. To get to the point, die-hard Maiden fans who are completists with thier CD collections should, of 'course buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, great idea...","review":"One must be insane to spend US$ 17,98 on this album, which had the \\"clever\\" idea of printing ALL the lyrics backwards, to make them annoying (and impossible) to read. I don't know who supplied Bruce Dickinson with this fantastic idea...Maybe it was Bruce himself...It's hard to decide which is the worst Dickinson solo album: Balls To Picasso or Skunkworks. I think Skunkworks win the prize, cause Balls to Picasso has \\"Tears Of The Dragon\\" in it, and that song alone makes the album worth.Even so, SKUNKWORKS has its good moments. It shows once again that Bruce has a much more open and immaginative mind than his pals from Iron Maiden, and he tries a lot of new stuff here. Some of them work, others don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straying even further from the Iron Maiden expectations. 93% rating","review":"For his third solo album, Dickinson broadens his horizons even further and takes us on an enjoyable ride. It was for me at least. Slightly more polished sounding than 'Balls To Picasso' or 'Tattooed Millionaire', the rawness is missed but the songs never sound stale or dull.This would be the best solo album in most singers careers, however Bruce followed this up with 'Accident of Birth', 'Chemical Wedding', and 'Tyranny of Souls' which were all incredible. 'Skunkworks' should not be overlooked however as it features some great songs, and I can honestly say there are no filler songs present.Standout tracks are: 'Space Race', 'Inertia', 'I Will Not Accept The Truth', 'Inside The Machine', and my personal favorite 'Strange Death In Paradise'.The reissues are a bit pricey for an MP3 but with the already solid album in addition to all the unreleased and live extras, it is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sound quality I have heard in a long time.","review":"I am not taking issue with the material, but only the sound quality. The treble is abrasive and otherwise non-existent. The bass, well there is none. One of the worst cd mastering jobs I have ever heard, making the disc unlistenable. May sound ok on a cheapie stereo or in a car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad album really...","review":"Bruce Dickinson is a very talented vocalist and songwriter and even though this album is good it doesnt live up to his level. The distortion is greatly diminished and the songs are kind of cheesy. If you want to start off with Bruce get \\"Accident of Birth\\" or \\"The Chemical Wedding\\". Those two albums are masterpeices and made what Bruce is today."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not traditional heavy metal","review":"The material on \\"Skunkworks\\" is not outstanding in any way. When Dickinson released his first solo album the songs had character and were built upon classic heavy metal, and they were over all much better. This time, it seems Dickinson haven't put the same energy into the song writing and even if it's not bad it's certainly not good either. I would say that apart from \\"Headswitch\\" there's not much to be excited about. But if you're way into modern metal (Soundgarden, Alice In Chains etc.) you might find this album enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce goes bland...","review":"This CD is Bruce's version of Halford 2wo project. This is an alternative-metal mess that goes nowehere fast. It's not really bad, but it's in NO way good. It's not even good for what it is. The production is top notch and the performances are quite good but the record lacks distinctive songs and catchy melodies. It's not quite the sell out as many have made it out to be but it's not lacking in strong, epic songs. The alternative influence is not a terrible thing overall but it doesn't help this record find a unique voice.Pick this up if you are a Bruce fanatic - it may have some gems for you but for the rest...it's just not worth it. Nifty booklet though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I love this stuff, my husband bought it last year and we still have yet to finish a whole bottle.

Another great part is that it does not irritate private areas (if it accidentally get there) because believe me that is a mood killer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good first effort","review":"For a first effort from a fantasy author, Mysteries of the Past is not bad. Schneider creates an interesting universe and does an admirable job staying in it. The concepts are not necessarily revolutionary but they are combined and used effectively. Where Schneider shines is in her characters - while the situations and circumstances they find themselves in are not always believable, they handle themselves in ways a reader can relate to. The internal monologues do help readers understand the very real feelings of the characters. Hopefully, Schneider will follow this effort with a more complete development of the world and its politics and minutae, which are present and could be fascinating, but are incomplete in this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent intro to Foster and Sousa","review":"This is a tremendous value considering the price and the number of tracks that you get. The renditions are not bad, but I have heard better Foster. There is a lot of narration, which makes this a great teaching tool to introduce Foster and Sousa. The narration is a bit more for Foster than Sousa. Some of the Foster songs seem to be cut a little short, giving you what is really more of a sampler than a rich collection of complete Foster songs. The Sousa marches seem to be a little longer and don't have quite as much narration. Even though both men were well known American composers, their type of music was quite different, so it's kind of an odd paring on this album. It's a pleasant listen, but not a \\"must have\\" item unless you don't have much Foster or Sousa in your music collection; it's a good starter album. Great for kids who might be interested in learning about these two famous composers."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely delicious","review":"I have bought this product many times, although it is quite expensive, it is absolutely delicious.

It was sent to me when I signed up for an online portfolio service, so I did not have to pay for it (thankfully). I did however, sit and laugh for 45 minutes. This thing had to have been done in the 80's. While it was a good opportunity for the featured model, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her. She never smiles through a whole scene, instead going between \\"This is fun!\\" to \\"What is this guy talking about?\\". It's almost as if someone is sitting off to the side going smile, don't smile, smile, stop smiling, smile, look off into space there dear!

I first heard it on his web site and it was sped up. The vocals sounded like one of the chipmunks had a guest appearance but after hearing the real versions, I really like the album.

However, it appears to have some serious reliability problems. In the four months that I've owned it, it has already had to be sent in for repairs twice, once for problems with the wireless card and once for a dead LCD monitor.

I learned things about John Paul Jones that weren't mentioned in JOHN PAUL JONES, FIGHTINGSAILOR. Any Hornblower and Aubrey-Maturin fans here?Thomas Lord Cochrane was the inspiration for both Hornblower and Jack Aubrey.

This band was around before most of the great noise groups today, and I wonder if this band wasn't an influence (Wolf Eyes, xinlisupreme...).One of the best things about this album is the sheer variety offered. There are moments of extremely harsh stuff on here (the beginning of \\"Xia Xia\\") but those are juxtaposed with moments of eerie calm (like in the second half of \\"Ul Jamal\\").It's an intriguing noise album, one that grows on a listener with repeated viewings, and worse seeking out if you're a listener to the aforementioned bands or acts like Bastard Noise and Merzbow."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a really good book, it had a lot to say.","review":"it was a really thinkky book that kept you interested but wasn't too deep and intellectual. i really liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucked","review":"I'm not the least cynical of females, but even I was rather apalled at the way men were presented in this book.

I refuse to believe that we are such sniveling cowards that we must resort to the tactics of the worst of the patriarchy, or that a strong and good man is one who completely rejects the fact that he is a man.This underlying thought poisons every part of the book, making all of the women who are supposed to be strong into weak hysterical creatures who I am disgusted by.Or they would be if there were any redeeming characterization, but they come out as wooden puppets to preach her agenda.

Eight years later, I have probably read it at least eight more times, and each time, it is more disturbing, more absorbing, more amazing. Tepper has a canny ability to create worlds that are completely real when we are submerged in them, and completely bizarre when we emerge.Some of your reviewers are horrified at the ideas that are expressed as commonplaces in Tepper's world: genetic selection, emotional manipulation, government secrecy. What is more horrifying to me is the idea that these ideas would be ignored or banned. Although I, too, am disturbed by the prevailing ethos of Women's Country, as a woman, I can feel an eerie attraction to it. That fact, in itself, says a lot about the \\"real world\\" and its attitudes toward women."},{"rating":"2","title":"sci-fi with tragical scope","review":"this is the first Tepper novel I've read and I love the tragedy implied in the story. It's not only the references to the war of Troy, but also that when the victims of that war (women, according to the author)finally get their revenge (after many centuries and an implied nuclear holocaust), they are left with a feeling of bitterness. Is it possible to govern a world, to make tough life-or-death decissions, and not be unfair? Is it possible to play the role that men have traditionally played and not make the same mistakes? Tragedy and food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong \\"woman message\\" without being feminist","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal. it was the first tepper book that I had read, and made me look forward to other novels from this imaginative lady. I believe it gives something to think about, it revolves revolves around religion rather than gender and the traditional patriach beliefs that religion perpetuates. It suggests that violence is not the future of man and hooray for that!.This is the first book of many that I intend to read from Ms. Tepper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!!!","review":"Love this book.

I like the change of pace with \\"Skin Deep\\" which is a fun little dance tune and her voice sounds good on it. Recently picked up the CD version of this on sale and it sounds good. Of course, \\"I Found Someone\\" is the power ballad hit, I love the haunting synth lead-in. I like \\"Perfection\\" with Bonnie Tyler and Darlene Love and I also like \\"Main Man.\\" Her voice sounds really good on this one. It's a must for Cher collectors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cher's Triumphant Return To The Top!","review":"After a string of albums that unfairly were overlooked by the mainstream (albums like Stars, Black Rose and I Paralyze especially), Cher signed to Geffen in 1987 and recorded a rock album that finally got people to take notice.\\"I Found Someone\\" may have not been written for Cher (Laura Branigan recorded it a few years earlier), but Cher makes the song her own. It is a rocker! \\"We All Sleep Alone\\" is an all-time gem that even Cher had remixed to put on her BELIEVE album. Some of Cher's best vocals are on this song. \\"Perfection\\" is an underrated gem, you hear Cher at her diva peak on the album.While some of this albums production sounds dated 13 years later (Jon Bon Jovi, Desmond Child, Michael Bolton were all at the top of their game), for anyone who remembers this period, this album is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great comeback.","review":"I think this might just be one of Cher's best sets. It is very diverse with love songs (Hard Enough.., Main Man), power ballads (We All Sleep Alone), rockers (Dangerous Times, Give Our Love...), and even a dance number (Skin Deep) and a diva fest (Perfection). A record that can be listened to forward and backward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manolito Gafotas DVD could be rated \\"R\\" due to some nudity","review":"I agree with the previous review on the great humor and good qualities of this movie, but know that it is not really for children or teens because of some scenes in which the father and son characters are shown totally nude while going about their normal bedtime and bath activities.

Students learning Spanish will find this book a highly interesting reading comprehension activity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series, but no conclusion","review":"Ok, so I read the Breed series and was very impressed. I loved it. Always eager for the next one to come out. To bid my time,I decided to read some of her other stuff. Unwisely, I choose the Wizard series. Don't get me wrong, Its a great series and all ... so far. But where's the third? Anyone? It's been two years and three months since the last book was written ... ending with a huge freakin' cliff-hanger I might add. No talk of the third coming out.

All in all good read ... if you don't mind being left in the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"WIZARD TWINS 2","review":"It's a good book but no where near the brilliance of Lora Leigh's Breed or bound heart's books. It's the secon in a series, cute but the first was better. This one is a good read alone without and background for comparison. The book i full of a nearlly constant battle of the sexes, which is fine to a point but after to books of almost nothing but it's a little tiring. It will leave you wanting for the third sister's book that is very liklly never to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite","review":"Not a whole lot of substance and no action.

I was saddened by the fact that I just could not get into this story. I just wanted the characters to just get into it already. I really enjoyed the first story and was truly anticipating reading this part. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. It seemed to go on and on and the chacters kept going around and around, my mind started to wander and I had to motivate myself to finish reading the story. It felt like different people wrote these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly useless","review":"I checked this book out from my local library, and it took me about an hour to go through the entire thing and learn almost nothing. It's like he wrote a decent introduction to each of the chapters, and then moved on. There is not enough information given to actually *learn* from. The table of contents looks great. He just didn't flesh it out in a meaningful way.

I was extremely disappointed, as most of the information is extremely readily available, and the instructor is not to the advanced level yet with his woodturning, and hasn't developed any flare in turning or teaching yet. Way too soon for him to have written a book, esp. a book that is supposed to be geared towards beginners and newbies.As from the book, they will be learning a few bad habits. The author may have successfully navigated past the beginners stage, but he has a lot to still learn. From the few examples he has submitted via photos in the book, there is potential of becoming one of the 'turners' to go to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a project book","review":"Let me save you a few bucks. This tells you to how to set up your tool rest and then practice using your tools. That's it. The rest of the book is projects. They spend a ton of the book on using burls to make bowls. There has to be a better instructional manual out there. I learned a lot more just surfing the web for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"crapps","review":"Makes a good Coffey table book, lots of nice pictures.

As a Science Fiction fan and a movie fan I still cannot give it more than one star. It is poorly conceived, disjointed, boring, and has those kind of camera shots that flash rapidly because they did not have the money to make decent special effects; so instead they use flashing camera gimmickery such that you cannot even tell what is going on. The writing is worse than the cinematography...all in all it does not get much worse than this. I wasted my money on this film...I hope you will not do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space is bad. You will die in space. Don't go into Space.","review":"Okay, positives first. It was original. The graphics were top notch and amazing. There were some effects that I thought we well placed and really brought you into the future, you get that this is definitely in the future. hmmm....okay, my negatives. Well, the basic message of this movie and that of the director is that if you go into space you will die. If the vaccume of space or the proximity to the sun doesn't kill you, then apparently your own ship isn't even safe, so... just don't go into space.This wasn't a very good movie in my opinion. Sowwy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films ever made","review":"I read these other reviews and wonder if they saw the same poorly acted, poorly shot, incoherent film that I own. Awful quality in every way, especially the grainy, blurry visuals.

I found it unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie Awful DVD Transfer","review":"I was eager to see this movie after reading all the reviews. I am not really a great fan of thrillers but this one had me on the edge of my seat. The directing is wonderful and the movie is really excellent, so from that perspective I was really pleased.So why the 1 star?The DVD transfer is probably one of the worst I have ever seen (and I have a LOT of dvd's). The pixelation/artifacting is so pronounced that it really detracts from the viewing of the movie and creates a real distraction to any real enjoyment. Almost every scene has some form of really pronounced mpeg artifacting and this really should not have been released as it is.The DVD just feels like is was rushed into production with so so quality. I can't speak to the quality of the BD version but the DVD version is really terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A minus One would be a better rating","review":"This big-budget catastrophe (pun intended) illustrates how easily a movie can go totally wrong.I was willing to suspend disbelief: the sun is losing power.

Take the stupidest, least motivated crew you can possibly find, people who are telling us \\"human life SHOULD be extinguished\\" by their actions and lack of motivation and give them the mission of saving planet Earth. The film begins on the ship; no hint of what informed this rash decision.But wait! It gets better: instead of a straight journey to the center of the solar system, throw in mutated earlier solarnauts, and change the entire focus of the film from a disaster movie to a slasher movie (Def.: a slasher movie is one in which the characters are killed off, one at a time). Although we watched this to the end (we love planetary disaster films), this was a real strain to accomplish."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolutely incoherent mess","review":"I'm a big fan of sci-fi.... when it's done well.This fiasco was an absolute disaster. Outside of the general story line of trying to re-activate the Sun as it's fizzling out, I couldn't make heads or tails out of this thing.Where did the bad guy/alien/antagonist at the end come from? How did he get on the ship? Two of the many questions no one even bothered to address when they \\"wrote\\" this thing, assuming it wasn't just someone's summer college project.

They have a lot of challenges to overcome like in any movie, and then they overcome them. But here's the thing about the movie that you won't believe: no one ever looks really serious and says \\"It's daylight saving time.\\"Not one character. No one says \\"It's daylight saving time.\\" In the entire movie. I know you don't think it's possible, but if you watch it you'll feel like you wasted 4 hours of your life (time moves slower when you're waiting for someone to deliver an amazing line).

I am really into the exploration of space and movies like this just fascinate me. I will agree that the movie turns from a Sci-Fi thriller to another horror film in space in the last 30 minutes or so, but even that part of the film worked for me. The only thing I didn't care for was the blurry footage that was shot of a certain character towards the end. It was okay at first to add suspense, but Danny Boyle did it a little too much for my liking. I'm glad my theater got this film, because for a film that won't make a lot of money, it deserves every cent.4 out of 5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Star Fades!","review":"It is a great-looking but dramatically flat bit of star lore docked at the inner shores of the galaxy, rather than its outer limitsAt a certain point, like a dying star about to pop into eternal nothingness, the movie can't be seen as anything -- it just implodes.Sunshine is also an atypically humorless entry from Boyle, who's never made a film this oddly devoid of personalityDespite all that talent on display, Sunshine is a philosophical blank slateAfter a mesmerizing first hour, the film implodes so quickly our sputtering sun can barely keep pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"A handsome mess","review":"SUNSHINE doesn't work as science fiction, or as a psychological thriller, or as an action-adventure, or as a slasher movie, or as an homage to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, or as a mystical apocalypse -- but it tries to be all of these things.The plot is laughably implausible, and the \\"science\\" is simply ridiculous. Lowest point of the film: Several crew members discover that they must cross between two airlocks in total vacuum. (Sound familiar?) There is only one space suit. So what do the other crew members do? They wrap themselves in ... duct tape!The one star is for the special effects, which are often very good, and for the cast members, who are all beautiful to look at and do their best to make the clunky, humorless script work.Where is Mystery Science Theater 3000 when we need it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie!","review":"This is an awesome, fun movie!

It wasn't bad but, when you're used to Boyle creating things like 28 days later, Slumdog and Trainspotting, serving up a warmed-over Solaris-meets-2001 falls below the standards you expect from him.There were plot holes large enough to pilot the Icarus through such as:* Who was the baddie? The Icarus I captain gone nuts that no one noticed entering the Icarus II?* Why were they able to breathe in the payload area? What a waste of oxygen.The tried and tested formula of captain-dies-first was used yet again. The table scene was ripped directly from Alien and so on.I wanted to like this movie but the characters were so underdone, I had a hard time caring about any of them.One to rent only methinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and Visually Stunning","review":"THE MOVIE: Although I am not the biggest science fiction fan, Sunshine looked intriguing to me. I decided to rent the film from Netflix (my first Blu-ray rental) and I was blown away. Apart from the visuals, this is a smart, intense, and intellectually stimulating film. Directed by the brilliant Danny Boyle (28 Days Later), the film explores the plight of eight astronauts determined to reignite the dying sun in order to preserve life on Earth. Complications arise and tensions surmount. There is some brilliant writing, acting, and directing here. I particularly enjoyed the balance the film makes between action and moral dilemma. 5/5THE DISC: This is a stunning Blu-ray disc. The visuals are absolutely amazing. Each shot is so clear and clean. After watching this film I turned on regular television and could not believe how awful the channels looked compared to this movie!

There wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken special features make the movie unwatchable","review":"Do not buy this product. The special feature called Picture in Picture inserts a picture in the frame that offers a special look at the set of the particular scene. The problem is, this feature cannot be turned off. So, for about 12 scenes during the movie (more than half the movie) the audio is not audible because of the picture in picture. It is impossible to watch the movie because nothing can be heard.

Sad","review":"This was one of the best science fiction films I had seen in years with great writing, good acting, super visuals but no!!!!! they couldn't leave it on that level. The last 30 minutes are a heartbreak. I don't know who made the writers or director change the ending, I know this can't be what they had in mind. This film bordered on truly great but as soon as the mad slasher was thrown in to the plot I started thinking about supper or what I was going to do the next day as I lost all interest in the film. What a waste with an ending so bad that you feel you had been sold on a great car and it turns out to be a lemon after you bought it. I expect Friday the Thirteenth movies to be boring, predictable, for teenyboppers so I am not disappointed. This film had so much promise so the junk at the end disgusted me with the extreme trashing of talent. Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sperm fertilizes egg","review":"Reviewer Altman comes closest when he asks \\"where does their gravity come from in this 2001-look-alike spaceship?\\" but when 2001: A Space Odyssey was released, at least somebody picked up on the sperm-appearing Discovery swimming in space.

Why would so much resources be expended to create a pleasant and spacious crew area when they're not needed in the first place? Send a remote bomb.

It was hard for me to watch to the very end. I considered pulling it out of the dvd player during the last 25% of the movie because it was so tedious. This is not a new storyline either. Other movies have been made with the same plot. The special effects were the sole redeeming factor. The ship and the shots of the sun were good but not good enough to save a flakey movie. No great acting, a predictable plot, and a hoakey ending.

This film purports to be a bit more technically believable than most; a mission is sent from Earth to reignite our dying sun. People old enough to remember the Skylab missions from the early '70's might find something rather familiar about the interiors of the \\"Icarus 2.\\" Speaking of historical notes, it's symptomatic of the declining importance of Hollywood to the film industry that all American allusions are missing from this film; fifteen years ago, that obviously wouldn't have been the case. Half of the crew seem to have been recruited from Asia, the other half from feuding twenty-year-olds on a reality TV show. Though the film has many gloriously golden views of the sun, it ultimately degrades into another gory kill-fest. Too bad; it had potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sci-fi movies EVER.","review":"I can't believe I hadn't heard of this movie before I saw it.

It drives me up the wall when characters make decisions that seem implausible, out of character, or just plain stupid. The plot of Sunshine is driven by such decisions. Add to that unnecessarily gruesome scenes, weak physics, and a predictable plot and you get a teeth-gritting experience.That said, the visuals are stunning, and as much as I was irritated, at the end my heart was pounding. If you are looking for a sci-fi thriller and can maintain suspension of disbelief for a couple of hours, you might love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes dashed...","review":"Given its trailer and Boyle's credentials I though this should be REALLY good...it started out great - the cast is terrific, the camera work is superb and the musical score is top notch. Too bad the film degenerates into something less than it should be by the time it's over. Lots of questions as to who and why the main protagonist is and acts the way he does abound, stupid plot contrivances, and a sense of lost focus plague this movie in the last half hour. I'm disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little mixed metaphor ain't a bad thing","review":"I'll make this brief.If you liked 'Solaris' with George Clooney, you will likely enjoy this picture alot...And vice-versa.This is a science fantasy drama, a vehicle for metaphors about the Sun, and a collection of character sketches. It's about Icarus falling into the Sun. And the danger of \\"Staring into the Sun\\". The ensemble cast perform their parts with grit and seriousness.. the sense of danger and of isolation is palpable... the sets, effects and music are on point.As a mood piece, it excels.As serious 'science fiction'? Maybe not... but hey- is there really any such thing, anymore? We're a scientifically jaded culture, now that science is big business. Yes, jump starting the Sun w/a theoretical fusion bomb is silliness.. but that's just the vehicle to examine these characters- that's what this film is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I COULDN'T FIND ANY ASPECT OF THIS DIM SUNSHINE THAT I DIDN'T DISLIKE","review":"Writing, directing, acting, casting, art direction, editing, concept - Nothing appealed to me; everything seemed confused and repetitious and chaotic yet flat.Sunshine is just one calamity after another answered with panic.After the first few they all seemed so much the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"Don't waste your time.

Then I started picking apart the physics and although there are the normal Hollywood stupidities - the overall physics are not too shabby (compared to most sci-fi's). Then I just enjoyed the movie having picked it apart...This is a movie worthy of time and attention. Its attractive in a dark, strange sort of way (ironic that its about bright sunshine and I find it a little dark... :-) ) Overall, this is a movie worth owning - not perfect but watchable more then once."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNWATCHABLE!!!

But this \\"movie\\" was such a disaster in my opinion. Who cares about the legitimacy of the science? It has no nucleus, no progressive development, no plot. It is a meandering series of short vignette's about smoke-screen characters who don't matter. It goes from boring, to senseless horror film, to total golden bright chaos.

The visuals with the soundtrack plus the pacing of the plot had me on the edge of my seat. Yeah, ok the plot is seemingly unrealistic, but entertaining to a certain perspective. If you ignore the impossibility of \\"re-igniting the sun\\" (there is a chance, apparently something called a q-ball or some crazy phyicist term) and put yourself in front of a nice TV, blackened environment, clear surround stereo, you'll agree that this easily one of the best movies of 2007.

An unusual storyline with solid action and sci-fi special effects. A bit far-fetched (traveling to the Sun to explode a bomb to re-energize the Sun), but hey, its Sci-fi. Very dramatic photographic and editing style with extreme quick cuts during the action fight scenes. This is a great movie! Frankly, I am surprised I'd never heard of it before now. Highly recommended. Oh make sure your sub-woofer is cranked-up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start - Hollywood ending","review":"Dropping a payload on the sun to save the Earth is a difficult enough task. However, the film-makers thought it necessary to add the typical plot line of evil undead captain sabotage. Hence, the movie went from interesting to mindless mediocracy. The only saving grace was the deep space visual cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Event Horizon","review":"There are some lapses in logic and science in this Danny Boyle film- but I thought it was cinematic, interesting and the visual effects at times beautiful.

It's worth a rent- a good weekend Sci-Fi escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combination of 'Event Horizon' and '2010'","review":"This was SciFi with a bit of horror thrown in. For most of the film, the main tension is associated with the dangers inherent in deep space travel towards the sun. About 2/3rds of the way through you get a bit of horror thrown in, too. Other than the fact that the movie, in the end, centers around trying to \\"jump start\\" the sun with a giant fission bomb (which just strikes me as scientifically unsound) it's not bad at all.

It lacked that and jumps straight into the film without giving an account of what's going on. Like everyone else, I would like to think of myself as a man of above average intelligence, however, there were many a times while watching this film that I felt that a lot of things weren't explained. Sunshine truly doesn't deserve the celebration it got, not to me. And I don't think it was because I started watching this is at midnight, it just for varied reasons, didn't manage to explain itself that well. The film was also a little eerie but I never quite understood who's making the sacrifices and when. The movie just felt short of being taken quite seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame about the Ending","review":"Great premise. Great cast. Nice atmosphere, suspense and effects.

I was not looking for an Alien rehash.Could have gotten a 4 out of me if we'd just abandoned that needless sideshow.I will admit it continues in Danny's tradition of looking at the psychological effects of unusually harsh and unrealistic circumstances (ie: Zombies in 28 days later)But unlike 28 days later, we did not need a monster to pop up in this one.

Director Danny Boyle tries desperately to cover for the inanity of Alex Garland's screenplay by stuffing the screen with camera tricks and oh-so-purty F/X shots of the sun and the ship, the Icarus II, but by the time Garland trots out a Random (and overcooked) Malevolent Force to seal the fates of his surviving characters, all you can do is pray for an ending.

That this could mean their own deaths is something that probably weighs on their minds as much as on the viewer's.The film will also put one in mind of Alien, with the confining space of the ship and the intimacy of a small group. There's even a nod to Silent Running, with the greenhouse/oxygen garden on board.The film might have benefited by the inclusion of some bits of backstory on these people and maybe some transmission from their families back on Earth.

Unfortunately, during the mission, many problems ensue. This film was made on an evidently cheap budget - not by itself a problem, if the movie was interesting, which is not.

I really liked this movie. Instead of a simple premise, predictable dialogue, and a happy ending, we are given all the drama of 8 people trying to stay sane on a long journey coinciding with a suicide mission with a noble goal driving them along.

Taken individually, DC's work seems like a stanza from a much larger composition. But, when placed together with Reilly's earlier albums (First 4, Domo Arigato, Guitar + Other Machines), Someone Else's Party really shines, in particular the title track. Reilly plays his guitar like no other (save perhaps Johnny Marr), and the production crew has been held-over from the Rebellion sessions.If you're new to DC, I would suggest Domo Arigato or Sex and Death before SEP, but it would be a nice addition to any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"All of the drama in the novel is packed into the last 30 pages.

But to be quite honest I found it to be almost unbearably boring and drawn out. It simply reeks of the style of the times, which was to so forcefully over dramatize everything that work now seems almost comical. The point of the novel was supposedly to show how Eyre was able to overcome the sexism of her time, but in the end it seems as though she gave in to the sexism and ended up getting lucky. The plot is weak, the characters are unrealistic, and the language is far too melancholy. I won't argue that it was progressive for its time, simply because of the fact it was written by a woman and openly spoke out against the sexism in society, but in our times I'm afraid the message has been lost in its tediousness and extremity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I did not appreciate the fact the book was written in, it is very distracting trying to read the book.

Maria Felix is very over-the-top in this film, the direction is undistinguished, and the production values are on the mediocre side (like in many 1950s Spanish commercial films).

It was completely about the inefficient, or inept, or biased PD in Spokane. I am more interested in the lab work that is needed to catch the criminal and how the PD gathers the evidence for the lab, and a lot of description of the actual perpetrator. There is very little in this book. It is just page after page about how negligent the Spokane PD was. I can certainly believe this and I sympathize with the author's frustration.

It became very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Cop, Terrible Writer","review":"I have been a reader of true crime for several decades. This book was one of the worst written of them all. Redundancy abounds, and it asks more questions than it answers. A person would have to be terribly desperate for a story to waste time with this one. The only prevailing theme is Fuhrman's ego. He was never impressive as a cop, and he doesn't pass \\"Go\\" as an author. I say pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making murder boring","review":"What could be more exciting than a book about a recent serial killing case in my area? Lots of things.

I wanted to know more about the victims and way more about the killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pictures, pictures, where are the pictures?","review":"America's favorite detective, and deservedly so.

After all, that's a dangerous occupation they have chosen, isn't it?But where are the pictures?A true crime case like this DEMANDS photographs; of the burial scenes, the cops, the victims, and of course, the serial killer himself, doesn't it?Still, a pretty good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Read!","review":"As a listener of Mark Fuhrman's radio show I was pleased when he announced he was writing a book about Spokane's Serial Killer. He did not disappoint. The book is filled with facts of the murders, crime scene locations, and the mistakes made by the Spokane Police Department. Fuhrman along with his radio co-host Mike Fitzsimmons takes the reader along when they go searching for clues and meetings with the Spokane Police. The writing style is different than the previous two books by Fuhrman, but I must say I enjoyed this more. Looking forward to the next book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An investigation that wouldn't go away.","review":"Prostitutes were turning up murdered in the Spokane area and all the police seemed to be interessted in doing was \\"bagging and tagging\\" them. Fitzsimmons and Fuhrman were the ones who seemed to be pursing clues, talking to witnesses and keeping this case alive. The Spokane authorities didn't seem to be too interested in using the \\"old fashioned\\" method of solving crimes--footwork and interviewing, they were convinced that DNA would catch this killer. Fuhrman paints a fascinating story of a serial killer just screaming to be caught. Shame on Spokane authorities for not being able to see the forrest for the trees, and kudos to Mark and Mike for their hard work. If you happen to see the story of Robert Yates on the court tv show The System, do yourself a favor. Turn off the TV and read the book. Well written, fast paced. Furhman did a first-rate job with this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark Furman does not belong in Spokane","review":"Mr. Furman makes clear that he has always longed to investigate a serial killer case. When the task force would not accommodate him by letting him join the investigative team, Mr. Furman chose to \\"investigate\\" the task force instead. The blistering and unrelenting attacks upon the detectives demonstrate Mr. Furman's pre-ordained objective in writing the book. Unfortunately, Murder in Spokane is short on facts, and long on speculation. It also is replete with Mr. Furman's egotistical ramblings about how he would have handled the ultimately successful investigation. In a bizarre twist, Furman contends that serial killers are extremely difficult to capture, but then criticizes the task force for not catching him sooner. The book is nearly impossible to finish because of Furman's speculative ramblings which cause the reader to nod off. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder in Spokane","review":"This has to be the poorest excuse of writing I've read in a long time. Mr. Furhman did nothing more than take a chronology of the deaths of these poor women and add his \\"monday morning\\" quarterbacking. I enjoyed Mr. Furhman's other books but this book was a great disappointment. If you REALLY want to read this, come to my garage sale and buy it for $.25 'cause that's all it's worth. Shame on me for spending a gift certificate on it and shame on Mr. Furhman for \\"writing\\" it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boastful and repetitive","review":"As an author, Fuhrman falls short. I am a true crime buff, however, I could not even finish reading this. Even though we all know that prostitues live a high risk lifestyle, I understand mentioning in a book with this topic, however, how many times must I read about it? At least twice (remember, I didn't finish the book) I read how high risk their lifestyle is.Also, so, he was involved in the Simpson case, let it go. If I wanted to read about that or the Moxley case, I would have gotten a book on those topics.I believe if you are a true crime buff, as I am, you should not waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible waste of time","review":"This book was terrible. Some have compared the author to Ann Rule...what a joke. Comparing Mark Furhman to Ann Rule is like comparing Ed Wood to Steven Speilburg. Actually, Furhman has writing ability but wasted it with page after page of second guessing the Spokene police. Even though a lot of it was with some justification, this is not why I bought the book. Very little was devoted to the seriel killer who preyed on Spokene area prostitues for years before he was caught. The purpose of of this review is not to honor the talent of Ann Rule, although it is considerabale, but Furhman could take a few lessons and do much more reseach into the backgroud of the killer. Perhaps I was expecting too much. I got way too little. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me...","review":"...but I thought this book was incredibly boring. I read the other reviews before buying it and expected it to be as good as Fuhrman's other book, Murder in Brentwood. Made it through about a 1/3 of the book and gave up. How the author could make a story about the murder of 8 hookers boring is beyond me. But like I said, seems like everyone else liked it. Just wanted to put my two cents in though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Forgettable! The Title Should Read Murders in Spokane!","review":"Sometimes I wished Mark Fuhrman would just go away, ever since his notoriety during the O.J. Simpson trial, he has been seen and heard on Fox giving criticisms regarding criminal investigations. Kind of ironic since he bungled one of the century's most notorious cases with numerous mistakes. Now, he has relocated and retired from diverse Los Angeles, California to less diverse Idaho where he lives with his family. He writes about the Murders in Spokane just as his book, Murders in Brentwood because it involves multiple victims. After reading Barer's book on the same case, I vaguely remembered Fuhrman's book which was more about him than about the victims and the case itself. Fuhrman is still trying to gain acceptance among his peers or try to forget the Simpson debacle but wherever he goes, that case will follow him to the grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"more display of Fuhrman's big ego","review":"This book was just another example of Fuhrman's big ego. The same ego that got him to lie during sworn testimony. Because he he has a good gift of gab and is a fairly good looking guy the world and himself thinks he is God's gift to criminal investigations. You don't have to read between the lines to see his ego come out, it's right out there in front of you. Don't waste your money on this dribble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incompetence or inexperience?","review":"I thought the book was very good. I have read 2 books now by Mr. Fuhrman. I am not sure if the Spokane PD/Task force was just inexperienced or incompetent. After the first few bodies showed up being prostitutes, my first thought was why the police didn't set up surveillance at East Sprague with decoys also. They also seemed stubborn and afraid to involve other people because of embarrassment. I don't understand how Ted Bundy, The Green River Killer, and the Spokane killer could dispose of that many women before being apprehended. It's incredible. What are the cops doing up there in the Pacific Northwest? It takes 20 years and approx. 49 murders before a suspect is arrested in the Green River killings. The Spokane killer disposed of about half of that himself. Anyway, Mark raises some good points and this case could have been solved much earlier, saving many lives. I enjoyed it and can't wait until the next Fuhrman book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put this book down.","review":"I'm reading backwards...Murder in Greenwhich and the book on the O.J.

I couldn't sleep the night I read it. I think Fuhrman is an excellent writer. Perhaps it's best he resigned his detective position. His details, research, thoughts were all quite excellent. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in true crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Typical True Crime Book","review":"I was disappointed because we never got to know the criminal and the victims.

Right from the first song, this album commands you to do something physical or active. I started jogging after the first few listens, and although it did hurt at first, you eventually forget about it and lose yourself in the fast paced beats, and the amazing basslines. The shouting vocals also helped, they acted as though they were being sung by a drill seargant at a boot camp. It is impossible to sit still during this album. just get it if you need exercise, or if you just want something agressive yet not headache inducing. You will realise that there is a purpose to fitness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the effort","review":"Well, after listening to a few Nitzer Ebb releases, I decided to purchase one that I hadn't heard. I bought this one. Obviously, there are quite a few people who hold this CD in high regard, but sadly, I'm not one of them. Realizing that this album was recorded in 1987, I had to think of the period of time and the other music being recorded at the time. So with that, I have found that this CD is too minimalistic for my tastes. Compared with \\"industrial\\" music being produced around the same era, this CD is too monotonous with regards to the speed and the similar synth basslines for my tastes. I do credit Nitzer Ebb with showing a lot of attitude on this release, but it still falls short in my mind for the era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated - empty and meaningless","review":"It just is.I recall when this came out in '87 and it was in all the clubs. I bought a copy and played it to death but then I slowly realized that while other industrial bands had a message and some substance to go along with their beats - Nitzer Ebb weren't really saying anything. It's a bunch of shouting and yelling of words that sound aggressive but they really don't mean much.Compare them to lyrics from Front 242, Laibach, Front Line Assembly, etc. and you'll see that NE were yelling but not saying anything. After a while they get a bit annoying really. I sold my copy a long time ago.Their dance beats on this CD/record get repetative as well. Not that repetition is bad - it's just within the same record I don't want to hear essentially the same tune twice with different lyrics.As for their popularity as \\"proof\\" of their greatness - Britney Spears was popular too."},{"rating":"1","title":"no music here","review":"For someone trying to get into \\"industrial\\" this is not the way to go. Hell, I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone.Here's what's on it: VERY simple drum tracks from a very old, annoyingly fake sounding drum machine and VERY plain synthesizer loops. There is no musical value here; there are at most 2 synth loops on top of a drum track and vocals. The loops aren't interesting at all, just a hand full of notes played over and over. The singing gets irritating after the fourth track.When I first picked up the album, I thought it had potential but now I realize it does not.

Misuse of commas was a major issue. The story was like something out of an after school special. The sheer corniness made me actually roll my eyes and put it down, and I'm a big sucker for romance.

I thought of it one day after seeing a Hot Tuna CD in a local record store, so decided to pull it out of the archives to see how it sounded after all these years. Aside from the snap, crackle, pop of old vinyl and a worn stylus, I found I loved the album as much as I ever did, if not more. The hunt began. I found it at a small, obscure shop, in the town I live in. I listen to it several times a week. Now I'm hungry for more. There'll never be another Quah, but Jorma's fine acoustic blues picking and warm, earthy voice shine through in all of his work.

Unfortunately, these tracks are outweighed by bland 80's hard rock drivel like Wanna Make Love and cheesy blooze rock filler like Prison Blues. Jason Bonham, lacking the subtlety and dexterity of his late father, fails to impress as does Robert Plant in his guest appearance on The Only One. John Miles is a better vocalist than Chris Farlow, but that's not saying much.

Still trying to find my musical taste so to speak, but always liked Led Zeppelin, Sabbath, Purple. This is not a Led Zeppelin album!What it is - is a diverse mix of where Page came from and where he was heading - with a few throw backs to the blues which he loves - me too! It's also not like the Coverdale/page CD he does years later.I still play a few licks off this album on guitar which I ripped off and incorporated into my style years back - almost a how to play blues CD!There's a couple of songs that are so so, but for the most part I really enjoy the album. I hadn't listened to it for about 10 years until I got the new CD and was blown away again by how strong the songs and playing are.Personal favs are Wasting my Time, The Only One (With Robert Plant), Liquid Mercury and Prison Blues.

Which, sorry to say, it generally is not. Aside from one or two good cuts, it's largely unlistenable. God knows I've tried. One keeps thinking -- is is really this bad? And the same answer comes back every time -- yep. 'tis. There's a reason it's selling for $1.58 in Amazon's used bin. Let me make an analogy. When I was in grade school, they used to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with butter on them. Gross. Why ruin a perfectly good sandwich? Dunno.

The music was sickening, uncomfortable and horrible. page could've done so much better. Him and Plant need to make an album that would blow fans away and they haven't done that.

However, it wasn't laid out pretty well. The vocal tracks on each songs were laid out very poorly. The instrumental tracks were pretty good. The vocalists on this record except Robert Plant were terrible. Robert Plant's vocals on \\"The Only One\\" wasn't at his best. Jason Bonham's drumming were pretty good. He played pretty much the same technique his father, John Bonham did. The bassists on this record weren't very good either. Overall, this record is very disapointing. If you're a true Led Zeppelin fan, you'd be very disapointed with this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"First off, a question. Can this be considered a re-hash of past glories and styles? The answer is yes. Led Zeppelin were a great band, but now are defunct. Page originally had a concept of a double album with sides of blues, rock, folk and other (similar to Stephen Stills 'Manasas'). But when demos were stolen he opted for the blues/rock format he was accustomed to.I say all of this because I like to judge things on their own merits, not because some icon from the past came out with something and oh, wow, we must compare to what he did in the past. The album was very enjoyable (as was the subsequent tour). When this came out, everyone was very excited about it and I knew a lot of people who had it. It isn't daring or anything else. It just is. It's a hard rock album that came at a point in the pop metal keyboard craze of the 80's. Where are all they now? So if you want shades of Zep or just plain good 'ole hard rock, here's your answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is and What Should Never Be","review":"This album does show off Page's awesome guitar skills, but with an 80's rock style. Guest appearances of Robert Plant and Jason Bonham are treats, but if you are looking for this album to sound like Led Zeppelin, you are out of luck. Even though this album lacks the Zeppelin feel, one song, Prison Blues, does resemble the classic guitar style Page uses with such songs as Bring it on Home and You Shook Me. A must for Jimmy Page fans, but not a necessity for Led Zeppelin fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinking Like A Led Zeppelin...","review":"I purchased this cd a few years back, but only got around to listening to it the other day. Why did I wait? I don't know. It was just filed away in my collection. When I finally got around to fishing it out, I expected no less than some great songs and cool guitar riffs. I was to be disappointed. One of the things that brings this record down is the 2 featured vocalists, John Miles and Chris Farlow. Both are competent vocalists, don't get me wrong. Page shouldn't have let them write their own lyrics. I have never heard so many rock cliches on a single album. Most of the songs sound formulaic. Page sounds like he is bored. This cd gets a 2 star rating instead of one just for The Only One. This is a track that features Robert Plant on lead vocals.

Think before you order."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST DIAPERS YOUR MONEY CAN BUY!","review":"Pampers Swaddlers diapers are the best diapers your money can buy. They are ultrasoft on your baby's skin and are highly absorptive. They are very stretchy so it is easy to put the diapers on. I have exclusively used these diapers with both of my children and have NEVER had leak problems or diaper rash issues. They are a bit more expensive than other diapers and more expensive than even the Pampers baby dry diapers but they are well worth it. I highly recommend these diapers and wouldn't dare put anything else on my baby's bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit","review":"Our son in now 2.5 months old.

There are several great songs on this album..Title track is powerful. Temptation is a passionate ballad, and Eyes of a Stranger has a certain sexual feeling that is fantastic.

But bands put out good and bad albums, and \\"Contagious,\\" which others have noted is Jimmy DeGrasso's first album and Joey Alves' last with the band, is not all that good.\\"Contagious\\" starts well with the title track, but from then on, there's really not much. \\"The Kid Goes Crazy\\" is another of those comic tracks, like \\"Barroom Boogie\\" before it, but doesn't quite live up to the standard.

Okay the compliments are out of the way. I love this album, but this is the worst sounding edition I have ever heard.

However, just because something is musically innovative doesn't mean it is enjoyable. I tried for YEARS to like listening to this album because I knew it was clever.

Kerry Minnear, Gary Green and Malcolm Mortimore (all,from Gentle Giant), have just formed a new band this year, and they're called, \\"Three Friends!\\" Who would have thought?! I heard a bit of them doing \\"Free Hand\\", and it sounded flawless, with a new singer sounding perhaps something like the guy from Kansas. But what's really exciting, (along with them getting together in the first place), is the prospect of them perhaps doing a new album! Hearing Minnear's recent theme music for the two live DVDs, makes that a very appealing prospect, indeed! I think we'd all better start e-mailing them about that, if you want to hear something akin to a new \\"Gentle Giant!\\" And, hell, who knows, perhaps other former members may feel encouraged to enter the fold.

The band's music is so historically critical to modern prog bands such as the Flower Kings, Transatlantic, Neal Morse and his former band mates! These bands continually pay written and musical tribute to this talented and extremely experimental 70's band. The first four GG L.P.'s from their extensive catalogue are absolute masterpieces of progressive, avante-garde, experimental music. Why are we, the listening public, left to suffer only second-rate, poor quality audience recordings produced by the remaining bandmates? GG deserves better, and so do we!

Maybe they can against someone with no skills, but not against a trained fighter. This book is very with the times as it fills in the gap for people who train mostly with the gi and would like to know how to adjust their moves for a no rules or less rules situation. For someone who isn't interested in 'pajama-grappling' as I like to call it, this book teaches you the BJJ that you really need to know without all the silly flexible monkey moves that'll probably get you killed anyway. The DVD that came with it makes it a real bargain too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As the title says ...","review":"When you look at a lot of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu books on self defense, they seem to switch over to a very traditional looking style. This book does the opposite by showing the reader how the standard techniques of Jiu-jitsu can be used in a less sportive situation.This books value for those looking for a non-sportive groundfighting method is appreciated by those in the military and law enforcement community. The forward by a 5th Special Forces Group member and reviews by police forces pretty much says it all. This is a no-nonsense book that weeds out the sportive side of jiu-jitsu for those martial artists looking to add some 'real' groundfighting to their style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD, Good Book","review":"I won't be as harsh at 'the gifter writer' and say that there are some things that I'd like to see from a \\"No Rules\\" book, but hey - it's a BJJ book! What do you expect!?!Although the book seems to be a re-hash of sections from the almighty Master Text, there are some valuable insters and does offer a reader looking for only this type of fighting a 'cheaper' alternative to Simco's monster manual.I do love the DVD and picked up the full set at [...]- really great stuff and more 'street' oriented than the book. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversold and Underdelivered","review":"I am a martial arts instructor who is wanting to incorporate some basic Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu into my curriculum for self-defense purposes. After reading all of the glowing reviews about this book and DVD being \\"straight and to the point\\" and how Simco just shows the street-effective techniques I thought this would be the right resource to utilize.I was wrong.I am very disappointed in the skimpy material in this book, all of which is designed for use by a very strong fighter in an MMA competition, not a normal sized individual on the street. Also, the DVD is nothing more than an advertisement for his other DVD sets. Seriously, there are only 3 techniques on the DVD (about 10 minutes worth) and the rest is previews without instruction for his other products.The techniques he does show are good if you are an MMA fighter, though there are not a lot of them. If you are looking for a self-defense book, I suggest buying something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Explanations; Accurate Instruction As Usual From Simco","review":"Another outstanding book of instruction from BJJ Black Belt, Gene Simco.These days all MMA fighters need to have BJJ skills and this book helps to explain why. It illustrates and explains the key moves and techniques used by skilled BJJ fighters to win mixed martial arts events. It also shows the wide application of BJJ methods in a variety of common self-defence scenarios.Like all of Simco's books his instruction is a model of concise clarity. The DVD shows that Simco can walk the talk, as he gives examples of some moves and techniques from the book.This book has enabled me to have a greater appreciation of MMA fighters and allows me to enjoy watching UFC type fights even more as I can appreciate what the fighters are trying to do in terms of positional advantage.This book will benefit any serious martial artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for those with digital cameras","review":"I bought this to compliment a recent purchase of a digital camera.

I got tired of sending the unit back and forth because it cost us the shipping every time. I opened the unit to see if I can at least determine why such an expensive unit would break down 3 times for the same reason. I found that the heating coil is a very thin metal and due to over heating it burns out at the connection near the air output.

To get warranty, it would have been a paid phone call to set up RMA and a $15 fee, plus shipping... went back to my old $15 dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy for the money","review":"This hairdryer was great for about 11 months. I loved it and raved about it to everyone I know. However, after 11 months the power went to about half. And, 2 months later sparks/smoke came out and it completely died. RIP Chi Pro. I thought it would last longer for the money. I am very sadded by the loss. So, I am trying out a new brand, twinturbo. (recommended to be by my stylist)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even make it a year","review":"I purchased this dryer in Feb. '09 and it started sparking today while I was drying my hair. I've never had a dryer go out so quickly - most have lasted 2-3 yrs. and cost much less. I don't recommend this Chi dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKEN AFTER 3 MONTHS!","review":"We splurged on an expensive hair dryer for my daughter only to have it stop working after 3 months! We were then told by Amazon to contact Farouk, who said we would have to pay $15 and shipping to have the warranty honored. Amazon told us to ship it back to Amazon and they paid the shipping and did replace it. Thank you Amazon, but what a hassle. We only hope it lasts longer than 3 months. We like their hair straightener (which has lasted well)but will not buy another Farouk product because of this experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"Nice, quiet hair dryer that we liked while it lasted...but...I bought this hair dryer on 5/6/09 and the heating element in it is already broken...just blows cold air now. That's pretty disappointing for the amount of money spent on this hair dryer and with such light use (used once or twice a day), so I recommend against buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Before I bought it, I read lost of reviews on Amazon and was a little bit upset. ;) Well I haven't used it so far cause I am a short hair guy. :-) But wife said she was really happy with it, low noise, well feeling. If she is happy, I am happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farouk chi dryer should be farouk shhhhhh","review":"Really not worth the hype. I usually find myself giving 5 star reviews but after one use this dryer gave up. Yes, the first use was wonderful, my hair looked great! The next day, I was going to use it for a retouch and poof only cold air came out. What an absolute waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!:Did not last","review":"I purchased this about 2.5 months ago and gave it to my son, a hairstylist. It worked beautifully until a week ago. All of a sudden, he gets nothing but cold air. Too much money to invest to get this result-so quickly! I wished it had a better warranty. I think I would have come out better purchasing directly from the company, instead of Amazon. I just wonder if this was a 2nd or refurbished product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced - Works OK","review":"I gave this two stars because it doesn't work any better than a 19.99 dryer from your local drug store. I wasn't worth the effort to return it, but I would NEVER purchase another one NOR would I ever recommend spending so much money, it is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 6 months and mfg. warranty is void if purchased from Amazon.","review":"Purchased this hair dryer six months ago and the heating element failed. Pretty short lifespan for a dryer. Called mfg. and was told warranty is VOID if purchased online (I confirmed this on Chi's website) and they also stated Amazon is not an authorized retailer. Amazon made good on the warranty after a few phone calls and sent a replacement unit.This warranty exclusion applies to all Farouk Systems products according to the mfg. I'm sure Amazon will honor the existing warranties but be prepared for a little extra work if your unit fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chi Dryer Smooths and Softens Hair","review":"My stylist uses this Chi dryer at the salon, and I always attributed my end results there to her skill, and not the hair dryer. However, she encouraged me to try a Chi dryer, and I couldn't be happier with the results. The Chi dryer smooths out split ends and damage and gives the hair a softer appearance. Amazon's price with free shipping can't be beat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after six weeks!!","review":"I purchased this product late Nov., hoping I bought something that would last a very long time considering the high price of this dryer. The hair dryer worked great at first; then just today it started to die out on me....I noticed the plug was extremely warm. I tried it a few hours later and it was completely dead. The warranty is not valid for purchases made over the internet, so I guess I'm out $80!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Farouk CHI","review":"I want to preface my review by saying that the only hair dryers I have for comparison are the ones that can be purchased for around $20 at wally-world, so my view may be biased by that. I was hesitant to fork out the extra cash for a hair dryer. I have a LOT of hair and it's long, so my hair dryers usually give out after a year or two. I haven't had this one that long, but even so, it uses less wattage, but gets my hair dry in about the same time. I had previously been using an 1875 watt dryer which tended to trip a lot of breakers. This one is only 1300 watts and hasn't tripped any breakers thus far. It also doesn't get as hot which leaves my hair much healthier, but the ceramic components help my hair get dry in around the same amount of time. I would definitely say that this was worth the extra $$. The only thing I can't speak for is it's longevity, but I'm hopeful that it will outlast the others I've had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I definitely didn't feel like i stepped out of a salon after using this hair dryer. I was hoping to eliminate the use of the flat iron with the purchase of this dryer (some of the other customers comments said they didn't have to use their flat iron), but i guess their hair isn't as thick as mine. Girls with thick hair - this dryer isn't for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best money I've spent on my hair!","review":"Oh, how I wish I'd known about this hair dryer years ago! This is by far the best money I've spent on my hair! My stylist recommended 3 brands of hair dryers, Chi was one of them. I looked at this one based on a Consumer Reports rating. After much research, I decided on this one and LOVE it! So quiet, easy to use, no frizzing, just smooth, silky hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"Dries in half of the time and leaves my hair with a sheen. I don't know how I lived without it. I've had it for over a month and I still thank my husband for buying this for me everytime I use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"Have been using my dryer for about a week. It definitely is quieter than my previous dryer, but it does NOT dry my hair any faster than other dryers. Also the dryer is heavier than any dryer I have ever used. Not worth the price tag in my opinion. I also hope it doesn't die like many others have reported, not at the price you are charging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"Works well on my thick hair. Blow dryer cuts down on blow drying time by at least five minutes but not sure if it is worth the price for five minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than a standard blow dryer","review":"This blow dryer was well worth the extra money, which was only about $50 more than a standard dryer. It puts out good heat and does everything the product claims. The best feature, in my opinion, is how quiet this dryer is. My wife uses a dryer every morning and the hearing loss this saves her is well worth the extra money. I expect it to last longer as well, but that remains to be seen. I have seen lower cost dryers that \\"burn up\\" after a few years so if this lasts longer, it may actually average out to lower cost. I noticed the power is only 1300 watts, which may help to keep it quiet, but it dries hair just as quickly, if not quicker. I tried several other dryers, including the popular Babyliss, but I found this Chi dryer to be the quietest by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard - Danger - Farouk has terrible customer service","review":"I've had this hair dryer for about 10 months before it almost lit my head on fire. Was a regular morning as any other, drying my hair when suddenly, it shot hot sparks onto my head. I was able to avoid a full blown flaming head with quick reflexes and water by the nearby sink. There was minimal damage to my hair, but the dryer's heating unit was toast. I called Farouk and they denied service because I didn't purchase from a salon.It's a shame, because I actually liked the dryer.**UPDATE January 2010**Amazon made an exception and replaced the hair dryer. Amazon rules!**UPDATE December 2010**The dryer's heating unit fried again. Cold setting only. This was after minimal use in less than a year. Going to try to contact Amazon again for help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe I fell for this","review":"I feel like an idiot for paying so much for a hair dryer. It worked okay for a while (nothing special, but it dried my hair). Now I've had it for 18 months and the heating element has failed. Turns out lots of other people have had the same problem...and there's no warranty.Serves me right for being dumb enough to pay so much for a hair dryer, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality, Not Worth The Price.","review":"Bought this hair dryer thinking it would be a high quality item (hence the price). Is not that powerful or hot to begin with. Long story short the warranty is one year and mine burned out (no heat) after exactly 13 months of infrequent use. Buy something cheaper that won't be such a disappointment when it fails.And yes this is/was a true CHI product (not a knock-off). It's just a piece of crap. Maybe the knock-offs are better than the \\"real\\" made in China CHI products?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted","review":"I bought this dryer in Dec 2009 and it stopped working in Feb 2011. For the money that is not long enough in my book as it was not an inexpensive one. It worked great while it did work. It heats up the way a professional blow dryer does and concentrates the air flow so it doesn't blow the rest of your hair around while trying to smooth sections. But again, I just can't see paying this kind of money for something that lasts just over a year. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"only lasted two weeks","review":"Only blew out cold air after just two weeks of use. Amazon is replacing for free. I love the way it dries my hair. I have very thick hair and this dryer dries it faster than any hair dryer I've ever used. I'm giving it another chance.I don't understand how a product that costs this much can have so many issues. My last hair dryer lasted 15 years and probably cost $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farouk Chi Pro GF Ceramic Low EMF Dryer","review":"Just had to have this dryer replaced after only 8 months of casual, personal use only every second day. It still worked but would not provide heat, only cool air. For this $$ a dryer should last a couple years. Farouk will not provide warranty for any Amazon purchases as they could be selling refurbished items apparently, so if you purchase and it stops working properly, Amazon makes good on returns if you return the broken one to them within 30 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Hair Dryer But DOES NOT LAST","review":"I absolutely loved this hair dryer- it dried my long, thick, hair quickly and made it smooth and shiny. When it died the first time (after about 6 months) I was able to replace it and continued to be happy with the purchase. Long story short - and THREE hair dryers later, I am unable to return the newest drier because the warranty is only 1 year and yet again it has died and only blows cold air. Considering the cost- this is a toss up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Dryer","review":"I got this for wife for xmas. she stated that it is quieter than her other one. she also stated that it gets too hot when using the attachments, so she uses the cold shot when it feels too hot. without an attachment, it feels fine. i like it that it's quiet because it doesn't wake me up in the morning like her other one. my two daughters seem to like it too, but we tell them not to let it get too close to the scalp. it's been two months now and it seems to be working okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product, but only lasted a year.","review":"This was my second Chi dryer to stop working in under a year's time, which is really disapointing considering how much they cost. This dryer worked really well until recently, when it started blowing occasional bursts of cold air. The other day it started shooting sparks (!) and then stopped blowing hot air completely. My mother-in-law bought the same hair dryer 6 months ago, and hers did the same exact thing. Farouk only offers a year warranty, so I suppose I'm out of luck. My next hair dryer will be a T3 dryer, which offers a 4 year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 15 months!","review":"I was very happy with this purchase. I got it on a gold box deal and paid only $79.99. Even that, I considered expensive, but I thought I'd splurge and see what all the CHI fuss was about. It worked quickly, was light and my hair looked great. Unfortuntely, when I got out of the shower this morning and plugged it in, it was dead. I bought it in late April 2007 and this is mid July 2008, so I got 15 months of daily use out of it, but I will have to think long and hard about buying another hair dryer with only a 1 year warranty. I am very disappointed. I rationalized the cost by thinking I would use it for 5+ years."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM !!!!!!","review":"Do not purchase this item if you plan on using it beyond 30 days as the manufacturer does not cover the unit if it is purchased online. I bought this for my wife and it stopped working. The warranty inside the box states that it is covered for one year but that contradicts what is stated in the product description on Amazon.com. I think that this form of coverage is problematic and unfair. If the manufacturer's warranty is not honored if sold through Amazon then Amazon should not sell it. The representative from Farouk stated that they will only warranty the unit if purchased by a professional salon. Good luck if you choose to purchase anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"only lasted 1 year. Do not buy this product","review":"The CHI hair dryer was great for exactly one year. I bought it from Amazon and was super excited. Now when I turn it on it blows cool air, not hot air as it did before. I have bought less expensive hair dryers that still work after 6 years. I am very dissapointed!!! There is noone who can repair it and the price you pay for the product is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality.

I liked the way it dried my hair and thought that maybe the failure of my first one after 8 months was a fluke. NO, it is a horrible product that does not last. The new one also failed and now just blows cold air just like the first. I work from home and do not even use this dryer every day. It got used about 3 times a week. I would not recommend anyone spend the money on this product. If you research it online you will see that not only does the heating element fail very frequently it is also a fire hazard and the plug will become very hot for no reason. Please beware and warn all you know.This company does not back up their product at all. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special, especially from CHI","review":"I love my CHI straightener, however this hair dryer was a total miss. It is quiet which is nice, but it didn't provide any less frizz, especially in the Florida humidity. My biggest complaint with this product is that the on/off button is exactly where you hold the dryer so during the drying process, you are constantly turning it off...HUGE ISSUE! This was really not what i was expecting and definitely not what I wanted :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as my RUSK hairdryer","review":"I've been using this CHI hair dryer for about a month now and really don't like it.

I expected a bit more for a $100+ dryer. I have short thin hair, so it definately wasn't over use that caused the dryer to go. This vendor was not interested in a return and I made the mistake of buying a second Chi dryer from them. This one only lasted three months before the heating element went. This vendor was actually rude about my request for an exchange. An all around disapointing transaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it - both mine broke down in 2+ years!","review":"I bought 2 in Feb 2009, and both broke down recently.

After the initial purchase, unit did not heat or work. Returned to mfr. under warranty but costs $15 for shipping and handling. They only provide 90 day warranty on the returned unit. The returned/repaired unit (actually was replaced with a new one) only lasted 6 months and now not working again. Customer service at Farouk Systems - (Chi Hair Dryers) only stated that this unit had a 90 day warranty. Theydid not seem to care that the units stop working or willing to offer any type of replacement or discount for another unit. The Quality of the units vs. the high cost of the unit does not seem to equate to the mfr's review or our expectations. Thought it would last longer than 6 months for an expensive hair dryer like this. Take caution before purchasing these units --- may not be worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this hair dryer!","review":"Purchased the Farouk Chi GF1505 and on the 3rd day it stopped making heat!

Would NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted.","review":"I had this dryer for just over a year and a half and used it almost daily. The heating element just went out the other morning.I'm very disappointed because it was the best dryer I've ever owned.

I didn't expect and expensive dryer like this to break so quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I've had this dryer for only six months and it's already broken.

Was great while it lasted though :-/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Naturally wavy hair? Not anymore!","review":"This dryer is fantastic!!! Worth every penny. I have naturally wavy hair that I usually blow dry straight and use a curling iron to finish off my style. Using a straightener has never worked because any humidity in the air would always cause some frizzage. With my CHI, I don't even have to use a curling iron or straightener after drying. My hair stays straight and keeps my style just from drying. My friend had a CHI and I used it once and fell in love. I have always just bought my dryers at Target before and never thought I would spend this kind of money on a hair dryer, because I never knew what a difference it really made. Love, LOVE it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive to last only 12 months","review":"I really liked this product when I purchased. Lightweight, dries your hair quickly, quiet etc. But after 12 months of normal use, it's a broken hair dryer. It only blows cold air. Really disappointed. I have a few \\"cheap\\" hair dryers that I've had for years and I was going to give away since I had this one. Luckily I've kept them or I would be w/out a hair dryer now. I noticed that this dryer does get really hot - probably why it dries your hair so quickly but wondering if this burns it out faster than other ones. After reading other reviews, seems like it is a common problem with these dryers and no warranty coverage when you buy through Amazon (other than 30 day warranty)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even last 2 years!!

I still have to straighten my hair afterward which I was hoping I wouldn't have to, but it isn't too much of a hassle.

My hair isn't very frizzy after blow drying it which is an improvement from my last dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best blow dryer I have ever had","review":"I bought this based on a story I saw on Good Morning America. The lady was from a Consumer Reports type magazine and rated several items. This blow dryer was on the high end of price, but so far it has been well worth the money spent. It dries my hair fast and without a lot of frizz that has resulted from other hair dryers. I would definitely recommend this, especially to people with curly hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for a Well Known Brand","review":"I love Chi products; I got the 1\\" straightener in May 09, and I just had to have the blow dryer too. So I thought I could get a good deal on one on eBay; I got a used one (the red version of the 1505 - the \\"turbo\\"), and it stopped blowing hot hair in November!! I was so mad, and so I knew that I needed to just get one brand new. Amazon had the lowest price of any website/store I looked at (even with coupons!), and so far, I've had no problems. It doesn't dry my hair as fast as the turbo version, and it is a little louder, but overall, I'm satisfied. I am able to dry my shoulder length hair in 7-8 minutes, and it comes out smooth : ) I definitely recommend this product to anyone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed !","review":"I bought this hair dryer from Amazon about 18 months ago and finally it decided only to blow cold air as other reviews stated. For such an expensive hair dryer, I really expect it will work at least a few more years. Long story short, after hearing my complain for a few days, my husband decided to try to fix it.

I was in the middle of drying my hair this morning when sparks started shooting out of the dryer into my hair, and the heating element went out. I only had a few singed hairs, thank goodness, it could have been a lot worse.

Today (June 2011) my Chi no longer blows hot air. I knew full well that it would not be covered under the warranty but figured it was worth the risk because of the much lower price. I take very good care of my hair appliances (as soon as I am done using them, they go back into the drawer) and I have never dropped the dryer. I am disappointed that I now have to replace my dryer. Luckily we have a back up dryer at home because there is nothing worse than needing to dry your hair so you can get out the door for the day and your dryer stops working! I have not yet decided whether to risk getting another CHI. I love the long cord. I guess it is now time to research more hair dryers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lived","review":"When I first bought this I was excited because CHI is supposed to make a quality product. Boy was I wrong. It worked fine like any regular dryer would except that it dried my hair a lot faster than my old dryer and quiet considering it was a more powerful dryer. Those are probably the only differences. For the money I had higher expectations. After 1 year the heating element died!!! A dryer this pricey should have lasted several years. Thankfully I didn't throw out my old Conair which I went back to using. I've had the Conair for almost 9 years and probably paid less than half for the CHI. Not worth the money I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good selection","review":"The choices of stories in this book are not very good. Some of them are repeats of other anthologies.

She lived for many years with multiple personalities and much of the book is about this. I don't take repressed memories or \\"cult abuse\\" seriously, but her weird story is a lifelong personal favorite of mine. My father met Sizemore during a personal appearance she made in the 1970s; she lived in my hometown of Greenwood SC at that time. (I was a small child and was not invited). Since that time she has gotten involved with people claiming to be survivors of cult abuse and even written part of a book on this topic.

Even better is the variety of sounds you get here. It all rocks, sure enough, but there's a change of pace thrown in here and there, background vocals exhorting the crew to higher heights and the drumming. Ah yes, the drumming. Never flashy, always perfect, like the minister's daughter. My only complaint is the mastering. Maxed out it is. The music is already max volume. I would prefer to up the volume to get extra thrills myself, thank you. As it is, turning this beauty up leads to beastly ear pain instead of instant analogue aural nirvana. Slight complaint, though. In fact, I think I'll play it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but it ... a lot of batteries","review":"I originally bought this watch during my wife's pregnancy. This watch is awesome because I don't need another device on my body for my wife to reach me. The free 1 yr subsription from Skytel is pretty good too!

It is very well written and is packed with useful (essential) information. One very illustrative and important example explains the process of splitting up the classic introductory program 'Hello World!' into multiple source files, using a header file to do so.

Our aquarium has large, natural colored river pebbles, so we can't really get the roots covered adequately enough to weight the plants down with them. We have freshwater anacharis plants. We were using plastic tie wraps to hold the anacharis strands together, and then stuck the bunch into the pebbles, but some strands would break off and leave a gap in the bunch. This would allow the rest of the bunch to float up and out of the tie wrap. Now they just do the same thing with the lead wrap weights, but I notice that at least it does take longer for the bunch to break loose and float to the top in loose strands. I think this is because you can wrap the lead ties a little tighter and cover a little more of the strand base by spiraling the tie up as you wrap. Oh well, it's better than the plastic tie wrap method.

Not only do you have stupid song titles: Kittens Got Claws, Slow Poke Music, but you also have Coverdale impersonating Robert Plant: Judgement Day. Does anyone recall Kasmir?

I liked the old bluesy 'snake, but the album \\"Whitesnake\\", with John Sykes playing some absolutely storming guitar, and great drumming from Aynsley Dunbar set a new bar.This album is a horrible mess. Many of the songs that others seem to like (Judgement Day, Sailing Ships) are incredibly poor. They are a musically all over the place veering between styles. Vai's playing is completely out of character with most of the songs. For me, I prefer the dumb, but at least \\"straight ahead\\" songs like \\"Kitten's got claws\\" on this album.You don'y need to get this album unless a) you are a Steve Vai fan, and don't mind that his playing is disconnected from the song playing, or b) your just want to complete your Coverdale collection.

Steve Vai came in at last minute to replace guitarrist Adrian Vanderberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Record","review":"Nice album, nice line-up. Perhaps Steve Vai wasn't the right choice for Whitesnake 'cos he's too widdly. That said, he's 10 times better then John Sykes, who played on the 1987 album. The song are good, although typically 80s, and the lyrics are a bit cheesy. But most of the songs are outstanding. My favourites are \`Wings of the storm', \`Judgement Day' and \`Slip of the tongue'. The remake of \`Fool for your loving' ain't bad either. I'm giving it 4 out of 5. Like I said, Vai is awesome but not the right choice, I think Adrian Vandenberg is better because he has got chops, but he never let's his solos distract from the song(listen to a Vandenberg(the band) album if you want to konow why). Sarzo and Aldridge do a fine job creating a solid backing and David is singing good as always. Nice one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Exceptionally Great Serpent","review":"Whitesnake's 1989 album is another winner being a nice follow-up to ultra superhit WHITESNAKE. It is extention of the 1987 album for sure but this time the sound becomes much more classic a bit remnicent of David Lee Roth/Van Halen. Well balanced in soft ballads and straight ahead rockers.The most impressive of the straight-aheads is WINGS OF THE STORM This really kicks! And NOW YOU ARE GONE is exactly the perfect style of power ballad I had been dreaming so long. The last one SAILING SHIPS is pungent with classic hard rock masters, a bit remniscent of Led Zeppelin's STAIRWAYS TO HEAVEN.They are truly the band true rock fans want it back!

This is my first effort at creating a web page from scratch rather than updating an old one. I will start by being positive. What I do like is how the author explains the scripts used in the exercies. He starts at the beginning of the script and says what is happening as the script progresses. Now for the negative. This book is poorly written. Typos abound, including in the scripts. It is very frustrating to spend time trying to figure out why a script won't run when you've typed everything in as you are told. It is also not written very professionally. The language tries to come off as a layman, however the bad grammar and incorrect punctuation makes it come off as ignorant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic yet original","review":"We checked out this pattern in a bricks-and-mortar store, and loved the look (classic yet with some original touches like the different length tines on the forks) and feel (beautiful balance, though on the heavy side).

I've had horses for over 50 years and, believe me, they do NOT behave like this horse. They are wonderful, perfect animals but this was way beyond anything that would happen in real life.

The most amazing thing about this record is that it was the follow-up to their hit, Pornograffitti, and unlike most artists, Extreme broke new ground.They did not try to rewrite \\"More than Words\\" or \\"Hole Hearted\\". They produced a thoghtful, musically diverse epic that cannot be matched by any rock band of the past 20 years.

The main reason for this is the awesome talent of guitarist Nuno Bettencourt. He is astounding - he plays wicked guitar, he writes and arranges all the music, he sings, and he produces. You will experience everything Nuno has to offer on this album and it will make you search out all his other work. I can't begin to describe how awesome this music is, you have to hear it for yourself. This is for people who love high quality rock music with virtuoso guitar playing and amazing songwriting. As a musician, I really do think that Nuno is one of those people who just oozes creativity and virtuosity. There's is nothing he can't do.

It was even during the grunge period in music history. Perhaps Extreme weren't viewed as grungy enough. They're more rock than grunge anyway. Hard rock I might add. This, their third cd, was by far their best, most consistent and most original. Extreme's lyrics were insightful and perceptive on this cd and the music far surpassed what they had previously achieved. Songs like \\"Rest in Peace\\", \\"Cupid's Dead\\", \\"Tragic Comic\\", \\"Stop the World\\" and the three part opus \\"Rise 'n' Shine\\", \\"Am I Ever Going to Change\\" and \\"Who Cares?\\" are some of the best songs they've done.

If you hear the complete album twice you never want to part with it, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts weak, ends awesome","review":"This is a very underappreciated album, probably because the material literally goes from bad to great.

I am happy to say that this book is neither. The author gives a very brief but clear explanation of Taoist belief, and relates it to the struggles faced by all who live in our consumer society. He also distinguishes Taoist beliefs from other traditions such as Christian and Buddhist.

Sorry, but I can not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"A great game! A wonderful combination of stategy, great graphics, a variety of interesting playable characters, variable weapons, and interactive scenery! The graphics are the best of any role-playing type game I've seen!My only critisism (but a significant one) is the lack of adequate \\"save areas\\". If your character dies before completing a level you start from the beginning (all over again) every-single-time. Since many of these levels are very difficult this means you repeat the earlier portions of certain levels many, many times. I confess. I actually went on-line to get the invincibility cheat-code so that I could complete certain very frustrating levels. This is the only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Intuitive Controls Drive Ya Nuts","review":"If you're looking for something along the lines of Balder's Gate this is not the game to get. The story line is okay, but the controls are not intuitive and hard to figure out. If you are used to using the buttons on the XBox controller then this will drive you nuts. The weapon and shield controls are the triggers which I thought completely ridiculous. And, you can't really customize the controls the way you want. If you want to try it rent it first. I played one night then returned it. Another annoying thing is there isn't enough health potions. Another thing is the turning and movement thing. You can't turn when moving like forward or backward. So, if you're trying to attack an Ogre, and he gets behind you, you have to use the left thumbstick to get behind him and the right thumbstick to turn around while you try and hack him, so then you're hacking at thin air. Overall very disapointing. Decent graphics though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything about it is wonderful, except...","review":"Its frusterating as hell. The gameplay is wonderful, and while the storyline and mid-mission cinematic scenes aren't the best, the overall experience of the game is fantastic. The only problem is that it's so darn hard. Not just that, but there are no mid-mission saves, and so when you are killed, you have to play the whole level again. This is very frusterating. But, when I was replaying the levels over and over again, I just tried to immerse myself in the wonderful gameplay and enjoy the fun and try not to think about it being the tenth time I played the level. The traps, unlike some reviewers said, aren't that bad. Most can be seen before-hand, and the few that can't generally don't really hurt you enough to worry about. Anyhow, enough said. This game is truly entertaining, but I wouldn't recommend it to the casual-just play a little here and there for fun-gamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Graphics....","review":"First, let me say, Enclave has beautiful graphics. But after playing it awhile, I found myself frustrated by my inability to generate my own character, or to be able to start out with a character of my own gender (female). True, later on, you can select a new character at each level, but after a while, I just found myself NOT caring about playing any further.I prefer games with a little plot and a LOT more diversity at the get go. Enclave just failed to grab my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's about as \\"mature\\" as a round of Donkey Kong","review":"Enclave takes a great story and reduces it to a series of obstacle courses. The levels do little to progress the plot, involve the character, or introduce any new characters (when a new one is introduced, their usually just standing in the middle of a level with no explanation). And, gues what? You get to replay each level over and over until you've memorized where all the \\"barrels\\" fall. And your reward for completing the insane levels which have no save points? Not even a descent cut-scene. Sound like fun? No, it's really not. For the mature gamer? Ya, meaning your 40 and still enjoy \\"Asteroids.\\" This is not \\"Thief\\" of \\"Thief 2.\\" They had detailed stories and characters... and mid-mission saves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent before you buy.","review":"Grafix, good artsy goes with the mood.

Run around swinging wlidly and hope you eventually kill something.Challenge, with out aim or combat system simple weak monsters are potentially deadly, Only cheats may help.Over all, this is two stars worth of game, thats all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a mature player! (16 and older that is)","review":"This game is a game for a mature player. It include extremely strong graphic violence, blood, and gore. This is most definately not a game for an 14 year old player and I am being dead serious. It includes the act of heads being decapetated with a six lbs war ax. In this game, you go down dungeons, catacombs, and creepy castle with all the medieval like weapons you can think of. With those weapons in your posession, you find demons, zombies, other soldiers, and creepy nighttime creatures in those catacombs. The creature feed on your flesh and the flesh of allready dead people. I also strongly suggest that you not play this game at twelve A.M. unless you want to get three nights of nightmares. So, with this in mind, this is a great game for a mature player 16 and older.

But for the uninitiated (poor souls), the music is good enough to stand on its own. The themes are simple, poignant, and expressed using the simplest means: some soaring strings, a little piano tinkle, and percussion that sounds somehow Japanese. Much of it is synthesized and sounds like a karaoke-machine, but it is affecting nevertheless. It ought to be sentimental--it comes very close, in fact--but ultimately I think Hisaishi's music succeeds in evoking genuine emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"This is a poor excuse for an album.

The remarkable thing about this book, and the history it records, is the way that the classic doubts about the standard account of Oswald were already arising within hours of the assassination. Lane on business the day of the assassination quotes an official figure in a hallway discussing quizzically the lone gunmen theory and how it didn't make sense given the facts already in the media. Almost everything seems to have appeared almost immediately even as the official account began to crystallize with such grim force.

When my copy of this CD arrived in the mail I immediately tore off the packaging and put it in the CD player...and had to postpone the walk I was about to take because the power of the music made tears come to my eyes. It was totally involving; by the end of the Hallelujah Chorus I was exhausted! I'm not one of the experts who has fifty different copies of the Messiah, but I have heard it both recorded and live every Christmas of my life, and this one is right up there. I confess I didn't expect it to be so good, for the price. The only thing I found that I didn't like was the unusual accelerandos, which tended to appear just when I was ready to lean back into a slow section. Also, there is a very limited number of tracks compared with most Messiah Highlights CDs; but since it's half or a quarter the price, what can you expect? Overall, I think this CD is an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a honest account","review":"Mr. Gasz has created with excruciating accuracy an honest portrayal of the difficulties surrounding the Second Amendment. The more real-world lobbyists on both sides of this terribly intense issue dig in, the more they appear foolish. Our society's trust in compromise has long been put to rest and Congressionally, the all or nothing stance prevails. Finally, someone has exposed these silly postures for what they are with a recommendation that I found to be quite just and fair. I applaud Mr. Gasz for his forthright depiction of the ridiculous NRA and its bizarre leader. This novel is a compelling page-turner chock-full of ingenious intrigue and action. The refreshingly simplistic use of language and lack of meticulous landscape makes for a quick read that will leave you thinking for days after the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"Joseph Gasz has written a tantalizing novel around a topic that engenders strong and passionate responses on at least two dimensions of a controversial topic. The story line is gripping and the numerous literary vignettes provide nice respites from an engaging and positively strenuous mental exercise. Once finished, the reader will have reexamined the notion of the right to keep and bear arms and completed an exiting literary journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive on...","review":"From the band that brought you the memorably abhorrent \\"Everything About You\\" back in 1992, sample this lyric: \\"She was a good witch!

This album was super diversified. It showed UKJ's hard side (\\"It'a a Lie\\") as well as Whit's ability to sing ballads (\\"12 Cents\\").

Like Chris Thile of Nickel Creek, James Nash's guitar playing is among the top ten who have ever played the instrument. Stevie Coyle's finger style guitar is on a plane with Jorma Kaukonen.

The Waybacks blend a number of musical styles with electrifying results that vary from fast 'n' frenetic to serene 'n' sensual. \\"Saltflat Rhapsody\\" is \\"silk for the ears.\\" It's that smooth and soft. \\"Police Dog Blues\\" is funky-boppy with undertones of humor. The double mandolins on \\"Turkish Stalemate\\" are pure perfection. Their rendition of Floyd Cramer's \\"Last Date\\" is the best I've ever heard. Their lead singer emotes from every pore; he can make you feel the words down to your bones. Their first CD was remarkable in and of itself, but this one is truly amazing.

First heard them do I Wanna Be Like You and loved every minute. Then we saw the guys in person in Rutherfordton, NC. What at great night in a saloon! There is chemistry which is hard to find in many groups these days. There is creativity which crosses many lines of music including Jazz, Bluegrass, Rock, etc. The musicianship is 5 star and one only has to listen to Bright Place and Last Date to discover the sensual, sexual, creative side of these guys.

Robert definitely has a way of expressing now what we as believers will be doing for eternity...worshiping our risen Lord Jesus Christ! Sounds like a modern-day psalmist here.

It is a joy when a compilation is released and it is very good. This is such a release. Are these the best of the Science Fiction genre for 1995? I don't know, but these stories are wonderfull. When I buy short story anthologies I tend to look for authors I have enjoyed over the years. The true gift is when I find an author I know nothing about or a new and rising author that is going to be fun to follow. This anthology has some of the big names such as Le Guin and Silverberg who both have written execellent stories. The true find for me was Nancy Kress. Her 'Evolution' is about a plague and the ramifications of genetic manipulation. Kress wrote 'An Alien light' in 1988 and I had lost track of her since. She is truly an amazing find. This book is well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cooker","review":"I purchased this cooker over a year ago and it works well, both cooking and warming rice. You don't want to prepare rice really far in advance because it will dry out on the warming function over time, but it is OK for a day or two.

The B Side to \\"Sleepwalk,\\" \\"Nivarm's Song\\" is included, but why the rest of the album didn't make its way on is a mystery.Since most of Frampton's work is not on CD - this is a good alternative to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed full of information","review":"Very informative, if a little bit fast paced and dry.

If you don't like lotions with a strong odor you might not like this lotion, but I love the strong minty, tea tree smell. It's very earthy. I have very dry skin, and I live in Chicago where the winter wind is dry and brutal so I need a good, heavy moisturizing lotion. This lotion is very heavy to the point where it feels a little bit sticky when you put it on your skin. However, the lotion quickly soaks in, and the sticky feeling fades away, leaving your skin soft and moisturized. The moisture is long-lasting too. This lotion is perfect for me. If you have oilier skin or don't live in a dry area you may want something a little lighter, but Nature's Gate has a wide selection of lotions that would work for you.

I love Cher, I have every album she's ever put out and I can honestly say this album is gross. Maybe it's just that it's terribly dated (as most Cher CDs are). It's just sound so uninspired. Sounds like a bunch of crappy songs that didn't make the cut for her previous 3 albums (Heart of Stone, Cher and I Paralyze), so they stuck them all on this one.Although the songs suck, Cher's voice is powerful. She belts it out into that microphone with her background Christian-rock style chorus. Vocally this album is great. Still, Cher's voice can't save this album. The keyboards and sappy songs ruin it and any potential it had.I still love Cher. She still rocks. But if you're thinking about buying this album, save your money, it'll just gross you out."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but rather forgettable release from the diva","review":"Cher's 1991 release Love Hurts is a mixed bag at best. The album boasts one surefire classic for Cher with \\"Save Up All Your Tears\\", but the rest of the album is a different story. Her remakes of \\"Love Hurts\\" (also covered on her 1975 STARS album) and \\"A World Without Heroes\\" both start out strong, but fizzle out fast. I was never too much a fan of \\"Love And Understanding,\\" the albums top 20 hit. On this album, you can tell Cher is tiring of the \\"Geffen sound\\" from her s/t 1987 and Heart of Stone albums, but she does wanna end the trilogy as good as she can. Only problem is that the material just isn't that memorable. The final track \\"Who You Gonna Believe,\\" comes as a relieve because after going through so many bland tracks, you get rewarded with a fun rocker that could've been a hit. The red hair cover (which was just reissued by Geffen) is worth the discounted price alone for this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Inspiring","review":"This Christmas c.d. is my absolute favorite.

Unfortunately, I was bitterly disappointed. I guess I'm just a traditionalist. She handles the Christmas classics (such as O' Come All Ye Faithful) beautifully, but there are too few classics on this CD. With her cultural background, I expected more from Amy. \\"Rockin' around the Christmas Tree\\" is completely out of place here (I don't happen to like this song, but I guess her rendition is just about as good as anyone's). I like my contemporary Christmas music in small doses -- there is just too much on this CD. Maybe one day she'll record a more traditional CD and then I'll be back to rave about it. For now, this CD gets played maybe 3 times a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice Christmas collection","review":"I have had this tape (yes, tape) for several years and I bring it out every year at Christmas time.

Grant gives a most wonderful interpretation to Carly Simon's \\"The Night Before Christmas\\" ; you will find yourself singing along with the chorus.

I knew it was going to have more of a jazz influenced score and I was psyched about hearing something different , but I wasn't blown away at all. I imagine the score works great within the movie, but as a listening experience this is a really bland album with very little thematic material. While listening to this album, I kept noticing comparisons to Jame's Horner's \\"Sneakers\\" score, but just not as interesting as what Horner did. Williams is continuing to take more risks scoring films (Minority Report), but at the same time he is not coming up with the great themes we've come to expect from him.

Problem is, it doesn't work often enough for me to keep it. I wanted an MP3 player for playing OTR (Old Time Radio) programs - usually 10 to 30 minutes each. On two MP3 discs, the player worked fine for about 10 minutes - then would suddenly skip to the next track, leaving the previous one unfinished. The same thing would happen every time I tried to play the disc. On a third disc (with 120 10-minute shows), the player showed the number of tracks, but wouldn't play a darn thing. Without exception, these three discs all played fine in my computer. For what it's worth, the Koss sounds good when it's playing...but if you want to hear how your cuts finish, then look for another player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Bad Player","review":"Even though many say that the Koss is not worth it I have had no problems. Well one I can say that it won't read my CD-RW's. It reads my CD-R's just fine. I burned them with Easy CD Creator 4 and never had to change any settings. Right now I have a CD-R with 240 songs encoded at 160kb and it handles them fine. The sound quality is great other than it declines when the bass is turned on but not badly.

I spent nearly an entire day trying to get a CD-R encoded to work with the darn thing. What frustration. And when I finally -did- get a CD-R burnt that worked with it, the sound quality was reminiscent of a walkie talkie. LAME. There was this weird echo effect present in the MP3 playback that does not exist when the very same CD-R is taken to a desktop PC and played there. Also, the sound quality on CDs is bad, too. FWIW, I used RealJukebox Plus to encode from CD to MP3, and then used CDRWIN to burn the MP3s to CD-R.This KOSS unit is a shame, because I bought the KOSS unit since I was so pleased with their standard CD player, which costed me [price]. This unit, at [price] from my local ... store, is not worth more than [price] IMHO. I'm returning it tomorrow and picking up either the Philips/Magnavox unit, or the RCA unit.

Whoever said the antiskip doesn't work must not know anything about antiskip. As for the sound, it is awesome. The base boost makes it a ton better. It plays normal cd's very well, there is no difference between how it plays normal cd's and MP3 cd's except MP3 cd's take a couple seconds to boot up.Overall, it is the ideal Mp3/CD player because it's cheap, it works, and it has good sound.

I have a DVD player at home with MP3 capability, as well as two PCs, all three of them play the same discs flawlessly with no cracks or anything.The player plays audio CDs OK, but the very reason I bought it was because of the MP3 capability.On top of everything, I lost my Target receipt and could not return, because they changed their return policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Price, wish it would work correctly.","review":"I bought the player and it plays MP3's but it LOVES to randomly skip ahead a couple seconds in the middle of a song and it also insists on making some kind of \\"digital chirp\\" in songs I know sound just fine.

Oh well, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will scratch your CDs","review":"I bought mine on sale at target but I have to return it after one week because it scratched my CD-R. The metal plate and screws on the underside of the cover was the culprit. Previous reviews mentioned something about this problem, but since I am buying CDP 3100 a later model, I thought that maybe the manufacturer has corrected the problem but I was wrong. Anyway, for the one week that I had it, it played CD-Rs, CD-RWs and regular CDs just fine. For the money, it would have been a good buy. But I just can't keep this player knowing there's always that possibility it will ruin my CDs, or my kids' CDs or my friends'CDs particularly if it's regular CDs. And I can't imagine myself wasting time burning CD-R and RWs over and over again to replace the damaged ones. I decided to buy Memorex model 8507.

So, I gave it 3 stars. Today, I had an opportunity to check out a TDK Mojo. I still had the \\"ruined\\" discs from my Koss troubleshooting. Guess what? The Mojo read all those discs all fine, and even displayed the tags! There was nothing wrong with my system or burning. The problem was with this product.

I heard a large skip and replayed. Skip wasn't there. Did this several times at different locations. This would indicate the CD was OK and the player was skipping. Skipping will start annoying you to the point that you wished you paid more for a better player. Also, CD must be carefully inserted and firmly pressed into place. Otherwise, the player can't read the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall.........Very good","review":"this is a very good product. i can play over 100 songs on this player. i use a re-writable disk too. it reads it fine. once in a while it skips but i think it is because the batteries are low. great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not even consider wasting your money.

It uses batteries like there's no tomorrow.2. It skips like crazy on both MP3 and regular cd's.3. The display shows no names, titles, just numbers.4. Huge bulky design. Does not fit in any pockets, no belt clip and heavy5. Headphones have the shortest cable known to man.6. LOUD!!! it makes a lot of noise.7.

We've seen it all before in disaster movies about The Rapture. There can be as many stories about those left on earth as there are families and people. This one focuses on global chaos and turmoil, with government agents working to solve the mystery of the disappearance of all those people. It's an action movie about global conspiracies. The Bible never really tells us exactly what happens after believers are snatched away to be together with Jesus. This is an interesting interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showcasing the voice of a master.","review":"Scott Hamilton's tenor sax playing is beyond reproach on this disc. I thought an entire programme of slower material might drag but it most certainly doesn't. The selection of these chestnuts is carefully put together with medium tempo tunes like the gorgeous Flamingo and River of Sainte Marie nicely placed to keep things moving; two other equally magnificent songs I likewise hadn't heard before are I'm Glad Their Is You and Serenade In Blue. Scott's tone is spell binding with his unobtrusive British rhythm section of piano, bass, drums providing hushed, subtle and swinging support. The cover art work is tasteful and fits the mood perfectly but more importantly, the high quality of this 2005 recording clinches the occasion. If you would like the band to materialise, Star Trek like, in your living room, then just turn up the volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful album!","review":"I am a fan of Scott Hamilton of long standing, and I have many of his albums; however, I must say this is one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your ticket to inside the life of one Marine","review":"Train To Baghdad is a \\"behind the scenes\\" look at the some of the logistical operations in Iraq and the Marines which support them. Presented in a diary format from the view of Cpl. John Archer, Mr. Leatherwood maintains a steady pace and logical flow while making the story both easy to read and understand. The reader is taken through a mental tour of not only the realities and anxieties of military life in an area where violence is possible at any moment, but also the \\"hurry up and wait\\" mindset of rapidly deploying troops and supplies to an area to wait for further commands. Anyone who seeks to understand the Soldiers that help defend our country and its interests would do well to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is a great inside look at the day to day life of Marines on a modern day battlefield.

His \\"Ten Great Car Tunes\\" (nearly his alone, including instrumentals, lyrics, and vocals) gets better every time I listen to it. The lyrics range from fun to philosophical, and often catch you off guard with simple, disarming honesty. His melodies pull you in, follow you around throughout the day, and are beautifully enhanced by his harmonies. The variety too is impressive, from pop and rock and roll (to which you can't help but move) to sweet acoustic. And it is all powerfully supported by his skill with guitars (the CD includes two really fine instrumentals). I fully trust it will leave you, as it left me, hoping for much more music from this very talented man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mild=aggressive","review":"I bought the mild sound muffler in hopes it would be just that...

I always love the early simplistic Shadows tunes like Apache, Peace Pipe, as well as the marauding Stingray amongst others. Cliff's vocal is enchanting in almost all the song compilation in \\"Me & my Shadows\\", which I first listened with much pleasure whilst a high schoolboy in Malaysia. The rock tunes such as Geewhiz It's You, and the slower ballads are delightful and pleasant to the ears. They reflects the teen aspirations of those wonderful years gone, as in the 60's.

There were some great songs and of course being from Texas the song 'Texas' became an anthem for me and my friends. Wish this music was still popular. I miss Junkyard, Guns, L.A.

Hollywood, Texas, Blooze, Can't Hold Back, hold the album together with some hard rockin', no nonsence flavor, while Simple Man, and Hands Off slow it down without getting sappy. Simple Man, Hands Off, and Hollywood are true classic material, with Hands Off delivering one of the best lines ever sung. If you like this you should make a quest for the holy grail and find a copy of \\"6's 7's and 9's\\" it is even better, in my view could be the best album of all time.

Without that identification in many cases is almost impossible as many pods resemble each other very much indeed.Second: The metric conversion chart in the back of the book is wrong. Centimeters and inches must have changed places. The way it is now a 10 inch pepper like for instance Numex Big Jim is about the lenght of a thumb!!

Each song consists of Bible verses from the King James Bible. There is not much more to say than that. Some of the songs can be rather short (perhaps 45 seconds) which kind of shocked me the first time I listened to the cd. There are some 3 minute songs on there though (to the best of my knowledge). The voice is accompanied by folk music.They have some free samples/songs of their music at the author's website. I would go there first and see if this music conforms to your musical taste. The music definitely is unique, and I have grown to enjoy this cd.One note to keep in mind is that shipping for this item in particular can take awhile from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"An empty biography","review":"Other than the little mention of Colter in the Lewis and Clark Expedition journals, there is no verifiable material for this biography.

I found this book a total pleasure to read. Couldn't put it down! Although it is true that Colter's life was somewhat obscure by a lack of more historical documentation, Harris does an exemplary piece of work with what there is to work with. Citing such references as William Clark, Thomas James, Brackenridge, Bradbury and others, Harris does make a justifiable attempt to back up his story. Required reading for those into this time period of the early American West when mountain men roamed the wide open spaces, high mountain valleys and peaks. It must have been a tough, but very rewarding way of life...if you survived the perils and hardships of that day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I though","review":"I am over half way through reading this, and will be surprised if I finish. I thought this book was going to be a biographical story about John Colter, but I am finding out it is really a (insert any mountain man's name here) type of book.

On his latest release, \\"Life's Fairytale\\", Brian Hazard (the sole member of Color Theory) haunts us with emotive songs & Martin Gore-esque vocals. He is intricately complimented by a blend of post modern synths and a crystal clear piano.Highlights include,\\"Ponytail Girl\\",(I love the complex harmonies on this track), the dance infused \\"Everything I Thought I Had To Be\\", and the Anything Box cover \\"I Felt The Pain\\".

I just like to select it and listen through the entire collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffeehouse Techno","review":"Color Theory doesn&#65533;t make the kind of music you can mosh to, and even when he employs club beats, the results are still more suitable for easy-chair listening than shaking one&#65533;s behind to on the dancefloor.

He started play piano so many years ago and he's able to write good tunes and touching lyrics. He plays as Color Theory since almost a decade and since his first album \\"Sketches In Grey\\" his music developed so much until the nowadays emotional synthpop. On this \\"Life's Fairytale\\" he develops even more his electronic side (you have to know that his previous albums had piano based songs with electronic arrangements) by composing catchy tunes with a voice that many people paragoned with the one of Martin Gore (shame on you if you don't know Depeche Mode). This album contains also \\"Everything I Thought I Had To Be\\", the song that pushed me to listen to the Color Theory's music and forced me to get all his cds. If you dig touching, energetic and melodic electro pop, this could be for you also. Wanna try?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the truth is ours","review":"At times overproduced, Colloseum had some of the most talented artists of the day.

This water filter, a birthday gift for my husband, proved to be as easy to use as the advertisement. The video advertisement is deceptive, however, in its portrayal of how to fill the bag. But it was extremely easy to fill from the side of our canoe. We hung it from a tree back at camp and it worked great! It was so easy to use and store and the water was delicious. The only reason I didn't give the bag four stars was that the clean water output was quite slow. But when you're on a camping trip like this, who's in a hurry?

Now the product has no more capacity than a personal bottle filter. The fault is mine since 'Features' text is accurate.I give it a low score because it no longer fulfills it purpose as a high capacity camp filter, due to cost and hassle of replacement filters.

It is easy, and does a great job of filtering. But it is too slow for 20 people, so I just bought another one to have two for next time. It will easily satisfy 10 thirsty people in a decent order of time, and the water tastes great!The bag is a thick material, the connectors are all firm and tough, and it hangs well. A quality product for a great price. It is much easier to use than the average pump filter. You just fill it, and hang the bag. That's it! As you open the hose to fill your canteen, gravity brings the water through the filter and down the hose, into your canteen or cup. No pumping, no hard work. Just fill it in the creek or river, etc., and hang the bag.Looking for a large capacity water filter that is easy to use, sturdy, collapses to a tiny footprint, is lightweight, and going to last a long time? Then this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter.","review":"I work in the tropics 4 months out of the year; we drink river water because the site is secluded. This filter is a life saver; I wish I purchased it sooner. I love it. The water tastes great, the amount of water filtered can last for days, and you don't have to pump or put in chlorine tablets.

These pans have stainless steel bottoms for even heating, can go into the oven up to 500 degrees, are dishwasher safe, or clean up in just minutes if you wash them at the sink. You can even cook without oil if you wish. I use nylon or silicone utensils, soak the pan in water for 5 minutes or so if anything is dried on, and just wipe them out with soap and a wet cloth.

The upper part is held on to the lower with three press studs. There is no storage for extra cards or the remote. The two upper studs can be detached, so that the upper part hangs from the lower stud. However, because the case is very stiff it either covers the lens (if in front) or bumps into your chin.

In fact, I can't tell the difference between the waffles we ate in Germany and the ones that I now make at home. They never stick and the waffle maker never makes a mess. After using it, I wipe it down with soapy water and \\"Fertig!\\"--I am finished. The waffle maker cooks perfect waffles that have to correct thickness and texture.

The waffle maker cooks them very unevenly no matter the browning setting. There was also no difference between the two cooking modes, the waffle turned out the same.The absolutely worst part is the chemical smell that permeates all through the house when it's on. Horrible.

All deserve your attention, but the music that Kane, Welch, and Kaplin have created in their three recordings is special. In a time when music is more produced these recordings remind us of how \\"real\\" music can be. It sounds simple due to their approach to the music, however this is a creative hybrid of many styles and influences that is created by exceptional musicians. The two styles of writing--Kane and Welch-are different but compliment each other. Kaplin somehow finds the perfect sonic additions with his varied instrumentation. Now they have added Kieran's son on stripped down percussion and it drives but does not overpower the songs. I am amazed at how Kane keeps simplyfying his songs and how they actually become more musical and powerful. This is very sophisticated stuff. Pay attention and you will not regret this muscical journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sax at its best","review":"I heard Ace Cannon songs on old cassette many years ago,and I had been searching for ages to find and a copy of that tape on CD.Iam glad that I was finally able to find a CD containing just Gospel songs rather than Jazz or pop.Highly recomended listening, suitable for all lovers of traditional Gospel music, or instrumental music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly perfect premier recording","review":"Nearly perfect premier recording of a great Handel Opera.The music,without a doubt,is fantastic,try Clotilde's Act IIAria\\"Combattuta da due venti\\"with it's sweeping String writing,like a storm(CD II;track 9),or the Act III Duet for Clotilde and Adolfo\\"Cara!/Caro!\\"(CD III;track 5).But the singers,although theygive a good performance here,are vocally imperfect.Julianne Bairdis much too whispery,and Mary Ellen Callahan's voice too whiney.The other singers are rather gruff at times.But despite this it'sstill a great recording,with a lot to offer.This recording,withthe excellent Brewer chamber Orchestra,led by Rudolf Palmer,Livesup to their previous Imeneo recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Wedding Gift","review":"I recently gave this to a friend on her wedding day. I knew that she and her husband like to go on picnics and spend time outdoors. This basket has a beautiful design, and includes everything they need to help them enjoy simple picnic dates. The quality is very good, but the dishes are relatively cheap and made of plastic. As some have noted in other reviews, plastic dishes can be good because some parks do not allow glass. Also, one thing to consider is that this basket is not lightweight, and adding food inside may make it pretty heavy, depending on how far you'll be carrying it. Overall, I think it was a very nice gift, something that was a little different from typical wedding gifts, and she and her husband seemed to really love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picnic Basket","review":"We got this picnic basket for our 8-year old who asked Santa for it. She wants to have picnics with her friends in the backyard. It is nice that it comes with all of the items needed for the picnic so we did not have to add anything to it to make th basket functional for her picnics. And we just removed the wine opener.

I cannot even count the number of spelling, grammar, and layout mistakes. The book frequently refers to the incorrect figures, and even when one finds the correct figure, often the command shown in the figure will be different than the text describes! I believe the book is also using the wrong acronyms in some places, so the information may not even be reliable! For someone that does not know AIX well - which should be everyone reading this book - they will be thoroughly confused. Without an AIX machine in front of you, there really is no way to tell when the book is wrong. This is definitely only for the UNIX savvy that can figure the mistakes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A superficial text replete w/grammatical & spelling errors","review":"This book was a great disappointment in both its content and presentation. The treatment of most subjects was extremely superficial. Even more surprising was the extent of grammatical and spelling errors, as well as, reference to a non-existent Figure 6-6.

That's not really the intention... My kids really like them. When you jump around on them, it makes the jumper bounce everywhere they go, and they do gain a little height. But jumping (for kids) is just plain fun... this adds to it. And they're noisy, noisy, noisy, but aren't kids noisy anyway??? When they're outside jumping, I can hear them indoors... at least I know they haven't wandered off! We recommend them, as long as you don't think you're going to be able to jump onto the house with them. Also, be careful jumping on any slick surfaces, as a twisted ankle is likely to occur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made a great gift","review":"I got the moon boots for a very girly girl 7 year old who hates to get dirty, not wearing anything but a dress and anything not pink.

Talk about a great gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm..I can barely jump on this thing","review":"Well, first of all..I'm 13 so I guess I'm probably out of the weight range for these things now..but nonetheless, I still think these dont work very well. For little kids, these shoes help with balancing skills..and I have to admit they're pretty awesome on a trampoline (i did almost sprain my ankle tho). On the ground, though, they're just loud, heavy, shoes that clonk around. I wouldn't really recommend buying these though. They're kind of pointless and will probably end up under a pile of junk in your garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total piece of junk","review":"these seemed like such a good idea and my daughter and her best friend were actually willing to spend their own hard-earned money on them. So we bought them and I spent an hour or so assembling the two pairs. Within an hour we knew they had to go back. First and foremost, the girls were totally disappointed in what they did. Blame the box, it's deceptive, but I was willing to chalk that up to real world education and would have let my daughter deal with the lesson. More disturbing was that we had to replace a half dozen or more of the black rubber bands within that time, they snapped. Now I know why they give you so many, it's not just for the heaviest kids (who proabably are too old for the toy to begin with.) It's so every time the kids use them an adult can spend time putting new bands on...until you run out. Needless to say, they went back the same day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sprained Ankle shoes","review":"My son got these for his birthday. These are so dangerous!!!

The shoes are made of cheap pieces of plastic. The box includes bunches of black, elastic bands that you need to really s-t-r-e-t-c-h onto the shoes to provide the \\"bounce\\". The more your child weighs, the more bands you use, but you have to double or triple them onto the same hooks. They are very hard to install and could be dangerous if they snap back into your face while you are installing them. Once assembled, the kids played with them for about 10 minutes before becoming bored. They haven't played with them since. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger danger danger!","review":"My daughter received this as a gift and we excitedly put it all together for her to use right away. The minute she put her feet in the shoes, however, I saw the immediate problem. Just imagine your feet attached to 2 platform that are higher than they are wide. It is too easy for the shoe to fall over. But if your foot is attached, it's going with the shoe. The perfect recipe for a broken ankle.There are not too many toys that I ban from my kids. This toy makes the top of the list. I am surprised these are still be sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"My daughters ages 10 and 8 wanted the moon shoes for 2 yrs.

She thought they were cool for a few days and now they are sitting in the garage. We put the appropriate number of strings on for her weight (56 pounds) but she doesn't seem to bounce very high.

In fact, even the most highly trained athlete wearing these shoes would only be able to jump as high as the clouds.While gravity and shoddy craftsmanship might limit your jumping potential, your imagination will allow you to leap to the stars! That's the best part about Black Moon Shoes -- it's not about how high you can or can't jump -- it's about how high you WANT to jump.So when it comes to using your imagination and developing important motor skills, Hart Enterprises' Black Moon Shoes are leaps and bounds above the competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed","review":"As a huge Prince fan, when I first saw these I thought they were PURPLE RAIN shoes, so I purchased four pairs without hesitation.

The Tom Petty original that opens the CD is worth the cost of the CD alone. It is the single best rock and roll Christmas song ever written. Ann and Nancy Wilson deliver a great version of Blue Christmas and the Randy Travis Jingle Bell Rock is the best version I have heard. Bon Jovi rocks, Luther adds a bit of great jazz and although I am not typically a fan of hers -- Sinead O'Conner delivers a beautiful version of \\"I believe in you\\".

I've read all the books in her two series and this is my first encounter with one of her stand-alones . I found the book engrossing and could hardly put it down until the last chapters. The way the book ended left me cold! It was as though the author didn't think the storyline through before she began writing and then couldn't come up with an ending that lived up to the wonderful character development and the beautiful narrative. The \\"who,\\" the \\"why,\\" and the \\"how\\" of the ending seemed to me more in line with a novice writer rather than someone of King's stature.

Rae Newborn is a strong central character with a history of depression. Like Anna Pidgeon in the Nevada Barr mysteries this woman chooses a life in the wilderness. The setting is the San Juan Islands near Vancouver where Rae, a prize winning wood worker decides to restore the island home of her Uncle that burned over seventy years earlier. There are several subplots that have to do with Rae's family, her isolated childhood, a mental illness that has estranged her grown daughter and a husband and child killed in an auto accident. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"(1.5) Suffering from too much imagination","review":"FOLLY will eventually be a mass-market best seller, no doubt, in spite of the fact that the book cried out for a good editor. Read the other reviews for plot; I found it formulaic and clumsy. The heroine, Rae, an artist-woodworker, widowed and depressed, isolates herself on a remote island formerly owned by a mysterious dead relative. Not a huge mystery, but at least the hint of one. King's characters are so wooden and one-dimensional, they never come alive, stuck forever in their blocks. The plots twists in unlikely unresolved ways, leaving the reader with unanswered questions. Then there are endless pages devoted to varieties of wood that fail, however, to interest or enlighten. There is little personal investment by this writer, which says volumes beyond the much-burdened folly of FOLLY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Folly","review":"I found this whole book to be tedious.

Music by Handel, Storace, Dibdin and other 18th-century composers performed with style and charm, and with humour when called for. This is a more aesthetically pleasing album than Baird's later 'Jane Austen's Songbook', which is laudable in the completeness with which it includes the contents of one of Austen's songbooks, but suffers a little by the randomness of the arrangement and is not as well recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is What It Was All About","review":"This CD should be ranked up there with Metallica's Master of Puppets and Megadeth's Peace Sells.

It was amazing to find myself really blown away with the maturity of the composition!They could control the flow and emotion more than their first 2 albums. The sound sounded great too. Without attempting to create a too polished sound, they succesfully brought the energy of their music. I still remember in the beginning of 90's when first time listened to one of their track: Stop. I liked it very much. It was the time when I learned drums. But when I listen to that song now, I like it much more than before, also with the rest fo the songs in the album.

I've read more than a dozen of them now, and I relish the interplay between eccentric detective Nero Wolfe and his assistant Archie Goodwin. The Mother Hunt was no exception. While this one was a little thin on plot - Nero and Archie are \\"blocked\\" for most of the book and make no headway on the mystery until the last quarter of the novel - it has great characterization in spades. Perhaps my favorite part: more insight into the enigma that is Saul Panzer, the ace operative Nero Wolfe calls first when they need an extra pair of eyes and legs. Saul's great; he could easily be Nero's right hand man, if only he weren't so much like him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"can never get one delivered that isn't broken","review":"Choose another brand of rice dispenser.

But, in this case, after hearing Carla Ulbrich one evening on NPR, I not only bought a copy for me, but purchased two more to send to relatives. When I tell my friends about Carla Ulbrich's 'Fabulous Debut' album, the first thing that they ask me is, \\"What style is it?\\" The best that I can say is, \\"It's HER style!\\" Somehow, she bridges the gap from jazz to folk to acoustic rock to 'almost country' so smoothly, that one becomes convinced that mixing styles this easily is 'no big deal'. Beyond that, her songs are so thoughtful, personal and clever that, by the end of the album, you feel like you've been in a confession booth with a stand-up comic-savant who has just become a new friend.

However once I listened to \\"Building the Bridge\\", I was severely dissappointed. Boy, does this album scream suck! I mean, all the songs mesh together in one bland, adult-oriented pop, lackluster effort. Where are the catchy choruses? Where's the fun? Where's the energy? Where's the signature guitar licks?

I don't see why. The Italian reporters who went to Africa and South America didn't stage what they filmed. They just recorded and reported what these primitive peoples do. If anything, the narrator goes out of his way to explain and to justify many of the rudest scenes as being adaptive behavior, reasonable given the circumstances and capabilities of the people involved.MONDO MAGIC is no more exploitative than journalism usually is. And any shockingness is the result of what those people actually, customarily do. If what they do is disgusting, that isn't the fault of the journalists who chose to record it and present it to us. The dishonesty would be in omitting it, concealing it, and spinning a false yarn about what a glorious life is lived by \\"the noble savage.\\" We have had many falsehoods of that kind shown us.

In my opinion the then world premiere photo was altogether one quite good throw. Jennifer Lane sang passionately and elegantly. Peter Castaldi was also very good. The other Interpretern also rendered good or satisfactory services. The much-maligned R.A. Clark and his Manhattan Chamber Orchestra made a passable impression in the baroque subject .

This concept is indeed unfortunate, as the new material does not pack the same power as the old. However, one new one,Days Like These especially stands out; it sounds like it could have come from the Astra sessions. Otherwise, sorry to say, the final Asia tracks with original vocalist John Wetton are well-played and nice but not among the most memorable of their career. I think I can safely say these are actually Asia's weakest. I'd advise anyone looking to buy an Asia best-of to \\"Anthology\\" instead.

I have added them to my Christmas list as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I first read this book in the 3rd grade and still read it (I'm now 33 years old!) I love this book. In 3rd grade it was great because the kids lived by themselves and did all the housekeeping with no adult interference. They are good kids, but not perfect (Benny has temper tantrums) and care for one another. They find their own dishes, cook their own meals, swim...everything that needs doing they do by themselves. And they do it right. I also really like Surprise Island and Caboose Mystery I think it's called. The first 19 books or so I call the 'original' books...after that another writer continues the story and changes the characters somewhat, but the stories are still good. The later books are more 'modern up-to-date' since the others were written at least 30 years ago! Even though they are old they are still great to read - even for adults!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boxcar Children","review":"AmazingIt is an amazing bookI love it.I think that this book is amazing and that it t should be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I love the Boxcar Children","review":"I started reading the Boxcar Children series when I was in the 4th grade.

It was by Gertrude Chandler Warner. I liked the writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Chapter Book Series","review":"Four young orphans run away from a grandfather they have never even met. They make their home in an abandoned boxcar and are able to rely on only themselves. This is a wonderful series of books that is often overlooked these days with the onslaught of many new series. I recommend every child giving this series a try. I always read book one to my students early in the school year. I am glad to be able to introduce this series to more than twenty children in one sitting. I have many of the books in the series on my classroom shelf; these are copies I brought in from home after my youngest son outgrew the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Boxcar book ever","review":"The boxcar Children are one of the best series. The first is my favorite. I love how they survive all alone. They do what they have to to do to survive. My favorite character is Jessie. She takes care of her sibling. She seems like the kind of person that would do almost anything for her brothers and sister. They are so nice and good to each other. I LOVE THE BOXCAR CHILDREN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought me back to my grade school reading adventures!","review":"I had searched and searched for this book locally, because I could still remember how great it was from my grade school days. Anyway, one day I discovered Amazon.com on the Internet, and did a \\"search\\" for the book, and they had it! As I read it I still felt the sense of awe and adventure that I felt in grade school, and I am now 38 years old! This is the type of book that started me on a life-long love of books"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite!","review":"As a 32 year old mother of 2, I can only tell you that this book has remained with me since 3rd grade. I am purchasing a copy for myself. If my children are lucky, I will share my copy with them. This book is a must for all children.... and any adult who is still a kid at heart"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Best Book I've Ever Read","review":"This is a great book! Four orphans afraid of their grandfather settle down in an abandoned boxcar. Their names are: Benny, Violet, Jessie, and Henry. When Violet gets hurt they take her to the doctor and discover how kind their grandfather really is.This book is of a series so if you like this one there are many more. These four chidren solve mysteries with their dog in future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a RIOvolt... get this!","review":"The power adaptor works with all riovolts (4.5 volt DC)The tape is excelent quality also.

(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Little Blue Book That Could","review":"A few years ago I wanted to learn about the Constitution and the Second Amendment. I ordered box-fulls of books from various subjects. I read them all except the little blue book. It seemed so insignificant, certainly law journals were more substantial. After many, many months of study only the little blue book, covered with dust, remained. What the heck, it's only 85 pages or so. It couldn't hurt.What I found was the most concise, and the most expansive treatment on the basis for the Second Amendment that I have ever read. From 500 AD Saxons to William and Mary to Blackstone to Henry to Tucker, to Story to Coxe to Cooley. Dred Scot to Cruikshank to Presser, to Miller and beyond.The quotes are paragraph-length, meaty, and powerful. You will have little doubt as to the meaning of the Second Amendment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A combination travelogue and personal journey","review":"Written by Lon L. Emeric (a fifth-generation descendant of Cornish copper miners), Going Back To Central: On The Road In Search Of The Past In Michigan's Upper Peninsula impressively presents a combination travelogue and personal journey through Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Colorful characters, breathtaking landscapes, and memorable pieces of folklore are all retold in captivating detail. Going Back To Central is especially commended to the attention of anyone with an interest in American History in general, and the Upper Peninsula country of Michigan in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"Xenofex is a collection of plugins for graphics applications such as Paint Shop Pro and Photoshop, it should also work with the free Irfanview.The collection comes with lots of presets and the interface is very easy to use, with a series of sliders in each dialogue box which when moved displays the end effect in a preview window. My favourites of the plugins are Little Fluffy Clouds and Constellation but the Puzzle is nice and so is the Mosaic. I often use Little Fluffy Clouds to replace a poor quality sky in my photographs.The quality of the applied effects is very high and gives an impressive finish to your images.These are great plugins to use and once you have them you will wonder how you managed without them."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Kids only!!","review":"I bought this because I love butterfly and sterling silver jewelry. However it was more like a choker than a necklace. Would recommend for kids only. Would've loved if it had about 3 more inches in length on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honda manual, not that good","review":"I have a 1982 nighthawk, this book described in great detail the 1970s models but had hardly any info on the updated 80s bikes, manual was not very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"ERRORS ARE RAMPANT!!","review":"While the content is pretty good the number of errors in this would result in an \\"F\\" if a high school student had submitted this work. There are parts that are unusable because of the rampant errors that fundamentally change outcomes of problems and understanding of concepts.Anyone that bought this book should either receive full refund or at least a free copy of the update. I would STRONGLY urge instructors not to use this book or students not to buy it until some MAJOR revisions (and proofreads) are made."},{"rating":"2","title":"waffle cones","review":"it makes the best cones ever and the shaper my grand children could do it if it was not hot easy to use and makes awesom waffle cones"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun time!","review":"I love this item. The dough is easy and fast to do (it take about 5 min). Making cones is easy and fun. The Cone Maker is not too big, so it was easy for me to find the place to store it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waffle Cone","review":"How can you go wrong with a Waffle Cone.

Everyone is impressed when I make my sugar cones! The plates need to be brushed with veg oil or they stick otherwise its a great product.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batter sticks","review":"I had trouble with the batter sticking to the baking plates. Had to add oil to the plates before each cone was made...which added extra fat. Other than that, the cones were absolutely delicious. I use mine to make \\"bowls\\" that I fill with non-fat yogurt and fresh fruit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Giant cone","review":"This might be great for some very large ice cream eaters but the cone is gigantic. Three scoops don't even fill it up. I short the batter and roll 1/2 cones and they are great. The recipe is good too but too much work and far too costly. I found Krustez mix on amazon in 5 lb bags and with a little water only it makes a perfect cone every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great appliance, fun for kids and adults","review":"This appliance does a great job once you get the heat setting and timing \\"calibrated\\" for the type waffle cone you like best. It heats quickly, takes less than two minutes per cone to bake and shape and is very easy to clean. It stores upright to save cabinet space as well. Having a rack to allow the cones to maintain their shape while they cool is helpful, but not totally necessary. The recipes make excellent-tasting cones. I don't use it really often, but I am well-pleased with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do I tun the beep off?","review":"It turns on, it turns off. Making waffles is not rocket science. But the beeping? It never shuts up? It beeps over and over... Make it stop. I'm selling mine because I hate the beep so much.

Save your money and use your common sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes we need to be told...","review":"... what should be common sense. I really enjoyed the book. It made me think more consciously about why I make the choices I do. I can't wait to put it into practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!","review":"I promised myself I would not spend another Valentine's Day alone. I got the book and read it from cover to cover. I thoroughly enjoyed it! The best parts are the step-by-step suggestions on where to meet compatible women and how to comfortably approach them. Talking to women in lesbian bars will never intimidate me again! I have recommended it to all of my single friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"paperback pep-talk","review":"this book took me about 15 mins to read, and another 15 mins to re-list for sale as used. this is not a collection of methods and techniques for meeting women with similar interests, as the title implies. it is merely an ink-and-paper 'warm fuzzy', full of up-beat exhortations to just keep your chin up, and don't stop trying, girl! at one point, the author suggests that you approach an attractive woman in a bar, and introduce yourself. duh, had that not occurred to anyone before Sacks? if this had been a step-by-step how-to book for building a garage onto your house, it would have gone something like this: \\"Get a lot of bricks. Stick them together. Now, pull that car in, girl! Don't worry if a few dozen of 'em hit the hood of your new Volvo. You just keep parking in there, girl! Remind yourself that you have a right to park in there, and don't let that garage make you feel bad for doing it!\\" maybe she should have titled it \\"Lesbian Dating for Shut-Ins\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Lesbian book I've ever read.","review":"I think this book is terrific, especially being single, but even if I wasn't. The book was full of suggestions (really great suggestions, not just lip service) on so many aspects of being a Lesbian. It seemed like every word in the book was written especially for me. And that sure doesn't happen offen in this world. I really recommend this book to any Lesbian, single or not... but definately if you are single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt work","review":"Ordered the thermostat and had our electrician install it.

It was easy to install and works exactly as expected!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"I bought this album in 1993 on a whim. I was looking for something new, so I \\"splurged\\".Lucky me.From top to bottom, this album just rocks with straight rock and inventive lyrics. Fitch's guitar screams and then he finds great clean tones. Paw wields its craft very well and, if you're remotely interested in this bad, this disc deserves to be purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented beyond belief!","review":"Wow!Every song on this record is excellent,my personal favourite being the movingly exceptional LOLITA.Their sound is just brilliant,basically,that\`s all there is to say!Please come to England,guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To good to be true","review":"I couldnt belive what I was hearing the first time i put \\"dragline\\" in my cd player, its just amazing music, its so original, the best song is \\"dragline\\" in the middle of the song, theres an acoustic melody that blends violently a few seconds later with crushing guitars! Please buy this album so you can understand what im talking about!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another road rash","review":"This album also contains songs featured on a PSX game \\"Road Rash\\" The best thing about this album is that it is good and catchy through and through."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cd of the nineties","review":"Let me make it clear - Dragline kicks ass. I've never heard anything like it. I've worn out or given away at least ten copies. Songwriter guitarist Grant Fitch pulls out one surprise after another. Mark Hennesey is flat out the best rock and roll singer in the buisness. The pedal steel playing on JESSIE still blows me away after all these years. I love this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Own Album","review":"I've worn out two copies since 1993 ... and I'm working on wearing out my current copy ... \\"Dragline\\" is a classic! The music is hard, melodic and tight, creating a new category of music -- southern-fried macho cerebral crunch-rock!!! Imagine if Page Hamilton from Helmet married country legend George Jones and their kid hung out with Charles Bukowski! That kid would be PAW!!! :) The lyrics (very intelligently) cover everything that matters to the \\"every-man\\" ... women, fishing, dogs, women, drinkin' and women (and there's even a song about hangin' out with yer old man)! I love this CD, man!!! And you will too!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD of all time..........","review":"This is saying alot. I am 33 years old and have been faithfully buying and listening to music since I was 10.I first picked up this CD/tape back in 1993 when it first came out. I can honestly say this CD touched me in a way no music ever has. Yes, it is that good. Powerful... emotional... this CD was something very special that few too many people ever experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond a 5 star Album","review":"In the era when Grunge music was defined by a league of fantastic bands and albums, Dragline was and still is my Favourite album of the Grunge genre. It is timeless and to this day, some 17 years later I still have it in my 60-CD stacker. The precision and heaviness of the Guitar, and the band's tightness and composition sends you reeling back to the days when music was pure and raw. Mark Hennessey's southern voice is rich and purposeful yet with an undertone of a poet as he melodically belts out each Lyric with heart and meaning. I had the pleasure of seeing them in a small and intimate gig in Melbourne, my heart still flutters at the memory of Paw's exquisite delivery and tightness. I'm glad this band never made it to the super-stardom like some of it's contemporaries because this album wasn't air-played to death and I feel like I hold a treasure that only those who are enlightened enough, will posses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I was introduced to Paw's music through the video game Road Rash on Sega Saturn in 1996. They had about 3 tracks on the game but the whole album is great. These guys are really fun to listen to and their songs sound better than most other bands. I really love that drum intro for the song Pansy. Awesome album..real timeless feel good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"My desert island album","review":"This is the album I would have with me on a desert island if I could take only 1 CD. I grabbed this in '93 and was amazed by the raw energy and sound. Here it is 15 years later and it still ranks in my top albums of all time. Review after review talks about the band behind the curtain of grunge. Sadly they were not promoted well and fell into obscurity but that doesn't diminish the talent and effort that they bring. Dragline falls into that \\"perfect\\" album standard for me. Every song kicks me in my emotional cojones and gets my soul moving. Furious rock jams turning on a dime into heartfelt melodic dirges. A band unlike any other. That is for damn sure. This album is a gem and should be listened to and then preached about. It's that good. Tell your friends. They will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Automobile Traffic in Background","review":"I've been converting my LPs and cassettes to mp3, and as I was listening to this tape (headphones on) to adjust the input level before recording, I heard what sounds like automobile traffic in the background. It's not noticeable if played over loudspeakers, but disconcerting nonetheless to think that I paid for this. I can almost see someone setting up their microphones near a bridge beside a babbling brook, with trucks rumbling overhead. I've played this tape many times, and never heard the traffic, but I don't believe I will ever play it again. I'm giving this one star only because I can't give it zero stars.If you really want soothing natural sounds, take a listen to the Environments series by Syntonics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your search is over. This is the Bible you need.","review":"I have read through most of the New Testament Recovery version five or six times.

Every verse is full of nourishment for our living (Matt 4:4). Praise God that He has given the entire New Testament as a bequest to us New Testament believers. God has also given us faithful servants who have interpreted His word to help us relate it and match it to our experiences. Although I've received help from reading a few books and commentaries on some portions of the Bible, the Recovery Version has been the most comprehensive source I've read. It took me one year to read the Recovery Version cover to cover. My appreciation of Christ and of His church has been uplifted so much, not just in teaching but in experience. Just read the notes for the first verse, Matthew 1:1, and you'll see what I am talking about!"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],x={key:0},H={key:1};function B(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(C,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-0291c309"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/4.md","filePath":"guide/4.md"}'),W={name:"guide/4.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
