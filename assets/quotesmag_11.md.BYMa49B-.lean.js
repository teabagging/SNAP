Yes, it does show you exactly what to do but the examples are disjointed. Instead of actually working on a project, you make absolutely minute changes to a pre-existing file. In fact, in one section the authors have you open a blank presentation and save it without having typed a thing!I thought that maybe each chapter or maybe the whole book would be devoted to creating a project and that the CD would have the supporting files. I had not anticipated that each section of the book would have its own file and so you never build on what you had done in the previous section.I had used a book on MS Publisher that did just that - you created a project and the authors provided the supporting text and graphics but you actually made something.Perhaps the book will improve as I am only on chapter 4 but I'm not real hopeful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as specified..shipped on time","review":"As described and arrived on time.

I actually had to purchase a high-walled mixing bowl to go with this mixer. It splatters liquids all over the place with a regular bowl. However, now that I have the high-walled bowl, I find it to be a very good mixer that gets the job done. I love the new design of the beaters (no center post) - its makes it immensely easier to clean and less waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy & Flimsy","review":"It may have a strong motor, but it howls like a military jet on afterburers. What's worse, the beaters are made of flimsy wire. After a few uses, nothing very hard, they were bent and out of balance. Now the off-kilter beaters make a terrible racket as they bang together. We had an old Cuisinart food processor that was pretty reliable, so we bought this mixer based on the brand. We bought one of their coffee grinders as well. Both have been only fair to poor. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY-CUISINART SHOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS","review":"Yes, the mixer is powerful, but I only got about a handful of uses out of it before the beaters quit turning.

It looks nice and the fact that there is no center post on the beaters means that they are easy to clean up. The problem though with this mixer is that it is way too powerful. Even on the lowest setting, I have ingredients flying everywhere which necessitates a lot of extra clean up. As a mom of two young kids, I have enough clean up to do! I tend to do my baking with my five year old son, mostly for somehting fun to do, but I end up feeling frustrated when using this little gadget.

I've gotten spoiled, I guess, by more-recent HD-quality widescreen concerts with 5.1 sound. This is something different. The image is often fuzzy, and the sound at times actually feels *mono*. This concert is from only 5 or 6 years ago; they could have done better. Add in the eclectic song selection (of the video producer, not Prince -- who apparently played much more material than is represented here), the \\"artsy\\" (and completely unnecessary) filler between songs, and the lackluster camera work (which often focuses on someone other than Prince, even when he's playing a killer guitar solo), and you have a video that is better than nothing at all but probably not appealing enough to encourage multiple viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"He hasn't lost a step.","review":"Prince is a master showman and incredible performer, a bandleader in the vein of the great James Brown. He's an excellent musician himself and his stage presence is unrivaled. I can't claim to be familiar with his entire catalogue (who can?) but even material new to me doesn't fail to impress.

So it could be that the DVD sucked simply because the concert sucked. Prince is supposed to inspire me. I should want to dance. Or I should want to jam on the piano. But what did I do when the DVD was done? I went over to the computer and surfed onto the Yahoo financial page.

I use to kiss the album cover every night before bed. I purchased this dvd, expecting more from your concerts, (since I was never able to go to one of the concerts in person), I wanted to see you in one of favorite cities in the United States. I am so glad I didn't go to this concert because I would be very disappointed. I did love all your original songs you performed in this concert, but I didn't like the other songs that was performed. It seems that Prince was sort of disinterested in his performance, and I became disinterested in watching it. I give this dvd a phffft. :P.

The NPG is totally kicking like a superpower kung fu chicken!If you want Prince from the 1984 days of Purple Rain, you better get something else...If you want Prince as he is today, the Reining Funk Master, get this DVD.Half the set is modern jazz and the other half is rocking like nobody's business.If you play guitar there is an extra bonus on with the extra track. This is the first time I have ever heard or seen Prince play guitar like greats Jeff Beck and Carlos Santana."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make a bad dvd of a good concert","review":"AOL music allows you to download the entire concert for free, which is FAR better than this dvd. This is NOT a dvd of the Las Vegas concert; it is a dozen music videos, all of which were created from the concert footage. The director has chopped-and-diced this concert beyond enjoyment. The sound is not in true surround sound, and the MTV-style quick-cuts and wacky angles are so annoying as to make the video unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prince or impersonator","review":"I was very dissapointed.

I kept thinking there was something wrong with my system until I put on James Taylor's \\"Pull Over\\" DVD, which I purchased at the same time. I was relieved to find that it wasn't my system. Pull Over is pristine. Hopefully Prince will put out something worth buying in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Effort","review":"I was psyched to hear Prince put out a live DVD of a concert he did in Vegas. What better place to enjoy a Prince show than the city of sin and excess? Unfortunately, the show and the DVD are extremely lame. I'm not sure what decisions went into the musical selection for this show but it was not the up-tempo experience I had hoped for. Instead it borders on melancholy R&B;/jazz with only flashes of the brilliant funkiness and stage presence that Prince used to be known for. The best track on this DVD is a cover song of Led Zeppelin. I kid you not.Several years ago, Prince would have torn the roof off of Vegas with a line up of showgirls while he ripped into \\"Pussy Control\\". We can only dream now of that kind of show.Coupled with the past few disappointments Prince has put out on CD, it appears the Purple One is migrating into waters that only his mostly fiercely dedicated fans will follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince at the Aladdin","review":"I think this live show is awesome.

(Alaska heliskiing and the South Georgia Island ones are my favorites) The scenes are beautifully shot and really take your breath away. I have to hand it to the Warren Miller team, in that it can't be easy to film these every year and still put out a film that has such an emotional impact for anyone who has been out in the mountains.

The only problem is you need to stack them in the dishwasher so they don't touch other stoneware pieces, as they can chip if banged just right. I chipped one piece very quickly this way and one other as I put it in the cabinet by knocking edges of pieces together (pretty hard) by not lifting the plate quite high enough for the stack. Both chips are on the underside, right under the pattern ring, so they do not show from the top but do from the side.

I'm still trying to recover from how bad it is. Don't get me wrong, I love B movies like, Plan 9 From Outer Space and Manos The Hands of Fate. Both of those films are miles above the stink that is Phantom of the Park. To be fair it does have moments that are so bad that you just have to laugh out loud. My favorite moment in the entire film is the fight between Frankenstein's Monster and Kiss. You have to see it to believe it. Also, the main villian was probably the only real working actor in the entire production.

Its a good way to get the overall concept of the .NET 'thing?' as it applies in ASP. And its well written. You can read it, then do it, and doing it is what its all about.

Authors of these books have NO IDEA how infuriating this is to a novice user who is struggling to learn, yet after decades of flashy, overpriced new computer books, it continues. For example, in the first few chapters, runat=server is used three different ways:runat = 'server'runat = server/runat = 'server'/...with NO explanation of why.

Sure, you can code ASP.NET in notepad, but if you have a tool that does the repitious code for you, why use notepad?

But when I purchased Sams Teach Yourself ASP.NET in 21 Days (2nd Edition), I left, very disappointed. I wanted to learn both VB.Net and C#.Net. The book advised it would explain both, but this is not true at all. While it has sample code in both languages, a lot of the time, it used VB.net.

An early chapter says that sendmail configuration is easy, but says \\"wasn't this...\\" (and displays a cryptic line of C code) \\"... hard to understand until you learned C?\\" Well, Eric and Bryan, I hate to break it to you, lads, but many of us just run mail servers and (horrors) we STILL don't know C. No less than six times in the first eight chapters, the authors say \\"this looks hard, but it'll be easy once you understand it.\\" I *think* that's called a tautology, boys, but it doesn't help me to get to the goal of understanding.

You'll have to look elsewhere too (like sendmail.org). In fairness, configuring sendmail in all its complexity is a mess, so the book had its work cut out. However, it's not that hard to configure a simple sendmail installation, and the book should have made that possible within the first few chapters. As it stands, I'm not sure at what point in the book you should be able to actually send email without having to learn everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference, though with some assumptions","review":"I bought this book because I needed to learn about anti-spam measures using sendmail features the 1st edition didn't cover. While the book wasn't as detailed in those areas as I'd like, it certainly provided me with enough info to accomplish what I needed to do, and has been an excellent reference for basic sendmail questions I've had since.

The emphasis here is more on what Iceland looks and feels like from a motorcycle rider's perspective. Naturally, Helge gives a few hints on how to do this trip yourself. After watching this film, I immediately began putting a 5-year plan together with my wife to go see Iceland. I highly recommend this movie to anyone remotely interested in Iceland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronic LED that controls speed stopped working","review":"I wouldn't by this mixer again.

The authors tell you commen-sense ideas, such as \\"don't have too many graphics\\" and \\"avoid tacky backgrounds\\". On top it, these ideas are hammered over and over again. Reading this book was a chore: I did not learn anythingnew ... The concepts of layout, color themes, navigation, and many others, were largely ignored. The book essentially tries to convince you to stay away from the newer technologies. However, this is a philosophy from the 1990's. Plain, bland pages just dont cut it anymore. If you are even mildly serious about learning good design, choose another book. This book is targeted towards people who have no prior experience at web design. Even for beginners, this is a poor guide that will take you nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, NOT funny, and totally outdated.","review":"I was utterly unimpressed by these two fools.

Also the book still costs a fortune for a 3+ year old internet book...total ripoff.If you want to learn design from a couple of internet geeks then this book suites you well.

Don't make the same mistake I did. It's not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book leads the pack for \\"Web design books that Suck\\"","review":"My overall impression of Web Pages that Suck is poor at best. The writing style of the book is choppy and suffers from taking decent copy from a web site and padding it for the book. Judging by the many side bars and paragraphs explaining American cultural references, the authors seem to be writing for amateur web designers in the international market. The design of the book is just as poor as the many web sites is condemns, glaring colors, bad photography (we could do without the see through Elvis suits - ugg) and poor organization make the book look amateurish.If you think that you can learn good design by looking at bad design then 1+1=3.

Unfortunately, the material does not delve as deep as Nielsen does, and some of the topics may be slightly dated, whereas Nielsen's concepts are more sustaining. Both books have great examples, so which one should you read? Probably both--read this one first, since it will go a lot faster and is more humorous, and then read Nielsen to delve into a greater understanding of the concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book on Thai cooking and culture.","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

It's not just hysterical - it's socially concious."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Behind the Curtain","review":"_Prehistory_ is a rewarding collection of anecdotes and prototypes of Far Side cartoons. Obviously this book is essential for anyone who considers themself to be a fan of the strip. Larsen gives us a peek into how his ideas take shape, and tells some very funny stories about getting started. I especially enjoyed reading how he only took one portfolio to San Francisco with him. It was a great story. The reason I'm not giving it the full five stars is because I thought that there could have been more material divulged by the author. The last third of the book is only cartoons. While they often speak for themselves (hilariously so) I wished that Larson would have stuck around more at the end of the book to elucidate some of his concepts and generally do this thing.

The 'remastering', however, is not.Every single track on this compilation has been reworked to dull down Grace's raw, edgy power. It's as though a roomful of suit-and-tie record executives lifted Grace's vocals and laid them across Lawrence Welk arrangements, the result being that everything that makes Grace Jones blow your mind has been comfortably pasteurized for the coffeetable chitchat set.God forbid Grace should make anyone uncomfortable, or challenge their perceptions in any way.

My husband had bought it for me at a household auction and it was used, of course. It was a great little mixer. While the Cuisinart has some bells and whistles, it does not do the job my old one did. IT won't properly mix brown sugar if it has a few lumps in it, it just doesn't mix cookie doughs, or cake for that matter in an efficient and consistant way. When you use the whip to beat egg whites or whipped cream, no matter how tall a bowl I use, it whips part of it up and over the edge. Also, my old one had the speed \\"uses\\" on the handle. This one, I have to go to the book everytime I want to find out what speed to use for egg yolks, creaming butter, adding dry or wet ingredients, etc. It's just a pain. I do not like the beaters and,obviously, they're the reason it doesn't do a good job of mixing.

It is definately not a pure concept book and will be of interest mainly to us developers who actually need to develop software.

Her approach is always intelligent and warm, yet never cloying or clinical.The author's wit (and impressive familiarity with pop culture!) make the book compulsively readable and even---though I hesitate to apply the term to a book on such a serious subject---highly entertaining.The book is filled with practical advice as well as with moral support for those going through the experience of trying to cope with infertility.

Don't get me wrong, once I let my expectations go, I loved it! This book is not about boarding school. Its not your average love story. This books is filled with mystery. Glenallen is a mystical place, filled with folk lore and legends. Ghost, strange deaths, and irish myths play starring roles, not young girls growing up together and overcoming small tragedies.

In addition to describing the basic theory and mechanics of the algorithms, the book helps develop an intuitive feel for the algorithms and provides examples of how they have been used.That said, the coverage of the theory behind the algorithms is fairly superficial.

Even if you are in the field, you're likely to read certain pages several times to embrace a concept... but once you embrace it, you will have some of the best foundational knowledge there is on the subject.

Normally within 2-3 weeks most people can adapt to it.This one like most straight-head shavers is not the best around the neckline and you may need to learn a few tricks on ur own to get a close shave around that area.It retains its charge for upto 5/6 shaves provided you shave at least once in 2 days and of course depending on the rate of ur beard growth.It doesnt come with any fancy accessories like a stand and brush like Braun does.

If you search for the product id PAUK10U at google you will see that there are at least three models: all black, all gray, gray with black numbers. The one that is gray with black numbers is the one that I received at home (PAUK10C) and is DIFFERENT from the picture product here at amazon (PAUK10U), that shows the gray only (and a all black with calculator which is not in discussion here). It has NO USB input as the others have, I have the one that is gray only and it is better built quality and has 2 useful usb inputs wich I plug my mouse and printer.

With these remixes, its hard to say whether i like the remix or the original better, but i lean toward the remix. A few of the songs even have different melodies, but this is a good thing.

I disagree with his conclusions on ditching God due to many gay men's negative experiences with their fathers. I think he would have been much better served in that area if he utilized Sallie Mac Fague's work on metaphore. Overall, Clark did a decent job in exploring an area that has not been adequately developed namely the application of the gay experience to the theological enterprise.Given the rudimentary groundwork done by Clark, I think the issue needs to be revisited now with a broader perspective given the advent of new AIDS treatments has changed dramatically since Clark wrote.Once again, this was an excellent academic effort in the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for a REAL Java Crypto book","review":"Java Cryptography was the first O'Reilly book I found disapointing.

The book was disapointing, there is no CD containing source code or the required Java Cryptography Extensions, and by the books own omission, some of the examples aren't even available online.I understand that the publishers were limited by US export laws, but without solid examples of things Java developers might want to write (SSL), without the JCE which international readers will be unable to obtain, this book was extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again OReilly did a great job ! ! !","review":"Impressed me???

The extender was supposed to help me see through the view finder but it doesn't fit properly, a design flaw on the part of Canon. The eyepiece has a triangular protrusion on the back which slides in a grove just above the diopter wheel. I assume that this is to keep it from rocking back and forth. Unfortunately the extender does not have this protrusion, nor does it have a matching triangular groove for the eyepiece to slide into. This results in an ill fit for the eyepiece and in order for it to go into the locking grooves, it must be forced. Even then the triangular peice causes the extender to stick out on the left side putting an unnecessary straing on the eyecup. I have contacted Canon and they have never heard of this before but are researching it. I wonder if anyone else has noticed this flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works good with some modification","review":"I was disappointed with not being able to see the screen well, but noticed that it keeps my nose from hitting the screen too much.

Pro if you want to see the whole view faster since you'll see the image on the viewfinder at a reduced size, meaning that you can evaluate the shot faster.

The examples are all in C#, but that doesn't really matter. When I needed C# I could copy the code directly; when I needed VB.NET it was easy to convert. This is a well-written, easy to follow book that covers the most important parts of a complex subject, and has lots of good samples to follow.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"XML Rules","review":"I thought this book was written very understandably and read very smoothly.

Coming in at just under 1000 pages, it isn't to be attempted without a great deal of resolution and lots of spare time. I read this particular edition for a reading challenge and I have to admit that were it not for the accountability of having to report in to my friends, I might not have finished it. That being said, I finished the book with a greater understanding of why it is considered one of the great novels. Tolstoy commits human emotion to the page in a such a compelling way that one can forgive seemingly endless dissertations on mundane subjects such as farming practices, even if it's not quite possible to forget them!This kindle edition retains some non-standard spellings of names that seem to have been abandoned in later translations.

Published by decree of Pope St. Pius V. Prescribed by Pope St. Pius X to be used by all priests in instructing the faithful. Recommended by Pope Leo XIII for all seminarians. Pope Clement XIII said it contains a clear explanation of all that is necessary for salvation and useful for the faithful. Covers the basic knowledge of the Faith by detailed explanations of the Ten Commandments, Sacraments, and each word of the Apostles Creed and the Our Father.

For children who do not know the story of Exodus well, this might be educational, but, for children who attend day school, this is redundant and repetitious. There is nothing challenging about this game.

The books one major flaw was that it didn't come to an ending. It just kind of leaves you hanging about what happens to all but the main two characters and even that is kind of hanging.

In the end I gave up and started using a cortisone cream. Maybe it was just a coincidence, but after switching to the cortisone the red patches went away completely and permanently. Maybe I was not using Barc for its intended purpose, and if that's the case then please disregard my low rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if you are allergic to penicillin","review":"I tried this product and I did not see any results, but I found out very quick that I am allergic to penicillin.

I guess it would be a worthwhile thing to have on your shelf, to compare to legitimate books, or to illustrate that there are many interpretations of Coyote's nature. I wouldn't pay top dollar for it.And this interpretation is as legitimate as any, I suppose- I just didn't like it.

I though the addition was unnecessary.I realize that just because I like it one way it doesn't mean that the composer liked it that way, too. So it is an extra treat to be able to have it both. So you can have Orson Wells introduce the album and still have the solo-less buildup in TellTale Heart as well.

This book is great for those Flash Developers that just like to copy and paste codes instead of really learning the actionscript, so if you are one of those ..., you're in luck.

I had a general knowledge of ActionScript and kenw the tools in Flash like the back of my hand when I started reading it, but I just couldn't make myself go through this book. They just make you do some exercise projects which are not useful at all and it all just confuses you much more because they don't seem to keep in mind that the reader may not be a programming expert.

This book fails to go into the much needed detail to make the examples come to life in your head.

I found it to be poorly organized, filled with typos, and didn't even come close to describing the basics of VBScript. The author assumes the reader has at least an intermediate understanding of VB to start. Another huge omission was code samples. The book was filled with them but didn't come with a c.d. nor did the web page offer the samples for download. My learning style is hands on and without the scripts to actually test, the book was of little use for me. The one good point is that it does have a good reference section for the available functions in VB script.

The texts are unpointed just as the manuscripts themselves are. Bibliographical information is listed for the Biblical texts, but their Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek content are not included in the book. In most cases the Biblical texts align with the Masoretic text. Having the Hebrew and English text in parallel allows people who know a little Hebrew to work with the text.

I have never had a problem with warping, however heating this pan really hot and then rinsing it in the sink could cause warping. To maximize the life of the pan, be sure to NEVER use aerosol oils such as PAM on the pan. The propellant in the can burns at a lower temperature than the oil, and ends up burning in the pores of the pan surface. It will not take long to destroy the non-stick finish. Also, allow the pan to cool COMPLETELY before washing it to prevent any warpage. No gritty cleaners either.

It worked perfectly until I accidentally hit the plug with my foot and powered it down - it wasn't in the process of doing anything at the time, but that was enough for it to stop working, and start the dreadful clickling and clacking of doom. Luckily western digital has a good warranty, and they sent me a replacement drive.The rainy season was opon us here in southern california recently, and we had one 2 minute power outage, and my replacement drive once again went kablooie, clicking and clacking, making me want to beat it with a two by four until it followed orders, but all was in vain, and here on my desk sits a shiny brand new western digital replacment.

Full drive powered down and just decided to come back on with a series of very loud \\"clicks and buzzing\\", after of course I had formatted my source drives with only about 1/4 of all work backed up on DVD's. A valuable lesson, in how not to trust a single back up option. From the similiar reviews, I would steer clear of these, an internal drive of similiar capacity would save you a lot of $$$ (I paid $250 for this flashy monstrosity), and be arguably more reliable.

Many of the video images are unclear and the features to be illustrated are often difficult to discern. But the worst problem is the scripting and narration. The script consists mainly of literally hundreds of glacier-related statistics and measurments (down to 0.001 mm!)and often unclear explanations of far too many technical terms that no one but a professional glaciologist coulc possibly need.

Within the first three chapters, however, my dreams were crushed. This book is pure drivel. There are major plot discrepancies (i.e. first something happened two years ago, then twenty pages later that same event is described as happening ten years ago), minimal character development, and the entire piece is laced with elementary grammatical errors.

Only 3 were slightly addressed in the movie. Granted, the priest was benevolent, but because he was given too much focus, the efforts of the Spanish conquest paled in significance.

A mirage bit with Mary and Joseph is as laughably middle-class as things get. California camp.The streaming version is presented in anamorphic CinemaScope and lush color by DeLuxe.

Ha, you should've seen this guy's face when I deftly explained to him how sound waves can be sculpted, filtered, combined, tweaked..

The last part of the book contains detailed information on various patch settings for a host of instruments.

The characters were not developed, the plot ( if there was one) wandered all over the place, aimlessly, and the ending was to lead to a sequel no one will want to read.This author was not helped by his editors and is not a good writer. The author, and probably the publisher, was playing on the popularity of books about \\"secret societies\\", and middle eastern cultures, and oil, with all the makings of a good story, hidden in a a non exisitent prophecy, to encourage purchase of the book.

Nothing in our culture, media, or general perception of life, tells us anything positive about aging so it's no wonder that everyone is running out to get Botox or sinking into mid-life depression.I read this book to help out a male friend in crisis, and ended up helping myself. As a woman, I have come to view aging as form of death-sentence. I search my face to see if I have any wrinkles and often long to be 22 again. This book gives an accurate and scathing critique of the culture in which we live where aging has become a \\"disease\\" or something to be battled. I learned that fear of aging is a form of self-hatred; after all, what is the alternative to growing older? Dying young! This youth-obssessed society has made a whole segment of our population feel disenfranchised, ignored, and repulsive. It is shameful.

Then I remembered I had Creative Lab speakers with my dvd player for my 5.1 sound and loved them. So I searched on Amazon and these speakers came up. They were not expensive and I purchased them only due to the Creative Labs brand name. Magic. All interference is gone and the speakers work perfectly.

The very idea that the barely audible Janet Jackson could have sung a driving soul song by Holland-Dozier-Holland and then a Fats Waller medley in the same breath is a patently ludicrous claim. Also, as these songs give evidence to, it is nearly impossible for anyone else to sing them. Some have been covered but never really very successfully. They were written for the idiosyncracies of Ross's voice as it shifted over the years. Also, for all the great talent at Motown, check out the other Motown groups' covers of Supremes songs: they aren't very good--whereas the girls drive through the Four Tops' \\"Shake Me, Wake Me\\" or the Isley Brothers' \\"This Old Heart of Mine,\\" transforming them into their very own. That's the undeniable vocal talent of the Supremes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Remastering of #1 Hits","review":"With this compilation of #1 hits by Diana Ross and the Supremes, the stellar chart toppers get perhaps their best reproduction treatment. It is evident from the first note that a true expert, and artist has in his own right, marked these songs with the best sound quality ever. Reworking old analog master tapes to the digital format of today, requires a talent to preserve the warmth and depth of a sound while delivering a crisp, sharp product free from defects of tape hiss and the like. And, when working with songs by the most successful girl group of all time and the undisputed Queen of Motown, the end result is a stunning tribute that will stand the test of time. This CD is a real jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops","review":"Gee, I really have to get into the new think. Let's see. I go to the Louvre and am shocked to find Mona Lisa's smile has now been airbrushed into a frown and to make something new out of the painting someone has added a mustache. If I object, I should \\"get over it.\\" After all, we had the original painting for so long! Is the listening public today that dumb and that gullible that 15 seconds more of a fade and tricked-up remixing rates five-star reviews and 20 bucks put down for a C.D.?

Do we really need ANOTHER \\"new\\" Motown compilation? There are plenty of newly remastered anthologies with clear, clean, remixed versions of their best work. Rehashing the same old stuff is senseless. Want a newer, exciting, remixed sound? Simply TURN UP THE VOLUME of your favorite collection!

These are NOT what the original hit records sounded like!

How many times will the same songs be released? True, they are modified a little but they are still the same songs. Andy/Motown/Etc need to wake up and put out new stuff of The Supremes. I would love to hear songs where Mary, Flo or Cindy may have done leads on the original hits, if such songs exist in the vaults. I personally need more than just a remake of the Classics or a never before seen photo. I have no more room on my shelves for CDs of the \\"same old songs\\".

It would go along perfectly with her upcoming book \\"Upside Down,\\" which also describes exactly where this music is standing right now. I hope there's a head on her shoulders on the cover. A note: People criticizing all these reissues and remixes and remakes aren't bashing Diana Ross or bashing the Supremes. They are bashing a make-a-buck-however-you-can mentality in the record business which pursues reissing proven hits rather than pursuing new music of equal merit and bashing a public whose intelligence evidently never can be underestimated when it comes to serving them a reheated musical meal; they'll hunger for it, gobble it up and foam at the mouth in the process.

Where are the previously unreleased tracks? As a buyer, this is the last time I will be sucker to nice packaging & promotion by the likes of Motown.

I guess Im not a huge fan of the hulk in particular, his die-hard fans will be totally loving this. It was fun to throw stuff and kick puny humans around, but after I ripped a car apart and made it into smashing gloves for the 20th time, it had all lost it's novelty.

I had planned on starting a few chapters the night I bought it, and wound up reading through until the end at 1 AM! Walker's text is riveting and never lets the reader get bored. The countdown of three weeks to August 6, 1945 is perfect in terms of describing the key players and events, and the author makes the people as real as if they were standing next to you. He entices a degree of empathy for the Japanese victims of Hiroshima without being either judgmental or maudlin, and he reveals not only the heroism of the Americans engaged from bomb development to delivery but their very human flaws. The book is perfectly tailored to delivering a maximum impact of a stunning and never surpassed horror of history and what made us the people and world we are today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Human Story","review":"I've read a number of books about World War II.

You think of those in Hiroshima who found their children turned into charcoal. You think of the American children whose fathers came home. Is the life of an American serviceman more important than that of a Japanese child? You're glad you didn't have to make the decision.This is a wonderful, horrible, human story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it...","review":"My daughter loves this video. She does not otherwise watch this show \\"Bear In The Big Blue House\\" and was NOT familiar with any of the characters. That did not matter. I have also seen many of the other videos and books. This video did more to encourage her than any of the other videos. Encouragement was a huge part of the process and the video helped to keep her on track and to keep trying. For instruction, we used the video by Alona Frankel called \\"Once Upon a Potty\\". We HIGHLY recommend using her Once Upon a Potty potty chair. It is so easy and comfortable for the kids to get on and off. We have owned or seen probably all of the potties out there and this one is really NICE and one piece--it is the easiest to use and to clean. We only use it in her room at night, though since we quickly transitioned her during the day to the Baby Bjorn potty seat on the big potty."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE LOVE BEAR IN CA- GREAT DVD FUN EPISODES!","review":"We love bear in our house and especially on the DVD format. It is the only way to go with kids movies. The added features the DVD verion offers makes it worth the few extra dollars. It has sing a longs and 3 story selections which make it great when you are trying to make a squirmy toddler sit still. Quick and easy and totally cute.

A good buy with three great episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reinforcement","review":"Bear and his friends are familiar playmates in our house and this is another fine production. This video does a great job of reinforcing the potty concepts for the newly potty trained.

We're very happy with the DVD, little one is just not quite there yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Silly","review":"The potty episode is silly and great about holding the attention of my children. Concepts such as accidents and needing to stop playing when it is time to \\"go\\", are delivered in a very calming way. The only improvement I would prefer is to make the other episodes on the DVD closer to the same potty theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words like suave, and debonair to confusing for little ones","review":"I bought this video to try to encourage my son to use the potty.

I was very disappointed with this video. \\"Two thumbs down\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE IS THE TOILET?","review":"I watched over 20 minutes of the this video and did not see one single toilet (my daugther even asked me, 'where is the potty?')! There were no bears/children demonstrating how to go potty, no bathroom, and the low voice and language which the bear uses is *not* aimed at toddlers. Please do not buy this video...you will probably be very disappointed. I've heard that the boy/girl potty videos are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weasels frightened my 2 1/2 year old!","review":"Just thought I should let people know that the weasel song frightened my child so much that he refuses to watch the video.I, myself, thought the video was cute. My son seemed to really like it at first and has rarely had any fears. He loves the Bear and the moon at the end (which seems freakier to me than the weasels!). The only other thing that ever frightened him was an episode of Sesame Street with a big bad wolf.When we were watching it for the 4th or 5th time, I noticed a look come over him and he asked me to turn it off. I finally determined the weasel part was frightening him. It gets all dark during this song and they sing about the \\"cult of the potty\\" with a Near Eastern tune.He hasn't watched it since and I have put the box away. He now has very little interest in using the potty (he seemed interested before). I realize this reluctance may have nothing to do with the video scaring him. However, I wish I hadn't bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok but more like the tv show","review":"i just got this dvd for my daughter she is interested in using the potty and knows when she needs to go i used a video for my oldest and it helped but i no longer have the video so i thought this would be good she like bear. how ever its just like the show and doesn't really get to the potty point. its cute but doesn't really get the point across to her its just another dvd to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only took 2 days","review":"We bought this video to get our 2 year old familiar with the idea of going to the potty. She is 2 years and 1 month old. After viewing the video, she wanted to go potty immediately. She is potty training with few accidents after having the video only 2 days!

I highly recommend this video-- just be ready for the sudden switch to making potty stops at stores and restaurants."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough \\"potty\\" time","review":"This video is cute and it talks about different aspects of the issue, which is good, but it's also the problem - too much talking about it, and not enough demonstration. My son just turned 2, and is in the very early stages of training. He needs to see how to do it, not listen to animals TALK about doing it. Perhaps this video would be good for kids who are further into the process and just need encouragement to continue, but I don't recommend it for beginning training when kids need visual reinforcement for what they see Mom and Dad doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tipped the scale","review":"My 2 1/2 year old son had the potty basics down. Pee-pee was pretty easy but he WOULD NOT do #2 in the potty. I ordered the video and he loved it! I saw a definate change in his potty habits within 2 days (watching 2-3 times a day). After 2-3 weeks he was using the potty without my wife or I asking him. Even if it only knocks a month off of the childs learning curve you are going to save money on diapers :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Potty trained in 2 days","review":"I bought the dvd for my 2 1/2 year old grandson who would not even sit on the potty before he watched this.

I was amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Potty way to go...","review":"My son is 3 years old and is sort of getting this whole potty thing. He loves this video. He dances to the songs and watches the whole thing over and over again. I think it will help him link \\"potty\\" to a fun thing someone else (Bear) does and eventually he will go on his own. I feel very good about purchasing this video as a potty aid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendly and Straightforward","review":"Both of my kids (5 and 2) liked this video, which is refreshingly honest and straightforward about using the potty. Bear takes the mystery and fear out of the process, assuring the viewers that \\"every creature has to poop sometimes\\". Bear's friends have various concerns, all of which are dealt with in Bear's open and caring manner, and the result is fun and encouraging for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute!","review":"My son really enjoyed watching this video. It doesn't really go into detail about how to use the potty, however, it made my son interested in potty training!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video but too many commercials leading into it.","review":"My grandson watches this video, which is quite a feat in itself - as he usually doesn't watch anything but \\"Barney!\\" He's only 23 months, so I think it might help him more with his potty training a little later on - - it's already helping a little. The video is excellent in its treatment of the subject. It covers all the aspects - good hygiene, encouraging the child to interrupt his play time when he has to go, what the child should do when he's not at home and has to go, etc. My only negative comment is that there are 10 minutes of commercials for other videos at the beginning of the tape. I think these should be at the end of the tape and then if you want to watch them, you can. When I want 10 minutes of commercials, I'll watch TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video was the final push for my daughter to potty train","review":"My daughter potty trained late at 4 years of age. In retrospect I realize she struggled with knowing how it felt to go potty. I originally taped this show from the Disney channel. She watched it 4 or 5 times in one week and at the end of the week practically potty trained overnight. Great tape for kids struggling with understanding how to go potty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality video","review":"My daughter started potty learning about three months ago. After awhile it all came to a stop. I felt she needed a little more motivation. I selected this video based on great reviews from other parents. Well, my 24-month-old did not get potty trained in one week, but she's willing to give it another try. She'll now sit on the potty 'just like the mouse'. I thought that a 'Potty train' song with shadows was a bit too scary for a young child, but my daughter expressed only slight consern the first time she watched the video. Very nice work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enteraining, but not motivating.","review":"My son loved the video. He can sing all the songs to it! However, it in no way made him want to use the toilet. He thought it was funny that the mouse used the toilet, but made no connection to the fact that he should be using the toilet too. I would recommend the book if you want your kids to learn some fun songs while on the potty, but not for much else"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really motivated!","review":"This really motivated my 3-yr-old son to start sitting on the potty! The first episode is the only one that is specifically about potty training, so we started by only watching that one. After watching it three times in a row, he was willing for the first time to sit on his potty sans diaper. No, it won't teach him all the steps to going potty (although it does mention them), but I can do that. Bear gave him the interest in training--something I can't teach him. One thing I really liked was the part about interrupting fun things to go potty; the fun will be waiting when you get back.The other two episodes have become favorites, too. One is about practicing new skills, and the other is about accomplishments. Both themes are related to potty training, and you can always talk about them with your kid to help him/her get the connection. I should mention that it's cute & clever enough to not drive me crazy having it played repeatedly--always an important consideration!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have expected better...","review":"Yes, the characters are nice, as usual, but the main point of this episode is, \\"it's OK to go when you feel the urge.\\" How about pride in achieving control of one's body and in wearing \\"big kid underwear,\\" not feeling too bad if you have an occasional accident (and learning from accidents), and the other myriad of emotions and achievements involved in potty training? Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass!","review":"My almost 3-year-old twins love movies, but will not watch this boring, somewhat bizarre collection.

After watching the video he took the tape out of the VCR and put it in the trash can.

My daughter looked scared watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the big bear!","review":"Apparently what some tots find big, affable and friendly others find huge, boisterous and scary. My little video-savvy toddler bursts into tears everytime she sees the bear. We've only been able to play a few seconds of this video before we have to turn it off. We've tried it repeatly but she'll have nothing to do with this character. This is a 0 stars purchase for our house but I gave it 2 stars because anything from Jim Henson has merit. My advise is to make sure your little on is a fan of the Bear before you make the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backfired in our case","review":"Our 2 1/2 year son recently took interest in the video *after* being potty trained. Within a few days he started having accidents, which he really didn't have before, even when first learning to use the potty. I finally asked him why he was going in his pants and he said it was because \\"Ojo didn't make it to the bathroom\\".There is a scene in this video where Ojo the Bear doesn't make it to the bathroom in time and has an accident. For some reason, our son thought this gave him permission to have accidents, probably because Bear says accidents are ok. While this is true, our son took this statement to heart and now I have to work with him all over again. The video is fine except for this scene, as it can easily be misinterpreted by little ones. Bear is very reassuring about accidents, but probably too much so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Although we really like Bear, this video is too advanced...","review":"Our 2 yr old loves Bear, and we like the humor and music. However, we did not find this video to be helpful at all in potty training. The concepts addressed (i.e. knowing that it is okay to stop playing to go to the bathroom) are too advanced for a potty training 2yr. old. It seemed geared toward children who are already potty trained (3 & 4 year olds). It is too wordy and detailed, and the songs are not as good as most Bear songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best video for toddlers!!!","review":"The music and lessons are great for kids. Teaching hygiene and urgency is a great start for using the potty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful aid in the potty training war!","review":"Potty training in our household has been iffy.

The characters are spectacular and the songs too. It is perfect for children of any age. This is one I didn't mind watching so much. It teachs every step including wipe, flush, & wash hands. My daughter took her pants off and went to the potty right after watching it. This is truely the best kids video ever. I have the dvd and it has sing-a-longs and other bonus stuff that are great too. I definitely recomend this one all the other videos I tried were a total waste of my time & money. In short you should really get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tool when it's potty training time!","review":"A friend loaned us this video when we first started potty training and I found it very helpful, especially that it teaches that \\"when you gotta go, you gotta go\\" and the game/activity will still be there when you get back. Our daughter enjoyed the video and I found it very helpful to play the video first thing in the morning ... that gave her much of the reminding she needed to be successful and \\"stay dry\\". I appreciated that I didn't have to be the broken record player ... oh, I still had to remind, but it was so much easier to say, \\"remember what Bear said ...\\". I also appreciated that the video covered flushing and washing hands.After we relocated to Sparks, our daughter had a back slide. I had returned the video to our friend and immediately ordered my own copy. Our daughter watched it once and the accidents stopped. (Thankfully). We'll keep the video for when our second daughter hits potty training time. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good","review":"The Bear Potty time, is a good DVD.

So, this was a pertect video for him. He is just not interested in potting and this video has not helped to improve his interest. He will potty sometimes when I put him on the potty, and he is proud when he actually goes. He usually asks to go potty after he gone in his pants and refuses to go on the potty when I know that he needs to go. He has been watching the video for about 3 months now - and I will keep trying.

This video has good songs and characters but it only has two short scenes where a puppet is using the potty. I was expecting a scene where the child can be taken step by step on how to use the potty. this video didn't do it, so I'm still in the search of a video that really enphasizes potty trainning.

I should add my son is still not potty trained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good video undermined by racist stereotyping","review":"Like a lot of the Bear videos, this has great scripting, catchy tunes and good puppeteering. However, the big let down for me was the song introduced by Shadow, who is an annoying representation of a bog-Oirish charachter complete with inane diddly-eiddly fiddle music. The song is quite disgraceful really - cut-out figures supposed to be blacks in 1970s disco attire, complete with frizzy Afro hairstyles, thick lips and wide noses. At best you might say it's racist stereotyping, at worst downright insulting to African-Americans who might buy this video. Come on, Muppet People, you can do better than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose the stick dancers","review":"I was hoping this would be a decent video about potty training. It jumps around too much from character to character and from process to process. Addresses washing hands before it addresses using the potty which it called a toilet and let's face it few kids / parents call it a toilet so that is another thing that irritated me. I have always hated that shadow chick, and she is really annoying in this series. And the \\"potty time\\" song with silloute stick figures is just plain stupid. There was only one redeeming scene in the actual bathroom with the little brown bear, but the rest of this was total [...]. It is going in the next yard sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"This move is dumb","review":"Who wants to watch a buncha bearss and those creepy shadow people use the bathroom. I think it's rude!

They are easier from a neurological standpoint.Love the characters, set, music, songs & animation. Bear is terrific and should be a TV show. I agree that this is not a hard-core potty training video. However, my daughter loves it and wants to sit on the potty after watching it - so thats good enough for me.This video has 3 chapters and only one is about the potty. The other 2 are completely unrelated. I agree with one of the other reviewers that the \\"Shadow\\" segment is weird and patronizingly \\"Bronx-like\\". The shadow puppets are a nice idea but, should tie in with the theme of the show and be relevant. I wish the entire thing was about potty training.

At first glance, this appears to be a digitally-tuned radio. And I think it might really be. The radio frequency number appears on the LED read-out as you tune. The huge problem is that there are no pre-sets. Each time you want to change stations, you must turn an incredibly sensitive thumb wheel. You must tune up and down each frequency very carefully. If you want an AM station at 1070, you must be very precise or you will land on 1060 or 1080. The same goes for FM. This radio is only for those who listen to only one station most of the time.

There are a few inconsistencies in the text, but overall a lot of useful info is given about the covered pens.It is not a reference book, because of the choices and number of pens covered.

Of himself. Once upon a time, he was the grandiose, jocular interpreter of Eddie's riffs, but he became the Elvis of the 80s and 90s - a whining court jester taking pot shots at Van Halen every chance he got without ever producing an iota of originality to back himself up. Now - spiraling into deeper self-parody - he covers the Doors, Hendrix, the Beatles and even Savoy Brown and Steve Miller. Plus, get this, a lounge version of Van Halen's own 'Ice Cream Man'.

Roth proves once again that he is fully capable of staying true to his roots as well as holding the title of 'Clown Prince Of Rock 'N Roll' intact. 'Diamond Dave' will most likely lure certain drivers to go over the posted speed limit while the disc is playing on the car stereo. Best tracks are \\"You Got The Blues, Not Me...\\", \\"Made Up My Mind\\", the boogie number \\"She's Looking Good\\" and most of the covers, like the Doors \\"Soul Kitchen\\", Savoy Brown's \\"Made Up My Mind\\", Steve Miller's \\"Shoo-Bop\\" (good guitar work) and the Beatles \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (possibly the CD's best cut). His Jimi Hendrix cover of \\"If Six Was Nine\\" is so-so. Second to last, what do you know? \\"Ice Cream Man\\", a Van Halen remake. Just an all around fun disc to listen to.

The entire story of Russia and the Revolution was captured in two sentences about half-way through. Individual episodes start by jumping back in time to long before the previous episode ended....so you keep covering the same ground.

One can argue that in some cases, the mono mix sounds more like the original hit song as heard in the mid-1960s, but to me, several of the Roger Miller hits are better in stereo (particularly \\"England Swings\\" and \\"Little Green Apples\\").Also, Miller only had 12 Top 40 American hits, but this collection omits two -- \\"Walkin' in the Sunshine\\" and \\"Little Green Apples\\" -- and replaces them with relatively-minor songs like \\"Atta Boy Girl\\" and \\"In the Summertime.\\"You gotta wonder who is handling Mercury's reissue department these days. Instead of this collection, my advice is that you find the previous Mercury collections \\"The Best of Roger Miller - Vol. 1: Country Tunesmith\\" and \\"The Best of Roger Miller - Vol. 2: King of the Road,\\" which are far superior.

They are not very good copies, lacking the graceful curves, smooth tines, and body of the original design. That said, I placed the copies I just received next to the original ones I have and showed them to another person, asking her if she could see any difference, and she couldn't. After I pointed out the differences to her, she did see them, but she didn't think it was such a big deal. Now I am undecided about sending them back, wondering if I'll just be creating an unnecessary hassle for myself by trying to find a better match. I don't recommend these copies of the Dansk Variation V forks to people who are very discerning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-stick cookware","review":"I thought this was a great price for the set.

Heats up easily, cooks food evenly, and cleans up well. The sizing and variety of the pots and pans have worked out great for me, and they've been the best set I've ever owned. I love that they are dishwasher safe - clean up couldn't be better.The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because a few of the pans arrived with chips on the inside finish along the top edge of the pan. Hopefully this doesn't affect the useful life of the set, but I was disappointed. I'm not sure if it was a packaging issue, and since they were on the pans I would use the least, I decided not to send back the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookware doesnt get much better!","review":"I have enjoyed cooking at home with gourmet equipment for many years.

Do not look any further, just but this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great pans","review":"I got these pans for Christmas and I love them. I chose these because they were dishwasher safe, but they clean up so easy I have yet to put them in the dishwasher. My only complaints are that they are quite heavy (they may by difficult for an elderly person to handle) and I feel the handles get a little too warm to be handled comfortably.

God forbid those fans ever listen to any other genre of rock.I bought the CD for the recording of \\"There's Good Rockin\\" which has a driving rhythm, Jeff Beck on lead guitar and a fantastic horn section. There's an added bonus track of \\"There's Good Rockin\\" live.The other tunes are pleasant enough to listen too.

However, I always thought she should explore and perform more in the jazz blues arena. She has a gorgeous voice and style. This album displays what she can do with her voice. This is not a country album, if that is what you are looking for. She is an accomplished songbird and this album proves her talents. I know Rod Stewart and Cyndi Lauper have recently recorded new albums of old classic standards. I only have one thing to say, move over you two and pave the road for a great Crystal Gayle return. I only hope that Crystal will do a follow up to this album with a volume two in the next year or so. This album was worth the wait. However, I hope Crystal releases new albums more frequently in the years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful arrangements, but Gayle's voice is strained","review":"Crystal Gayle has been my favorite singer since I was 16. As much as I would love to give a great review of this work, I cannot. In the last decade, it has saddened me to hear Gayle's voice deteriorating so much. I am embarrased for her that she would release tracks where there is obvious straining for notes. I understand that there is a need to please the fan base, but even these vocally unchallenging tracks are compromised.

Author Sonny Barger, whose book \\"Hells Angel\\" is now a classic outlaw biker tome, shares his experiences and insights on how to navigate the road of life from Barger's particularly unique perspective.A good read and reference - well considered and presented in a volume size you can tuck in either a saddle or tank bag while runnin' down the highway.\\"Out in Bad Standing\\" ex-Mongol Ruben Cavazos should have read Barger's sage advice, specifically Chapter 11 \\"Leaders Accept Dissent, the Tyrant Goes It Alone\\", before writing his own book ... a literary backfire that resulted in the former Mongol international president being sent packing by his former club not so long ago now.\\"Credos\\" is Barger's best work other than the first book on his life - the two go hand in hand like a one-two punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never judge a book or it's author by the cover...","review":"This book was a surprising and enjoyable read.

This book is for anyone who takes major issue with big government suffocating honest Americans and the right of the individual to protect their rights themselves instead of relying on the government and big brother to do it for them. Not only that but this book is a tremendous improvement over Hell's Angels, Barger's freshmen effort, which speaks volumes about the man's ability to improve and, in my opinion, silences the critics who claimed he was simply writing to make some cash from his name and notoriety. In this book, he proves he is indeed a REAL AUTHOR. Also recommend Let's Ride, a guide to riding he wrote shortly after this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not worth it","review":"No doubt Sonny Barger is an American icon, but what he has to say isn't worth much, despite the eloquence of his co-writers.

I didn't necessarily like the anti-cop theme throughout the book, but I suppose that's to be expected from a \\"1%\\"? Some good ideas, and not so good ideas were written about.

A diversified performance, and so clear in some of the virtuosi passages--a real joy to listen. Piano reduction is so difficult when clarity is concerned. It often may sound jammed so easily.

This music has held up. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Devlopment","review":"Having seen the West End version (No 3 I think) I was intrigued to hear this reworking. Like so many theatrical works it can take some time for the production team(s) to find the right combination and I think Martin Guerre is possibly one of those. The original story was going to be difficult to transfer to the stage from day one. The scale, the complex plot and the credibilty were always going to be a challenge. This version could be one of those productions that relies on the visuals to make it enjoyable as the patchy score does nothing to assist the listener. I certainly missed some of the stunning music and orchestrations from the original (Working on The Land, Bethlehem & Here Come The Morning). I will continue listening - to the original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the original!","review":"Ugh! I'm realy disappointed. I had the original, but my copy got ruined (probably through overuse). So when this came out I leapt to get it. Much to my dismay I found my favourite songs had been cut out, and the ones left had been changed beyond all recogniton. So I am now hunting the original which is impossible to find.All I can say about this, is don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad.","review":"The music was well done, but after hearing the American cast at the Kennedy Center with Erin Dilly, Hugh Panaro and Stephen R. Buntrock, I am not sure I can listen to the CD again with as much enjoyment. If you're simply a fan of the musical itself, then go for it. In the grand scheme, it isn't bad. Otherwise, wait to see if another version with the American cast emerges."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful remastering!","review":"This new \\"Martin Guerre\\" is far superior to the mediocre London Production release. Although the 1999 version is hurt by the lack of a full orchestra, the composers Boubil and Schonberg have rewritten every song...tossed out some of the bad ones; such as the dragging \\"Sleeping on Our Own\\", and added such brilliant romantic numbers such as \\"Live With Somebody You Love.\\" The vocalist Joanna Riding (Betrande) has lungs of steel as she carries her masterfully numbers. If you were a fan of the original Martin Guerre, you will find the songs you enjoyed to be redone in a much superior manner. I would strongly recommend \\"Martin Guerre\\" to any fan of \\"Les Miz,\\" or \\"Miss Saigon\\", as well as the fan of any love story. Boubil and Schonberg, showing they still have what it takes, created a third hit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Martin Guerre - 2nd version","review":"I finally opened my copy and kept scanning through all the music to come up with the songs I knew from the first recording. Sadly, I couldn't even find the beginning theme song or some of the others that I really loved. Maybe they think they made a better product, but it seems like a different musical to me. I was hoping to return my copy to Amazon.com for the earlier version, but in another review, I discovered that it is out of print. I'll try to tape or burn a copy from the library CD I had before. Think about what you want before you purchase this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Step Down from the Original","review":"I have to say I'm fairly disappointed with this revamped version of the show. I can see why the changes were made, which I believe were to flesh out more of the story and make things a little clearer than the original. The only other improvement I can think of off the top of my head is the lyrics, which are sharper and less cheesy than the 1996 counterpart. Unfortunately, by improving the story, they've sacrificed the music and overall emotional quality of the show, and knowing these writers from their previous work, I guess I've been spoiled expecting high quality music and storytelling. Unless you're a diehard theater and Boublil/Schonberg fan, I'd definitely go with the 1996 version. The tunes are nicer, better sung, and the orchestrations are astronomically better! I'm a little hesitant now to see the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing from the creators of Les Mis and Miss Saigon","review":"I had purchased the Original London Cast Album of \\"Martin Guerre\\" about five years ago. I remember being struck by the beautiful opening melody of the cd. I knew that this show had been inundated with change from its opening and that changes had been made to the tour. But what a disappointment! Musically, this cd is just a shadow of what the original was like. It was a bummer. Also, this is from the team that brought us Les Miserables and Miss Saigon. These are two shows with plenty of great songs and melodies...Martin Guerre had a lot of potential, but somewhere it got bogged down...and that's too bad. I would reccommend this cd if you are a die hard Boublil & Schonberg fan and you have a need to own both recordings of this show. My opinion would be to search out the original recording (I don't even know if it's available anymore)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"It's a shame, I really love the work of Boublil & Schonberg and think that Les Mis is one of the best musicals ever but the 1999 version of Martin Guerre is in a word, awful. I have the 1996 recording and love that and was interested in hearing how they had \\"improved\\" the show. What they did was turn what was a great show into one that ranks up there with Carrie-the musical. If you can find a copy of the 1996 cast recording either on-line or at a store that specializes in out of print recording I urge you to by that one. Don't waste your time or money on this God awful version. There is just no passion in the music, the lyrics are trite and the vocals half hearted at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this version!","review":"In my opinion the 1999 version of Martin Guerre pales in comparison to the original 1996 version. They've taken out the orchestra and replaced it with synthesizers and pianos, and scraped most of the amazing themes from the original. Granted, theaters like the Guthrie in Minneapolis (where this version is making its North American premiere) cannot house an orchestra, but still the new version sounds so hollow without a full orchestra backing it up. The lyrics are not as poetic as the original nor do they have the same emotional intensity. Even the plot has been rewritten to prattle on about Satan and witches, while the original was much more poignant and relevant in a simple clash between Protestants and Catholics. I am extremely disappointed in this re-vamped version and I am glad I didn't wasted 50 bucks for tickets to see it while its here in Minnesota."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any theatre fan!","review":"I bought this CD after seeing David Campbell and Maria Friedman in Hey! Mr. Producer. It only took a little while before I fell in love with not only the beautiful music but the love story as well. I love this CD but I have to say that the US cast is a million times better than the cast on this CD. In LA, I saw Stephen Buntrock, Erin Dilly, and Hugh Panaro and they were fantastic! I am hoping that a recording will be made with the US cast in the near future. Although the US cast is better in my book, I still say buy this CD so that you can fall in love with Martin Guerre as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Inferior Show and a Step Down for the CD","review":"I own both cast recording CDs and have seen the show and I have to say that I prefer the original CD to the current production that has reduced the scope of the music and made it very brassy and sparse.The musical left me mostly uninspired (as it did most of the audience that remained firmly planted in their seats.) The material just doesn't give you much to care about.After seeing the show I went back to my original recording and play that one occasionaly. If you're a true fan and you can find it, get it -- otherwise I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"These two writers maxed out their talent with Les Miz. These tunes are cheap imitations. \\"Live with someone you love.\\" Uh, ok, I hadn't thought of that. Having seen the premiere of this musical in Minneapolis, it was remarkably unengaging. There are some agreeable numbers, but overall it pales...I put it in the same league as Jekyll and Hyde and other goofy, commercial shows"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than before","review":"The 1999 version of Martin Guerre will win your heart again as it did three years ago. With a completely different libretto and added musical themes, the new version exceeds the expectations of the original. While the 1996 version depended on the actual stage production as its endearing quality, Boublil and Schoenberg have again used the music and lyrics to magnify their audience. The friendship between Arnaud du Thil and Martin Guerre is strongly enforced with new music, while subtractions from the original like the comic \\"Sleeping on Our Own\\" do not phase the mood of the story. Anyone familiar with the history of the musical will be overly satisfied with the latest and, hopefully, final version."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not look like picture","review":"I ordered this item and only one came in the box and it was broke. poor quality product and very poor packaging.

The contoured sides and tilted back design do make this very comfortable.One very important note here: If you are between sizes, lets say you have a 36\\" waist and thought that you would get a large, DON'T! Order a medium.The reason in that the design of the belt limits how tight it can be cinched, as I found out after ordering a large, and having had to return it for a medium. With a large, I was unable to tighten the belt sufficiently.I had no problems with the MEDIUM belt, it was perfect.

It was a shocker from the very first page and I got so wrapped up in the story and its characters that I finished the entire book in two days. The author, who was a vet in the war, shows how the Iraqis and US soldiers really interact on a daily basis, with all the mistakes, misunderstandings, and humor that occurs when two such completely different cultures run into each other. The central story of how an army officer finds meaning in a no-win assignment by trying to help a sick Iraqi boy is compassionate and well presented. The last chapter choked me up. This book really opened my eyes and I highly recommend it to anyone who wonders \\"what the heck is really going on over there...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The first antiwar novel of the Iraq War - an amazing tale","review":"You HAVE to read this book if you have interest in what our soldiers are experiencing in Iraq or what life is like for civilian Iraqis caught up in the war. The story follows the efforts of an eight man National Guard team trying to bring democracy to a bunch of Iraqi officials who aren't buying. It is funny, angry, and sad all at the same time. The author was apparently in Iraq and his knowledge of that culture and the frustrations of army life shine through. Should be required reading at the Pentagon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"Having never read any of Miss Manners' columns, I didn't really know what to expect. After reading the first section, I was so in love with her writing style that I couldn't put the book down! I love her witty, candid answers to many common questions about life and social situations. I feel much more informed and have made this my go-to book for quick reading. Although I don't agree 100% with everything she says, a lot of her opinions make a lot of sense and I love how she can keep your interest with her writing style.Overall, the book is in a format as follows:Introductory section to topicQ&A; about said topicSometimes there is a conclusive section as well.I started reading from cover-to-cover, but then decided it would be just as easy to hop around to what is interesting at the moment. She covers everything from weddings to baby showers to funerals and everything in between.

Some of her advice is sound, but some of it is not up to date and seems aimed at the 1950s housewife, which she probably was at one time herself. The worst part of this book (and her columns) is that she herself comes off as not all that well-mannered. She often suggests snippy, snide retorts to people, and she lapses into what sounds like nouveau-riche snobbery vs. well-bred, well-mannered behavior and attitudes. Don't buy this.

Here are my test results.Incoming water - 48 degreesGallons per minute - .75 GPMHeated Water Temp - 118 degreesI did hit 125 degrees or 77 degrees once but not for .75 gallons per minute.For my test, I set the AE-9.5 on a table about 30 inches off the floor. I wired the unit to 240 volts. Actual voltage, 242. The heated water was directed into a two gallon pail using a two foot section of hose. The distance from the unit to the pail was minimized so as not to affect the results. I used a sealed thermometer to measure the water temp.

I didn't thrash it so I'm not sick of it, strange title & cover I suppose didn't help. Good nostalgia for myself. It's funny how Pete Wylie sounds more mature on this first album, and later gets poppy & younger sounding eg. \\"sinful\\" similar to what The Cure, Avril Lavigne and Gomez did (I suppose it usually works because the sales seem to improve)but in Wah's case I think I prefer the darker, \\"older sounding\\" less poppy style."},{"rating":"2","title":"If u love RENT, this CD is not the way to go . . . .","review":"I could literally sing all 42 songs from RENT from memory at any time of the day, and I have to say that this highlights CD, while about $25 less than the full version, does not do the musical justice.

I've seen the show several times and have made a vow to myself that I will not die until I have played Maureen. This CD is incredibly disappointing. It fails to include some of the best songs from the show, such as \\"Halloween,\\" \\"Happy New Year\\" and most notably \\"Your Eyes.\\" Hmm...they left off \\"Your Eyes.\\" That's a gross oversight, seeing as how the whole play is ABOUT that song. . .Also, some cult favorites, the Voice Mails do not appear on this album. It's really a terrible shame because the CD is only 66 minutes long, and some CDs can hold up to 80 minutes of music.

Perhaps the performers are as bored of this musical as I have become- and I feel that really transmits through the recording. Let me just say that RENT is a show to be seen not heard on a recording.Having said all that, it is worth the investment, and does have most, if not all of my favourite songs. RENT perhaps has become a little overdone to me but I guess many of you out there may still appreciate this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass if you own the 2-CD set","review":"Disappointed.That's what I was when I listened to this disc.

To newcomers, I recommend \\"La Vie Boheme\\", which sums up today's generation; \\"Seasons of Love\\", a more and more well-known tear-jerking song (my undying favorite); and, well, everything!

I can't find anything about the content that is not appropriate, but the organization could be a bit better. If one were using this book as it was intended by the author, the young person would have a lesson each day; however, many lessons are seasonally-appropriate and their random placement in the book seems a bit odd.

My daughters are in their teens and their step mother is always getting on them about how rude they are and how they must have learned this offensiveness from their mother (me!) (Her issues with me have to do with interactions that shouldn't be discussed with the kids.) My daughters have laughed together over things they have read in this book that their step mom just ignores, but they are too polite to say anything to her. . .

I started reading it, and was amazed at how much *I* didn't know about proper manners!In my opinion, there is a lot of detail in this book that is not strictly necessary for day-to-day living. For instance, there is a detailed description of which hand to use for each utensil, and how to cut meat and then transfer it to the mouth. Perhaps my standards for etiquette are low, but I'm happy if my kids simply use their utensils instead of their hands!All of that said, this book is an outstanding resource for unusual or unexpected social situations, such as funerals, bar/bat mitzvahs, and the proper way to behave at these occasions. It's definitely a great resource book to have on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I'm using this book as part of homeschooling my preschoolers. It is great to get ideas from, and the children love learning and practicing new manners. This book not only serves for the good of my children, but also in reminding me of certain things as well.

If you have a CD or DVD burner, it is supposed to be possible to transfer video from the camcorder to a CD or DVD. Unfortunately, when I tried to do this, Sony's software kept prompting me to insert a CD into my burner even though there was already one in there. I could not get around this problem, and never was able to transfer video from the camera. Also, if you want to transfer video from the camcorder to your hard drive, think again. Sony's software package will strip your audio, add its own soundtrack, and shuffle your video images around for artistic effect. I could not believe that there was no way to transfer video, as is, to the hard drive. I have returned the camera, very frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've had mine for 9 months now...","review":"This is a great camera for filming!

It takes good enough videos with the memory stick, great sound!Not so great pictures at night, but wonderful images during the day.I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I just bought this camera, at first I was a little scheptical, cause I read on some reviews that it was kind of dificult to transfer the movie to your pc and then to record it on a DVD.I bought it anyway, the camera is small, easy to use and has very nice features. Some people also said the image was washed out, I've had two minidv camcorders prior to this one, a sony and a canon, and I can tell the image, colors and brightness are the same quality as the others I've had.Transfering video and audio to my pc was very easy, I used a firewire cable and a popular program to capture it and then to burn it on a DVD, very simple. Photos taken with this camera are not bad at all, (of course you cannot compare with photos taken with a megapixel digital still camera).I gave it four stars just because I haven't used all the features on the camera, but I can surely recommend this camera for anyone who wants an easy to use and very high quality video camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen broke after 7 months","review":"Despite gentle use, the screen has broken after only 7 months.

The SonyDCRHC40 that I purchased from Best Buy had too much motor noise for my liking. Of course, the motor noise occurs when a tape is in the camcorder and is recording or playing. It was my luck that the camcorders at Best Buy were locked where the tape goes in for security reasons and when I turned on each of the Sony camcorders without a tape in them, there was no noise. So I bought the SonyDCRHC40. When I began taping a dance recital the noise was terrible. I was charged a restocking fee to return that camcorder and then told that ALL camcorders make the motor noise. Well, I am now trying a tape in each camcorder I look at and there are camcorders that do not make the noise that came out of the Sony. So, buyers beware. Try the camcorder with a tape in it before you make the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FOR SONY LAPTOPS & NO SUPPORT","review":"I own four Sony laptops of different models and I had planned on buying several of the ReTrak charging units for business computers.

I also have an HP laptop and the tip for the HP works OK. So, if you own a Sony laptop, DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT, IT WILL NOT WORK.

Immediately following these words was a G-d**n. I really hate to spell it out, but I am a Christian and this type of language really offends me. Other than the language this game looked very promising. The graphics were really nice, and the voice acting was good (just not what was coming out of their mouths!).

It's a big book with thick binding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Songs","review":"I was very dissapointed when I received this book. Not only was the collection mostly obscure songs I've never heard of (which is the case with most of these children's song books), some of the songs that I was looking forward to learning only had the first verse of the song.I cannot recommend this book.

This book, as well as his others are filled with pieces from this and that, speculation and cliche' and has little to nothing to do with the truth. (The Lakota people do not, nor ever have had \\"Shamans\\") This type of book not only serves to perpetuate the disintigration of our sacred ways, but it also dishes out lies, misconceptions, and other non-truths. I highly suggest that this, and books like it, not be supported so that those who are truly searching, won't have to be loaded down with junk, before they find the true treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Mr. Meadows is known for his \\"Shamanic\\" genre writing, though this is the first book of his I have read. I wanted to explore some of the history of earth based spirituality, and with that expectation found this book very disappointing. Mr. Meadows paints incredibly huge strokes, covering thousands of years of spiritual life, shoe horning it into the Medicine Wheel, and doing so in the space of 90 pages. He makes statements that begin like Aristotlian proof theorems, and spin into grandiose New Age spiritual idealisms. His descriptions of what \\"Amerindians\\" (now I am really getting ill) believed or didn't believe no doubt has Native Americans everywhere rolling on the floor or in their graves. Meadows tries to do way too much and is ill equiped to handle his subject matter, both academically and poetically."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Makers?","review":"Well, to be honest there are not many Christian artists that will make history. Heck, most of this generation has no idea who these artists are. To our discredit, the christian community is not that dedicated to its past. So I don't think in 20 more years there will even be any evidence that any of these artists even lived much less made music. That being said, this is a good little collection of music that I'm glad I stumbled upon. This series is out of print so you can pick up some used copies here in there. I think the reason it's out of print is they didn't sell as many as they thought they would and most likely didn't even break even. But the other side of the coin is, God knows who they are and he and I love this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Griddle","review":"This is my first griddle and I'm loving it! I've struggled using my large skillet to make pancakes, quesidillas, etc. Using this flat pan is so much easier!

The tarp itself is thin, good for one season at best. Buy the 10 mil. Worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth half the price","review":"I used this to cover my Ranger this winter. All it had to do is shed water, not deteriorate for one year, grommets needed to hold, and protect the boat from sun rays. I think it might have kept most of the sun rays off of the surface. Really a weak product. I really cannot think of a practical use for this light duty (whatever it is). Bought Aug 2011, threw it away March 2012, and it did not keep the water out of the boat right from the start, the grommets tore out with very little pressure, the fabric ripped and wore in less than 2 months.

There is something painful about the 'siamese cat' line. Probably I just don't get it. \\"Your Big Night\\" is Steely Dan adeptly finessed into the 90s. \\"Star Behind\\" may have been inspired by The Moody Blues or the Hale-Bopp cult troop, I dunno, but I like the pulsating yet dreamy arrangement.

It is a Satin Doombox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken Andrews' Masterpiece","review":"I hadn't really heard of Blinker The Star at all until I became a huge fan of Failure, Ken Andrews former band.

Sometimes McIntyre digresses into too much history for my taste, but his essays are powerful nevertheless, more so because of his unique and accurate observations. You have to love a man who writes like this: \\"You will stare at him [a band tail pigeon] for a moment before slipping him into your game bag, and for just a moment nothing else in life will be of much consequence. There will be a brief intermission from the din of memories of lost love, fears of where the money is going to come from next, and questions of whether you are at all who you think you are that usually fill your head to distraction.\\" If you too treasure such moments, slip this book into your game bag and let McIntyre take you hunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sublime experience","review":"What can you say?

While searching for copies of his CDs to introduce a new generation to Bill's music, I came across this CD for grownups. While I prefer his children's music (maybe because Bill himself seems in some ways like he never grew up), his stories are cute and funny and contain elements everyone can relate to. The songs are pleasant and Bill has a warm folksinger's voice. This would be a nice CD for a road trip. I enjoyed the chance to get a little more insight into the life and times of a troubadour who created so many happy moments for us when our children were young."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for gamers","review":"This was such a great buy.

The price is nice and the grips do not interfere with the ports that you need to both hear the speakers or plug in items. ANd if you need to open it and take the game out of the casing, it is quick and easy. I use the neck cord condensed for a wrist cord so that I don't drop the game during street fighter battles.

I have enjoyed several of Van Damme's movies such as Hard Target and Timecop but this movie is terrible. I watched it again last night after several years and my first impressions haven't changed from 1995 when I saw it at the theater. The violence is excessive and brutal. The movie trys to be over the top like the Die Hard movies but the violence is more akin to Sam Pekinpah. The body count is excessive and in my opinion sadistic. Strange as it may sound I found the movie very uncomfortable as well as silly. The silliness I can handle but not the uneasy feeling. A very mean and vicious movie. In my opinion this was the beginning of Van Damme's slide. I am also very dissapointed in Peter Hyam.

Die Hard And Under Siege this film can often be compared with. Van damme plays a fireman(original instead of a burned out cop or goverment agent)who takes his kids to the Stanley Cup Playoffs where Terroirsts Have taken control of the arena and hold the u.s president captive. The villian is so lame in this film he makes Elmer Fudd look more terifying. The tagline to this film was \`Terror Goes Into Overtime\` more like Boredom goes into Overtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable movie with unmemorable title, of course!","review":"This movie was a total waste of time! The dialogue was weak, the characters were unbelievably false, and, yes, I know, you are supposed to suspend your belief in these type of movies. But how far must you go? There is one real unbelievable scene where this idiot kid of Van Damme's has no common sense and waits at the stadium when everyone else has left, with a BOMB of course, and doesnt leave because he's SCARED! Also, the script must have been thought up on someone's lap on a plane trip, with \\"realistic\\" phrases from announcers like \\"Scratch my back with a hacksaw!\\" This movie is definitely a crowd pleaser for anyone that has an I.Q. a bit above 25."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sudden Death Looks Good Right Now","review":"This was definitely not the best movie I've ever seen.

Powers Booth is a great bad guy that you love to hate. Jean Claude did a great job on this movie. I especially liked the scene where he speaks in french to one of the hockey players in the locker room. I also liked his stepping in and playing hockey.

However, I have to say that I am from Pittsburgh and a huge Penguins fan, so that probably affected my perception of the film.

While I would rate 'Stealing Shadows' and 'Out of the Shadows' 4 and 5 stars respectively (the last book really was wonderful), I was bitterly disappointed in 'Hiding in the Shadows.' The concept underlying this story was disconcerting and extremely frustrating. Unfortunately, this is all that can be said without revealing the plot twist. My advice to readers of this trilogy is skip this book. The books can be read as stand-alone reads so do that, and leave 'Hidden in the Shadows' hiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this book is so popular","review":"I can not believe that so many of these reviews are positive. I had to read this book for my book club, or I would have stopped reading in the first 50 pages. The fact that it was an easy read and could be finished in a couple of days was its only redeeming quality.The characters were the same characters you'll find in any other airport novel. I think that the author was really reaching throughout the entire book to give them more dynamic personalities, but in my opinion fell short.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, and I have a whole bookclub of people who would agree. Instead of discussing this book, we spent the whole meeting trying to come up with future books and kidding the woman who chose this one everytime she suggested another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written but...","review":"This book was very well written with a strong mystery.

She doesn't even remember her friend, journalist Dinah Leighton, who visited her every day at the hospital and who has now disappeared. As bits and pieces of Faith's memory gradually return, never mind that they seem to be someone else's memories, it appears that she was helping Dinah with an investigative piece, but the details have been lost. It also appears that someone was banking on Faith never waking up. As attempts are made on her life, she turns to Dinah's fiance for help. But can he be trusted, especially when it becomes apparent that Faith has some sort of psychic connection to the missing Dinah? This is an elegant little thriller with supernatural overtones, and readily recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll buy the next \\"Shadow\\" book too...","review":"Kay Hooper is a new favorite author for me. Her style of writing is easy to read but with enough substance and suspense to keep you interested.Hiding in the Shadows is an easy read about Faith who wakes up from a coma with amnesia. She learns from the doctor that she has only one friend that has visited her in the hospital and has provided for her once she leaves, but now that friend is missing. Faith is cast out into the dangerous city of Atlanta by herself, but due to mayhem, that doesn't last for long. Faith & Kane are trying to find Dinah before it's too late. I really enjoyed the mystery and suspense in the book. The psychic content is very intriguing. However, the ending could have stopped at one point, but kept going. It was totally different and leaves you thinking. In my opinion, it wasn't as good as Stealing Shadows, but definately worth reading. Now I can't wait until her next book is released."},{"rating":"1","title":"no no no no no no NO!","review":"I don't usually hate books, but i hated this one. all i can say is that the heroine didn't know herself so i never got to know her.I loved Kay Hoopers other books in the \\"Shadows Trilogy\\" and i actually own those other two books, but this one IMO is frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Paced Suspense Thriller with a Twist","review":"Faith Parker wakes from a coma without her memory. This is a bad thing, because someone is trying to kill her. Could it be because she has glimpses into the memory of her friend, investigative reporter Dinah Leighton who is missing, maybe dead.This book is a fun read, with a surprising twist for an ending. Too surprising for me, too unexpected. Even with the reappearance of Noah Bishop from the last book, the tight writing and believable characters we care about (maybe too much in Faith's case), that ending cost it a star in my book. Still four stars is very respectable and I can heartily recommend this craftily written paranormal, suspense thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly pop fiction","review":"There is no need to go into a brief synopsis, as those ahead of me have sketched out the plot. I grabbed this book from the best-seller stand at the grocery -- looking for an easy afternoon read. I did finish the book, but it was just too unbelievable. I simply did not enjoy it. The conversations between people were so hokey and unreal -- no one really talks like that. And the ending was the kicker. At least my local library will benefit from the donation. Also, the Atlanta connection wasn't very strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"great author","review":"great book and really liked the story line and would recommend this book to others that like this type of story"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good but it didn't sit well with me.","review":"i adore Kay Hooper's psychic romance novels.

Having said that, I really didn't like this one. It is not so much the story itself as the twist with, revealed at the end, that just irked me. I won't state it here. Let me just clarify - it wasn't a lame \\"waking from a dream\\" or even a slapped together resolution. She's too good for that. I guess that the resolution just made me uncomfortable. Maybe that a good thing. Maybe that states how strong Hooper's stories and writing is... but for me, this is one of her novels that I'll keep (to keep the series together) but probably never read again - and I am a voracious re-reader.

When trying to return it, the seller said that I could not get a full refund because they had advertised it as CD + PAL/Region 2 DVD. I did find this mentioned about half-way down the description (not at the top), but did not know what that meant. Apparently, Region 2 means it won't play on an American player.

Talk about disappointment!If you like to smile and occasionally even guffaw, this talented series is for you. As I mentioned earlier, it is addictive, but cheaper than hard drugs.

However, when the movie came out, I didn't want to see it on the big screen. When reading the book, I felt the pain, sorrow, and sadness of the whole wartime period, as well as the impact on future generations. No action is ever lost in time. After watching the DVD, I felt the same emotions as those felt when I read the book. The acting was excellent. However, the subtitles for the extensive French scenes took some getting used to. I understand such native dialogue added to the reality of the story, and the English subtitles certainly moved the plot along.

The film is excellent, don't miss the Making Of segment, as well, However, please read the novel first, you will get so much more out of the film and be able to follow it, as it jumps between 1942 and 2009.

The movie skimmed across the top of all the issues without rhyme or reason for what was happening i.e Bertrand.

Isn't there enough contrived, sappy, predictable love stories on lifetime???I was extremely annoyed when Richard Rainsferd, who is dying of cancer, rips off his oxygen mask and proceeds to sit on the side of the bed. Also, another irksome bit was that Julia is seen getting out of the American Driver's side seat. The acting of William Rainsferd was by far the most unrealistic. The final scene of the movie put me over the edge.

And it is odd to me that people want to view such realism in a story and applaud that, if it has such great acting and such realism as someone having to take a dump in the wrong place, showing you such true life. Sure, it was great drama and a story that might need to be told, but should you not tame it up a bit for the big screen and at least have a happy ending of some sort? Even Schindler's List had some hope, and not as much depressing overwhelming dread, and a good inspiring ending. I found myself wanting to get a drink and watch any comedy I could find.

I really wasn't expecting to be scared but I watched it late at night and found myself double checking the locks throughout my house once the movie was done. Hell, I even locked my bedroom door when I went to bed and I never do that.Since I had never heard of this movie, I was skeptical as to whether or not I was wasting my time even watching it. Seeing it had pretty good reviews, my curiosity got the best of me but I'm glad I gave it a shot. It had some twists in it I definitely didn't see coming, which I like.

I love that when she was born that they watched her to see her true nature before they named her and then gave her the name Jingyong - Quiet Courage. Also that her father would not allow Jingyong's feet to be bound, and that he treated her as a son and she was taught the 5 pillars of learning - art, literature, music, medicine and marital arts! There is so much more of the book, but I don't want to spoil it for you! This is an excellent book!What a fasinating story! The artwork is beautiful! And I can't wait to read this book to my daughter and find a Wu Mei Kung Fu studio to learn Wu Mei ourselves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great message but inaccurate martial arts-wise","review":"My son loves this book as do I, but I would love it more if I weren't a longtime student of Sifu Ken Lo, 7th Generation Master of Wu Mei Pai and Head of the Wu Mei Kung Fu association. While everyone's version of events of Wu Mei's life will be somewhat different, there is a very real martial art called Wu Mei that descends directly from Wu Mei herself. The nun Wu Mei's movement as depicted in the story are very different from the Wu Mei I've studied for the last 15 years. I suppose that is poetic and artistic license, but it's a shame nonetheless, especially as the author interved Sifu Lo and watched his class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and very creative music","review":"This CD has some very original and creative sounds to it, and nothing quite sounds like anything else.

Expected a scratchy, melodic folk/blues album. Uh, no way - this is an amazingly high-techno electronic but melodic album with soaring vocal interplay. I don't like it all the way through, but the high points are my favorite music of the year: My ritual, One Part Lullabye, EZLA, and (esp) No Need To Worry. A gorgeous whoosh of electronic melody (with, indeed, folk melodic underpinnings) that I have not tired of after 2 months (at least the high points)"},{"rating":"2","title":"largely untouched gem","review":"It took me some time to actually listen to this album, as I did not really care for their previous efforts, but once I started I simply could not stop. It has been over a year and I still have this cd in regular circulation. The album is an odd mix that ends up working really well. Although I enjoy \\"electronic\\" music, I sometimes feel that alot of artists now simply use it as an extraneous detail that really doesn't bring much to the actual song, just to be more on the up and up. The experimentation on this album, however, feels earnest and actually helps to give the songs more aural depth and texture. Beats flow in and out and build, while the acoustic foundations never get washed out of the mix. A great album that shows cut and paste aesthetics need not sound cold or out of place."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"one of the finest records of the 90's, for sure, it's incredible that it spawned no hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am i missing something?","review":"Am i missing something?

We are going to buy a different brand and suck up the cost of getting some extra carafes.FYI a replacement carafe for this thing is $40"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks and customer service","review":"Received this as a Christmas gift but didn't use it until this summer. After a few uses, it started leaking from the bottom. We contacted DeLonghi and left a message. We are sending it in at our expense to have it repaired and they pay to ship it back to us. We don't think their customer service is worthless like some reviewers have expressed. DeLonghi must be aware of this problem. We did not register the product for the warranty but they allowed us to send it for repair without the warranty. We hope the problem will be fixed. We will edit our review once we get the product back. I don't think I would recommend this product because of the leaking problem that so many people have had.We would not have bought it had we read the reviews on Amazon. Whether we buy from Amazon or not, we do trust the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I got this coffee, espresso, cappuccino maker for Christmas this year and so far it does what it's supposed to. I did run it a few times with the regular coffee side and the espresso side including the steamer with water before using coffee as the instructions say to. I haven't had any problems. The one difference between this and a very expensive version would be the plastic accessories vs. heavy duty metal. Still it makes good coffee and I like that you don't have to buy filters for it and the auto time set, so it brews while I'm getting ready in the am. The price seems reasonable for a coffee maker and I think I would have bought it had it not been bought for me.Update:The coffee maker broke after 1 day of use. I would not recommend purchasing this model due to the poor construction. The one cup of coffee I was able to drink did taste good. As always, your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pot leaks and the company won't stand up for the product - terrible","review":"We purchased this pot from a local store (not amazon) and with in four months we would find 1/2 cup of water on the counter under the machine. I emailed the company several times and waited weeks for a response - because I hadn't saved my receipt (who saves a coffee pot receipt) they said that my warranty had expired (they use the date they manufactured it instead) after 4 months (BS). I wouldn't purchase another product from this company not because the pot stopped working and leaked water but because of the lousy customer service. I emailed over 5 times and made 2 phone calls and service was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"twice disappointed!","review":"i can't believe that delonghi would actually put their name on this sub-sub-standard piece of equipment. we got our first combo machine on thanksgiving 2011 and just after using the drip coffee feature all of 5 times it stopped making filter coffee. thanks to kohls no questions asked rrturn policy we were anle to exchange it for another exact same machine around dec 15 2011.today feb 21 2012 the drip feature on the replacement stopped working too! i thought i might be doing something wrong but judging from the reviews here i'm glad to see that the problem is not me but this cheap and lame excuse for a coffee/espresso maker.i called up the customer service and they told me i have to ship the unit at my own cost and the repair can take anywhere upto a month! given the track record i'm not sure if i'll send in the machine for repair,just to have it broken down in 2 months again. i might just be better off getting a basic coffee maker next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"De Longhi","review":"I never have had any problem with online shopping... but must say that all the bad luck came with this product.Twice had to return as after the first cup of coffee it stopped working!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!!!!!!!","review":"Received this item for a Christmas Gift.

Also the espresso maker is not as hot as it should be. The removable water tank leaks and you will find a puddle under the unit. I dropped the plastic water tank from about 2 feet off the ground and it cracked, making it useless, I was suprised how soft plastic could break so easily, and as of yet I am unable to find a replacement, and Delonghi wont respond to my emails. this unit is cheaply made, and not worth the 100 bucks I spent on itlook elsewhere for a better combination machine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Machine","review":"I was given this as a gift and sadly had to look the gift-horse in the mouth. My boyfriend returned it and got his money back.This is a sub-par product that is poorly manufactured and almost 100% plastic.The coffee maker did not even work, it did nothing when we tried to make a pot of coffee, and the espresso it created was simply \\"strong coffee\\".I have been a barista and am knowledgeable about how to make a proper espresso. This machine is not capable of that.Use your money towards a better product - research a good pump driven machine.Or simply purchase the $40 Mr. Coffee - tho its not the quite the same, it will produce something closer to espresso than this machine ever could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee side stopped working after a few uses","review":"Received this as a Christmas gift. The expresso/cappucino side works ok. The coffee side did work for a few uses, but has now stopped working. DeLonghi agreed to repair the item, but I have to mail it to a repair center at my cost.

We ordered this product and used according to the manufacturer's manual. The drip coffee machine portion of this combination machine broke down the second week of usage, which we probably used only 5 times less. We asked for a replacement, however the drip coffee machine again broke down but this time was only the second time of usage! We only use distilled water for brewing our coffee so it shouldn't be due to minerals within water source. The drip coffee simply just doesn't drip. I don't know if it is just our luck, but I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND purchasing this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...when it worked","review":"Like so many others, our DeLonghi worked great for about 8 months after purchasing. The coffee was so good! I love the flavour system to choose brew strength and I loved the removable water basket-made it so easy. However, after 8 months, it started leaking water all over the counter. The frother is also at a weird angle, so you have to lift the machine up to fit your milk froth pitcher underneath it. We have not tried contacting DeLonghi, and will be purchasing something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks! Do not buy!","review":"I've only had this coffee pot for 6 months and it's completely ruined my counters. The coffee pot mysteriously leaks and you don't notice it because it's contained under the unit.I called DeLonghi customer service, since I've only had it 6 months, but they want me to ship it back to them, at my cost. It's UNDER warranty. It's sad because I really like this coffee pot, but the cost of the unit isn't going to cover the cost of replacing my counter tops.Don't waste your money. Want to see how widespread the problem is? Try googling \\"My Delonghi coffee pot leaks.\\" There are hundreds of reviews which say the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is Useless","review":"This coffee maker has essentially been useless from day one. It leaks from the bottom and floods the counter. After the returns process was intractable, I tried to make due by putting a baking sheet underneath the coffee maker. This worked for a few month, and I would get about two thirds worth of coffee from the amount of water I put in. Now I get about one fifth of the coffee I should get. Terrible product, and it seems to be the same story for everyone who has it. DO NOT BUY, its a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Not very happy, after waiting and waiting for it to come, the coffee part didn't work only the espresso part of the machine would work.

I really liked it at first, but now only 8 months later, it suddenly quit working. I love coffee makers and have had many different styles, so I know how to use them. I only use cold water, I make sure I keep it clean, and I descale it at regular intervals. However, after 8 months, it seems the pump on the drip side of this one went bad, no water will cycle from the reservoir. I have never had a coffee maker die on me before and so it really surprised me that this one did so quickly! I will never own a delonghi again!

The included permanent filter leaves residue in the bottom of the pot, but if I try to use paper filters instead, about 1/3 of the time the brew process, which feeds water in from the side rather than the top, \\"flips\\" the filter, resulting in a combination of really weak coffee and lots of grounds in the bottom of the pot. My old Krups machine was MUCH better, and I'll probably go back to using that one and retire this.

We exchanged it for another one and as soon as we plugged it in, the coffee maker didn't work. Exchanged a THIRD time, and after one use, the coffee maker stopped working.

I told her that's the way it's supposed to work and suggested that we simply put it in a 20 gallon bin or put a few towels under it. I told her that the spilled water offered us an opportunity to clean and wash the counter on a regular basis. I think her fears of electrocution are most definitely irrational and that we'd most likely survive the initial shock."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaky little devil","review":"I bought this item second hand off someone in town. I have to say it has leaked from the start. But I just put a towl underneath it, no big deal for me. I was a broke college student- at the time I couldn't afford to try another one. The leaking never really bothered me as long as i kept a towl there. The coffee was always good and so was the espresso shots. I've ran a coffee shop for 5 years, I know coffee. I never used the steam wand so who knows how well that works... But after having it second hand for over a year it has sprung another leak. The first leak was from underneath it and the second leak is now between the espresso head and coffee pot. I still use it every day- but I am worried it is going to go kamakazi and take down the whole house."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Stopped working after 2 months.

We sent it back (at our expense), they fixed it within 2 weeks and sent it back. Now it works fine but like other reviewers state it leaks, also I have to add more water then coffee I want (I fill to 6 cups instead of 4 cups) because of leaking and steam, making it more unpredictable and I often get a weaker or stronger coffee than I prefer. Also, you have to be careful the water tank in the back is firmly and tightly secured and the top shut precisely or it won't work at all.

Got this model for a Christmas present and it's already in the junk after @ 4 1/2 months of use. Espresso turns on - but the coffee side won't. I contacted the company and their advice is to ship it across the state (at my cost) there was no reference that they would pay to have it fixed but \\"they will pay to ship it back.\\" Which means what? I got rid of a coffee/espresso machine that was working to what I thought was an upgrade. It does look nice and did make great coffe when it was working but now I'm out a combination and using an old coffee pot. I don;t think this company realizes that standing behind a product should mean it's well made in the first place. I learned my lesson. I will NEVER buy and product from this company ever again.

Not for everyone, especially if you're closed-minded or a homophobe, this German film explores the reality of what it's truly like to feel different, to be alone in the world, even as you try to accept yourself. The two leads are brilliant, in a film that is a honest in a way very few other films - especially American films - ever are."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films I have ever seen","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented this film ... but I certainly didn't expect what I got. This film is incredibly slow moving so much so that it borders on being boring. The photography is horrible. The story line is a secret wrapped in a mystery cloaked in an enigma. The one redeeming aspect of the film is the music which is great.Others have compared this film to some of David Lynch's work but I just don't see it. Lynch's films were at least understandable on some level. This one isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"to the producer","review":"Hello producer,Next time you get the idea to make a movie, have a story.

Supposedly an end of the world movie but I didn't see it in the parts that I watched. This movie goes from bad to worse and then gets even worse. What is this movie about? Is there a point? It made no sense to me, seems to me that it's an Angsty movie about teenage angst, with extra angst and more teenage angst thrown in just to make it more Angsty. I kept trying to find a good spot in this film or at least something that would indicate what was going on, never happened. Apparently the director was smoking 'pregnant guppies' while he was filming, because this movie makes no sense at all, and probably wouldn't get better (even if you smoked a 'pregnant guppy'). Just don't bother, watch a test pattern or snow on you TV instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is the worst thing that has ever happened to me!","review":"This movie isn't for fans of the bizarre, but for fans of the nonsensical.

This is Farberware's el cheapo brand designed to appeal to Wal-Mart shoppers and college students.The pans are thin, the nonstick coating will not last and you'll find they scratch rather easily.However, they are an absolutely fabulous deal hear on Amazon, which is why they get 2 stars, not one. For somebody who wants the absolute cheapest set of not-quite-disposable pans they can find, you've come to the right place.I would recommend, however that you buy one or two of the Calphalon Commercial or Farberware Classic special priced items here instead. It will last a lot longer, look a lot nicer, and cook food better. Ultimately, the cost of cookware is a tiny fraction of the cost of the food that you will be cooking with it -- pennies a meal.

The author's illustrations are Zen-like, simple Shodo brush drawings that encourage a meditative approach to language.

Great behind the scenes info, drawings, etc. My only complaint is a one-page summary of \\"Jack Frost\\" and under-rated and in my opinion the best of the holiday specials. A sadly sweet story that deserves more recognition. Would love to hear from other fans of Rankin/Bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen up boys & girls!","review":"If you LOVE Rankin/Bass, holiday specials, or childhood memories, then this is a MUST have book!

Loved flipping through it (wish all pics were in color though). I Still need to read it, but I'm sure I will love it. It lists all the movies and shows in order (even shows I had no idea Rankin/Bass were involved in). It also has collectors items and memorabilia. There's not much behind the scenes info, but it is packed with photos. Still worth it for Rankin and Bass fans. Thanks Rick your awesome! P.S.

The Enchanted World of Rankin/Bass by Rick Goldschmidt was over a eight year effort, and may I say well worth it. Each project perfectly documented including production stills, rare photos, concept drawings, and fan memorabilia. There's Loads of interviews with Arthur Rankin, Jr., Jules Bass, actors, as well as animators and artists who worked on the shows. If that's not enough for you, then maybe 16 pages of color stills and over 400 photos will fill your belly. Covering over 20 years of television series, specials, theatrical releases, not to mention live action movies, this is a must have for any Rankin/Bass fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great photos, terrible text","review":"This book is a great concept; unfortunately it was not executed well. The design is crowded and jumpy. The text desperately needs a copyeditor. DESPERATELY. The whole thing lacks professionalism. The author is a fan, yes, but he should've worked with someone on this who knows what they're doing. Lots of unnecessary repetition and unclarified information. And whatever happened to those puppets? He never tells. Very little text about how the specials were actually filmed in their \\"Animagic\\" technique. How were the puppets made? By whom? What size were they? How were they worked? Lots and lots of questions left in readers' minds. Poor job. But--we're stuck with it. The attempt is nice, but it needs lots of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute dissapointment.","review":"Having been one of Rankin Bass biggest fans, I looked forward to reading more about behind the scenes and technical info. How dismayed I was to find that the bulk of this book is no more than plot synopsis of each of the R\\\\B shows. tell me how there is no behind the scenes photos of a set piece to show the size of the actual figures used. I remember as a child going on a tour of the NBC studios, and seeing the figures from rudolph in a glass case. I was surprised @ the size of the abominable snow monster. I was hoping for seeing more of this type of thing. There is one picture of somebody holding donner, and thats it. we\`ve seen these shows countless times, we know the story backwards..yet story synopsis takes up 99% of this book. the photos are very small, mostly black & white. It is obvious that the author is a novice, shame on him & shame on me for spending $ on this amateurish attempt of writing about a company (Rankin Bass) who deserves better treat ment than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely no Christmas in July ...","review":"Pictures and plot summaries aplenty, but very little history, far less insight and absolutely no Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July.

It gets two stars because it arrived in poor condition, several bolts were loose, some had to be retrieved from the box and reattached (we had to figure out where and how they went), it was obvious that these were not meant for the customer to attach. A rubber protector piece was lodged inside the center column of the stand when it should have been attached on the end, we had to force it out and reattach it.

I was wrong. I cannot get this tank to stay put (I even tried tucking it in, which usually helps with shapewear). No luck. I wouldn't recommend this tank, since shapewear doesn't do much in the way of shaping when you're pulling it down every 5 seconds.For what it's worth, I have a well-defined waist and hips, so that might influence the riding/rolling up. Maybe if your shape isn't hourglass this won't be as much of a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should call this \\"barely smoothes\\"","review":"So I bought a medium, my normal shirt size being 5'5.

I had originally bought it to give to my son (who enjoyed watching birds...mostly raptors....as a child), I decided to read it myself and was amazed at the species of birds this soldier was seeing over there. Sounds like (in addition to his mission) he did have some downtime and had some positive things to say about the region, which was nice.

Physically, the book, while it's got a nice cover presentation, is about 4 1/2 x 6 1/5 and has about 50 pages of very sparse text, plus a checklist at the end. Not even any pictures. Mostly a simple listing of the birds he sees during random days around camp. No deep meaning, no great insight. Quite disappointing considering the potential of the topic. I can't imagine who this was written for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and underwritten","review":"The book costs $9.95 but consists of little more than slightly edited versions of what the author put on his blog. The idea behind the blog is intriguing: being a naturalist in a war zone. The book is really a series of reports: he saw such and such birds in such and such a place. The poignancy of what he is doing never comes through. And the price? Ridiculous. It's worth maybe $5.

The ball bearing in the tube where the water comes out kept getting stuck. very frustrating for our bird, and ourselves. Now.. that being said, it didn't flood the bird cage with dripping or gushing water, like other brands, it is easy to attach and remove from the cage, and also easy to clean. If you can keep it from hanging up inside the feeding tube.. it might be worth having. Maybe ours was a one time defect.. don't know.

It chronicles the electric car phenomenon of the 1970's leading into the 1980's. A lot of interesting historical photographs in it. With so many off the shelf parts available today, it's easier then ever to make an electric vehicle. Things have came a long way since this book was written.

It fits easily in a pocket. It appears and feels solid and sturdy though I haven't tested to see how much abuse it can take.My advice, though, is to do some research before buying a moderately expensive flashlight, because there is no one type that is best for everyone. Some factors to consider are size & weight; beam brightness, coverage (angle), uniformity, and color; battery type and life; uniform or declining brightness over the course of battery life; durability of the body; lifetime and durability (and cost) of the light source (LED or bulb).

I don't need a page after page of colorful descriptions. I need a reason to care about the characters.I felt that Kasischke was deliberately obtuse with the facts in order to be more \\"artistic.\\" Much ilke a beginning director will stage odd shots, or shoot in black and white just to prove how different they are than the commercial directors.

I think that other reveiws were correct in saying that it is hard to know which character was which in the high school segments because there was no reference by name. I think that the concept of the book was interesting, however, follow through just wasn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off on Anita Shreve's book","review":"I was so taken in with the beginning of this book, but then it just became so boring. The rest of the book is composed of very descriptive accounts of very mundane activities. I could see where this book was going, and I've already read the same story, in a much better novel by Anita Shreve-The Last Time They Met. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good set up founders","review":"As practically every review points out, the first 6 pages are riveting and create an interesting premise. The last 19 pages are also interesting. The 200+ pages that come between are numbingly bland and soporiphic. After the opening, it quickly becomes obvious (as the title telegraphs) that the bulk of the book is the flash forward of a teen imagining her life. And that's the problem -- full of teen naivte, it's a future with all the depth and resonance of a Hallmark card. Lilacs and peonies bloom with cloying sweetness. Picket fences and husbands are both \\"perfect\\" -- and all but indistinguishable from each other. The garden isn't just a garden but \\"her very own little garden.\\" The house is \\"her very own dream house.\\" I heart life, jotted with endless repetition. By failing to create a rich or textured future for her character, the author made it impossible for me to care much about her or feel the enormity of her loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Church Classics not as expected","review":"I ordered Church Classics because it was listed with Steven Anderson on my search for piano music played by him. It is not what I expected. It is the music performed by Festival Choir and Hosanna Chorus. No where on the CD's do I find anything by Steven Anderson. What a disappointment. Since I have already opened it expecting piano music, I can't return it. After the fact I read the other review on this and I wish I had read it before I ordered. I am VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product great! Packaging and order fulfillment poorly done.","review":"I knew the product was great. We own other copies of it and have given them away to others who have greatly enjoyed them. This order was to replace what was given away. I ordered it for my mom who'd given hers away. I paid $16 extra dollars to have it delivered before Christmas on a late order. The picture says 3 CDs, which was the packaging my mom had to begin with before she started giving them away. 3 CDs in 1 box.When the package arrived, there were only 2 individually plastic boxed CDs, the 3rd one was missing, no overall box that matches the picture above or what was advertised. And, one of the plastic CD boxes was cracked 6/8ths of the way across the front. I was very disappointed, but too busy caring for my parents' health issues to return the products for the ones I paid for. Normally, Amazon is on top of things. The only good thing is that it did arrive before Christmas....only not what I ordered and not in good shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh stop your arguing.","review":"Does the genre really matter? Just listen to whatever sounds good and to heck with all the bollocks out there. Now stop whinning about whether these are true punk bands and tell people whether this is a good buy or not.Thursday and Taking Back Sunday have excelent tracks on here. Probably the best two. Most of the other songs tend to grow on you. But the first two tracks I mentioned warrant a buy on their own. Not for $14 bucks, mind you. Maybe $9.99 or somewhere around there. I'm sure you could find this cheaper at an actual store.If you don't like acoustic music or any of these bands then you should probably spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"I hate to participate in this genre debate but I will anyway. To me, punk/hardcore is DIY, basement/house shows, we don't need your highly record label we can support ourselves because we're all a community. That said, to me, this isn't punk. But whatever, if you like these bands BUY IT! Do it!however, if you want to hear some amazing acoustic punk bands (sometimes compared to folk music), listen to:Ghost Mice, Defiance OH, Operation: Cliff Clavin (they have one acoustic album), Best Friends Forever, This Bike is a Pipe Bomb, (obviously) Against Me!, Sawwheel, Madeline, and if you like mellow acoustic mixed with powerful screams check out the mighty (MIGHTY) 1905.1905 is absolutely killer, these kids have such impeccable talent and great lyrics... goosebumps!:) peace kids, don't hate each other, enjoy everything the undeground has to offer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This cd took forever to come out and then it broke my heart. I love the bands on the cd but I think the songs are a let down. Many of the songs you've probably already heard. I love acoustic music but I don't think the acoustic versions of these songs demand any special attention, better yet a cd. I would not recommend buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad idea","review":"Theres a reason that these bands are considered punk it's because none of them can sing. Most of the vocals on this CD are horrible. Punk songs just should not be done acoustic. I new this CD would not be great especilly after seeing Thrice play an acoustic set at the warped tour. Stick with these bands real albums this CD sucks and was a bad idea from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA","review":"This just makes me want to laugh.... First of all, half the bands on this cd are not even punk- Yellowcard?!?!?! The Starting Line?!?!?!? The Ataris?!?!?!?!?! ah, NO!

When I'm feeling melancholy or a little out of it, I just throw this on for a little pick-me-up.This album is to rock what black-and-white photos are to full-color photos. A little more depth in spots, a little more emphasis on certain aspects of the music and lyrics we would never focus on if full instrumentation was included. Emotion is rampant. I agree with the guy who said that this isn't exactly punk, though. But it's still a great collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"so easy to put down","review":"Loving gay-themed fantasy novels as much as I do I am awfully sorry to give such a low rating to one of them, this included.The world created here by Mr Donaghe is interesting and the plot really has potential. Moreover it is extremely clear how much care he put in his work, giving us a novel that is neither short, nor vain, nor hurried.Unfortunately it is also lenthy more than just long, excruciating more than slow and wordy more than meaningful.We are given whole paragraphs when simple sentences would suffice, long explanations instead of hints and this happens again and again.I had to abandon it after little more than a hundred pages, displeased with the author and with mysel, not a nice feeling.By the way, one could legitimately feel displeased with the publisher too: the book awfully expensive, massive, hard to read, printed with a very small font and badly bounded so that pages tend to fall out."},{"rating":"2","title":"capts boom boom","review":"wasnt super scary but good story line cant wait till i get the next book charaterswe're pretty good but dracula's dreams caused the great war is kinda deep but it worked that something this evil as dracula could cause it to happen but being judas wow now thats deep good book liked it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugar hit it!","review":"Snaps all around - track 2 is my fave.

Then, on the track \\"Love Is Blind,\\" she criticizes -- and eventually slays -- a man who batters his girlfriend and sends her to an early grave.Given her fascination with hoodlums, the sentiments of this song, poignant as they may be, are hard take seriously.On her first effort, Eve does, however, show potential as a lyricist. The only problem is that to notice it, you have to cut through the lame sing-song choruses (\\"Gotta Man,\\" \\"Philly, Philly,\\" \\"Love Is Blind\\") and way-too-long list of guest appearances."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is da best buy of da month","review":"no doubt eve is hot...in looks andlyrics....da album is a must have.although the remix of \\"what ya want\\" aint as hot as the original... the hook is OFF DA HOOK..and da lead single \\"gotta man\\" gets repeat action in my player....all in all she may gotta man (stevie j) but now wit dis cd she gotta winner....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eve, Ruff Ryders First Lady and best investment.","review":"Released on September 14, 1999 and hitting hard lyrics for all the peeps to groove to.

One other name that should have been on the cover is Zack Gill - the frontman of ALO adds a great element with his accordian, and track 6 is an amazing version of his band's \\"Girl\\" unplugged. If you understand that these are recordings from their friend Kelly Slater's studio and that it's all about having fun, this CD will be in your regular rotation...If you are more into a plugged-in live performance with a full band, give a listen to Donavon's Abbey Road Sessions album."},{"rating":"2","title":"gotta-have CD","review":"This is my second time purchasing this CD.

This is an excellent reference book about permaculture. The Why.

Not that you can't implement some of these changes even there to help create a great personal environment.And before you begin any of these projects, make sure you have your family's support. I got shot down as soon as I opened by mouth.The first thing to be aware of though, is that this will need a certain investment of time, $$, and WATER.

Despite the lack of detailed maps, it was easy to follow the campaign leading up the battle and the struggle itself. Detzer did an excellent job of portraying the chaos of the first major Civil War battle, something no antiseptic map could. Detzer also notably debunks some of the legends behind the battle, without attempting a full-scale revision. There were a couple minor errors in the book, like listing Republican political manager Thurlow Weed as mayor of New York City. Also some of the more interesting anecdotes did not seem to be cited in the back of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"My son really did not enjoy it much - kind of OK from educational point.

However, they didn't start that way; they were originally this: Autumn Wind Thesis.I purchased this CD with low expectations; I only wanted to understand where the band had come from. However, this is horrific. There's no sense of structure, nothing new, nothing exceptional; infact, there isn't even anything mediocre, or just 'ok.'This CD is terrible. I love 'Blessed Are The Bonds,' and I love the members of the band - they are amazing guys, and incredibly modest. I'm glad they were able to take this and grow to heights that are too high to touch by most musicians. I would never suggest anyone listen to this, though. This should be buried and forgotten.

The toddler dropped it and a few pieces broke off ie the door. Pay attention --the handle on the toy is for adults to carry, not toddlers. Thanks to duct tape, the Storybook Station has been patched up and is still going strong. I just bought one for my nephew who is almost 2 years old. It took awhile for me to find this toy, because the name and manufacturer were not on it. This toy is well worth the price here on Amazon.

Thank goodness I only went for the 1.7oz.(which was given away to a friends son, who loved it). There is some loud funky note that goes through the duration of this thing that I can not stomach. Now, mind you, I'm more than willing to rock an unconventional scent every now and again,(Kouros, Kyoto, Le Male, etc), but this thing I can't do. I can detect the same note in Xeryus Rouge(I think), but Rouge couples it together with softer notes to temper it down. I don't know, just my 2 cents.

Larry David has made a brilliant show, with improvisations that are unlike any you've ever seen, plots that are as ridiculous as Seinfeld (and just as funny). It's painful to watch sometimes, and you find yourself wishing the characters would choose different ways of approaching life, but it's because of their horrible life strategies that the show is so funny and so successful. What a riot."},{"rating":"2","title":"No smarter or funnier show on TV!","review":"Curb Your Enthusiasm is the program that Seinfeld should have been. It displays an edge that you've never seen in a sitcom before, and it is--at times--downright painful to watch.

Mary, 16, knows that her parents are not acting responsibly, and that her father needs help, but no one will listen to her suggestions. Her father physically and emotionally abuses her and, upon being refused welfare, shoots his wife.

However, there are others working magic in Scotland, and the children soon find themselves caught up in a magics both new and old!This is a great story, harkening back so clearly to ancient folk stories. I especially liked the traditional idea of women as possessors of ancient wisdom and power, beyond men and their science. This is a great book that I recommend to everyone with children, especially girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I'm surprised people like this book. The writing is overheated, the story jumps around confusingly and it contains rather ridiculous claims. For example, early on, Hogge states that Henry VIII was motivated primarily by the fear that England would sink into civil war if he died without leaving a male heir. I didn't realize Henry had such noble intentions!I'm about a third of the way through and considering giving up, which is unfortunate because I usually inhale books from this period.

The size of my spare tire prevents the arms of the rack from opening fully so I can not properly lock them open.Make sure your tire is small enough to mount this rack to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT fit LARGE tires","review":"Be careful with this rack if you have large spare tires. I have 32\\" BFG AT's on my Wrangler and 33\\" Bridgestones on my H3. This rack fits neither of them. The top section needs to sit above the spare to lock into place, and tires larger than 30\\" in my approximation just won't work. There is no vertical adjustment to the rack, only side to side for decentered tires. It's a shame because the rack itself when locked in properly seems very solid.When using the THULE vehicle fit guide, keep in mind that it's based on the standard size OEM tires on the base model of the vehicle. If you choose an off-road package with larger tires (and thus a larger spare), or if you switch to larger tires later (like many of us do), the THULE rack will probably end up being returned like mine did.I've since ordered a SARIS BAT rack, which also mounts to the spare tire. But it extends up and out, and doesn't need to settle part of it over the spare, so I'm hoping it works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"too restrictive","review":"the rack came very promptly, however, the packaging was badly beaten up, and the actual rack had scratches when i took it out of the box. it was easy to install on my '05 jeep liberty, and is sturdy. there is one big problem i have with it- it doesn't fit anything smaller than a 16\\" mens bike. i have a small mens bike- 14\\", and i had to purchase a bar adapter so it would fit, and even then it's still a very tight fit! it's a great rack, but too restrictive on the size bikes it holds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thule 963 Spare Me 2 Bike Rack","review":"This was a very good investment.

But do consider that it's only 50 feet at it's longest, and the further you move away from the house, the coils pull back considerably... just like a rubber band would. This presented a major problem when I went to fill up our inflatable pool the other day... normally I put our old hose in the pool and I could walk away as it filled up on it's own, but with this hose I had to stand there and hold it, otherwise it would've sprung back towards the house from all the tension. Additionally, if you have a lot of winding pathways with delicate flowers in your hard, this is not the hose for you... as you absolutely cannot lay the hose down as you move about the garden... it just is one straight coiled line from the house to wherever you stand. Be forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good purchase","review":"I bought this hose April 20, received it April 22. It was green instead of blue but I hooked it up and started using it. Because the faucet is down some deck stairs and around the corner I wanted something I could hook up and leave on so I could water my deck flowers each morning. I bought the more expensive one thinking it would be sturdier. Imagine my surprise when I came home yesterday (April 30, just 8 days later)and water was spouting all over! The hose had sprung, not just a leak, but a hole the size of a quarter in the middle of its length! Back it goes. Don't get it if you plan to leave your water source on.

Most people in the book were so taken with her, but there was no justification for the constant adoration showered upon her. This book was also too darn long! I just wanted it to end already! Dorothy was funny, but the letters really got to be a bit much. I wouldn't say not to read it because it seems that all the other reviewers loved it.

The novel opens with Bitsy on the run from her abusive husband, with her baby in tow. Her mother, Dorothy, remains institutionalized, and writes letters to the First Lady, detailing incidents in her family's life (each one in turn over time). Aunt Clancy Jane is back with her hippie tendencies turning into crazy cat lady proclivities, along with daughter, Violet, who is off to college and medical school and seems to be the most sane of the bunch. The book spans the late 60's to the 80's as we watch these wild and wacky women go through their lives, some improving on their lives, some falling into the same patterns. This was a clever, amusing, and sometimes bittersweet novel of women of the South."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like Crazy Ladies","review":"I'm disappointed. Mad Girls in Love warps the characters of the first novel. Clancy, Dorothy, Bitsy and Violet - none of them seem the same.

The plot shifts so quickly and with no direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it in a day!!!!

It gets good ratings and acclaim from the critics. I read your reviews and others and decided to rent it. My first and only reaction was how pathetically easy it was. The moves were easy to pull off, and when i began, i mainly used them. Then as the game progressed and i found that the opponents were actually good at blocking them, i began to devolve my strategy into first combos then just mindnumbing pushing of three buttons in order. Punch-Punch-Punch. All you had to do was evade an opponent attack and then just do that combo. Evading is remarkably easy as all the characters have a remarkably long wind up, but if you fail, you are caught in a looong combo that you have absolutely no chance to get out of. The computer took half my \\"life\\" away with one combo followed by hits when i was down, because I COULD NOT GET UP. The controls are sluggish and the graphics bit the big one.

This game is awesome, and I'm sticking to it. I've played Soul Caliber, and I have to admit that it's pretty good too, but VF3 graphics much better, despite being 3 years older, and most importantly the gameplay is best for a 3d fighter yet. Although Soul Caliber does have the added rpg feature I don't see how it adds anything significant to the game. Fighters are meant to be played with friends. There's no fun in beating up on the computer. Bottom line, if you're looking for a great game that'll keep you busy for months then you've found it. This one's a definite keeper. To all of you that are bashing this game for the sake of attacking Sega, all I can say is don't kill yourself over the fact that they're putting out quality titles.

No one plays this game well by bashing random buttons. Any gamer that has played this game for months (like myself) will tell you that mastering a character is perhaps the most rewarding art form on the planet.

For one thing, you get to choose between 7 characters (the 7th is secret). As Sonic, you simply go through the level to the end. As Tails, you race another character to the finish. As Knuckles, you must search for emerald shards. As Amy, you run from a psycho robot, while leading a flicky to the safety of a hot air balloon. As E-102, you complete a task. And as Big, you... go fishing(groan!). This is the 2nd best Sonic game and number 6 on my favorite games list. It boasts incredible graphics, awesome gameplay, and the character voices are great.

Sonic acts like an egotistical teenager, Amy acts like a screaming immature brat, Big is way too dumb and that E-102 robot is one of the cheapest robot characters I've ever seen. The only decent characters are Knuckles and Tails. The one thing that's really stupid is that you have to pick a certain character for a level.But hey, if you like Sega and the Sonic games, then get this! I must admit the graphics are good, but unlike the Sonic cartoons and comics, all the games' plots have been the same, cheap slop over and over again.

No cheats were used, and this was my first time playing Dreamcast. I think that this game stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating","review":"This game is bad. First of all, you run around like a freak, and you barely feel like youre controlling the character. the game play is awkward and stupid. After playing the game for 10 minutes I thought I was going to throw up. Really, there are points where you can just put down the controller and make a phone call and it doesnt seem to matter.The game also lacks polish, as if they were in a hurry to get it out.

This is an awesome game, one of the best adventure games I've ever played (I'm an adventure video game fan). But the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was confusing at some points in the game. Most of the time after a cinematic scene ended they would just leave me there with no clue what to do or where to go, except sometimes right before the scene ended the character would say, \\"I've gotta follow him!\\" or, \\"Let's go find out!\\" or something like that. That was the only flaw in this game, however. If you like adventure games, or if you're just looking for a good time with a video game (and if you own a Dreamcast) buy this game.

One of the coolest features of the game is the simplicity that it takes to really get into it... However that doesn't mean that it doesn't have some amazingly complex level designs.

However, it may be a little too easy. There is a lack of puzzles, and the bosses are pretty simple. I guess I'm the person that likes RPG's like Zelda and Grandia II. The story is ho-hum, but once you get into it, the story really breaks off in different directions when you see the game through the eyes of the six characters you can play with. That's the main reason I gave it four stars instead of two. Also, the graphics and sound are good. My only gripe about the sound is when characters are talking, their mouths speak Japanese, but they speak in English. (That is if you have the language set on English.) I'm not sure of this, but I AM sure that their oral movements definately aren't matching what they say. Overall, it's worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Scheme","review":"Dr.Robobotnik(a.k.a.Eggman) and Sonic are on a game for Dreamcast with some new freinds.

Controls are easy to use, graphics are pretty good, and there are many characters to choose from, but you have to find them. The voice overs are really bad because their mouth moves at a different time then when they actually speak. There are many levels to go through, and each level has three levels to beat it with, A, B, and C. Overall it's a good game, but once you beat it with everyone, you don't really want to go back. There's no replay value in this game, but it's good until you beat it. Hope this was useful for you.

If yes, then buy this game!","review":"Although there are slight camera angle problems, they are minor, and can usually be corrected with the view controls, and only obliterate your view in instances where you are already dead(like having fallen off of the level). It really only bothered me a few times, in a few of the later levels of the game. This game is a blast, and it is so incredibly fast! It must have 'blast processing' or something! :-) I am 31 years old and it is not too childish for me. That was my only concern before buying it, because of the cartoonish nature of it. There is no reason not to buy this game if you have a Dreamcast, and if you don't have a Dreamcast, you should get a part time job so you can afford to buy one, since it is well worth it. I cannot go back to Playstation and N64 games now, without noticing how incredibly pale the games look in comparison! Seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ultra long game with tons of secrets","review":"(...)You seem to think theres only 7 characters in this game! (...) there were 10+!First off the main 6 are-Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big and E-102 gamma. Complete all them to get Super Sonic (no action stages!). On Casinopolis you get Nights by getting to the top of the Nights board (1 stage). Hatch all the eggberts on casinopolis to get Rella (1 stage). Finally, get all emblems for a secret level cheat. Get all animals on this level to get Tikal (5 stages)! There are also codes to get Super Tails and Knuckles. Anyway, I give this gameGAMEPLAY: 5*GRAPHICS: 5*REPLAYABILITY: 5*LOADING TIME: 4*STORY: 5*CAMARA: 3*OVERALL: 4.999*If you like this, get sonic adventure 2.

If you don't have a Dreamcast, you can just get the Gamecube version for your Gamecube/Wii. It's almost the same just the graphics are enhanced and there's more to do. If you can get it for under $20, then you should get it. There's still a lot to do, and I don't think it finishes fast. It took me a while to beat all of the bosses. Tails isn't stuck in a machine, either-he can fly around easily. The chao are also awesome, I really recommend this game, you can't have a Dreamcast collection without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY FUN","review":"I can't deny that this game is a blast to play. One good thing that I like about it is that once you have completed Sonic, there are more characters, with their own task to complete. The graphics are simply amazing. The speed at some points in the game are out of this world. Sega sure did have a winner with this game. I think it is well worth your money to purchase this game. If you do purchase this game, you will definitely not regret it. This game beats the CRAP out of Super Mario 64, and Crash Bandicoot. I have played both. I can hardly put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic for Dreamcast","review":"Sonic Adventure being the first Dreamcast game holds a remarkable feat. Sonic Adventure really displayed the Dreamcast power 1 year ago. With great graphics and sound sonic goes good in that department. Sonic also has great play control with only a few glitches. Many modes and levels including mini games. Shoot Sonic Adventure mup as a great game to own. This was my first game let it be yours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my goddess!","review":"This game is arguably the best in the series. It's music is catchy, the sound, clear and crisp, the dialog... Well, the voice actors kinda get a frog in their throat every now and again ('specially tails, near the end) but I say to you now; If you loved Super Mario 64, you WILL like this game. If you liked any other sonic game, YOU WILL LIKE THIS GAME. So get it. It's the most fun I've had since Sonic And Knuckles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic rocks.","review":"When I first played Sonic I thought it was really really REALLY cool!

Its way better than Sonic Adventure 2, and miles better than Sonic Shuffle. I like it because you actually get to choose who you want to be, and with Tails you can actually fly...amazing! Plus to top it all off I just found out about bonus characters(not Super Sonic), and this is the first game I have ever played with adventure mode where you can just roam around freely, find hidden power-ups, and even some new areas!

Stunning worlds and innovative play make Sonic Adventure an exciting, breathless,andvisually astounding game. As Sonic, Tails, Knuckes, Amy, Big, andE102 Gamma, each character must stop the evil that threatens, an evil which lies in Dr. Robotnik -- the sinister villain who has returned to unlease ultimate destruction. Areas like Emerald Coast, Speed Highway, and the Sky Deck make you feel like you're flying in the game, an insane speed that grips and doesn't let go. Breathtaking graphics and sound make this a top-quality game, and no Sonic fan should miss out on Sonic Adventure. A masterpiece of a game, Sonic Adventure is one wild ride, and the Dreamcast shouldn't go without this title.

A lot of times the itmes used in a game can be treacherous if you jmust work inside in a rfelatively confined space. Cavert has come up with a lot of substitute items that can be made from things you probably have lying around your house. I used his unidentified flying bandana as a substitute for frisbees (which are hard to find in January). I had to shorten the starting line for the game, but I didn't have to worry about anyone walking into the hall not realizing that a frisbee had been thrown.

Kevin Navarro's book ranks, without question, as one of the best.\\"Complete\\" is the right word to use in reference to this book. Kevin manages to squeeze a wealth of information into a relatively short, easy and engaging read. The chapters on musical direction alone can be used as a handy reference book, invaluable to have available in a church staff office. The sections on theology, discipleship and leadership are equally spot-on; Kevin readily points out the elements which are truly needed in today's church environment. Best of all, Kevin's heart for worship is evident throughout.I would highly recommend this book, not just to professional worship directors, but to anyone who accepts the challenge of leading a congregation into the presence of the living God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Worship Resource","review":"This is an outstanding book-- great for pastors, worship leaders, worship teams, and anyone who worships.

The only way to be successful as a worship leader is to put God first in all you do and this idea is wholeheartedly endorsed by the author, but God also expects you to use your talents in an excellent way.

After a month or two is started to squeak. The back eventually broke. I emailed the manufacturer and sent pictures. They replaced the glider with the new model. After a month this new model started to squeak. It got worse as the days went on. I emailed the manufacturer again and sent in a video. They sent me a new base. There is some squeaking but not like it was. I think I can deal with it until it gets worse. The manufacturer was very helpful and I was glad they replaced the old model and the base of the new model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not broken but squeaks a lot","review":"When I bought this I thought I found a great deal. I remember being blown away by how expensive other gliders were. I tried the floor model at the local babies r us store and I thought the cushion was thin but the glider itself was good. I found it online at half the price in the store and figured I could add a cushion to make it more comfortable.The chair was great for about the first week. Then it started to squeak. No matter how I positioned myself, it creaked and squeaked. Then it started to jolt just a little as we rocked over the centerpoint. Amazingly, my daughter didn't seem to mind. We're going on two years and it's held out ok, but we never could make the squeaking go away. Now we just use it to read books in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine broke too!","review":"This chair was great for a little over a year. It got A LOT of use, but still should have held up longer! A couple months ago, it started cracking while my husband was rocking our daughter to sleep. I made him get up, and sure enough, the back had broken from the base. We had just moved and I figured that maybe the screws had been loosening from all that handling or something. I removed the screws and the little metal grip thing that provides the threads in the base. I drilled new holes, and put it back together. A few days ago, it broke again while he was rocking her. This time, I went and bought new bolts with nuts and repaired it again. It seems really strong, and I don't see how it could break there now... hopefully it won't break somewhere else.

I will never forget when I was rocking my baby to sleep when she was 9 months old and then all of a sudden the back of this chair broke and it fell on us - it was SOOOO horrible.After reading numerous customer rewievs of this chair at babiesrus.com it became obvious that this hadn't just happened to us. Neither Babiesrus nor Jardin responded to my request for a full refund so far...They have been notified of a poor design of this product yet they keep selling it \\"with a little different name\\" - still!

Thankfully I knew better and saved my reciept b/c in less than 2 months the back broke off again, same place- right at the base of the seat of the chair.

The back is anchored with two screws. Unexpectedly, the seat splits where the screws are attached. This happens suddenly and can cause injury. I suffered a back injury.

If it had not been positioned in the corner of the room (the walls behind the chair \\"caught\\" the back when it broke) it could have been disastrous. We escaped without serious injury, but I URGE YOU FOR THE SAFETY OF YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR BABY, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

I couldn't afford to spend $400 on a chair so originally I was going to go with a very cheap glider/ottoman combo. After several trips to the store and lots of deliberation I decided that i would forgo the ottomon and splurge a little on a better chair considering the amount of time I would be spending in it. This chair was priced in between the original one and the more expensive ones and in the store it felt soft and cushy. Well within a very short period of time the cushions became flat and unconfortable, they stained very easily and the incessant squeaking began. My son is now 6 months old and while it hasn't broken yet I wouldn't be suprised if it did. I am very dissapointed, If I had only know how uncomfortable I would be I either would have spent less to be that uncomfortable or I would have found some way to buy a more expensive chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value!","review":"I've been very pleased with these pans.

Plus it's a beautiful, shiny pan - even after so much use. The inside bottom does have some surface scratches from my whisk :) but it doesn't affect its functionality in any way.

The 5-1/2 qt saute pan was shipped via FedEx in the Cuisinart box with one end resealed with a piece of cardboard and lots of tape - the helper handle of the pan was the tiniest bit scratched. The saucepans were put in an amazon box and shipped via UPS perfectly. The Everything pan was shipped via a weirldy named shipping company that FedEx uses and was fine. 5 stars on the pans, but 1 1/2 stars for Amazon.

It is a little warm near the pan portion but who holds the pan at that location anyway. It is solid and for the price, a great value. There is some discoloration after several uses but it doesn't affect the taste and I expect some Patina if you will for stainless steel.

The construction is very solid and I've had no problems with it whatsoever. It's definitely worth the money because you can't find anything comparable for the price.Stainless steel does have its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, if you treat it right then you are going to get professional results. On the other hand, it requires more maintainence because things will stick to it.Also keep in mind that after you start cooking with it, the pan will get dirty and grimy and scratched. This is normal so don't freak out about it like I did when I got my first stainless steel cookware. It won't affect the performance of the cookware."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOESN'T WORK ON AN INDUCTION COOKTOP !!","review":"I bought this to use on my induction cook top but it won't work on it - a magnet will not stick to the bottom - there must be too much aluminum in it.

That having been said, I had mixed thoughts about this book. The part of the book that covers the 1950s through the middle 1960s is wonderful, with lots of detail that hasn't been available anywhere else and it leans heavily on the reminiscences of Prince Buster who is a very valuable resource. By the time Bradley gets into the 70s, he loses his exclusive source (Buster) and the narrative speeds up. The 80s and 90s are dismissed quickly and very incompletely, making this a strong source on early Jamaican music but pretty useless on everything else. One further note - (...)difficult sentence and paragraph constructions, bad grammar and bizarre word choices can make things very difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"the definitive tome so far","review":"Excellently researched, engagingly written and an absorbing read, THIS IS REGGAE MUSIC is the best book so far on the topic.

I didn't set it up for several months, because we were moving shortly after the baby was born. So I set it up and two months later it broke! I was gently rocking my baby to sleep. It was pretty late at night, and the back just broke off. Completly BROKE OFF! The wood had craked in half where the back was attatched to the base. I really didn't use this that much. I usually feed my Daughter in a different chair. So I use this possibly only once a day.I went back to Babies-R-Us, and they tried to say that I could not return it because I no longer had the box. The box was huge, where would I put it. I threw it away as soon as I took the glider out of it. I did finally talk to a manager and they issued me a store credit. So that is the only good thing about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget the glider get a recliner!","review":"My mom bought us this glider in 2004 a 1 1/2 months before our first child was born. It was very nice great for breastfeeding all night and day. Until our daughter was about 3 months the screws holding the back let go and the arm broke. I fixed it with some new screws and bults and some glue for the arm. Now we are expecting our second child and the glider needed to be fixed a second time. We went and bought a rocking recliner that will be good for breasfeeding, lots of looking arround, but we got a nice one. I didn't want to take any chance of it braking again. Also it's not so comfy when you can feel how flimsy it is. The price of this chair was about $400 something 2 years ago. Personaly I would rather spend the money on something not made of wood, and have a great warenty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted...","review":"...but like so many others here, ours broke after 16 months of use. The other descriptions are accurate - the screws won't hold the back on any more and can't be fixed (wood splits and anchors will no longer hold the screws.) I was planning to use this chair for multiple children given the price, but now I'm stuck - pregnant again and looking for another glider. I give it the two stars because it was a good chair for the time that it lasted - we did get some use out of it, although not our money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dangerous! Ours broke too.","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS GLIDER!! My mother-in-law bought us this chair for Christmas, 2004.......it broke April 2005. It didn't even last 5 months! I really think the manufacturer should recall this chair. The back broke while my husband was rocking our 9 month old. Thankfully they weren't injured. The screws holding the back into the base would not screw back in and the wood split. Very dangerous chair. We were able to take it back to the store and get a store credit. Now we are struggling w/what glider to replace it with. But I will not buy another Jardine product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waist Your Time...Another Broken chair","review":"I bought this at my local BabiesRUs.

Lynch managed to make all the Dokken songs sound much, much worst than the originals. Indeed, a fantastic feat. The excellent \\"Kiss Of Death\\" became an atrocious dog of a song, it's almost unbeliavable.The singer is also extremely annoying.One of the worst Lynch related releases ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the new versions","review":"I guess I'm in the minority of people who actually like the new versions of \\"Breaking the Chains\\" and \\"Kiss of Death\\" (along with the others). Are they better than the originals? Maybe not, although they certainly sound better in terms of recording quality. But who cares? If you want to hear the original versions of these songs, they're already available. In fact, you probably already have them. Go listen!This CD is just an excuse to put out some material, but it's better than just re-recording the exact same versions as the originals (see LA Guns \\"Cocked and Re-Loaded.\\" Actually, don't.) I like the heavier guitars, the vocals done a little differently, etc. I was pleasantly surprised by this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carcass covers DOKKEN!!","review":"This album is growing on me. The basic approach Lynch took to this project was to: Remake Dokken and old Lynch Mob tunes but use a Baritone guitar (which is tuned to B I believe) and a more rough intense production style. The result? Pretty darn good! I am no fan of bands redoing their songs tuned lower than the original (Ripper era Priest anyone?) but the results of this are different because he isn't just redoing the old stuff, he's reimagining it as well. \\"Tooth and Nail\\" is probably the best of the bunch, ending up like \\"Heartwork\\" era Carcass if they had Robert Mason singing (well it is Robert Mason singing on this). The only bad songs weren't that great to begin with (She's Evil But She's Mine I've always hated). Overall, its interesting to hear this, the solos are a bit more Holdsworthy in style and the tone is killer. A good album to buy along with Lynch/Pilson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I'm a sucker for following artists when they leave the project that made them famous - I'll admit it. In the case of Dokken, I always erred on the Lynch side - the music, the tone, the RIFFS were always more important than the vocals, so I followed Mr Scary more closely.What a complete shocker this album is. It's really horrid. I can foresee that someone buying it without preconceptions or knowing the songs might find something here. Unfortunately, the majority of buyers will find themselves staring in disbeleif at the aural assault the disc represents.If you've never heard Lynch play a note, it might be okay. If you know his work - run as far as the Lynch / Pilson project release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your own songs","review":"This CD is horrible and not sure what George Lynch was thinking of when they did this.

I've always questioned alot of George's decisions since the end of Dokken, mainly the \\"Smoke This\\" album, which was just terrible. Now he's gone and destroyed and ripped to shreds some of the best songs in his career, it is just unbelieveable. Why do certain musicians feel they should try to revamp old material? Don't they know by now that nothing beats the original version. I was skeptical about this album at first from that fact alone, but I decided to give it a shot anyway, boy was I in for a nightmare! I won't knock George too hard because his other new release \\"Lynch/Pilson\\" is quite impressive, which is good because this attempt at re-recording old songs is an absolute failure and he should be put in jail for it.

This is so far removed from what is actually happening in Rick Warren's ministry, that Smith's assumptions don't hold water.Is this the fundamentalist method of spreading the Gospel? Using fear and intimidation to win followers? I don't know. Just double check the facts, and you'll uncover the truth. I don't believe the facts are in this book.

This book is from 1987, and most of the material has not been updated on the \\"westernization\\" of Thai boxing. Jab, Cross, Hook is NOT covered. The author has the habit of writing an introductory paragraph on a technique, a few lines on execution, and then a piece on fighting application. Most of the sections really should be expanded. This book has excellent pictures and background information. The summary of the training routine is excellent. You could easily set up a program with a partner using this book.

Canned Heat follows the first song and on it goes.We also have the classic rain storm but unlike Woodstock, Jay Kay did not initiate a rain chant so it kept raining.........and the band played on.

I am glad I bought it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely No Effect","review":"This product was really disappointing. I've read rave reviews for it, so I thought I'd give it a try, but it did absolutely nothing for my skin. The smell didn't bother me. (The tea tree oil smell is very strong.) However, my six year old remarked, \\"Mom! The awful smell of you!\\" after I had just put it on. So it's not the most enchanting fragrance. Some people say it really burns when you put it on, but that only happened to me after I had used an astringent first. (So be warned... DO NOT use this product after using an astringent.) That was extremely painful. It might work for some, but it did absolutely nothing to clear my skin, so I really don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells ssoooo bad!","review":"I'm currently using this all-natural product because I'm pregnant and can't use harsher acne products for my lovely hormonal breakouts.

Two hours from home in another small town they find Donor Dad and she sleeps with him, 3 weeks later she finds that it worked. A week or more she finds out Donor dad has moved to her town. And it's just downhill from there. The whole book they spend barely talking... him angry, her passive and than what do you know they are in love. This book needed a lot of help. I will not be reading the rest of the series. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is b/c I at least was able to get to the end of it.

I've recommended this to my co-workers who are now buying this phone and enjoying it as well.

However, after using the phone for a longer period of time, I felt obligated to come back and re-review...First things first -- the speakerphone is a nightmare. You can hardly understand the person on the other end. Secondly, as I stated in my other review, I am constantly hanging up inadvertantly. It's extremely annoying to me and the person I am speaking to. Not to mention incredibly unprofessional.I have to say this is not a phone I would recommend. Nothing against Uniden, of course.

I have owned several different cordless phones,including older Unidens and a Vtech with which I have NEVER had this problem. Also thought the LCD readout was faint, lame, almost completely useless. The battery held the charge well. Fortunately, I still had all the packaging, and after a full month, got a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate this phone","review":"Contrary to the other review, I HATE THIS PHONE. The clarity is terrible. Also, the two line feature on the handset is confusing. The line functions are difficult to use. Giving Uniden the benefit of the doubt, and considering the other review, perhaps I just got a bad phone. However, this is the second time that I have been disappointed with Uniden products. If you try this phone, save all the packing material so you can return it. I didn't and now I'm afraid that I'm stuck with this hunk-of-junk. The price was great for a phone with so many features.

Of course they were counting on my not returning it again. I kept the pot, used it one time to make soup and the inside bottom of the pot became horribly discolored. I will never buy another Cuisinart product. I have decided that life is too short to let go of my hard earned money to a company with poor quality products and even poorer quality control and customer service.

Who can say no to a huge stock pot that can boil, bake, or steam.. all WITHOUT adding harmful chemicals to your food?We have the Chef's Classic Set and have been adding to it over time - this 12q stockpot is a LOVELY addition.

The stainless steel, as with all of cuisinarts chef's classic line, do show spots after cooking if your water is not soft, but is easily cleaned with bar keepers friend or equivilant. This is really only seen when cooking pasta. It holds temperature well, and when used properly, has very minimal sticking. By far one of the best and most successfull features on the entire line of pots and pans is the dripless rim. When pouring out sauce, water, or whatever you may be cooking, nothing gets dripped and then burned onto the sides of the exterior. Helps to keep your pots in good condition and clean. The lid also fits the 10 skillet so makes good for being universal.

As triatlon training plans are a little more complicated to make than \\"monosport\\" training plans, this books is a very good addition to my booklist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"This is a great book for anyone who is interested in triathlon. I have one gripe however. Why can't the author, editor, and/or publisher take the time to proofread the book? Typographical errors and missing information in the training plans bug the hell out of me. In some training plans, critical workout data is missing and you must figure it out for yourself. It's not too hard to estimate the info that should be there, but you shouldn't have to do so in the first place. Other than that, it's really a good book with useful information for a tri-head of any ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly edited","review":"This book was evidently compiled from a variety of magazine articles the author had written over the years, and it doesn't look like the editor put much effort into turning the magazine articles into a book.For example, the first sprint distance training plan has codes \\"E1\\", \\"E2\\", etc. The next page says that you can find details of those codes in Chapter 25. Well, there is no Chapter 25 in the book. If it's just a typo, it's not the only one...On that same sprint distance training plan, the author mentions that some of the runs are performed in (heart rate) Zone 3. The plan doesn't include any Zone 3 runs, though.I could cite more examples, but in summary, the book is very poorly organized. If the training plans are any good (and they may well be), then maybe it's worth the effort to decode them. Otherwise, you'd probably be better off trying another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 'panacea' book","review":"I bought this book with the hope to find the 'perfect' plan for every competition need. Actually you can choose among some plans but you must be lucky to find those appropriate for you. It does not provide a way to build your custom plan. If a personalized training plan is your primary need (... as it should), it's better to rely on books as Friel's Triathlon Training Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of information","review":"I've only begun to sift through all the plans and information in this book and I already have a lot of training insight (duathlon)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, breaks almost instantly","review":"I have now broken two of these in less than 5 minutes. I am not doing anything crazy, just simple curls and shoulder shrugs. Both broke in the same area, where the strap attaches to the cord. Will just return and try another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent step-by-step guide in using Powerpoint!","review":"I was assigned this book for a Computers in education class this summer and in three weeks,I was able to provide a professional power point presentation with literally all the bells and whistles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heal your neck!","review":"Had neck pain from looking down at the laptop. This allows you to use good posture in neck and rest of spine. Easy to use and adjust. Another great feature is that it tilts the keyboard up and my cats cant walk all over it. Lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stand but Misleading","review":"Well ventilated stand and sturdy design, but the summary of the product is very misleading. They claim to include a USB hub at the top of the page, but was not included with this stand. It's no big deal, because you can always pick up a better USB hub somewhere else for less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best $20 accessory I ever bought","review":"Bought this at a local Walmart about 3 years ago and it's great. I consider it the best $20 I ever spent on a computer accessory. It lifted my 17\\" Dell Laptop screen up to a \\"regular\\" monitor height, gives me more desk space since I can use a wireless keyboard and mouse with it, and it keeps my system cool. This REALLY increased the usability and enjoyment I get from using the laptop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"After two returns I'm now done with this product. The first one I received was shipped in the box it came in (which is pretty weird to begin with) and the product was fine at first I thought. Then I set it up and realized that 1. The stand is crooked at all heights and leans to one side badly and 2. The cord organizer that was supposed to come with it was not in the package and it does not have the smaller support bar pictured. I though maybe there had just been a mistake so I settled on exchanging it for a new one. When it came in the box it was shipped in and the product box were both crushed and the stand was bent again. Once again my laptop would not sit straight on it. I;m now done with this product as as great as it seems, its just not worth the hassel anymore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Fit","review":"It simply did not hold my Lenovo laptop. The depth of the base plate was too shallow, causing the computer to just slide out and down the front of the unit. I had pre-measured prior to ordering too, so was surprised that the laptop was too high for this unit per the advertised specs. Otherwise, solidly made and probably would have fit a thinner laptop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with my ThinkPad","review":"Arrived exactly as described. Easy set up and it works great with my ThinkPad. I set it on the lowest angle to take some pressure off my wrists and raise the screen height and am pleased with the results. I am much more comfortable now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Laptop Stand","review":"The stand works as described. It's very solid given that it's basically entirely made of metal. This has been great for me as I work from a laptop but move from office to office every other week, so I've had carry the stand and throw it in my car. I work extremely long hours during the winter and dreaded being hunched over my laptop again this year. This stand has helped tremendously as it's prevented the neck pain I've had in past years from looking down all day.Shipping was surprisingly fast. I don't have Amazon Prime but the stand was delivered the same day I ordered it. Ordered in the morning and the package was waiting for me when I got home from work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I bought this stand on a $20 impulse. It is great value. In hindsight, for my personal needs, I should have bought a stand that raises the laptop up off the desk a bit and have room to put stuff (keyboard, papers, whatever) underneath. If you that is not an issue and you want good value, I would recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"This laptop stand will not hold my computer reliably. I have a Acer Aspire 7741 series laptop. The case design comes to a taper where the lid and body meet. The rolodex stand's holders> the 2 feet that actually brace the laptop on the stand, are too short! As soon as you touch the laptop, it slides right over the too short holders and onto the floor. I think some designer didn't think all aspects through. All it would take is the 2 holders to be 1/4 to 1/2 inch taller and there would be no slippage, which is what I have done. Instead of returning it, I have modified it by gluing 2 small pieces of rubber weatherstripping to the holders. This has raised the edge of the holders the required 1/2 inch needed. Rolodex>I will sell you my design mod for a reasonable fee> take the money out of said designer's salary, because he obviously isn't earning it! Anybody else needing help with their stand contact me, and I will show you how I did the mod.The rest of the stand seems to be ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolodex Laptop stand is a great addition for home office","review":"The Rolodex laptop stand is a great addition to a home office. Not only does it give a more useful position for a laptop, it provides additional cooling for the laptop. The mesh construction allows better airflow, set the desired angle for typing and viewing and the metal construction is sturdy and does not flex when you are typing. A very useful product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roledex Review for 17 inch Macbook Pro","review":"I don't have a lot of desk space so I wanted to be able to use my keyboard while elevating my monitor, this is a great solution. 17 inch macbook pro is a big computer and this works without much movement while typing which is awesome. I can hide cables under it, and there is a place where you can actually dock cables on the back. I wasn't sure how sturdy this thing would be but so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"laptop comfort","review":"I didn't realize how much stress I was putting on my back & neck until I tried using this laptop stand. It has really made a difference in my position while using my laptop and I don't feel the stress on my back & neck anymore. I enjoy the adjustable options it has."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT PURCHASE","review":"THIS IS A MUST FOR SOMEONE WHO USES A COMPUTER ALL THE TIME.

VERY HAPPY THAT I FOUND THIS ITEM ON LINE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid product","review":"I bought this after the 3M LX550 let me down, this is much more adjustable and a better looking product as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"no issues, love it, does everything i need it to do, good price and happy with the product over all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk! Unstable!","review":"While reading some reviews of this. I managed to jerk the laptop off of the stand. Just a small tug on the mouse cord sent it flying off. Or I should it fell off because the 'feet' that hold the laptop are too SMALL.It doesn't take much to teeter it off. My laptop is only a 2008 Gateway 15\\" screen so therefore it's not big! Save money and many cuss words! If I would have saved my box and receipt I would have gotten my money back long ago. Now I'm gonna just try to rigged something up to keep it on there. The only good thing about this stand is the airflow it provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it's job","review":"I needed a stand to get my laptop screen up higher when working on my desk at home. This stand is simple and works great. The stand has nice cable slots to hold the USB connections I plug / unplug everyday.Probably the only change I would make would be to install larger feet at the bottom of the tray where the laptop sits. They are a bit small for my laptop. My laptop has a dip along the front edge (which sits on the bottom of this) and the rubber part only makes contact on a few small parts of the bottom.My partner liked it so well he went and bought the same one for his house and loves it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly not for larger laptops","review":"The design seemed fine until I actually put my 17\\" laptop on it. In no position would it hold the laptop in a secure manner. It would have been so simple to alter the stand so this wouldn't be a problem -- I don't know why it was designed this way. If the \\"feet\\" at the bottom were curved / hooked, that would securely hold the laptop and make certain that the computer didn't slip. This seems to be a general defect with the design so it will be sent back to Amazon ASAP. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"It may be OK for a very small laptop but but my Toshiba Satellite A660 (15.6 inch monitor) did not fit. This stand is not sturdy at all and it was not designed for medium sized laptops.Went back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and Not Worth Buying","review":"I bought this laptop stand because of all the good reviews here but when I received this I was extremely disappointed and frustrated. This stand is very flimsy and bent almost immediately when I attempted to lock in the stand. Wobbly and not reliable, my laptop slipped off the stand twice and cannot stay put. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone who has a 17\\" laptop, perhaps a very small Mac would or iPad would be ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"laptop slides off!","review":"This does not securely hold a Dell Inspiron - thankfully mine fell on my chair instead of all the way to the floor when it slid off. Use with caution!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Lap Should Have a Top","review":"This is a very handy accessory to your laptop. I got it for my DH, and he uses it a lot, not just in his lap, but on the coffee table. It is very handy on the bed or a table if you are watching streaming videos, or something that doesn't need much interaction for you.Only negative is that the feet can scratch a table, so put a placemat or something protective under it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Laptop Stand","review":"I work from home so I needed a strong sturdy laptop stand. I use two monitors so this was perfect. This allows my laptop to be at an angle to keep it cool and also gives me different height adjustments so I can make sure this is at the same level as my other computer monitor. The wiring holder in the back is great, this helps organize all the wires.There were so many laptop stands to choose from but glad i went with this. This was sturdy and I've been using it for about 4 months now and I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice stand.","review":"This stand works great for a 15.6 inch laptop but my 17 inch Hp is a bit big for this stand. Although I am using it with my HP laptop and it does a good job having a stand that fits the laptop would be better I think. My laptop does stay cool with this stand even though there is no cooling fan and I love the adjustment heights for times when you want to dock your laptop. The metal construction is study and solid and it can take a beating and still hang in there. It is portable and light so you can carry it from place to place with the laptop and use almost anywhere. I love the stand and will be using it for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laptop does not fit on stand","review":"Even though it was advertised for Toshiba laptops, my Toshiba Satellite did not fit on the rack. Be sure tocheck the depth of your Laptop before purchasing.The stand was also delivered with missing parts. Not impressed from such a well known brand name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"I ordered this for my boss to elevate his new laptop. The only issue I had was that I had to put something under the laptop to raise it up to prevent the metal tabs from cutting into his wrists. This is not a problem with the stand, it is because his new laptop is ultra slim and I am assuming this stand is designed for the normal thicker laptop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Mac Pro 15\\"","review":"This is the ideal stand if you are looking for a cooling stand. It handles a 15\\" laptop with ease. Not to be used on your lap, but very good on a desk. Shopped around and found it at Sam's Club for $14.38 and no shipping. USB dock (optional) is also adaptable to the back of the stand, if needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"came defective twice","review":"product came defective. exchanged it and am in the process of returning second item (which I believe to be the very one I returned) because it too is defective. (legs don't go into notches evenly on both sides so stand wobbles when using laptop)"},{"rating":"1","title":"good materials, poorly constructed","review":"since the particular laptop i just ordered is known to stay exceptionally cool without the use of a cooling pad, i decided to just get something stable to put it on and keep an eye on the temperature without active cooling.this would have been perfect for passive heat dissipation, but when i opened the box i discovered it is poorly constructed. you can see the metal hinge that supports the top platform in the picture; that hinge slides into one of several pairs of grooves on the back of the platform. the metal bits with the grooves are soldered on, but with the stand i received, one was soldered about a half an inch lower than the other. i can fit the stand into a pair of grooves, but the whole thing is unstable as a result of the asymmetry.perhaps someone who is handier than i could correct this, or perhaps other customers receive better made stands. this one, however, is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I should have returned this as soon as I opened the box. Because when I pulled the package out of the box it was shipped in the box inside had been pretty trashed. But I figured nothing was actually missing so I'll give it a shot. The stand itself isn't a failure but if I was shopping again for a laptop stand I definitely wouldn't get this one. My biggest complaint is probably that the biggest reason I bought this stand was because of how other people raved about the cord keeper. It's a very simple design with a piece of rubber that slides into some slots on the back of the stand.... and doesn't stay there. The piece slides around/comes off way too easily and frankly is probably more trouble than it is worth. So if you like this stand because it has several height options, you might be happy with it. If you love the idea of a cord keeper on the stand, you, like myself, are probably going to be greatly disappointed by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold my laptop securely","review":"The product was flimsy and my laptop fell out of the stand every time I bumped my desk. I returned the item and would not recommend this laptop stand to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very sturdy","review":"The first one needed replacement because of missing parts, so I could not tell how was it. When I finally got the one that works, I found that the construction is rather wobbly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid, but no included USB hub as stated in the description","review":"Solid stand, but was disappointed that the USB hub was not included. Will not purchase again because of this deception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Addition to My Workspace","review":"This is a STURDY metal laptop stand. The mesh provides excellent cooling capabilities. As described, it has several settings and adjusts from 12 to 36 degrees. I was slightly concerned about it being made of metal, but found that there are four pads on the underside of it to prevent scratches to your desktop. There are two similar pads on the top, which provides a soft bumper for your laptop. However I purchased some clear self-adhesive silicone \\"polybumpers\\" to provide a little more protection (http://www.polybumper.com/products/). I have a 17\\" MacBook Pro and it fits nicely on this stand. The stand sits firmly on the desk unless you want to move it, and the laptop fits snugly in the stand.This is not a \\"lap\\" stand in my opinion. I use a \\"Lapinator\\" for when I want to use my laptop on the couch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adjustable table stand","review":"Excellent solid stand with great breathable mesh bottom. Elevates the laptop so that air can pass around it. Has adjustable settings so that you can set the height to one of 4 different settings. The shelf on the inside can be used to hold a low profile hard drive, external DVD drive or other accessories. It also has cable management system to hold any cables that need to be attached. It has removable modules that can be added at additional cost.Would have been 5 stars if it had a way to hold lock a setting in place for the height of the stand. Great product. Great construction. Great price. Go get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Exactly what I was looking for. Can elevate your laptop several inches as needed. Helps prevent overheating for the laptop.

I like it the only thing i don't like about it is the stuff that hold the laptop in place block the place where you put your headphone in. It bad and bother me alot. If you head phone jack on the side of the computer then it wonderfull. wish the maker who made it change the design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome stand","review":"I really like the fact that my computer's front controls are still accessible. The adjustable height is very convenient. What I really like is that a Bluetooth keyboard slides under the stand so you can get it out of your way. Also, my place looks like NASA. Lol. On a kitchen table, you can watch some DVD's or news programs on the laptop. It makes it easy to move the computer around without marring the table or rubbing out the grips and the bottom of the laptop. I don't understand why anyone needs to spend more on these. This does the job, looks great and at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold laptop securely at steeper inclines...","review":"Most laptops have beveled bottoms and the holding arms of this stand do not extend far enough out to keep the laptop secured at steeper inclines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talking about Christ across the table or across the world","review":"\\"Can We Talk\\" reminds us that sharing our faith in Jesus Christ continually seeks relevance.

Either the manufacturer changed something or the other reviewers didn't have it fitted properly on their phone, and i don't see how that is possible.

In a backpacking book I expect some description of water availability from streams, lakes, etc. In this book the authors only describe whether or not public water is available at campsites.

I started writing this review while watching it thinking this was a good thriller/horror film. I liked it a lot ready to give it 4 stars until the movie just ended without any conclusion like it just stopped. The film ended unfinished in my opinion all they needed was like 5 minutes to give it an ending. Basically in the end when you are expecting everyone to be caught or get away who lives or dies the screen went black 15 seconds later the words start coming.

Whatever I write will not prepare you for the visual horror that awaits the hapless buyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie bad features","review":"The content is great! I can see Argentinians away from home appreciating the movie just by its images. Although the richness of the images cannot be very well appreciated because the subtitles cannot be turned off.

I really like a number of their tracks that clearly standout on this one. The overall recording sounds much better than the last. Still, I don't think this album outdoes some of their finest (and earlier) work such as the self-titled album or the classic Maniacal Laughter. As a Philly native, the Souls never cease to amaze me every time they come through town or whenever they put out their latest line of work. You've got to give these boys props- they know how to rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting better with every listen.","review":"I love the Souls, but I can't give The Gold Album 5 stars. It just doesn't have the depth that Anchors Away or earlier albums have. For the most part the album is solid, but there are a few songs that just don't do it for me, they just don't have that pull. Still it is an album worthy of your money.

That results in a much faster and better experience. Directions for copying the maps to your hard drive are on the Topo web site. Some reviewers do not realize that.The digital maps are an extremely good value compared to paper maps!! Live Map Updates is a feature of version 4. You can download the current maps and street overlays for the quads you are interested in! And that is free.I have used versions 2, 3, and 4 of this product. Version 2 was excellent. Versions 3 and 4 are incremental improvements. On Amazon, it isn't always clear which version you are buying. Go by the dates -- version 4 was released in 2006.The software is excellent. My only complaint is that it is a bit complicated to install. I don't think it has ever crashed on me. I use it a lot, and discover new features all the time. It is not hard to learn. GPS support is great, in my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"Sadly the maps included in the TOPO! state series are NOT the same as the Trails Illustrated maps also sold by National Geographic. I have no idea why, but the TOPO! state series maps do not include trails on them like their TI maps. I'm told that the National Park versions do include trails on them, but only inside the parks.This might be ok if all you need are topos showing roadways or are willing to trust GPS plots that you download from the Internet, but this package is not very useful otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky interface, poor scans","review":"The interface is difficult to use, the maps are poorly scanned, and the icons and animations are very amateurish.

It is stainless steel. Not a huge big deal but I feel it was misleading. Looks like a nice pan. I haven't used it yet but was surprised it was not glass. I did see a review that said it was not glass so I wondered, but I thought maybe they were commenting on the wrong product. Probably not a great deal at $50-some but I think it will be worth the price and not having to go out and shop for it in person made it worth buying for me with a 4 month old baby.Update: This is a really heavy pan and although it has a side handle, it's still really hard for me to drain fat from it b/c of its weight. It really hurts my wrists a lot and I'm not a small girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Pan","review":"The package came in with its original box, no other boxes outside. I'm kinda scared that there will be any damage on my pan because of the light packaging. But when I open it, it's the nice shining pan without any scratch, dent, excellent looking. I have other cuisinart stainless steel pan too. Just love this brand. The only thing with this saute pan is that I wish the lid is made of glass so that I can see through it.

Highly recommended.Thumb up."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All Clad Person Loves This Pan!","review":"Over the years, I have collected a few All Clad pieces on sale, and, of course, they are very good pans. BUT this Cuisinart saute pan is an excellent value and I'm enjoying using it several times a week. It's a great size for stir fries, browning meats, tossing pastas with sauces, etc. It heats up quickly and uniformly and it cleans easily. It has higher sides than most skillets, which means that it doesn't splatter out onto the stove and create an additional cleaning chore. I definitely prefer it to my older Calphalon non-stick skillets. This would be a great buy for for someone setting up a kitchen or for an experienced cook who wants something new, fun, and practical to use everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice braise and seer.","review":"I got my 5.5 saute pan form Amazon cleaned it and put it to work.

I usally get very upset when my food doesn't come out the way I want it to especially do to the pans under performance. With this pan I didn't need as many step and use fewer pans being that it goes in the oven and you can wisk in it. I didn't have to heat the pan up very long to get it to seer the food. Nothing burned not even the spices that fall off the meat.The cheese didn't stick. It cleaned up very easily.I just don't care for the non see through top. For sauting you need that. lucky me I have one that fits...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent large pan","review":"I bought this pan because I wanted one that was large enough to cook a 6 person meal. This does the job. I've just used it once, to make chicken piccata and am very happy. Chicken browned wonderfully. Clean up was a breeze. I did burn the onions and garlic a bit when I was sauteing. Later read the instructions which clearly warned against using this pan on med-high to high heat because it gets especially hot and can burn thinly sliced onions. I do not find the pan particularly heavy and the extra handle made it quite easy to move around.

The handle came loose at the rivets and, with a lifetime warranty, I returned the piece to Cuisinart (owned by Conair)in New Jersey. You will pay to ship the piece to and from depending on where you live which can be $20-30 due to the weight and size.The note that came back with my new replacement said that \\"We strongly recommend low to medium heat be used on all Cuisinart cookware.\\"I was very surprised that 375-400 was not low to medium.

Our old pan was scraped and I was afraid we were poisoning ourselves with flakes of non-stick chemicals. This stainless steel pan works great - we have the 5-1/2 quart size. It's very high quality. The handle is long which is nice for cooking and when carrying the pan when it is full. It might make washing up a little harder unless you have a wide sink like we do. But I highly recommend this pan and lid! Epecially for about 50 bucks. What a deal"},{"rating":"1","title":"Twice Defective","review":"Purchased this pan as a gift for my wife. The first one split at the rim after only two or three uses. Cuisinart replaced it (we had to pay shipping) with a new one which subsequently suffered a delaminated bottom, bulging both into and outside of the pan. Understand that we are careful with our cookware, do not overheat them, etc., and don't even put the pans in the dishwasher. Cuisinart said they would replace again (as long as we pay the shipping.) Amazon said they would refund 50% of the cost. This is the last Cuisinart we will purchase. For a pan that lists for something like $150, it should perform much better. I will spend in that range and buy Le Creuset from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pan","review":"Great pan with a great price. It's heavy, but has a small handle (as well as the long handle)to help carry it. My only complaint is that Amazon put a shipping label on the Cuisinart box and the box arrive damaged. It has a few minor scratches on the small handle, but still usable. I read a review where this happened to someone else. I thought it was fluke and decided to order it anyway. Well, it did happen to me, just a caveat when ordering this pan from Amazon. It may come to you damaged as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice and HUGE pan!","review":"This pan is great! Not only is it nice and heavy and of great quality, but it is HUGE! Whenever company comes over or I am going to cook enough to have leftovers, I always pull out this pan. It is so massive that it sometimes makes it difficult to cook with the burner directly behind it. It is also very beautiful to look at.I have had problems with sticking a couple times, but I think that was mostly due to operator error. The item I have is not quite the same as pictured, even though this is the one I ordered, so I was a bit confused when I got it, but I thought \\"oh, what the heck!\\" The pan is stainless throughout (it appears to be non stick in the photograph) and has a stainless cover (I thought it looked like it had a clear cover on the photograph, but after taking a closer look I realized I was mistaken).I would buy this pan again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite pan","review":"I adore this saute pan.

He makes fun addictive, pop that is smart but not self-indulgent, complex but not complicated, and generally better than all those sad sacks and neutered punks on your MTV. It's tight four-piece rock with some synths here and there, and gleefully depressing lyrics (just look at the song titles) dished out in Frank's distinctive, articulately barbed voice. This album is his most immediately accessible - both the recent 'world's best ex-boyfriend' and the earlier 'mr. fancypants' are little more jagged and, in the case of the former, a bit downtempo. But don't worry, you'll buy them once you've listened through this album and find yourself needing to know more about this embarassingly clever songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whiter Teeth!","review":"I tried a sample size tube of this toothpaste. I love the taste. It's different but very refreshing. I've noticed after a few uses my teeth were becoming whiter. This toothpaste makes your teeth feel really clean and smooth. One of the best things I like about this toothpaste is that it does not foam a lot. I was relieved to find a toothpaste that didn't foam a lot because the foam from other toothpastes would make me nauseous. My dentist told me that a lot of people get nauseous from toothpaste foam. If you're one of those people then you might want to try this toothpaste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I got this toothpaste in the home remedy kit. I was a little concerned about what it would taste like and how well it would clean my teeth. Well, I have only used it once so far (I just got the kit yesterday), but I already love it. I have been using whitening pastes for some time and haven't seen any changes. My teeth were noticably whiter after just one use of the Lavender Mint paste. The flavor was quite different, but it was not unpleasant and it left my mouth feeling fresh. It does take a little more of this paste to do the job than of regular pastes. So far, I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a natural alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"I thought this book was very relisictic, because it dealt with everyday issues like physical apperence and being precived by you peers.

She's in a hospital because she broke her leg rollerblading and it didn't heal right. She meets Kyle a boy left blind after a chemical explosion.

However, if you are more into some more exciting, tenser, or simply darker music (be it jazz or not), and if you have a hard time listening to things that lean towards sentimentality, this is not an album for you.There is quite a difference between the first and second half of the album though. Rollins seems to want to make sure to attract the attention of hardbop adapts on the first track, and go for some latin on track two. Apart from that, the album consists of ballads mostly, which are actually not bad and have decent solos. The only exciting track, if you ask me, is the title song. Considering the electronic bass and guitar, the basis of the music invites for a relaxing listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PLEASING BY SONNY","review":"THE SAXAPHONE OF SONNY ROLLINS IS THE BEST THAT IS ON THE USA SIDE OF THE PLANET."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underground Action Flic kicks","review":"I randomly got a hold of this juicy film, and was happy that I did.

Instead, I watched a disturbing, yet riveting film about a consumate hitman searching for someone to follow in his footsteps. The ghost-like assassin tests the man he has chosen as replacement. Unknowing and unwilling, the replacement tries desperately to foil him and protect his love-interest and friends. The assassin kills them all to \\"free\\" the \\"prodigy\\" of the things that would hold him back from his destiny.There are no silly car chases or unrealistic shootouts. It is the tale of a sadistic, yet cerebral killer playing a deadly game with another human being to make the younger man worthy of becoming his replacement.This was certainly *not* my kind of movie.

The same thing happened the first time we boiled water for rice in a sauce pan. We intend to contact Cuisinart about this, but hold out little hope. The limited warranty seems to be truely limited, plus they want $7.00 for handling. May just pack it all up and return it to Amazon.

Cuisinart wants $15 to look at them to be evaluated for a replacement. So, three pitted pots in less than a year. Definitely not acceptable for a set that is supposed to retail for about $400. Also, all Cuisinart products are made in China.

I do still use a large non stick pan for eggs, but I have cooked everything else in these pans, including an entire Thanksgiving meal. LOVE these pans! I have had no problems with clean up - just use a little common sense and soak them right away. I do follow the instruction book's recommendation to not use \\"high\\" heat on a gas burner (that could damage the surface) but these conduct heat so well that I still boil water faster than I did with the non stick pans.

There is no way to prevent burning, sticking, and wasting one serving every time you cook. And then you waste more time using the polish to get the burned stuff off the pans so you can do the same thing again tomorrow.If you look closely, you'll notice the bottom of the pan has a seam. That's apparently the circular range you're supposed to cook in. If you go outside of that seam (like up the edges of the pan), then the temperature of the cooking surface drastically changes, and, well, more stickage!Summary:Pretty.Useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stain easily and hard to clean","review":"These stain very easily and are very hard to clean.

I used to own a set of this stuff, and was generally pleased with it until the handle on one of the pans came loose after a little over a year of gentle use. If you think this will last as long as your mom's old Revereware, you're out of your mind. I'd rather own a set of battered but solid old pans than cheap junk like this. If you can't afford good stuff (think All-Clad or Calaphon), save your money and look for a bargain on Craigslist."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cookware","review":"I have now used all of the items in the set.

The saute and sauce pans work fine and are good looking. The frying pans - we use a gas range and cannot get the heat low enough not to burn and stick. Doesn't matter what we do, eggs stick and burn, sauteed peppers end up cinders, bacon sticks, and on and on. Of course I bought them to surprise my wife, and of course she had preferred to have some input. Guess who is the goat. So it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this cookware!","review":"If I had known how great stainless steel could be, I would have replaced my old set a LONG time ago! Workmanship is great, heats evenly, food even tastes better! I even use a lower temperature with this set because it holds the heat so well. It cleans up great. Even stuck on barbeque sauce.

I've been using it for about a month now and really like it. What led me to search for stainless cookware was my research on the potential health risks of teflon or non-stick cookware. I find myself wanting to cook more since the cookware is so nice to use. The only short-coming I can see with this set is that it does not have a large skillet but this could be purchased in addition to the set and you would still have gotten a super deal!

It's decent for a family of 4. One of my pots are already stained brown and I cant seem to get it out.I can't believe that more people haven't complained about the handles. Since its stainless steel throughout some heat does transfer to the handles. Just to be safe I wear oven mitts or use a cloth every time I handle then after cooking. Being that the handles are so small it's very hard to pour your food onto a plate. Even with your bare hands you'd have to hold it a specific way to maneuver the pan. The up and down movement is fine, but tilting and rotating gets frustrating.They are pretty. Buy these to hang and decorate your kitchen with.

I almost hate to use them, they're wonderful. They're very sturdy and the handles are shaped so that they're easy to handle. They've a nice thick base and the lids make a good seal to the pan.

I am very health conscious, so I knew I did not want anything nonstick, and wanted a good set that I would enjoy using.I asked for these for Christmas, and got them. At first thought, I almost didn't want to use them. They are gorgeous. I knew that after one use they wouldn't have the beautiful shine on the bottom ever again. But that's not important.They heat up very quickly and hold heat. I haven't had too much issues with food sticking unless it was the occasional \\"I'm in a rush and don't want to wait for it to warm up.\\" You can go ahead and spend $1000 or more on All-Clads, but these get the job done.

They're awful. So awful, I can't even imagine burdening someone else with them. Everything sticks in them even when I cook on a low setting of 3. I can't even make hashbrown or fried potatoes anymore. All they do is stick and what's left is mushy potatoes and a burnt potato crust on the pan. Don't even try to cook eggs in it either, unless you have a lot of elbow grease to clean the pan afterwards.

Usually I am a good cook and the set works perfectly. My only complaint is that the smallest frying pan is just off weight/balance wise but you can't tell if there is something in it. Every once in a while I burn or over cook something, it usually cleans up really easily. However, one time I walked a way to answer the phone, came back and I could have sworn my pan would have been ruined forever. I cleaned it well, and used some stainless polish on what wouldn't soak/scrub off. Now it looks as good as new, mirror finish and all.

The cookware set was beautiful and I was excited to try it. Unfortunately the first dish I cooked was eggs & hashbrowns and even though I followed all of the suggestions (warm the pan, add some oil, etc..) I found it very difficult to cook. Everything stuck to the bottom and it was very difficult to clean- even though I followed the directions and soaked it right away.

I am going to sell this set and go back to my non-stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't cuisinart quality","review":"The sides and lids are very thin metal.

They are a good weight and have the nice rivets in the handles which by the way really do stay cool to the touch. These pans are also very easy to clean. Just add some warm soapy water and you are ready to clean after the meal is over. I love this set so much that I bought all of the matching pans so I could have all the sizes that I needed.

Everything burns when I use them especially the frypans / skillets burns stuff right away. They are very hard to clean (believe me I tried).

Again, you learn from some trial and error, but we have gotten it down pretty well. We have since purchased additional pieces. Only problem, my wife put on veggies to steam...forgot to add water!

You may be able to saute some veggies in oil, but forget browning potatoes (they will end up mashed), and don't even try eggs... they are a disaster. I don't want to be an \\"artist\\", I just want some hot food that I don't have to chisel off the bottom of my pots and pans.Even if you are merely boiling water for mac-n-cheese with the small pots, you better be stirring CONSTANTLY. The noodles in contact with the bottom of the pot will stick fast.There is a reason Teflon was invented. If you like to chisel food off the bottom of your pans when cooking or washing, get these.

We own a relatively low BTU stove (it's no Wolf, that's for sure) and was operating the pan well within the manufacturers recommend temperature range. I have contacted Cuisinart/Conair to replace both the skillet in question and the 2 other skillets in the set (I simply cannot take the risk of it happening again) but they are unwilling to do so. They have been pretty adamant about getting the defective pan back before making a determination as to whether or not they will replace one or all of the skillets. Sounds very suspect to me.

So, I went with this set because of the price and it didn't have a lot of sizes and rave reviews!. I couldn't be MORE disappointed. The stockpot pitted the 1st time I used it. The skillet has a permanent burn on the side. Obvioulsy it is not non-stick, but rather everything sticks. I hate them, and that is strong for me. I have worked in restaurants and love to cook.

My other pans were made in the good old USA out of REAL stainless that didn't pit, discolor, or look crumby after 30 years of hard use. With this set, the first time I fried up some potato pancakes in the small fry pan, the bottom discolored.

My boyfriend likes my few pieces, so I bought him this set for Christmas, since we both love to cook.

Although it was cheap, I thought it wouldn't be that bad since it was Cuisnart. Boy, was I wrong. I was sauteing some chicken and practically ruined my satue pan. The pans can't handle high heat, which is the reason why you'd buy a stainless steel cookware. If I could go back, I'd go back and pay a bit more for a higher quality cookware.

The pots and pans I got from Ikea for less than $20 are much better when it comes to things getting stuck and getting burnt.

Men are portrayed as perverts, thieves and pimps; women are righteous prudes. A woman is _shocked_ that a man wants to be sexually dominated during phone sex, the police antics are completely unbelievable, and the plot is silly.

Unfortunately, the hype leads you to believe that there will be a lot more of the moaning and sighing than there is.There's lots of kvetching though. Julia is a poor little pampered professional wife, with nothing more on her mind than her boredom with hubby, her hots for two different guys in her life, her phone sex research, and the mean old building that will soon block out her precious orchids' sunlight.The most annoying thing of all is that midway through this book, it switches gears into an attempt at a suspense thriller, when Julia starts getting super-creepy calls and the police won't take her seriously. Cuz, you know, BAD THINGS always happen to naughty girls who do things like talk dirty on the phone.This book wants to be new and naughty but it ends up being tired and trite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"Lip Service is a very interesting book.

In addition to the silicone case cover, the accessories that come with it (arm/wrist strap, belt loop, clip connector and other stuff) are way cool and helpful. I use one belt loop for my belt (imagine that!) for daily walking and hiking. The second one I backed with velcro and stick to the dashes of three cars I operate regularly (sic .. my ride, my wife's car and my work truck); that and a DC charger/FM transmitter add-on make using in \\"on-the-road\\" easy.

The only negative was that the arm band that came with it was sewn together backwards, so it is not able to be used.

Last night, I cooked fish for fish tacos in the skillet and clean up was actually quite easy.

Well, maybe that's an exaggeration but I would surely recommend this set to anyone looking to set up or renew their kitchen.

Cuisinart, a mainstay in the kitchen offers the cook in the household this wonderful 7 piece cookware set and Amazon.com offers it at an exceptional price.The set features 18-10 Stainless Steel construction that makes each piece feel substantial. The design also aids in convection and, thus, requires less heat from the stove top but that Heat is not transferred to the handle making the handle cool to the touch.Each piece features a high shine and bears the brand name on the side. Each piece is also rated up to 550 degrees which means it could double as bakeware.The only thing I would have liked would have been a 12 inch rather than a 10 inch skillet but with that said, the 10 inch skillet is a great piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as All Clad without the price","review":"This is a great cookware set and a great value.

I previously purchased two pans to have a look at how well they performed, and I was more than happy with the quality and performance I received from this product. So it was not a great leap for me to go ahead and purchase the 7-piece set. The performance and quality are superior. Do not be fooled into thinking that the low price means poor quality, quite the opposite. I cannot recommend this product enough, the cook well, maintain an even heat, and clean up and maintenance are superior.

However, acidic foods such as tomatoes and wine give food a metallic taste when cooked in iron. Since cast iron is non-stick I was looking for another set of cookware to use when iron wouldn't. This set is not non stick, but if you enjoy making sauces and gravies from the \\"yum-yum's\\" left in the pan then you will love it. I've had the set for a few months, they're easy to clean if you follow the manufacturers instructions. Even if something sticks it doesn't remind me of painfully scrubbing my mothers less expensive stainless set. Soak the pan while you eat and it will clean up very easily afterward. I've also used a scrub sponge (green on one side) occasionally, but they have never left any scratches behind. Double bonus in my book is that it is dishwasher safe as well. Just don't use any citrus detergents...per the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falsely advertized","review":"When I received this Cuisinart 77-7 cookware I notice that the term 18/10 stainless was not imprinted any where on either the product or the accompanying enclosures. I called Cuisinart twice and talked to Richard and Tiaira and both of them said if the pot or pan is not stamped 18/10 stainless it is not made of 18/10 stainless. An Amazon customer service agent referred me to Susanne the Amazon customer service Supervisor; she said that since I ordered the pans from a third party, I would have to go through the third party to get my money back. I explained to her that I have been an Amazon customer for years and all I was trying to do today is let Amazon know that they are falsely advertising this product. She was no help at all and told me to contact Cuisinart again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cookware ever!","review":"Be aware. After first use, the pot showed some dark spots that couldn't be removed.

Will never buy cuisnart again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my purposes","review":"I've had this set of cookware a few weeks now. I have been looking for a set without glass lids, and this one was perfect! It has taken a little getting used to, but I'm loving it! It heats up quite a bit faster than my old non-stick. The bottom of my large kettle has discolored a little as mentioned in other reviews, but after years of dealing with scratched non-stick, I don't care as long as they're clean! Today I forgot how fast this heats up and boiled a pot dry. Peas blackened and stuck to the bottom. I was afraid I would never get it clean, but I found this tip I thought others not used to cooking with stainless might be able to use. Boil 1/2 vinegar 1/2 water in the pan about 10 min. Then use a plastic spatula to scrape it out. Worked great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I've been using this set for about 5 months now and am completely satisfied with it. My needs are simple: 1) how well does it heat up, and 2) how easy is it to clean. They heat up quickly and evenly, and clean-up is very easy...virtually nothing sticks! I always let the pots soak for a little while before I wash them by hand. The only thing that actually took some scrubbing was scrambled eggs. They look very nice, too.

Then I tried all other 3, they all came the same with a lot of white dots on the bottom. I called Amazon.com customer service. They told me this set was defective product and would ship me a new set for replacement. It took me about one hour to get straight out. And I also need to spend time on returning. It's a waste of my precious time, but Amazon does not have any policy to reimburse me anything for the wasted time.

Have been using it for two weeks now, so far it does what it should, nothing is sticking but I've been (too) careful about using high heat based on the other reviews, and always used some oil.

What's even stranger is that I feel if I were to spend an inordinate amount of time reviewing this book, I probably would be giving an even greater effort than these authors gave in writing it. The simplistic dialogue, generalistic characterizations, and bland portrayals of all characters (not just the main ones) left any reader entirely unfulfilled.

His 3.5 year old brother is out with dad doing some errand, and when he comes home, I am sure he is going to be THRILLED with this toy. This is the kind of brainteaser that I am confident is perfect for his age, a great \\"quiet time\\" toy. I think this set will be good for him through 4 years old. Then I'll get the more advanced version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"My son absolutely enjoys learning with Mr. Mighty Mind. He becomes more confident with each puzzle and looks forward to building new pictures. I recommend this product for fun and educational value. A great gift for children ages 3+!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed bag","review":"Though I like the idea of the toy, there are couple of reasons I didn't like this as much as I though I would:1. From the photos it appears that the figures are like kid's jigsaw puzzles where the border is raised so that kids can easily fit the pieces without the pieces moving. But only two figures are like that. The rest are just pieces of thick paper with figures printed. So no real value for money and makes me think that the packaging is a marketing poly that makes customers think all puzzles are of the same type.2. The puzzles range from just joining two half circles to form a circle (which I think a 2 or 2.5 yr old could do) to fairly complex ones probably more appropriate for a 5-6 year olds. Unless you are buying it for a 2-3 year old and plan to use it for 3 years or so you will 'waste' part of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, however flawed","review":"The concept for the toy is god however, the reality is quite different.....the main flaw is that the small plastic shapes are hard to keep still when placed on the small card. When my child plays with card, it tends to slide around and the small plastic shapes have little weight and are hard to place. She will put in the shape outline and as soon as she takes her fingers off it moves out of the outline. It moves even more when placing the next peice as well.Buy Block Buddies by MIndWare....I purchased both at the same time. Block buddies was a few dollars cheaper and much better. The shapes are made from wood and overall learning method is similar. The shapes are easier to manipulate and stay in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy - needs to be magnatized","review":"We absolutely love this toy. In fact, after purchasing our first Mighty Mind toy, I went back and purchased additional tiles as well as the Supermind product. Also, I went to the craft store and bought magnetic 11 x 17\\" white boards, adhesive magnet strips, and a tin container to store all of the tiles. The tiles slide around a lot on the pages otherwise. Now after these few adjustments, my kids (3 and 5) just love playing with it and I love that it gets their brains going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Exercise for a Child's Mind","review":"I cannot say enough about these. My daughter's been playing with Mighty Minds since age 2 and we're on our second set as she lost a bunch of the pieces. It's a game you can play together and has increasing levels of difficulty. It's great to see you child's progress and develop her spatial conceptualization. I can see how this will help her with math and geometry, but also with drawing and imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comments on Mighty Mind","review":"Mighty Mind is an excellent toy.

It's really incredibly how quickly kids pick this up and get into this. The educational value of learning shapes, angles, and how to get pieces to fit together is incredible, and there are plenty of templates to go the distance. I'm looking forward to bringing this along on our next plane trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible","review":"The marketing of this book seems aimed at people interested in science, but seems written for a close group of colleagues who can keep up with the high-end philosophy, which makes the writing incomprehensible to anyone outside of the circle.

However, the software is buggy and causes my Tungsten E2 to crash a lot. If you try to get support, they repeatedly tell you to hard reset the Palm and install the Wi-Fi card before anything else. I did so 3 times, trying also to identify which other software was responsible for the crashes. It was still the Wi-Fi driver. And the support refuses to hear about that and repeat their useless advice. By now, PalmOne could issue a new version of the software since many users do complain.My suggestion: keep away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a PC-surfing surrogate","review":"While the convenience of getting wifi on your Palm is attractive and useful, consider a few things about this card:- it is hard to store since it has irregular dimensions and is longer than a typical SD card- it's range is only about 50 feet open air/25 feet obstructed- battery life is poor (20 minutes continuous use)- you have to eject your normal card, pop this in, store you old card, etc..... every time you want to use it- it causes my Zire 72 to crash about every 6th use, but the resets are quick (just annoying)- it's slow compared to a typical wifi connection- not everything online will transfer (pop ups, java, video)- you don't have the benefit of the expanded RAM of your normal SD card, so you have to allow space on your Palm pilot's built in RAM to cache your online dataIf I had to do it all over again, I'd get a Palm T|x with built in wifi, greater internal capacity, and larger screen.

In my case, I paired it with a Tungsten T3. Although I was able to connect to the web easily, the power consumption was so great that I had to turn off my Palm device within 10 minutes. If you want to use your palm as a notebook replacement, wireless internet is not an option. If you use it while charging, it might work. This will, of course, reduce its portability. If you want Wi-Fi on a Palm, my advice would be to get a Palm with WiFi already integrated; e.g., Palm TX. There is a separate power source for WiFi which allows wireless web access without the power consumption problems plagued by this add-on card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Deal","review":"The WiFi card was advertised as being easy to install with a companion CD.

Their website offers little information (they say to do a hard reset - thanks for the great tip!), and their support line is no better.

I also realized that those reviewing for the dust jacket must have been the Author's drinking buddies.

The book takes more philosophical approach and fulfills a purposeful debate about the existence of God.

It is not written to be just a systematic 12 step program or a review of treatment options. There are personal stories (including the author's) that are poignant and real.

The book does not model the most basic, well known, and successful recovery model - the 12 step program. Mr. Shulman is writing from first person perspective.

Most people do not seek help when they are stealing unless the courts have told them to because they are so ashamed of their actions. I began therapy on my own because I realized that I did have a problem. I was hopeful this book would provide new insight and therapeutic details, both individual therapy that works and pharmaceutical therapy that works or shows promise but the book did not give any new insight. I am still searching for help with the problem I have.

Because I have a daughter with a shopping and shoplifting problem I thought this book would provide me with some help in understanding the dynamics surrounding the behavior from a mental health perspective. I should have looked closer at the book and realized that it is a personal story and not a self-help book. The points provided in the book are repeated over and over and there is just alot of \\"fluff\\" in the book. I expected more indepth information on studies, hopeful treatments, legal standpoints, intensive treatment options, etc. the book did not address any of this. It barely scratched the surface of addressing questions and concers about the acts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 12-step program in any sense...","review":"I recieved a rather nasty e-mail from a supporter of Mr. Shulman deriding my review of this book. I returned to check my words to see if I had shared any untruths or poison, but my first review seems to have been deleted! I wrote to Mr. Shulman as a member of a recovery program and asked if his program was similar (the 12-step method), he recommended his book. Upon recieving it I read first thru the chapter on the 12-steps and found that he (the author) dismisses the method, the spiritual aspect,and the informal meetings with no professional class.

Terrence Shulmans book reveals the underlying reasons that \\"petty-theft\\" can no longer be dismissed as a harmless blemish on society. Shoplifting is surrounded by misconceptions that not only underestimate its magnitude but contribute to the lack of serious attempts to view it as a problem. It is harmful at an individual and social level. As a recovering shoplifter Mr. Shulman has a genuine understanding of the inner psychological dynamics of the often addictive behavior. \\"Something for Nothing\\" doesn't sugar coat this type of theft, but offers a means by which those who wish to change can navigate their way out of the maze of their compulsion. As a treatment provider with over ten years of working with shoplifting offenders, I highly recommend his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paula Pandamonia","review":"This is a very short book for the price and it doesn't give much information. There are other books out there that are much better and informative. Treatment with several antidepressant and other medications show promise and no information on this aspect is given in this book. A combination of professional therapy by a psychiatrist or psychologist who had medical training and can support all needs should be found by anyone suffering with any impulse control disorder.

He says that in his opinion the urges to take items that don't belong are as strong as any other addiction a person can have, to drugs, alcohol, work. Even though he tries to get the world to buy into his philosophy that this is an addiction, it will never happen. The court system, the stores who lose millions, and almost every person alive who has never stolen in their life won't care why a person steal, only that it is a criminal activity and illegal. Even if these people need help, the general public doesn't get it. A commandment says it is wrong, so it is wrong. A commandment doesn't say drinking or drugs or work is wrong.

Set around the time of WWI in the Canadian timber forests, the main character is an 18-year-old logger whose temper gets him booted out of the logging camp and into finishing high school. While that premise is sound--it's always a good idea to complete your education--the book is heavy-handed and frankly uninteresting. Plot is contrived, female characters flat (males not much better) and you almost wish the \\"crown fire\\" (an overwhelming blaze that sweeps through the forest by jumping from crown to crown, i.e. from the top of one tree to the top of another), would end up victorious--at least you'd be put out your misery 40 pages sooner.

It starts to hurt my hand after a few minutes.3 - Fast-forwarding is sloooooow.

Usually about 3 songs, it seems.I sent it back already once. The customer service line is NOT toll free and they take forever to answer it. They took a month to get me another one, and the second one came with the cheapest, worst headphones ever made. The first one had great headphones. Then the second Lyra broke just like the first one.

The carrying bag has dirt/grass over it. The tent was folded nicely in a box to fool me to think that it was new but once I opened up the tent, I notice that the tent has probably been used many times. I guess it was a customer-returned item before. I am a regular customer of Amazon.

A couple of reviewers said that the Dewalt was a better choice, as it would recycle the batteries. For five dollars more, it may be a better choice, but this one will work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the standard charger","review":"I almost bought a standard replacement charger but then I read a review about how bad they are and it recommended this charger.

I confirm that it works with 12 Volt battery for B&D Drill and can be used instead of PS160 that came with the set and was recently burned. The charging process was as the following: after 15 minutes charging the lamp stopped blinking and I tried my drill. It looked like the battery had been charged for about 30%. I put the battery back into charger and the lamp started blinking again. That process was repeated 3 times. So it means that to fully charge the battery you have to put it into charger and pull it back 3-4 times.

If you can get past the strangely different set up and really like a lot of coffee quickly, I guess it sounds like a good idea. You end up having one tank full of water constantly heating, while adding cold water in the amount of coffee you want to brew (the added water then replaces the hot water used for brewing). Well, six months later, at one pot per day, it died a sudden death at 6 am in the morning. When dumping the very heavy water from the machine, clear crystal stuff came out as well. Not happy about the six month life span, constant heating of water, and who knows what the crystal stuff was.

One would think that the \\"quick brew\\" feature would mean the coffee would be nice and hot -- where the heating element is always on keeping the water hot, but that has not been our experience. I have to put the cup in the microwave to warm it up. It also isn't really any faster than other machines we've had where you just pour in the water and start the cycle. The taste of the coffee is OK, but we have had other machines that overall were better.

The promise of speed really attracted me to this model and I thought for $20 I'd try it out. This is a huge appliance that took up a lot of counter space and as another reviewer mentioned there are several steps to go thru before you can even brew coffee.

None of the music in it is by the beatles, probably becuase the beatles didn't authorize their music to be used on the film, or the filmakers didn't have enough money to get the rights to use the music. Also if you watch it you might notice that they never get to go into any of the buildings because they're not authorized to go into any private buildings.

I must say that some of the footage of the Beatles themselves is somewhat interesting. However the movie as a whole is just boring! The movie would be so much better if it included more footage of the band and more music. Instead, it includes commentary from people who should not be on camera.

Be warned, despite the label claiming that it also includes an added extra ie. a special on Beatlemania, it does not.Worse still, this DVD contains no Beatles music! This should give you an insight to its lack of authorisation. It comes across as a cheap as chips production which is probably why there is no music. The producer simply could not afford it. Don't be fooled by the label stating rare footage. It does not shown anything that has not been seen before. Such utter garbage, and an offence to any Beatles fan. It should be renamed to \\"The Beatles Slandered by G. Giuliano\\". Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amatuer video","review":"This documentary relies mostly on existing footage woven together in a somewhat coherent manner.

(I, me, as though Pele is talking to us via the book) and i think thats what makes this book so good, reading what Pele has to say in his own words.

No matter- I found tons of things to accomodate them. One note, there is a 1,001 slow cooker recipe book in this series. It is probably 80% these recipes. That was a great disappointment.

My son loved it. The SUV silly song is right on the nose and depending on your love for these over-sized vehicles could take some warming up to. The Dr. Seuss take-off, A Snoodle's Tale, was very well done. It's similar to Flibber-o-Loo is the fact that they're both inspired by Seuss, but this one is much better. The style is more clever and the set design is much more visually interesting.Once again, it had great values and this show should help kids learn that God has big plans for everyone of us.

I especially like the SUV song as I drive a Jeep. Just wish we still had a 7-eleven to go to!

What a great teaching aid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worst Silly Song Ever!","review":"I just had to say that SUV is probably the worst Silly Song to date. I think they were going for a mock Meatloaf type style, mixed with Rice-Weber or something. Doesn't really hit a note with me. I like the fact it makes fun of SUVs and their common use of just going to pick up coffee at dunkin donuts. I understand where it is going, just it is so bad. The rest of the DVD, however, is fantastic! The Snoodles Tale portion is probably one of the most endearing stories I have heard from the Veggie Tales creators. Very touching! The animation in this segment, is very well done as well, and there is a piece on that describing what they did to make it so. More than makes up for the Silly Song being so terrible. Mr Jiggle and Mr Sly is wonderfully funny! My husband wonders though if fat kids at school will be called Mr. Jiggle, but I think if they do, then the watcher missed the point. I gave it only 4 stars because of the silly song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DVD for kids ever","review":"My two daughters (ages 2 & 5) absolutely love this DVD and request it constantly.

There are so many non-wholesome and/or scary kids shows out there its unbelievable - even from Disney! And we wonder where the children pick up nasty phrases from like \\"shut up\\" - just sit and watch some of the shows out there - I highly recommend watching before you let them watch any because kids pick up every little thing - especially from a DVD they watch over and over. Finally, here is a DVD worth letting your children watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"A Snoodle's Tale is the only Veggie episode that has made me cry. It's a blend of Dr. Suess narration and Max Lucado plot but VT pulls it off so beautifully that I was moved. But in true Veggie form, there's a lot of fun, quirky stuff on the CD as well. Dr. Jiggle made me giggle more than think. And Tom Hodge's take on SUV's is now my family's favorite Silly Song. Veggie Tales is right on track with this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cute New Veggie Movie","review":"I am relatively new to the world of Veggie Tales, but I enjoyed this movie. The snoodle story was so cute, and I wanted to just reach out and give the poor little snoodle a hug. Luckily he found someone in the movie that could give him some encouraging words - none other but the creator himself. The short movie Dr. Jiggle and Mr. Sly was pretty funny, with the 70s outfit and the big boombox, and the little doctor who didn't think he could dance because he jiggled a bit. I also liked the song \\"Sport Utility Vehicle\\" and had it stuck in my head on several occasions.

Thanks to him, gas prices and unemployment rates are up, and he gets a novel portraying him as a \\"leader\\"? Give me a break. This idiot also got a 2nd term only because people wanted him to solve the Iraq crisis, but then again, President Bush would rather blow the country's cash on the American troops fighting a senseless war than on our country's people.Use this book only as toilet paper or firewood.

I am still in the process of reading it but am really trying to just finish it. I would like to know what happens in the end and I only have 40 pages to go. Maybe the ending will make a difference in how I feel about this book. And I also think that the footnotes are a pointless waste of space. Evidently, this was just not my type of book and I really couldn't identify with any of the characters because they all seemed to be outlandish and overexaggerated. Just my opinion, as I am entitled to it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't finish this book","review":"I don't see what so many saw in this book....maybe I just didn't get it. I was looking for more humor, and he was just depressing and weird. Stopped at page 100 and could not go anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing novel from a great writer","review":"This book is so poorly written it was hard for me to get through it. Tim O'Brien is such a good writer, and I have enjoyed so many of his book s that I kept going and was really disappointed in the slap-dash feel of the story, the weird attitude of the hero. The best part of this book is the (too brief) flashback to Vietnam where you really feel O'Brien's power to reach through the page and grab you. But ultimately, this is a really bad read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Tim O'Brien, but...","review":"This was a really difficult book to read. The narrator is so dispicable and confused in his own mind that it's hard to wade through the book. The main character has few if any redeeming characteristics and that makes this just painful to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope this book means Tim is feeling a little better ...","review":"When I read a profile of the tortured Tim O'Brien in the Washington Post a couple years ago, after the publication of In the Lake of the Woods, I got the distinct impression that he was teetering on the verge of shuffling off this mortal coil. I am so glad that he chose to write another book instead.Tomcat in Love is vastly more light-hearted than O'Brien's previous work and good for him. Good to see a fine writer testing the waters and enjoying success as he does so.I just wish I'd found Tomcat funnier. I know other people will. Cheever and Updike fans, and those old cats who always liked Philip Roth, may just have found another literary pal in the kinder, gentler O'Brien. Not so much, me.Because O'Brien is a masterful storyteller with a vivid sense of place, I'll read his next novel also, but the work I'll keep recommending is The Things They Carried, one of the best short story collections I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Tim O'Brien but...","review":"I hated this book. Hated may not be a strong enough word. And I have really enjoyed everything else by Tim O'Brien. None of his characters are flawless people, but I found the main character of this book so distasteful that I couldn't get beyond that. There has to be someone in a book that you can sympathize with and this book just did not provide that. I barely made my way through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I wanted to like this book, really, but after 70 pages or so, I realized life is too short to waste on crap like this. Where to start? The lead character speaks like someone in a Stephen King novel. For instance, who have you ever met someone in real life who introduces themself with their full name, including middle name? Now, that wouldn't be so bad if, like King, it had a good plot. But I didn't believe this one for a microsecond. The whole family watched from a window as the teen couple kissed? The girl in the lingerie store cheerfully tried on clothes for the lead character? Come on. When the protagonist showed up in the yard of his family's old house and started weeping, I made a vow to myself: If he wound up bedding the woman who came outside to chase him away, I was outta there. I'm glad I followed that vow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our book club found this to be a big disappointment.","review":"Our book club of 6 dynamic professional women found this book to be pathetic, except for Christy who liked the humor, which eluded the rest of us. We thought Thomas was an undeveloped creep, an offensive womanizer. If Thomas was the anti-Christ, doubting character, then Lorna Sue could have been the redeemer except she ended up as evil as he was. Where is the redeeming value of these people? Not to mention where is the compassion? Our intention is to read meaningful literature, and we thought this was close to a waste of time, but for the lively discussion. We look forward to next month with Barbara Kingsolver. And our Long Beach, CA public library will have 4 donated copies of Tomcat. Are they lucky? We doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"why","review":"IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS is my favorite book and I rank it right up there with HUCKLEBERRY FINN; it is so classic and moving and sacred, perfection.

I kept thinking, this is Tim O'Brien, it's going to get better. This narrator can't possibly be this hateful or dumb. Tim O'Brien can't possibly be behind such overly simplistic twaddle as \\"Too Much Melrose Place\\" -- right? Wrong! It gets worse. It's a shockingly bad book from one of my favorite writers. Please let this be his one monumental failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anyone remember Nabokov?","review":"Because he wrote this character well. Chippering makes you want to hurl, not laugh. I don't know what people liked about this insufferable book. O'Brien was very highly recommended to me, and I intend on reading something else of his on the strength of these recommendations, but Tomcat in Love was a horrible book.

O'Brien suffered under the typecast of Vietnam writer for years. I helped contribute to that reputation! Well, this too is a Vietnam novel, but with a twist. Tim has eluded his detractors; taken the painful experience of a lifetime of war (because as sure as the day is fresh war is universal: we all wait for the wolf's knock at the door...) and turned it into an almost Joycean laugh at the cosmic irony of our circumstances. Some readers might think he has somehow belittled their war experience. This reader is a sixteen year war veteran who thinks he has done the finest act of reconciliation with the past possible: he has defused the hard lessons of history through laughter and joy. The war is over. It has been over. What remains are these daily struggles that kill us all. We are ambiguous. We are indeciphrable. Tim has illuminated the world for a moment. We should all be thankful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up-You'll laugh!","review":"If you are introduced to Mr. Chittering thinking you know him by way of his creator, you'll miss one of the true joys of reading-namely meeting quirky characters living quirky lives. Tom's mind thread is whacked (or is it?) Expecting to be reintroduced to a familiar character will guarantee you miss a seat on the bus. Mr. O'Brien touched our hearts in his previous works. It's a precious thing to know his heart is a bit lighter...and we all get to smile. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Brien ventures into an emotional battlefield","review":"If reading the novels of O'Brien is an inherently traumatic experience, it can also be enlightening. Tomcat ventures (mostly) out of the jungles of Vietnam and into the emotional minefield of romance for a difficult, powerful tale of the craziness love inspires. \\"Tomcat\\" is not about a battle of the sexes. It is a funny, but spiritually exhausting, story of one man coming to emotional maturity. While the story of the past accumulates, the present becomes sparse and the elements of the lead's life gradually fall apart. The question becomes whether the lead can overcome his obsession with his ex-wife and her brother, or if he is hopelessly trapped by a pattern of fate he cannot understand. The real power behind O'Brien's fiction resides in the way he turns plots inside out just when the reader thinks he understands. Only then do the emotional truths and motives become clear, and only then can the reconstruction of a life begin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected.","review":"After reading The Things They Carried and Cacciato, and several other books by O'Brien, this was a let-down. His previous books have won or been nominated by the National Book Award and even the Pulitzer Prize. The other books are 5+ star novels. I didn't like the perspective, the plot, and I didn't find it funny. It was just okay, fair, and average. Loved his other books, especially The Things They Carried."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED TOMCAT IN LOVE","review":"Read for my book club, TOMCAT IN LOVE was not loved by everyone. A tale of an academic who teaches linguistics...among his classes is \\"Methods of Misogyny\\"... this misogynist's tale is told with much humor and adventure. Tim O'Brien is in fine shape with his narrative holding well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with D300","review":"If you check Sterlingtek's website they claim this battery is compatible with the D300.

While the Trumps of the deck are stunning and the Courts are nice, once you get into the Pips/Minors it's a creepy dark ride full of explicit pictures including different body positions and parts, bestiality, decapitations, a bloody flesh eating man, nipple twisting, and dead bunnies!

It had the great suspense, and gore of the first two books, and had a very likeable cast. The book is pretty darn violent, but nothing worse than what Stine normally write.

Yes, it's different in the fact it's written in a type of prose-like style that gives the reader the impression they are listening to a TaleTeller speak around a firepit at night. It's advertised as a story where a woman warrior strides about Ancient Japan wielding a magic sword and fighting demons. Um..no. That's not what it's about. It's a mish mash of Japanese Folklore that plods along with some of the characters finding closure but the main character not. It just ends, and not in a satisfying way. I wouldn't spend the cash, but it's worth checking out of your local library for a quick read. Not anywhere worthy of the praise given it by the other reviewers, in my opinion of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Boring","review":"Picked this up in a used book store in desperation as I had run out of reading material. I won't make the mistake of picking up Tom Savage again. Aside from the plot weakness, the character development was really disappointing with the exception of FBI man O'Hara. Perhaps if the book had been written with him as the central character, it would have been more readable. The \\"hero\\" Mark, and I use that term loosely, was pitiful and hard to root for from the very beginning, and his girlfriend, Tracy, a paperdoll. It was an extremely quick read which is probably a plus since I was glad when it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid ending!!","review":"This book started out great but I was very disappointed by the bizarre ending.

The plot started with all the right ingredients and \\"The Family Man\\" was an intresting concept. However, there were too many victims, too many villains, and the ending was just too far-fetched. By the second half of the book, keeping track of all the characters was more trouble than the book was worth, the interest level dropped significantly and one was left with the feeling, \\"I hope the author never writes a sequel\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten Tomatoes Only Get Worse the Longer You Keep Them","review":"I tend to treat a book like an investment-- the more pages I read, the more determined I am to reach the payoff the end. But sometimes-- and Scavenger is one of them-- it pays to dump a loser and try something new. Scavenger is easy reading and the beginning of the book shows some promise. However, soon the plot seems rather flawed and the character's motivations appear contrived-- a flimsy excuse for the character to continue his hunt. The plot only gets more contrived and ridiculous; and I, the reader, felt more and more like a fool for not having the strenght to ditch the disaster. To redeem myself, I threw the book out after I read it and wrote this review. Don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing ending","review":"This was an interesting novel initially. Although it was rather graphic and somewhat far-fetched, the pace was fast and the chapters were short enough to keep the plot moving. However I had a real problem with the ending.

It's to Mr. Savage's credit that another integral plot twist is a little more unexpected. With that in mind, though, it is definitely worth reading. Savage lures you into his plot very quickly and his characters are interesting. And as in his previous works, nothing, no one is always exactly as they seem! No more, though...hate people who give away too much, don't you? Savage fans will be happy anyway, and new readers should go back to \\"Precipice,\\" \\"Valentine,\\" and \\"The Inheritance\\" to see Mr. Savage at his peak!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Savage can be great, but this book isn't.","review":"I first read Tom Savage's \\"Precipice,\\" which I found by accident in the library. It was original, fast paced, involving and well written. I couldn't put it down! I was dying to read more by Mr. Savage. So I did. \\"Valentine\\" was more predictable, but still a fun, quick read. \\"The Inheritance\\" was even more forced, but again, I still enjoyed it. When I saw \\"Scavenger\\" was available, I was really looking forward to reading it.What a disappointment! Not only is the plot so far-fetched to be not even remotely believable, the writing is terrible and amateurish and the characters seem completely fake. By the middle of the book, I had to force myself to finish it. Of course, there's a twist at the end -- there always is in Savage's books -- and even though it wasn't a bad one, by the time I got here, I could care less. I wouldn't waste my time with this one. Boring, silly and implausible."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO UNBELIEVABELY BIZZARE, I DIDN'T LIKE IT!","review":"I have read all of Tom Savage's novels except for Precipice and I don't think I'll read that one.

In \\"Scavenger,\\" the book's ending is just so amazingly and incredibly weird! I can't talk much about it because I would be giving away too much. The whole thing is about a crazy man making this author play a game and going on a Scavenger Hunt to find the truth about a murderer. The ending is just so bizarre! I did not like the way it turned out at all. Sorry, Mr. Savage, but I think I'll pass on your next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of The Author's Talent","review":"The basic plot of this book - that a serial killer will send someone on a scavenger hunt before killing him is so ludicrous that the novel has two strikes on it before you start. Then - chapter after chapter (and city after city) the tale becomes so trite and repetitious that it does the almost-impossible; it makes a book about a serial killer BORING. What is missing from most of books of this genre - and certainly from this one - is WHY SHOULD WE, THE READERS, CARE about the characters? The answer is WE DON'T! Go buy a Dick Francis novel (anyone of them) and you'll get a better, less gory, less sensational (but much more intelligent and entertaining) read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entranceing","review":"Tom Savage has done it again, but even more thrilling, as I started this book I just couldn't put it down.

Wonderful work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary falsehoods.","review":"Tom Savage has a very bad habit. He tends to lie to his readers. Much like Valentine, this book has an interesting premise, but a killer who is much too obviously the culprit. The only way Tom Savage is able to hide the killer's identity from the reader is to lie. He has the killer act, speak, and think in the way an innocent person would, even when they are alone with their thoughts, which defies plasusibility.The real problem with the 'twist ending' is that it removes any motivation that the main character might have had for their actions - Savage seems to know this, when he tries to off-handedly throw in a theory of the crime in the epilogue.The premise really did have promise, but unmotivated characters, a terrible ending, and plot points that don't hold up to the slightest bit of common sense make this book another disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for party artists and hobbyists, but pack extra batteries.","review":"I'm a henna artist, and got a few of these for party gigs where you're not always guaranteed a good light source.

It gives voice and details to so many who feel that the FL issue was not pregnant chads, but voter suppression and intimidation.I think African Americans, as a group, understand the importance and value of participation and democracy more than anyone else in our society. History has proved that the more the inclusion, the more prosperity for the society. Wish we didn't have to learn the same lessons over and over again. Let's hope things will improve in the next election cycle, though we will have a real challenge with the new voter machines. No matter what, she's right on target to focus on voter education. This book teaches much about our election system and process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Donna not only name dropped, she actually dropped the ball!","review":"One word, awful. I am both a political junky and an avid cable news watcher. I've enjoyed Ms. Brazile's political savvy and her insight on politics. However, this book was not that. The story was flat most of the book with Ms. Brazile playing \\"Monday morning quarter back\\" about what the Dems (Al Gore) should have done with the Florida recount. Half the book she named dropped and made a poor attempts at trying to connect the dots.Donna is not an exciting story teller and failed (just like her many campaigns) at providing context to the most controversial election of our times. Overall the book was bland as though she has never cooked with grease. I've tasted more flavor and style in other political books then in this dull recount of an unsuspecting campaign strategist. It was not worth my money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Promotion Leavened with Cheap Sentimentality","review":"So Al Gore's national campaign manager has finally gotten around to scribbling down her inspiring blahblahblahblah biography and her pithy blahblahblah political observations. I guess you could call it \\"one heck of a recipe!\\" So: what exactly should we learn from the campaign manager for an incumbent Vice-President for one of the most popular administrations in decades who manages to lose to a a guy who obviously is a moron? Can Donna teach us how you can lose an election even when you start off with all the advantages?? Can she teach us how to write off Ohio when it's still competitive, and how to scale back media spending in Florida for the last weeks of the campaign? Somehow I have a feeling that this book is not going to age well. I suggest you wait until it's remaindered by that book store at the outlet stores mall where they sell discount Bibles and last year's Tom Clancy novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a winner!","review":"I've had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Brazile a few times.

Unlike the neo-Nazis on the 'fair and balanced' network, she can present and argue her political bent without ever becoming discourteous. In today's climate that ability is becoming rarer and rarer!The book is well written; I seldom read nonfiction of this type. As I expected, Ms. Brazile isn't an egomaniac; she knows how to laugh at herself. The last political autobiography I enjoyed this much was George Stephanopoulos recounting his time in the Clinton arena.It's a great light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Woman of Our Time","review":"I enjoyed this book!

It's more of a blanket. It's very thin and does NOT have the same loft and warmth as real down, as stated in the product description. I was expecting two fluffy and cozy, twin size comforters for my children, ages 3 and 5. The the soft, cotton cover is well-made with satin piping around the edges. The manufacturer put money into the cover, but skimped on the filling. When the comforter is held up to the light, there are many places where the light shines through the filling. I would have returned the two comforters, but decided against it, since I'd have to pay return shipping for two boxes. (They were shipped separately.) I put the comforters in \\"Pinzon 100% Cotton Solid Flannel Twin Duvets\\" (also ordered from Amazon) and use them as \\"blankets\\" for the kids. They ended up being very expensive blankets!

I highly recommend this for anyone and I am buying more for someone else, now.I remembered I purchased comforters from Amazon 2.5 years ago.

The stress in the book is placed on conceptual understanding of confidence intervals instead of mechanical computation of p-values.As a mathematician, however, I was disappointed by the lack of rigor in the book, and especially at the plethora of mistakes, both in the text and in the solutions to the exercises.

However, I find that the UFO-02 Detector is not nearly as powerful or as accurate at detecting any local space traffic as my old Sub-Etha model was. At least my Elctronic-Thumb still works fine, so I can still hitch a ride when the UFO-02 Detector does register accurately. I will be replacing this as soon as I can find a new Sub-Etha model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the nonsense and disinformation?","review":"This product works. I don't understand why there are so many nonsensical reviews. Are there really so many bored or mentally ill people with nothing better to do with their time?The UFO-O2 Detector detects electromagnetic disturbances, period, and it does that effectively. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is because it could use a sensitivity control and an easier way to reset it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you all serious","review":"Are all of you just joking around or are you really serious about your beliefs etc..I do not believe this thing can work or even need to work..really??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely useful","review":"This device is only good for detecting the greys, which are not the ones to be looking out for.

At airport security, I put it in the bin on the conveyor belt, with my laptop and ipad. The TSA agent took it off the belt to examine it and it started flashing and beeping.After that, I was surrounded by four TSA agents and an armed soldier. I got a full pat-down and search of all my bags. An hour later, I was finally allowed to leave--but they confiscated my UFO detector. Which was still blinking. I guess it was broken, hence the one star review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No IPhone Support!","review":"At first I thought this was a toy or scam, but the device has changed everything. I am now more aware of my surroundings. Last week I adverted an alien abduction. During my trip to new mexico, the alien detector setoff while I was relaxing in my hotel room. Needless to say, I packed my things and left. Had I stayed one more minute who knows what would have happened to me. If I had one complain is that it does not connect to my Iphone. I would be ideal if it did. I carry my Iphone everywhere at home. I don't necessarily want to carry the alien detector. If this could call my Iphone or send text messages, it would be great.

The real strength of this book and DVD is the DVD--it has about 30 five-minute interview/clips with readers and how/why their favorite poem struck a chord with them. We see some personal background of the reader with them reading the poem aloud (sometimes memorized!) Readings range from the whimisical (\\"The Sloth\\" read by a 5th grader) the serious (\\"Facing It\\" read by a Vietnam vet). I also disovered poems I had never heard of before, like Margaret Atwoods, \\"It Is Dangerous to Read Newspapers,\\" a terrific poem. I first heard some of these readings on the Newshour (\\"The Song of the Banana Man\\") and wanted more. This book/DVD combination proves that poetry speaks to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Teaching Tool","review":"I was introduced to this book in a graduate level English course on Poetry and Performance. I am now a 10th grade English teacher and have used the DVD accompanying this book in an introductory lesson to my poetry unit, during which I require students to compile a portfolio of their favorite poems. Students seem to really enjoy watching the clips, especially the one of the young man who chose \\"We Real Cool\\" by Gwendolyn Brooks and the young woman who reads \\"Minstrel Man\\" by Langston Hughes.

Has all the functions that one would normally need for automotive use. The clamp-on wire feature is good for measuring RPMs while tuning up. The only drawback for this unit is that the instruction booklet is very poorly written. There are at least a half dozen spelling mistakes that are very obvious. The instructions are very basic and do not really help the novice in knowing how to use the unit for different automotive tests and do not always clearly show how to hook up the leads for measurements. It would also be nice to have the self adjusting scale range on this unit for the price range that it is in. Other than that, I think if one is looking for a multimeter in this price range, they will quite satisfied with this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Votivo Honeysukle spray","review":"A wonderful product.

I was expecting much more color and detail, but found too much generic patterns that didn't turn me on. I have a 500 MHz PIII with 128 megs of RAM. The planes are fun, but the scenery was really boring with a lot of flickering and visual instability. I ran the program on my friend's 1 Gig Athlon with 258 megs of RAM and a Nvidia G2 graphics accelerator, but there was no real difference. I was also disappointed at the lack of shadow from the planes as they approach the ground, which means that there's no way of telling how close you are until you crash.I played this game for about 6 hours total, then got bored and uninstalled it.

Well Allen answers all these questions and more. How and why it started, and why it was abandoned. The book almost reads like a novel, with good guys and bad guys, politics and the war.

The basic plot - guy kills guy talking to girl who he thinks is his gf; is actually gf's roomate wearing her clothes. This happens twice. Why doesn't the girl just stop lending out her clothes? At the end of the book we learn that none of the main characters actually exist, it was all a product of the girlfriend's imagination. What possessed me to borrow another one of Stine's book?
