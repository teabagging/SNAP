I was even excited to learn that the Cantor was female. However, being a music major, my ears must be tuned differently than those who've made comments before me, because I cannot endorse this CD by ANY means.The Cantor sings with an uncontrolled vibrato (think Stevie Nicks), no dynamic range, no connection to the meaning of the words, and no interplay with the choir she's singing with.The choir itself sings off pitch and, rather than singing like an ensemble, is a pin cushion of individual voices piercing through the soloist's part and ruining any sense of cohesion.I sadly report that when I offered to donate this CD to our Music Resource Center, the music librarian played it then laughed hysterically.I am not writing this to be mean, and I apologize if I've insulted anyone, but this CD was a huge waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Selections, LOUSY voice","review":"I am sitting here trying to think of something nice to say about this singer's voice; I'm sorry, but I just can't find anything. Despite the training (Bachelor of Music from Rice University) that the album insert says that she has had, she can't hold a pitch, has a wild vibrato, and goes flat so many times I was gritting my teeth by the end of the first track. She's what many of my choir directors would have called a \\"Screamin' soprano\\" who can (most of the time... ok... SOMETIMES) hit notes, but lacks anything approaching vocal control. Certainly she doesn't sound as though she's had a voice coach in the last 15 years or so; I hope she gets one.Meanwhile, I'll be putting the album up for sale, as I can't even stand to listen to it.Spend your money someplace else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is hazzanut?","review":"Some beautiful music, and actually, I thought the choir was quite good as well. However, the cantor, while having an absolutely beautiful voice, has very little sense of the tefillot (prayers), and how the tefilla should relate to the music. There is something quite necessary in order to be a hazzan/cantor, besides having a voice...and unfortunately, this cantor (at least on this recording) doesn't have it. There is little neshama (soul) in the recording...a shame really, since the music is indeed beautiful and the cantor is obviously quite talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I have never been heard of Jake Heggie.

Or just put your money on the floor and set fire to it, because that's effectively the same thing as spending it on Paradise.The other reviews are spot-on--while the graphics (particularly the pre-rendered backgrounds) are luscious and the story is interesting, the gameplay itself is terrible. Playing in the third person as Ann, you are reduced to pixel hunting over and over again because of glitches; sometimes you can find the hotspot, sometimes not. Even with the patch, my game hangs, freezes, and crashes with depressing regularity. Conversations are jerky and for some reason I repeat the same questions to certain characters endlessly. I never could play as the leopard.Bottom line...while I loved Benoit Sokal's earlier games, this one is a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - full of bugs, puzzles are stupid","review":"I can't believe Ubisoft put out something like this. It's terrible. From the same company that put out Myst games, this is what they've come up with???We played this game and got so frustrated with how buggy the game was that we almost quit altogether - but if we had quit it would mean that the game beat us, and our egos kept us going.Example of a bug: At one point we were talking to one of the characters and accidently terminated the conversation earlier than we had intended to. At that point we were stuck, it wouldn't let us talk to him again and he needed to give us an object to continue. We had to go back to an old saved game to even continue.Another example: If you don't do EVERYTHING in order, including talking to the right people at the right time, you can mess up the flow and get yourself stuck.It's terrible, it was like it was debugged by my 4 year old. And that is almost an insult to my 4 year old.Skip this one. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"The pre-release reviews I read gave an undeserved favorable impression of Paradise. I've enjoyed all of Benoit Sokal's previous games, so I'm extremely disappointed and surprised at how poorly done Paradise is.Poor controls (I would have liked to play the leopard, but the cursor jumped so violently I had to skip all three times!), numerous bugs, the predominately olive/tan color scene became painful to look at, and the ending was completely bizarre. There is no humor at all and the constant abuse of nearly every animal you encounter was depressing.I played to the end all the while hoping it would improve, but it only got worse. This game was clearly a rush job and is not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"After I read this book, I truly felt that I got to know the woman behind the mask, the real OZ of Jane Austen. While reading Ms Austen's books, I always felt that Jane allowed a portion of her own traits to be portrayed in the desires of her heroine, including the good with the bad. Yet, how sure could I be?The author of this biography on Jane Austen was able to get private letters and other data from the Austen family, and there are plenty of photos along the way. Sadly, not even ONE photo of Jane exists. He delved deep into what made Jane into the person that she became. I grew to love and respect her even more.On a whole the book is very well written. However, I can never actually sit down and read a biography quickly. It takes me a couple of weeks. I recommend this book to anyone who has read any or all of Jane's books and who wants to know the woman behind the pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful and readable insight into U.S.-Mexican relations","review":"This useful book offers more than its title implies.

The album is so long that the CD stops playing near the end on my computer's CD player - \\"Strangulation!\\" gets strangulated, and I don't even hear the bonus track. \\"Honest Man\\" is the only standout on the album, a blues-driven rocker that is unlike any other song MMJ has done.

I don't have the space to store 45 dvds on Lucy alone; I do have other movies I would like to own. The price is also a little steep. I would rather have it season by season, and at $50 a season, that is still only $300. That is a better deal for storage and value.As long as people continue to spend the money, we will never see a decent amount of Lucy episodes on a decent priced dvd.We need to stand up as consumers and stop giving in to the studios by buying these overpriced dvds.It appears that the diehards are going to kill it for everyone.

All the players are first-rate, in particular Angela Lansbury as the mother from hell, while Sinatra's portrayal of Marco reflects the dramatic high point of his film career. A nail-biting political thriller that warrants repeat viewings, \\"Candidate\\" is as relevant today as it was at the height of the Cold War. Beware inferior remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful thriller scifi from the cold war era","review":"This is a great film, full of expalined nuances that the viewer can choose to interpret. I was happily surprized at its subtlty. You get the plot of brainwashing, but then the film explores how it works and how it fits with the psychology of each affected character.Except for his obligatory fight scene, Sinatra is excellent as the ravaged man of duty struggling to fight what has happended to his mind. While he pales in comparison to Laurence Harvey's psychological journey, this is one of his best acting performances. The bad guys pulling the strings are also extremely good, and of course one wonders if all of them were exposed...This is such a masterpiece that the only reason I can see to re-make it is that Hollywood has run out of ideas in its never-ending search to make money. Get this.

For serious fans of the original version this is actually a good thing, for two reasons: 1. The new anamorphic transfer, and the audio track are a VERY noticable improvement over the first edition. 2. MGM has admirably avoided the usual trick of jacking up the list price-it is the same as the first edition (let's hope this signals a new trend in the industry!). As for the film itself-fellow reviewers have already done a fine job of plot synopsis; just suffice it to say that this one fits snugly into your \\"Conspiracy A-Go-Go\\" section right next to \\"The Parallax View\\", \\"JFK\\", \\"The Conversation\\" and \\"Three Days Of The Condor\\".

The fact that this was made before the era of CG graphics,shaky cam effects and ear-splitting soundtracks for effect only show how unnecessary they are when you have an excellent script,backed by an outstanding cast and great director who lets the story tell itself. The choice for Black & White enhances the suspense. Frank Sinatra gives a moving and powerful performance as he frantically tries to beat the clock in what is to be,unknown until the very end,the assassination of the presidential candidate, and the insertion of a puppet senator controlled(unknowingly) by Communists in his place.The idea of McCarthy era Communist hunts and brainwashing tactics,common to the era,gets the viewer involved right up to its conclusion.

Still potent, this ferocious political satire(?) about a brainwashed assassin was allegedly withheld from distribution for 25 years by star Frank Sinatra after the killing of JFK. Strangely, Sinatra also starred in SUDDENLY, another film about the killing of a president.

In Berlin did I want to see the still shot photo and name of the reporter plastered on the screen, covering up the fireworks display going on in the background (along with other CNN graphics)? That's reporter and network vanity at its worst. They totally lost the captivating effect that Paris had when I watched it originally on TV, no we had to see it micro-sized down into a box. Show Paris and then follow it up with Rome. They ruined both by trying to squeeze them on the screen together. Then there were the close up shots of Big Ben through most of the celebrations in London, we missed so much staring at that clock! San Francisco had to share a split screen with 3 other cities. Truly frustrating watching this, especially if you saw it live on TV and you knew what they left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a two hour commercial for CNN","review":"Don't waste your time with this one, the CNN millenium logo is on so many views, it even blocks much of the fireworks at the bottom of the screen.

We got poorly edited segments of festivities that should have been shown in full and long drawn out segments of stuff that should have been edited down.

While the premise of the novel was interesting, I thought that the characters of the book were poorly developed. It felt like the book was too short and didn't give the author sufficient opportunity to convince the reader of Livvy's emotions. I could see the story leading up to Livvy's growing feelings for Ray but when she finally realized that she loved him, I was not at all persuaded. Similarly, I couldn't really understand her unquestionnable trust in the two Japanese sisters. I could see the friendship developing but not enough to turn a blind eye to everything -- particularly when she herself understood the perils of precipitous love. The writing was fine but the book came across as a good start -- not a good finished product."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"A very nice book.

I saw this movie first and was very moved by the real-life experience of Livvy and the other characters, so I decided to read the book. The plot is a bit different but not any less realistic. In her reflecting of what happened with Edward, she gets a little graphic, definately not as much as most novels do but more than I would want my kids to read. It is a great story of how people will use you and let you down, but how that there is hope in tomorrow. Ray's faith in God and the goodness of his family and church friends were a great influence on Livvy's life. It was a good example of how God can work good things in your life when you think they are the worst.

Lots and lots and lots of tidbits from the author's no-doubt fascinating research are plunked down in the story, where they sit like undigested bits of beef or underdone potato, totally unrelated to the story as a whole.

Nothing new or original and loaded with errors. Superficial.There is little new research, and most of the quotes are taken from other books or from other authors. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad addition to your Hollywood library","review":"As some reviewers here have pointed out, this book is long on anecdotes but I'm giving it a 4 star rating because not everybody has heard every anecdote--there were a number I hadn't heard--and they're interesting and worthwhile recording while those people were/are still around. Perhaps some deeper historical context would have been useful here, but over all I enjoyed reading it and got out of it what I was hoping to get: a feel for the contradictions and idiosyncrasies of a fading studio system against the onslaught of new technology (ie television) and changing social mores. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Otto Friedrich by way of Kenneth Anger","review":"This terrifically readable cultural history of Hollywood in the Fifties was inspired by James Ellroy's wish to the authors that there were a book about the era as fine as Otto Friedrich's CITY OF NETS; the authors admit they could not quite match the comprehensiveness of Friedrich's achievement, nor are they quite as erudite or analytically sophisticated. But, in their best chapters (on the culture of Hollywood expatriates, and in fine narratives of the making of REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE and NIGHT OF THE HUNTER), they come close to matching the engaging tone of and gossipy frisson engendered by Friedrich's famous book. The initial chapters on the scandals covered by and created by \\"Confidential\\" magazine read more like Kenneth Anger's HOLLYWOOD BABYLON than Friedrich, but as the study continues it just gets better and better. I didn't want it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The likes of Tony Curtis?","review":"When the likes of old queens like Tony Curtis are interviewed for their alleged \\"recollections\\" you know the book is B.S. He, who lied about an affair with Marilyn Monroe, talks about Mae West in this book. And what he says is total fabrication. I know MANY of Mae West's close friends from the time period in which he speaks, and she had none of the characteristics he speaks of. It is hearsay that we have all heard before, indicating he knew very, very little about her personally. And the \\"writers\\" assesments are absolutely appalling.Having said that...what can you believe in this book? What good is a book where you have to weigh what is fact from fiction? The bigger question is, what do you WANT to believe? The truth, or what may be titillating?There are hundreds of cheap Hollywood gossip books. This is just another one.A NOTE: I love salacious stuff! I'm no prude! However...it must be accurate or I am not interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vivid inside portrait of sex and power games","review":"Bad & The Beautiful is a fascinating and informative history of Hollywood in the 1950s which offers a vivid inside portrait of sex and power games, from the rise of tabloid journalism to the rise of legendary film icons. The authors focus as much on cultural trends and perceptions of stars and Hollywood as upon the films and creations that kept it in the limelight of American culture and innovation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Elegance of Pachelbel","review":"I have many versions of the Kanon in D and enjoy them all.

Like so many of you, I find Pachelbel's Canon a beautiful piece of music. This version, although well made by talented musicians, is difficult to listen to. None of the tracks made me want to go back for more. Had I been able to sample a track first, I would not have purchased it. I wanted to like it. I really did. The thought of having a CD full of nothing but Pachelbel's Canon is still a great thought.

The Canon itself is performed only once (on the last track). If you are an adept of baroque music, if you believe that the Canon should be performed as it was meant and written by Johann Pachelbel (with the Gigue that follows, for example), on authentic instruments, then by all means do <em>not</em> buy this CD, you will hate it. On the other hand, if you like the Pachelbel Canon in many forms, if you do not care about authenticity, and if you enjoy relaxing \\"New Age\\" style music, then you will love it. Evidently the composer (Michael Maxwell) is very able and, provided you do not take this CD for what it is not, it is a remarkable piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh why did I believe the review?","review":"I bought this CD after reading the reviewshere and am now resolute that I will never againblindly trust such anonymous reviewing.

I was looking for a CD, much like you are, with it done in various ways- piano, violin, vocal, etc. Different tempos, chords, instruments, etc. I thought this was it. No. This is like PacHELLbel. I can kind of make out a Canon tune in the staggered tempos, extrapolations, and outright molestations of the original tune but it's just too far from the mark. Maybe I am not sophisticated enough. Great for elevators in medical buildings. One track though is the original essentially and it is very well done but the rest...

If you want to learn about the Spanish Mustangs that live there, I'd recommend you take one of the tours that are offered, where you will get to see the horses and learn about them from one of the informative and friendly tour guides.I found the video, in contrast, to be mostly political and slightly depressing; showing the back and forth between those that wanted a protected area set aside for the horses and those residents that opposed it. I had to force myself to watch the whole thing, even with the narration of Charles Kuralt's familiar voice. I'm glad the horses got their sanctuary, however, I didn't want to learn about the politics involved, I wanted to learn more about these beautiful creatures. I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for that information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for music appreciation","review":"This 4 CD set not only contains some of the best performances of the last century, but also works as a comprehensive review of some of the finest musical literature spanning from the Baroque period to Modern Avant-Garde. Some of the earlier recordings are better for nostalgia purposes due to the poor mediums of the times, but the performances for the most part are professional. Only complaint: Some of the best works (Wagner's \\"Die Walküre\\", for example) are only provided in excerpt form to showcase a certain performer or section of the piece.

Knowing what Mr.Clement was feeling at different times in his life, I might have an insight which could possibly help my daughter at times. Also Thomas Park Clement has chosen to include a sense of humor like no other. There are also parts of this book that will bring you to tears as I was. This is a book that will make you feel so many different emotions. I recommend this book to EVERYONE, not only to people that have an association with adoption."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unforgotten War","review":"I cried, I laughed, and could not put the book down. Sat all night until 2:30 in the morning reading it to the end. This is one of those books that was written before it's time and will take a long time before it is fully understood. The world of an international adoptee is so incomprehensible, yet in a straight forward manner, Thomas has related what it must be like to have his original native country, customs and language totally changed over night, literally. His adaptation into the American society with it's many trials and tribulations is a bit on the unnatural side. I cheered him on in his personal development and heard his gentle nature. I think many people outside of the trilagy would love this book as much as I did. Thank you Thomas, for sharing your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the high cost","review":"After purchasing this set I wonder why the cost is so high.

It's just decent game for DC or Arcade. anyway.. overall is pretty good game but if you have chance to rent this game, you should do that first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought the game because from the description I thought it was a gun game. It does let you use the Mad Catz gun but it makes no difference where you shoot, you might as well use a regular controller. It is NOT a gun game. It is an OK fighter in that mode, unfortunately in the arcade mode it is difficult to control and you get to the first boss level almost immediately. I recommend House Of The Dead 2, Confidential Mission, and Virtua Cop 2 instead of this title if you are looking for a shooter. Although I must say for the price it is still worth playing with if you are just looking for a Dreamcast game.From the description I believed it was a true gun game but it is not so I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love John!!!","review":"this album is awesome!!! john is at the top of his game with this one, there's great lyrics, great guitar solos, distortion, his voice is excellent, every song is just amazing!

He can't stop, and hopefully he won't anytime soon. John Frusciante has created another insane incredible amazing ground-breaking record. This feast of albums he has been generously creating for his die-hard and loving fans has been keeping extremely content over the last several months. But \\"Inside of Emptiness\\" is definitely the gem out of the lot. John Frusciante goes back to the roots of rock and roll for this album. Guitar distortion is beautifully used on some of the songs, particularly \\"Look On\\", my favorite song on the album. It contains a absolutely wonderful solo by John that lasts 1:15. There's no need for me to tell you about each song, only that each song is definitely amazing and beautifully written. Get this CD now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid, interesting albumn","review":"I am a RHCP fan for many years, and I have always appreciated Frusciante's contribution to the band. Until recently, I have never listened to his solo stuff. This is my 2nd solo album of his, and is much more to my liking. Some of his music strays very far off field compared with what we are familiar to hearing from him in the RHCP. I completely understand his need to explore and grow, but that doesn't mean that all of it is listenable. This album, although not funk-based like most of his playing, is very good. I listened to it 3 times last night. Some tracks stood out from the others during the 1st pass (#5), while others took a while -- over the course of multiple listens -- to sink in, but are also very good. What really stands out here is not only his command of the guitar, but his songwriting. His growth as a musician can be clearly seen since he was an 18yo kid when first entering the RHCP. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype about?","review":"I'm a big fan of JF, but obviously not obsessed. I really didn't get much from this album. If you have listened to other Frusciante albums and are worried about the singing in this one too, well you should be. I can't get used to bad singing, maybe it's just me. Unfortunately, JF needs studio polishing when it comes to singing.If you're searching for some Frusciante to get started on, try Shadows Collide with People, one of the best albums I've listened to period. It's night and day with his other works (that I've listened to) including this one. Shadows' 5 stars are justified, not so sure about Inside of Emptiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"JF's best? I've lost sense of it all.","review":"\\"What I saw\\" written about the album was quite different form what I heard. Having listened to the album several times I can't figure out what it is that distinguishes JF's album from any talented school-rock-band. The harmonic surprises seem to be limited to a major-minor change and the all-to true statement \\"and then foresight comes / I've lost sense of it all\\" in what ought to be the album's title song \\"Emptiness\\".Please!

It was a tough book to find & I didn't want to read the others out of order. I've already started reading the second one and I don't find it a lot better, though I'm more than willing to reserve judgement. \\"O Greenest Branch\\" is written in a style I find very distracting and its negativity or \\"Darkness\\" or whatever it is seems to go on for too long. I am a huge fan of all the other works of this author, so I hope Bks 2 & 3 get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it with an open mind.","review":"This is not the place to look for traditional epic fantasy. I was actually put off at first by the constant changing in style and script, but when I was stranded with no other book, this one got picked back up again. I'm very glad I did. Once I accepted the book for what it was, not what it's genre said it should be, I was enchanted. The characters are not heros of common ilk, but something so much more and intensly flawed. It might not be what you're looking for, but if you want something new and creative, give it a shot. It's a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Not up to Gael's usual standard at all.

I think I finally found out: to impress us with his knowledge of the arcane workings of musical form.I would like a good biography of Beethoven, Please.Do not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not worth multiple plays","review":"As a big fan of Broadway Vocals-type albums, I eagerly looked forward to this offering from LML Music. While I appreciated the quality of both Mr. Chandler's and Ms. Benton's voices, and the creativity in many of their choices, overall the album strikes one chord and stays there. I did enjoy Hey There and Going Home, but after many songs I kept wanting to say, \\"OK, we KNOW you two are in love, already.\\" I'd prefer love songs that help me celebrate my own love, not theirs exclusively."},{"rating":"1","title":"some good tracks, but limited","review":"there is no doubt that these two singers have talent. with that said, there is a soporific tone to this album that never quite lives up to the full promise. part of the drawback for me was the 70's-feel of the vocal arrangements, which are initially reminiscent of the carpenter's, but which later become more meandering for the ear. the first track, a medley of \\"i will\\" and \\"maybe i'm amazed\\" was charmed, but after several very similar song styles later on the cd I was disappointed. i was thrilled to hear the change with a cool song like \\"god will\\", but sadly that track is far too short when it had large potential. the tracks that stuck with me, namely \\"if i'm lucky\\" and \\"hey there\\", were inspired, but they were few between. pleasant cd, but limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be 50 stars!","review":"I am sorry this CD can only be awarded 5 stars because it deserves 10 x as much.

I bought Andrea Bocelli's Cieli di Toscana as part of a special combination package and they were worth every penny. For the first 3 months Josh's CD was the only thing I had spinning in my CD player. I think I've officially driven my roomates crazy playing it over and over, but I think they're starting to warm up to him too. I've also made other friends buy it too and now they love it too.

He knows his stuff and it shows! My favorite songs are \\"You're Still You\\", and \\"To Where You Are\\". \\"Gira Con Me\\" is my favorite Italian piece... The duet with Charolette Church is very well done. I HIGHLY recommend this CD. You will play it everyday forever!! He has been given a gift, and it truly shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power to Heal","review":"After listening to this CD over and over and watching his meteoric rise to success over this past year, one has to ask,\\"What is it about his voice?\\" He has an ability to reach into your soul and touch your heart with simply the power of his voice and the raw emotion that he conveys with each song. Although several of the songs on this CD are in Italian and Spanish, one does not need to know one word to understand the meaning of every word. The interperative ability and sensitivity demonstrated on every song is amazing. I find that his music calms me when I'm angy, lifts me when I'm down and heals me when I am wounded. I have become a supporter of this young man in a way that I have never experienced with any other singer. I truly believe that his voice is of a very old soul and that he will be legendary."},{"rating":"2","title":"The guy is amazing","review":"I swear i have become a huge fan of Josh in a very short period of time.

I don't know what it is about that song but i run every gamit of emotion when i hear it. He is truly a remarkable young man with golden voice. I hope he will do a concert tour or another PBS special or better yet perform at Radio City Music Hall. I WILL BE THERE.....And everything i have read about this guy is also a breath of fresh air.

Never before have I come across such a beautiful amalgamation of artistry, power, musical diversity and pure talent. Josh Groban has fed my need for a vocalist who sings his words with passion and heart... when you listen to this album, you can feel his happiness, heartache and everything in between. He doesn't just SING these words, he makes the listener become a part of his own emotion.I have worn out my original Josh Groban CD, now I need a couple more (nothing more relaxing than driving with this CD in your car!).

ENCORE! ... and thanks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Utopia","review":"I am not your usual classical music critic ...,but I love stating my point of view on the music I grew up with, from Hayden to Bach. Josh Groban,20, is no exception.From the wonderful \\"Alla Luce Del Sole\\", with a Spanish vibe, to the inspirational \\"You're Still You\\" to the pretty tune of \\"Vincent (Starry, Starry Night)\\" to the beautiful and uplifting duet with soon-to-be 16 year-old Welsh soprano Charlotte Church, 'The Prayer\\"...this is a wonderful classical utopia.I love this recording as much as any other tenor recording I have bought. Mr. Groban is sure to be the next Luciano Pavarotti! No questions asked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Albums, Please","review":"When I first heard his duet \\"The Prayer\\" on Charlotte Church's \\"Enchantment\\" album, I thought it odd to hear the young lady paired with a forty-year-old man. I was stunned to see on a PBS special that Groban is 20, and looks young enough to be dating Church in high school! I rushed out to buy his album, and was amazed by it. I have since found numerous friends and colleagues who have also discovered him and this album; he is more of a find that Church herself. Please send us more albums, but let's lose the more mod/techno arrangements. He can sing a cappella as far as I am concerned. Give me a duet between Groban and Jane Olivor, and I can die in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where has he been all of my life.","review":"Josh Groban is absolutely the best thing to come along in male vocal music since Elvis. I can't believe how great he sounds on anything he sings whether or not its in English. He also does well with most artists he joins in with in duets and such. He sounded great with the Coors and also in Jesu, Joy Of Man's Desiring. The non-solo song which didn't mesh was \\"The Prayer\\" with Charlotte Church. She simply can't sing at the level needed to compliment Josh. He should avoid her in the future. But this album is a 5-star effort all the way by our new Golden Boy, Josh."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have NEVER been THIS amazed...","review":"I am an avid Ally McBeal watcher, and I (of course) caught the season finale featuring Josh Groban. I was absolutely taken aback by this young man's voice. When he appeared again on Ally, I was ecstatic...but STILL didn't manage to catch his name! The crowning moment was on the Olympic closing ceremony, where I was absolutely awestricken by the performance with Charlotte Church (who is amazing in her own right!). I happened to be online, and as soon as I saw his name, I started downloading like a madwoman. The next night I went out and bought his CD anyways!! I have played it, and I have raved about it to everyone I know. I am insisting that they all go out and buy it. I am truly impressed and look forward to seeing MUCH MUCH more from this incredibly talented and mature young man!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EMOTIONALLY EXPLOSIVE","review":"WHEN I FIRST HEARD JOSH GRODAN ON ALLY MCBEAL LAST SEASON, I DID NOT KNOW HIS NAME. I WAS MOVED BEYOND WORDS WITH THE SONG HE SANG AND TRIED TO FIND OUT WHO HE WAS. I WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. LAST NITE HE APPEARED AGAIN, BUT TODAY, I WAS NOT UNSUCCESSFUL!!HIS SONG MOVED ME AGAIN TO TEARS THAT HE SANG AS I LOST MY MOTHER ON XMAS SO THE WORDS HE SANG CAME AT A TIME I NEEDED IT MOST. HIS VOICE IS LIKE AN ANGEL, AND WITH EACH WORD I REALIZEDTHE DEPTH OF HIS TALENT. I HAVE GONE OUT AND PURCHASED NOT JUST ONE BUT TWO CDS OF HIS. ONE FOR MY CAR AND ANOTHER FOR MY HOME.I WILL LISTEN OFTEN, AND THE TEARS THAT ARE SHED ARE NOT OF SADNESS BUT OF A PEACEFULNESS I FEEL WHEN I HEAR THE WORDS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR VOICE...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The coolest CD!!!","review":"This CD makes me feel so calm and I LOVE \\"The Prayer\\" I hope you buy it too. It is sooooooo awsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last...a great singer has arrived","review":"This young man has one of the most magnificent voices I've heard in years! His selection of songs aptly displays his diverse vocal range and style.By far the operatic pieces show off his voice best (\\"Gira Con Me\\") but equally powerful are the stirring ballads (\\"You're Still You\\" and \\"Where You Are\\"). His bittersweet rendition of the hypnotic \\"Let Me Fall\\" from Cirque du Soleil is so moving as to make you feel like you are, indeed, falling.I was eager yet wary to hear lyrics sung to the theme from \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" (one of my top ten favorite movies). I was pleasantly surprised that both the lyrics and Josh's voice did justice to this superb soundtrack.The only track I found less than stellar was \\"Vincent (Starry, Starry Night).\\" While a fine song, it seemed too, well, ordinary for this superb vocalists' talents.Overall, this ecclectic collection from this artist is a brilliant first offering and would be a welcome addition to any music lovers collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh... my... JOSH!","review":"A friend of mine and I were talking about music one day and I told her I liked classical music and she suggested that I listen to Josh Groban's CD, although it's more pop. She let me borrow this CD and I was immediately blown away when I put it in my CD player. His voice is so rich and beautiful that I just melted.I quickly bought my own copy along w/ the DVD/CD set of his PBS concert. Josh Groban has been in my CD player for the past 5 months and I have no desire to take the CD out any time soon.My favourite songs on this CD are \\"Vincent (Starry Starry Night)\\", \\"Gira Con Me\\", and \\"Canto Alla Vita\\".If you aren't into opera or classical-classical music, but still have no desire to listen to bubblegum pop like Britney and *N Sync, then this is the CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extrodinary","review":"Josh's voice is wonderful. I think I can listen to this CD over and over. His voice is so full of emotion and he truly has a wonderful gift. The DVD of his concert is excellent too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groban and Gary Clark/Piano!","review":"Our 2 newest favorite CDs. The 2 best of 2002! Highly Recomended!!

I can hardly wait for his next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful!","review":"A friend gave this cd to me. I had not been familiar with Josh Gorban before but this is wonderful. He sometimes reminds me of Bocelli. What an incredible voice for one so young. has aIf you appreciate good music this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groban's youthful talent is refreshing","review":"I enjoyed listening to Josh Groban's repetoire. His voice is fantastic, and as far as I am concerned, the sky is the limit. Groban's voice is very soothing, yet appropriately emotional, and that voice makes Groban a versatile singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This voice will knock you flat!","review":"I recently purchased the CD, after hearing his song \\"To Where You Are\\", and I cried like a baby, I just could not help it. Every single song on this CD is beautiful! I understand that there is CD distributed in Japan in which he sings \\"Mia Per Sempre\\" and everyone who has heard it raves about it. I logged on here to try and find it. In the meantime, I need to know, with the passion of a true fanatic, when and where I can hear him again (TV, new CD..)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulicious Sound!","review":"Eat your heart out, Andre Bocelli fans! Josh Groban hits his mark with a debut album that is utterly breathtaking. Every time I listen to it my heart swells with this magnificient voice. I am especially taken by track #5 because of the special message it imparts. There is nothing more touching than to realize the meaning behind the lyrics and listen to Josh's rendering of one of the most fabulicious sounds currently recorded. I cannot wait for his next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Waves of velvet","review":"I first saw Josh Groban on a television program where they intereviewed him as well as David Foster. I thought he was a cute teenage boy, and I thought, UH-OH...another boy band singer. HOW WRONG! This boys voice is simply AMAZING. Don't be fooled or put off by his age. His voice is so beautiful. His version of Starry Starry night (Vincent), is pure magic, and replaces Jane Olivers version in my heart(Sorry Jane)! He possesses a voice so much more pure than the shmaltz of Boccelli, who I use to love, but he has gotten so carried away with his press. Let's hope young Groban stays true to himself and offers us fine opera as well as beautifully done ballads.Do yourself a favor and buy this CD! Fill the tub with a nice bubble bath, pour yourself a glass of wine, light some candles and put this CD on....a night of heaven! ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Want More!!","review":"What a Honey!!! Josh has the best voice of any guy from the U.S. I can ever remember. His duets were O.K. but he needs to drop Charlotte Church. She is simply a pedestrian singer who has no place on this album. Would like to hear some more pop and less classical. Josh can definetly do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Pat Boone?","review":"Let's see... \\"deep\\" voice, same delivery of every sappy song, good looks (if you don't mind the hair)... Is it Pat Boone? No, it's Josh Groban. No doubt that with some technology to assist his voice (sadly unavailable for poor Pat in his day) the housewives will be in love. With my handy crystal ball I see a Christmas Special coming some time this season. If I turn out to be wrong about it, I will take the unltimate punishment - listen to this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Square","review":"What is the big hype here this guy is so boring and he needs to comb his hair and cut it. This stuff is so bland and I can't believe the music buying public can rave about something this boring. This guy needs taste in his music so many people were raving about Norah Jones a couple of months ago she was bland too and so is Josh Groban. That is why I switched to country at least those country singers know how to have fun with there music. Josh Groban should not take himself so seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are kidding???","review":"You liked this?Some time in the future, the term \\"Josh Groban\\" will undoubtedly become a euphamism for mindless pap.ie: \\"What the hell is that on the radio, boyo? It sounds like muzak from the elevator to hell?\\" \\"Oh dad, it's just some Josh Groban-style stuff, I'll turn it off.\\"This album is quite honestly one of the most appalling examples of trite rubbish produced for people who think Mills and Boon novels are literature.For the love of all things holy, don't subject yourself to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Crap","review":"I have never heard such a collection of overdramatic and sugary sentiment from someone taking himself way too seriously. Sure, great voice, but he should get some taste first. And the general public should get some too, come to think of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Everybody. Come back to Earth","review":"Sure, he has a pretty voice. But come on people. Give me a week and I guarantee I can find you a dozen, or maybe a hundred, twenty-year-olds who sing just like Josh Groban. This is pure marketing, just like Charlotte Church, or \\"The VOICE\\" or Bocelli, or any of the other psuedo-classical singers. And the material! Translate his repertoire into English and it's just a series of mediocre ballads.Josh Groban has great potential. He already has a lovely instrument. Now he needs to learn how to really sing. But why should he, if people like David Foster and David Kelly and John Williams are willing to welcome him into their company as some kind of amazing prodigy. Sorry to all the teeny boppers and adults who want a feeling of sophistication without any of the work, but he's nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"No 'Joy' For this Man's Desiring","review":"After witnessing a sweet performance and sweeter song on television's Ally McBeal, I had such high hopes for this CD. But a testosterone clone of the robot Charlotte Church was not on my agenda. Turgid ballads, irritating arias, a monotone baritone, and a misguided remake of \\"Vincent [Starry Starry Night]\\"; you have to wonder just who is responsible for all this. Then you notice roll call - David Foster, Walter Afanasieff, Richard Marx...then it all makes sense. My grade: C"},{"rating":"1","title":"i am suprised i acutally bought this","review":"I first heard of this guy from a duet he did with charlotte church that my mom had a cd of. I thought he had a good voice so i saw this cd and i bought it i could only sit through it once it was so boring and all the same. I got this when i was into classical music do not get me wrong i still like classical music like bach, mozart and so on but this dude sucks. The only decent song on here is stary stary night but he ruins it with overproducion and expressing no emotion in his voice, the don mclan original version is so much better. This cd was in the back of my cd collection for years untill my aunt lost hers so i gave her mine she gave me joshua tree instead which is overrated and kinda of boring but atleast it is not embrassing to have in my collection like this boy josh."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the ages","review":"Unlike many others, I like the duet with Charlotte Church, which is interesting because I am no fan of hers at all. Her almost raspy weak voice contrasts just right with Groban's silky smooth power. It works and highlights his performance rather than taking away from it.And what a voice he has! The first time I heard it on Ally McBeal it just blew me away.A similar story line has been done so many times where character gets his chance to sing. The problem with the plot line is that the singer's voice is merely good. But with Groban, his performance was one for the ages. When Ally tells him afterwards that his voice was the most beatiful she has ever heard, the compliment is totally believable -- she's not exaggerating.Get this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to tell the world about JOSH!","review":"Josh is the perfect blend of Frank Sinatra, Neil Diamond, and Luciano Pavarotti. I feel like I have purchased my first CD of many in the years to come. I have told everyone I know about Josh and his incredible talent. He is music history in the making. He is gifted beyond words. It's my pleasure to own his first CD and look forward to his next one. THANKS JOSH! You've done good!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Me Fall......Again","review":"It's amazing how skating introduces opera \\"snobs\\" to other genres. I \\"discovered\\" Josh Groban while watching Brian Boitano's New Year's skate. (years ago, Brian introduced me to The Gypsy Kings.) WOW! The maturity of Mr. Groban's voice certainly doesn't match the youthfulness of his appearance. HOWEVER......that youth brings a freshness to these songs that is worthy of constant loop on your CD player. And how often will I listen to Track 8 before I tire of the interesting arrangement? This CD is on my \\"traveling stack!\\" Buy it, enjoy it, obsess about it. It's that fine.(And when this boy hits the opera stage, WOW, will I be waiting on line to sit Aisle 5, Center!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I wanted this CD for one song, \\"To Where You Are\\", but was ecstatic to find that almost every song is rapturous; especially \\"Let Me Fall\\" and \\"You're Still You.\\" I also love his \\"The Prayer\\", though I was less enamored of Charlotte Church's part (although I do love her voice, just not here). This young man has it all - voice, looks, persona. Can't wait for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"After three years... I still love you, Josh","review":"I've been following Josh since a time that seems very long ago... no one knew who he was when I mentioned his name, there were zero websites devoted to him, and no music stores had information on this amazing young man when I tried to track him down. I waited nearly two years for his debut album to hit stores. But I knew, since the first moment I saw him sing with Sarah Brightman (La Luna in Concert) he had something special. In short, it was worth the wait.This CD is incredible. With nearly 800 reviews saying mostly the same thing, I won't elaborate much on that. His voice soars, the lyrics and music are beautiful, and Josh has put classical music back on the map-- and radio.As a classical singer and music enthusiast... there's nothing I could want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groban is amazing!","review":"This CD is beautiful. Every single song on it is wonderfully sang, and played. Josh Groban's voice is full, and rich, and flows elegently. The version of The Prayer that he does with Charlotte Church is breathtaking. His range goes all the way from semi-operatic songs such as Alla Luce Del Sole, and Gira Con Me Questa Notte, to Don McClain's Vincent (Starry Starry Night), and To Where You Are. A true delight to listen to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous !!!!","review":"I first heard Josh Groban singing in the duet with LARA FABIAN \\"For Always\\" (OST Artificial Intelligence) ... it was a great duet and that decided me to hear mora about Josh ... This first album is a great one with beatifull songs ... you have to buy it !!!A french fan ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Josh Groban is an awesome singer - whether the pronunciation of his Italian is correct is a moot point - his voice is beautiful. I am usually not a fan of his ballad type of music, but with his flawless melodies and harmonies blended with lush orchestral backgrounds, I really cannot say anything except magnifico. I truly recommend this CD to anyone with an ear for good music (most of us....)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I heard Josh Groban sing with Sarah Brightman on PBS - I knew this young man needed to be heard - thank you Ally McBeal - I downloaded \\"You're Still You\\" and impatiently waited for this CD. I have not stopped talking about his voice since I first heard him - buy this CD - and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic of Josh Groban","review":"Josh Groban is by far the best CD recorded since Andrea Bocelli's \\"Romanza\\". I am impressed that someone so young has so much vibrant talent and artistry. You can hear his heartfelt sincerity in Josh's songs. Everyone I have introduced to Josh's music fell in love with it as I did. I look forward to his next CD. This young man will someday be a household name. He is just wonderful....an inspiration for the young & old alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific CD","review":"I bought this CD at a friend's suggestion. For once, my friend was right. THis is a fantastic, romantic CD perfect for romantic evenings with chilled wine in front of a fire.Groban's voice is amazing. Its strong yet sensual quality and range of tone are nearly the equal of Pavorotti. THe songs are wonderful. I especially like \\"You're Still You\\" and Une Amore Per Sempre. Fantastic. With age and maturity, Groban will become the dominant singer of this decade, if not century!Guys, buy this CD for your girl. She'll think you're sweet and sensitive like Josh Groban and the music will definitely put her in the mood. But listen to it for yourself, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Voice","review":"When I first heard Josh Groban, I was overwhelmed by his gorgeous voice. Most young artists out there are singing \\"candy coated\\" lyrics, so it is truly wonderful to finally hear a young artist with such a beautiful voice, singing such touching lyrics. His talent and training are clearly evident. He has one of the most captivating voices and his music is sure to touch everyone in some way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I listen to this over and over and over and over and . . . .","review":"I listen largely to popular music, a musical every once and a while, and lots of Beatles and old soul music. In other words, not opera. But I love this CD. His voice is so powerful, especially for someone so young, and just simple and pure. Normally I require a more complicated, complex lyric with my pop songs (the lyrics to the popular songs \\"You're still you\\" and \\"To Where You Are\\" are rather simplistic) but it just doesn't matter here. His voice has all the complexity you require. Whether he's singing Italian or English, it doesn't matter. You just want him to keep singing.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great New Voice for the 21st Century","review":"A wonderful and lyrically powerful voice from such a young man.

This will be my third time thru the CD and it is simple fantastic. I seen Josh Groban on Oprahs Show and knew at that time I had to have his CD. It arived today, October 16th and I will not regret the purchase. As I listened to Josh on Oprahs Show, I wondered if Josh could sing classical also - believe me HE CAN and DOES fantastically. I will long cherish this CD along with those I have by Andrea Bocelli.I would like to be able to see & hear both Josh and Andrea sing togather. THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groban Review","review":"Josh's CD is absolutely sensational. A soothing, romantic, beautiful CD.

It had Italian operatic type songs and then pop songs. It made my wonder who Josh Grobin thinks he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great talent...","review":"He has a good \\"college play, or high school play\\" voice, but he'll not ever be an opera star, or a decent operetic singer. Very little magic happens here, and the cd is just typical of the commercial appeal for the every day soccer mom's who will rush to Tower Records and pick this up. This is along the same lines commercially speaking as Andrea Bucelli.Bottom line\\": Don't buy this unless your a soccer Mom, who drives a big sports utulity vihicle or a mini-van, otherwise stay away from this drek."},{"rating":"1","title":"The voice is flat","review":"his voice is empty and flat. he sings with little to no emtion. he's simply dictating the words and i cannot recommend his cd. it seems that all the 5 star reviews here are all ally macbeal fans that were watching the show. need i say more about their tastes and low intellectual level. i returned the cd. don't bother with this one. i'm saving you alot of trouble returning it. the music orchestration is also inferior and at times actually sounded staticy. Bottomline: refrain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh Groban Sucks","review":"This guy is horrible . . .see my review of his album on Epinions.com . . .he can't sing----you are a total idiot of you like this fool's voice.

Ha!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"***Wonderful***","review":"Having listened to Charlotte, Sarah Brightman, and duets with other male tenors, Josh is a breath of fresh air with superb power and clarity unmatched by few other artists! Definitely five stars - Keep your eyes on Josh as he is going places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh's debut album","review":"This album is not as good as either of his later releases.But none the less,it is magical.The English songs are mostly melancholy,and Josh's gentle yet intense voice shines through with brilliance.The Italian songs are rather empty,though.Not nearly as good as the ones in Closer.This is a great CD to own,but there are only a couple of songs that are really hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY JOSH","review":"We first saw and heard Josh on Ally McBeal, My husband and I decided we wanted to see and hear more, more. We bought our CD several months ago and listen to it in the car nearly every day. I bought a copy for my sister, now her husband is jealous of Josh. I bought copies for my massage therapist, hairdresser and best friend, I can't wait to share Josh with them as well. I also found out that Celine Dion loves Josh, too. ON MY JOSH I mean gosh, we love Josh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart, Soul, and a Voice from Heaven!","review":"I am still amazed at the beauty, clarity, and purity of Josh Groban's voice. His phrasing and annunciation are above reproach. All of those qualities combined with an eclectic offering of songs makes for a most delightful CD. The thing I'd like to thank Josh the most for, though, is that he took the high road. Instead of offering an album laden with vocal gymnastics (and he surely could have done so) he constantly surprised me with his choices. Josh Groban--a class act in the midst of all of these vulgar, classless, and talentless people calling themselves artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are no words......","review":"I was fortunate to catch the last 15 minutes of an Ally Mcbeal show last spring and was blown away by Josh Groban. I have been waiting anxiously ever since for his debut cd.There are no words to express how much I love this incredible young mans voice! Every song is absolutely beautiful. What a voice! David Foster, THANK YOU so much for finding Josh and giving this gift to the world.Josh, you are an incredible talent and I for one am looking forward to seeing you in concert when you come to the area! I give this CD to all my friends and family and the gift just keeps on giving!Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing voice!","review":"Along with Charlotte Church, with whom he duets in one of the themes of this album, Josh Groban is the most amazing lyrical debut of 2001. If you love the music of Maestro Morricone, you'll deeply enjoy his renditions of Cinema Paradiso's theme and Malena's theme, \\"You're still you.\\" Also lovely is his interpretation of \\"Jesu, Joy Of Man's Desiring.\\" It's just impressing in times where there are so many soft acts, to hear such a strong voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom's need this one!","review":"I am mom to 5 children, 3 still at home, and this is my escape cd! (We all need those!) Josh's voice just reaches my inner soul , touches my heart, and it brings me a sense of earthly peace. I studied some music in college and have always loved classical, so I am thrilled to see Josh bringing this to the forefront once again. Excellent! Recommend to all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me?","review":"I don't get it. If you like modern \\"Lite\\" Broadway musicals, you'll probably think he's great. I don't. He's pleasant enough but I think you need to be attracted to him to buy in to the whole package. Again, I don't. Check out Mario Frangoulis if you want to hear a voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groban, Future Star","review":"I first saw Josh on \\"Ally McBeal\\" last season and sat mezmerized as he sang \\"You're Still You.\\" I was in love! I told my husband that this \\"kid\\" was really going to make it, and I wondered why he hadn't recorded anything yet! I tried to read the credits to see who he was, but they were too small and too fast. Then he was on \\"Ally\\" again, and I got to hear him sing again! What a voice!One night we were at an electronics store and saw him on a video as we passed the banks of TVs. I made the whole family wait while I watched and listened to this video. I was determined to search the entire store to find a CD by him but, luckily, I didn't have to. His CD was located at the end of an aisle with the up-and-coming new stars! Good thing his picture was on the front or I still might have passed it by (I couldn't read the credits, remember?)! I intend to buy every CD this young man decides to record. What a thrill to hear him! Thanks, Josh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"God bless a mother that can give birth to a wonderful child like Josh!A rare angel that came to warm our souls! The more I listen to his music the more I feel that we are born to love, to sing, tO LIVE!His magnificent voice, so warm and tender, so strong in itself is overwhelming,it brought us joy and raised the artistic emotion to tears...Could I rate the CD with 10 stars?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous CD","review":"He really sings straight from the heart. He has such a strong and beautiful baritone voice. If you really listen to the music it can carry you away. This is one very gifted young man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Josh Groben is obviously an extraordinary talent. He has the most amazing voice, and allthough I think the songselection on this album is a little bit disappointing, the album certainly is very, very nice to listen to.To those of you who know Bocelli, and not Groben: don't believe that Groben has the same voice as Bocelli. Bocelli is stil in a league of his own, his voice is a bit warmer and deeper than Groben's. But still, Josh Groben is a very exciting new voice in the popular opera/pop music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss This One!!","review":"Never in my life have I heard a voice that has affected me so profoundly, to the extent that I'm repeatedly moved to tears while listening to it. It's true that Josh DOES indeed have the voice of an angel, and combined with the beautiful musical arrangements on this CD, it has become my most treasured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Voice","review":"I listen to music simply \\"by ear\\", meaning, I do not care about the technically of a voice as long as I like it. I have hundreds of CD's of different types of music. Josh Groban's voice is one of my most favorite. As with other commentors, I agree that Josh will refine more his voice as he grows more matured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is truly a remarkable young vocalist, with the voice of an angel. While listening, it's difficult to comprehend he is so very young, as his voice has such maturity and depth. He rivals Bocelli. He is assured a grand future, and I find it hard to believe Broadway has not found him."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmmmmmmmmmm smooth","review":"I could listen to Josh all day and nightI have a CD MP3 and rip to my phoneI want all of Josh"},{"rating":"2","title":"great DVD, NO PROBLEMS","review":"a great DVD, shipping was very good, and functioned well. Love Josh Groban's style and voice. If you love soft music , you will love this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Singer Endures","review":"Josh Groban was young and pretty-much unknown when he issued this CD. Wow, how times can change in less than a decade. Now he's in big demand, from concerts to singing the national anthem at the World Series. If you want one of America's best, if not THE best voices, you ask for Groban.This CD does not contain a lot of songs Americans can identify with, yet it still was a huge seller. That's how good Groban is, and how rare it is today to find male voices as good.Like Andrea Bocelli, Michael Buble and a few others, Josh can make any song sound absolutely beautiful, and this CD is \\"Exhibit A\\" of that. In this 2001 CD, we hear English, Italian, solos, duets....a little bit of everything, and a lot of Josh's great voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"plainly the best cd i own. his voice is strong and powerful. buy this cd, and don't be shy to play it over and over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groban","review":"Excellent CD of a superb young singer who will likely go far in the next few years.

It is romantic, mellow and beautiful :)This CD has two songs on it that are very unusual. I believe both are from Cirque de Soleil, and draw you into the music--warning-- While driving, do not close your eyes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrangements","review":"I first heard Josh Groban on the radio with \\"To Where You Are\\". It was magnificent and I decided I had to buy the CD. I was surprised (and delighted) to hear the Italian and Spanish presentations. My only criticism: Every arrangement of every song is the same. Each one contains a modulation as the \\"build up\\" to the finale. While modulation can be effective to create drama and passion to the end of a piece of music, when it is used every time, it not only loses its dramatic effect, it becomes a canned Hollywood production. Hopefully, that will be addressed in future albums. He's entitled to every opportunity to use the gift he has with attention on the substance of his voice rather than the form of each rendition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groban - Golden Voice","review":"Josh Groban is a uniquely talented and impressive individual. Once I bought his CD it was impossible to listen to any other. Since I began listening, every other artist has paled in comparison. His haunting and expressive voice has done what no other music artist has been able to in years; it made me cry. Not only from the beauty of it, but also because of the powerful emotion conveyed.The only problem I have is trying to pick a favorite song from the CD! No matter what kind of music style you are a fan of, you should buy this CD; it has something for everyone. Listening to this CD is not only enjoyable - it is an experience that will change you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful voice with a soul!","review":"This is a young man who is sure to become s megastar in the near future. Not only is his voice crisp, clean and wonderful, it is full of soul. He sings with such a passion that his voice can send shivers up your spine.The first time I heard his voice was on Ally McBeal. When he opened his mouth and sang, I was taken aback. He is so young to have such a masterful voice...Just wait, this is only the beginning!I truly enjoy this CD and play it often...even at work. You will not waste your money buying anything this artist releases!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Purely Angelic","review":"Unbelievable! Never have I heard anything closer to the voice of an angel.

I was first introduced to Josh when I was at a cast party. Things were winding down and about five of us were left with our directors. One told us that we had to hear this amazing singer, and then popped in the cd. I was amazed. Josh's voice is incredible; it's so pure and strong. He has such a hold on both the classics and contemporary pieces. As a singer myself, I can tell you that most people's voices do not completly mature until they are at least 30. The fact that a 21 year old can sound this good is incredible. I can't wait to hear him in 10 years when he's truly at his peak! He will surely be a force to be reckoned with- he is already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Tenor","review":"Josh Groban has an incredible tenor voice.

I am not one of those people who sit around and leason to classical music or anything of that nature, not that anything is wrong with that, and i love this CD. His velvet voice flows out of my speakers constantly. It is so refreshing so see someone younger creating amazing music that isn't dressed up in soda pop lyrics, thumping bass lines, and cartoon colors.To put it simply, it is a moving collection of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastico!","review":"Since I already own Josh's debut CD, his DVD and VHS, I bought the Japanese export just for the bonus trak, Mia Per Sempre. Josh's voice mesmorizes, and Mia per Sempre is another proof of this phenomena. I'm only a student of the Italian language, but one needs not speak Italian to apprecite, and fall in love with the rich baritone voice of this incredibly talented, gorgeous man."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Voice That Will Move Your Soul!","review":"Listening to Josh sing will move you and at times bring tears to your eyes it is that beautiful. I think there are a lot of singers out there with nice voices, but Josh's voice is truly a gift from God. Buy this CD and be prepared to be blown away with the beauty of his voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you like your emotions cheap.","review":"I guess the people gushing about his voice have Richard Marx and Micheal Bolton as reference point. Goban has a better voice, but not by a lot. For a classical voice it's pretty wimpy, and he has all the annoying mannerisms of Bolton and co. The way he breaks off notes, lets them trail into a sigh... Full orchestra. And synthesizers. And electronic drums. And background singers. And spanish guitars. More is more, I guess. And in sales it probably is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Each song he sings is special with his voice...but this CD is disjointed and grasping. Couldn'the producers put together a cohesive CD that flowed from one song to the other?

I have owed the CD for a few years, and thought she would like #5 on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Popera\\" at its blandest, from an opera singer-in-training","review":"I've had enough of people with weak voices who think that if they sing with enough vibrato a trite pop song with an orchestral accompaniment that it entitles them to call themselves opera singers.Yes, he has a nice voice. Yes, he's attractive. Yes, he's been on Oprah and has sung with Celine Dion.The fact is, he sings all his songs without expression, without dynamic, without feeling, without power. All his songs sound the same, and he sings them in exactly the same way. In addition to his pitifully small range, there is no variety, no edge, no venture. At least Sarah Brightman had the courage to cover a Queen song now and then. He sings with neither effort nor pleasure. And his music is certainly not pleasing to my ears.If you want good music, listen to some real operatic voices, and not Josh Groban (or Charlotte Church or Andrea Bocelli, for that matter)."},{"rating":"1","title":"All 5 stars??? I don't think so.","review":"I listened to the CD. First off - The voice is amazing. In fact, when I saw him on Ally McBeal, I fell in love. LOVE, I TELL YOU! But the song selection is not very interesting. And it's not because most of them are in Italian....they just don't suit him. I have a hard time putting this in words other than saying that he sounds like he doesn't mean what he's singing....even in Italian. Just blah. The one song I keep listening to, however, is \\"To Where You Are\\", and even that one isn't spectacular spectacular.MY SUGGESTION: Listen to it before you buy it! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't see what the fuss is about","review":"After all the hype I purchased the cd. I mean, it wasn't bad, but on the other hand I wasn't very impressed either. Nothing really grabbed me or stood out.The last duet song better done by the original artists would have been better left untouched.Maybe people notice at first glance because their not accustomed to hearing classical music or vocalists, (coming from their pop genres), or their impressed he's an American or he's young.But once that is gotten over with, what you're left with is a typical classical vocalist in a large international sea of other classical vocalists; many of whom with better voices but didn't have the American publicity machine behind them. He should take advantage of this while he can, because with the next album the novelty will wear off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"I heard Josh Groban for the first time from a duet \\"The Prayer\\" from Charlotte Church's latest album. I was so impressed I wasted no time on getting Josh's own CD. While I play it, I really had to stop everything and sit down, relax and get mesmerized and entranced from the sounds coming from him. So fresh and so talented I couldn't believe such voice will come from a young man like Josh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A boy with a gift.","review":"Thank Heavens that the powers to be at Ally McBeal chose Josh Groban for the part on the final show for the season because that made things move so much faster on discovering the quality of Josh Groban's voice.

If you think back to the special songs and special singers in you past, they can really improve your life.

Casually, I pressed a button on sessions@aol and up came this kid. Immediately rolling my eyes, \\"not another pop-baby...\\" then he began to sing.

His voice gives me goose bumps literally! If you like Andre' Bocelli you will LOVE Josh Groban. My five year old sleeps to this CD and brings it to school with her. It's soothing, it's romantic, it's powerul, it's perfect for a dinner party or just playing in the background while you work. I highly recommend it to anyone from any walk of life in any age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best!!","review":"The first time I heard him sang in one of Ally's episode, my heart sank!!

I saw Josh Groban on Charlotte Church's special and on Ally McBeal and was impressed. My 17 year old daughter has studied classical vocal performance for 3 years, so I'm headed toward this music. Groban very successfully combines both classical and contemporary music in this wonderful CD. I play it over and over and although I can't sing along with the Italian, the music stays with me.

Unlike other artist, Josh's cd stays in my car and room for looooonnnnngggg periods of time. When I turn the cd player on the first few notes of Alla Luce Del Sole lift my spirits. Even my mother (the same women who can't understand my love of Billy Gilman's music) likes Josh Groban. His voice is soothing and the music on the cd is well written. The fact that most of the songs are in Italian will throw you off in the beginning but after awhile you'll find yourself singing along. This is a great cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Voice","review":"A voice like this is seldom heard. You MUST listen to this guy sing. He is so very young, and his voice is so rich and full. I would have preferred more songs done in English, but each track of this CD is beautifully done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spell Binding and Soul Stirring!!","review":"After my first glimpse of Josh Groban on PBS, singing with his heart and soul, I had to run out and buy the Josh Groban CD. I feel what he sings and that is how he portrays his songs. It was easy to fall in love with his beautiful voice and easy manner. I sing along with Josh and have learned to sing in Italian, which is my heritage. I can't hear him enough and I look forward to his every new appearance and expect him to be in the category with all the Italian GREATS! Move over Andrea Bocelli. Make room for Josh Groban. I hope to see him perform with Pavarotti soon. He has me spellbound and stirs my soul! He is a rising comet shooting through the stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groben","review":"This is a phenomenal CD!! Love each & EVERY song on it! When Josh Groben sings he literally makes you FEEL each & every word in EVERY SONG he sings. His music will touch your very soul.

He is TRUELY a gifted singer & I am looking forward to ALL his future CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The True Voice of an Angel","review":"This CD is truly wonderful. Josh's voice is incredible.

I hope there are many many more like this to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"my view of this music","review":"incredable sound, the man touches nerves, when he sings i cant help but listen it grabs my feelings and caresses them in sensitive feelings of joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply beautiful music...","review":"I was more than overwhelmed and awed by Josh Roban's rich, powerful voice. This extremely moving music filled me with emotion... It is, indeed, a high quality album that everyone should have. I'm just thrilled I came across it. Without it, I would surely be missing something wonderful. 'You're still you', 'alla luce del sole', and 'un amore per sempre' are just lovely. I'd rate this album higher than 5 stars if I could. I'll be the first one buying Josh Roban's next one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CAPTIVATING","review":"I completely disagree with the reviews that spoke about how the songs were boring and that the lyrics were less then enjoyable. When I come home after a rough day at work and stick the cd in, it seems as though all my frustrations seem to slip away with every verse. He makes you want to take a deep breath and think no matter whats going on in the world everything is going to work out fine. I have just recently found an interest in classical music and that is mainly because of Mr. Josh Groban. I will enjoy watching him in the future. He has a voice that can take the listener to a place similar to a dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate and enduring","review":"I must admit that I had no idea who Josh Groban was until I heard the song To Where You Are on the radio like 20,000 times. Unfortunatly, except for the last time, I never heard who had sung it. When I found out I went to the store to buy the cd. I must say I did not like it at first. I would skip to the one song and wouldn't listen to anything else. But one day I just started to listen to the whole thing and I loved it! His voice is so full of passion when he sings and he really makes the lyrics come to life. I would recommend this cd to anyone who wants to step away from the conventional sounds of music and find something with a little more depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I'm in love all over again!!!","review":"Wow! What a voice! He should be 22 yrs old by now, born and raised in Los Angeles, California. He sings in perfect Italian, Spanish (song #6), and of course in English. Trilingual by talent and chance. It'd be a BIG mistake to let this CD pass you by! I'm hooked in Josh and his songs especially No. 7: \\"Canto Alla Vitta\\"...not to mention numbers 1: \\"Alla Luce Del Sole\\", 3: \\"You're Still You\\", 4: \\"Cinema Paradiso (Se)\\"-he starts this song with \\"Se\\"(...beautiful!), 6: \\"Alejate\\" (this one's in Spanish), 8: \\"Let Me Fall\\", 10: \\"Un Amore Per Sempre\\", and 12: \\"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\\". What a wonderful gift he's received from up above! Josh is not only talented, but also playful and human! You'll understand if you own a copy of Josh Groban in Concert Live (DVD). Don't forget to take him along with you wherever you go, especially if you drive to and from work. What a great way to start and end your day! Enjoy your ride with Josh Groban!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice but song selections too schmaltzy","review":"There's no question that Josh Groban has a stunning, unforgettable voice. That's why it's such a shame that he chose so many \\"fluffy\\" songs on this CD. While \\"Alla Luce Del Sole\\" and Gira Con Me Questa Notte\\" are excellent choices, \\"You're Still You,\\" and \\"Vincent\\" neither show off his voice to prime advantage nor show us the depth of emotion of which he is clearly capable. I'd hate to see him go the way of Whitney Houston and Celine Dion -- gorgeous voices singing only pap and insipid popular songs. I'd love to see Groban do more classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music, beautiful voice","review":"I bought two Cd's based on hearing his \\"one\\" song on the radio-You Raise Me Up. I think that his talent lies in his many other selections as they showcase his range and versitility. \\"Josh Groban\\" captures the richness of his voice much better than \\"Closer\\". I appreciate his selection of Italian music but would greatly enjoy a CD completely in English. Regardless, you can't go wrong with any Josh Groban CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"More, please.","review":"This young man has an amazing voice.

Although i prefer Rochmaninoff and Rossini, when in the mood for a type of modern music this cd is wonderful. It is very hard for modern musicians to maintain decency and still appeal to the multitude. but this cd has accomplished it. \\"Alejate\\" was absolutely wonderful and the backround to \\"un amore per sempre\\" was very nice. The only complaint that i have is with \\"the prayer\\". josh, it was beautiful. charlotte, pretty, but the richness in josh's voice makes her voice sound very weak. but other that that... absolutely wonderful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album - Easy Listening","review":"This is for everyone who enjoys listening to ONE great VoicesI sure hope that he cuts a couple singles so they also can be enjoyed by everyone on the radio toooooo"},{"rating":"2","title":"RX: LISTEN TO JOSH EVERYDAY","review":"I HAVE LISTENED TO JOSH'S CD JUST ABOUT EVERYDAY SINCE IT CAME OUT IN NOVEMBER.

Josh has a very projective voice, but I've noticed his range is not too diverse. He can master his nature voice, but limited on hitting high tenor notes. He managed to record a duet with the legendary Barbra Streisand, wherein Barbra's voice towers over Josh voice, but this is expected. Josh has a while to go, but he is impressive for his age. If you want to hear an excellent tenor who can hit all sorts of notes buy the CD \\"Only You\\" from Alessandro Safina. Mr. Safina has an amazing voice and great song selections. In my opinion, Alessandro is more diverse than Bocelli and Watson."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine voive no OPERA singer","review":"Josh has a very fine voice suited to many of the better show tunes, weber, bernstein etc. Perhaps even many neopolitan songs.Funny all those trying to capitlize on the ITALIAN thing.He is not in the same leauge althought only twenty he does have time to grow, in fact while attending music school, I heard many many voices as fine as his, the trick is to be around at 30 and then hope that the public wants to hear that type of music and his type of voice. All of a sudden every new voice singing pop music is called \\"operatic\\" they are not!!Can't wait to get my complete CD will enjoy it I'm sure but lets stop with the operatic voice. After studing for over 10 years, my first question to those who lable Josh as \\"operatic\\" what does he sound like WITHOUT a mic and all those great new recording methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply AMAZING!","review":"Josh Groban's voice is one of the most amazing ones I have ever heard in my life.

This guy is talented and I can't wait for his next disc to be released...whenever that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful voice","review":"I love classical crossover music, and I'm afraid that I can't exactly identify why I like Josh Groban so much except for his voice! :-) This CD is great for studying and reading. It's versatile in that it can be used for background music or can be cranked up and sung along to. Soothing, soaring, beautiful... I just *like* it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop, look and listen","review":"I'm not an Ally McBeal fan. When they aired the rerun of the episode which Josh made his first debut I was getting ready for work. I was already late but when Josh started to sing, I was so mesmerized by his voice there was nothing I would do but stop, look and listen.I got the cd a week ago and I haven't stop listening to this album, particularly \\"You still you\\" and \\"To where you are\\". Groban's voice is so strong and rich that you can't help but feel moved by his baritone voice no matter what language you understand and what language he sings.Music is the esperanto of souls, whatever your preference in music maybe if you don't love at least one song in this album then you're not really listening. I hope he'd make another album quickleee!The missing star on this humble opinion is because I wish there would be more songs like \\"You still you\\", \\"To where you are\\", \\"Vincent\\", and \\"Home to stay\\" - I'm not that literate :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of \\"bait and switch\\"","review":"I ordered this as a birthday gift for myself.

It has a band of Japanese(?)writing on it, but otherwise it is just the same 13 track CD you can purchase anywhere, but I paid $37 for it.

This young man's voice is a God's gift. There's no other word to describe him but \\"Truly Amazing\\". I hope to catch him if he ever has a concert in the Los Angeles area.

The whole music selections are excellent, and yet, Josh is still too young to sing with \\"heart ache\\" feeling for pieces like \\"To where you are\\" and \\"You are still you\\". Perhaps someday he will be as good as Alessandro Safina."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last-A whole CD of Josh Groban!","review":"My family and I have been Josh Groban fans for several years, after seeing him live with Sarah Brightman in the La Luna tour. His voice brings goosebumps to the skin! Of course, seeing him in the 1st Allie McBeal was a treat - can't wait for the 2nd visit on Dec. 10. But we have been waiting with great anticipation for an entire CD of Josh. This new CD did not disappoint, and the goosebumps were there for some time! His range is wonderful, and the breadth of songs included showcases his talent and gives a hint of even more wonderful music to come. The orchestration is full and rich on the CD, with the only wish to have the music mixed a bit under, so we can hear the most of Josh's incredible, gifted voice. We can't wait to hear the next CD, and to hear more duets with some of the well-known stronger female vocalists, for whom Josh is every bit a wonderful match. Bravo Josh, and many more to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy trancends the genre","review":"I am not a classical singer fan , I find that most singers in this field sound phoney and pompous. but this man is amazing He has managed to totally turn my thinking on it's headI can't wait for the next album ."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOD!!","review":"I have been listening to this recording with my mouth gapping wide open. It is truly awesome to think this young man just turned 21 years old. The richness andpure beauty of his voice leaves this listener stunned.I have noticed alot in the media lately, especially since his stint on \\"ALLY McBeal\\" and all signs point to a superstar on the rise. I usually don't pay much attention to Professional Critics, but this time they are right on the markJosh Groban is someone very special.. You must hear this voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotive, passionate give to your love","review":"The wonderful song \\"You're still you\\" on a recent Ally McBeal rerun made me get on the Internet to try to find out something, anything about the singer. Josh Groban is a wonder and his love songs brought a pang to my heart! Open a bottle of wine, light the fireplace, put this CD on and share it with the one you love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love Josh!!","review":"Even though I don't speak a word of Italian I find myselfsinging along with Josh Groban. This is my 2nd purchaseof his CDs - What a wonderful and powerful voice!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I'm A Grobanite!!!!","review":"Josh Groban's break-through is nothing but astounding you can simply tell that all he has is non-forced talent that has been taken care of and well-nutured by years of faithful toturing... Not only that but, despite his new-found fame he remains a very down to earth person. You can tell that there is nothing generic or fake about Groban.I listen and re-listen to his C.D. hundreds of times on my iPod. Each time I listen to \\"Your'e Still You\\" and \\"Home to Stay\\" I find myself falling in love with his charming voice. You can tell by his smooth sounds that there is nothing forced about it.This C.D. is great for any easy-listening fan or any good music fan... I love this C.D. and all in all it's one of the best C.Ds I own. Please buy this C.D. I promise you it's more than worth it's price-tag!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any fan!","review":"Being a huge fan of the singer, Josh Groban -- aka a Grobanite -- I bought this CD for the one song not available on the U.S. release of Josh's debut CD. I was concerned about paying such an exhorbitant amount of money for one song, but I was not disappointed!!!\\"Mia Per Sempre\\" is so heartbreakingly beautiful I was almost brought to tears on first hearing it. Josh sings this song with a pathos not heard in any other of his Italian love songs. The only song I prefer over \\"Mia Per Sempre\\" is the gorgeous \\"Gira Con Me,\\" which also appears on this CD.If you are a fan of Josh's buy this CD -- you'll be glad you did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groban","review":"I am not an opera fan, but he has such a fantastic voice and style. Listening to his music relaxes me and makes me feel good."},{"rating":"2","title":"He has a wonderful voice....","review":"I bought this CD yesterday and have listened to it more than a couple dozen times. Josh Groban definitly has a beautiful voice, but in some ways he might need a bit more maturing to do with his singing skills and whatnot. The best tracks are the first and the third. The first song shows his abilities in the best way, and \\"Your're Still You\\" is such a lovely piece of music that nobody could not like it.Although I only gave the album four stars it's not because I didn't like it. I love it. It's just that I think if he were given the chance Josh Groban could do much better. If he releases new albums in the future - and I really hope he gets to, crossing my fingers! - I think they would be much better ones. This is not his best. That's the only reason why I gave 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST","review":"I have one for my car, my boat and my house. Now I'm buying another for my office. Need I say more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, but won't fool a pro","review":"While I ADORE his voice, I admire that he has chosen not to do 'real' opera until his voice has matured more. \\"Gira Con Me\\" and others are in Italian, and have almost a Puccini tone to them, they are modern compositions. I especially love his rendition of \\"Vincent\\". I am looking forward to his next CD and am glad to hear a voice on the radio of someone who can actually SING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice!","review":"I saw Josh Groban on Ally Mcbeal and had to check him out. I'm so glad I did. He has an amazing voice. With Josh and Clay Aiken, hopefully this vocal pop will start to shine again. Actually, Josh is more classically trained. He has great vocal prowess and shows it on the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"This stuff is garbage. Normally, I'd just say oh, I don't like so-and-so's music or something like that, but this drives me mad. The fact that this drivel is selling is a reflection of the sad fact that religious right-wingers are gaining power in the US. Someone once played this for me when I said I liked opera. Nooooo, opera is a classical music form. This Groban is a Christian light rock singer. I know all the Christian rock lovers are going to give this review bad marks, but HA HA...I'm glad to be able to do my part toward decreasing the 5 stars this trashheap got. Wish I could give zero. A sad commentary on where our culture is going."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it makes my head hurt","review":"This guy Groban is a corny kook. He sings sappy, awful love songs. The fact that so many people like him shows how stupid so many people are. When I see him on TV looking all mopey and dopey, I want to punch him in the face. If you like horrible junk like Celine Dion and Clay Aiken, you'll probably like Josh Groban too."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Not enough stars to rate this album","review":"Josh Groban's music is incredible. I purchased this album last year and still listen to it every morning when I wake up. Even my teenage sons admit that Groban's voice is great. His choice of songs is wonderful- each one gets better and better. I enjoy this album as much today as I did the first time I listened. Josh Groban is truly a treasure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At least he's not Charlotte Church!","review":"Like Charlotte Church, Josh Groban is very gifted to have such a beautiful, mature voice at a young age. The selections here show off his warm, rich, sound, but it is easy to tell that his singing technique is juvenille even if his voice sounds mature. The color and depth of his voice lends itself well to classical music, but the vibrato doesn't spin evenly and there are a few intonation (pitch) problems that are surprisingly apparent. It is obvious that the recordings here are doctored with lots of reverb--hearing him unamplified would be interesting. If he follows the footsteps of Charlotte Church, however, and includes real opera arias on his next CD, he will be well on his way to ruining his voice prematurely. In my opinion, he should have stayed in school and developed a more solid singing technique before venturing out into the recording industry! I'd hate to see a voice like that suffer the same fate as Charlotte Church's."},{"rating":"1","title":"The voice was beautiful but...","review":"He should of saved his money/voice for a good recording studio. Josh's exquisite voice was drowned out by the music.."},{"rating":"1","title":"still needs maturing","review":"The music is fine when you hear it in an elevator or in the supermarket. But any more than that, you will notice that his voice isn't ready for prime time yet. It's good, but just not good enough.Give him a few more years to mature his voice"},{"rating":"1","title":"He is not Andrea!","review":"Very nice for a young fellow. Lovely voice. He definitely does not have Andrea Bocelli's \\"animal magnetism\\". Andrea sings in English, Italian and Spanish also, but he can tear your heart out with a beautiful ballad and thrill you with a soaring aria with high notes that just float on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reincarnation of Karen Carpenter?","review":"Beautiful voice but what schlock he sings. I hope someday he puts his voice into some serious music instead of this sentimental 3-hankie pop. This album gets old fast unless maybe you just broke up with your boyfriend and you're eating too much chocolate.Sweet like those photos of kittens playing with yarn, but I was hoping for a lot more here."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD is a Joke! *Warning*","review":"I was stupid enough to ignore the other 1 star review and bought this DVD anyway. It is very poor quality the instructor CAN NOT teach, and its true his lip licking is VERY anoying and the audio and video is very poor quality. I've never felt the need to write a review but this DVD was so bad I just had to let people know!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable and false advertised","review":"You can only learn so much by watching a DVD on programming, but with a poor teacher and no reference material that allows for practice of the content, it isn't worth the money spent to get it to the door let alone the money spent on the purchase itself.1. No source code.2. Advertized website to get source code or practice material covered doesn't exist.3. Teaching poor at best.4. Odd ticks from an instructor that is unprepared throughout the presentation.5. Video and sound quality terrible.6. Missing content from what is advertized on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Unless you are a die hard Uma Thurman fan, avoid this movie at all cost. The only redeeming quality of the movie is that you get to see Uma's first starring role in a major motion picture.

No two tracks are the same so each song is a pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staton C.500 Commercial Dual-CD Player","review":"The Staton C.500 dual-CD player unit works fine for my application as a basic music player component.

I still remember that day and the game to this day. I was rooting for the Packers.I enjoyed the bio summaries on Tim Brown, Ted Dean, and a few of the other Eagles. Unfortunately though the book was too much quoting of former Eagles and not enough narrative by the author. I didn't know that the Eagles were originally called the Yellow Jackets.An huge Eagles fan of that era may enjoy the book more than I did, but I still don't think the book would merit more than 3*."},{"rating":"2","title":"great NFL history","review":"Terrific book that taught me more NFL history than I ever knew. And, I loved the profiles of the players - two of them Hall of Famers (Bednarik & Tommy McDonald). I saw McDonald at his induction ceremony a few years ago. I didn't know who he really was at the time. This book really brought him to life - brought his era to life, too. I like the style of the book. It's easy reading, & you enjoy it, but you learn a lot in spite of yourself. I wish my college classes were like that! Did the author ever consider teaching! Anyway, the book moves along great whether you lived then, or whether it's 20 years before you were born (like me). I recommend it for young NFL fans to find out how this football thing got rolling"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovingly crafted Poetry","review":"A compelling and delicious book. A wonderful voice that is startling in its power to move, interest and delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typically Great Product from Men at Arms Series","review":"This book is one of the typically great products available in the Men at Arms Series. It has excellent graphics and pictures, and each volume contains enough detailed information to be interesting, but not enought to overwhelm the military \\"hobbyist\\" reader.

Has signal one day on some streets and not another.4.

I bought my first unit to utilize on my motorcycles as this is the only reasonably priced waterproof unit I could find and was happy with a previous Magellan gps. Liked it so much as a general use gps that I've recently purchased another as a Christmas gift for my daughter. The interface, especially with the upgrade including boating and backpack use, is quite nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Unit","review":"Great unit, but it does not come with the crossover upgrade. It has to be purchased, seperatly. Unit works well and text to speech sounds good. Has a great battery life. Suction cup mount works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"2200t","review":"I've had this product 3 months. It would be a good product to get you from an airport to most addresses. I bought it for local use and found that about a third of the time it did not have the roads I was looking for. One time it sent me in the opposite direction I needed to go! There web sight had no updates even though this model had been out for well over a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really have crossover maps","review":"Like another reviewer, I bought this several months ago based on the promise of crossover maps. I'm beginning to doubt that Magellan has any intention of ever providing them.It does okay on the road, but I had hoped for something that would eliminate the need for two units. I would not recommend just because I don't feel comfortable recommending a product from a company I can't trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Advertised","review":"I purchased this unit in early December of 2006, based on the promise and news release from Magellan that the unit could be upgraded to a Crossover unit that I could also use offroad on my ATV. The Crossover 2500 (which does both of these functions) had not been released at that point, so I purchased this 2200T unit based on Magellan's promises. It is now almost eight months later, and still no upgrades are available. Magellan's poor Customer Service Dept. keeps making false promises as to a release date and they have now removed almost all mention of the upgrade from their advertising. If I wanted an on-road only GPS unit I would have purchased a Garmin. Think twice before buying this unit...!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Magellan Roadmate 2200t","review":"Don't buy unless you like outdated roadmaps and poor customer service. Magellan apparently doesn't plan on providing parts for their products. The cradle broke right after I purchased the unit, I went to their website and ordered a replacement. I have been waiting over a month now, I have had contact with service dept. twice, but was a waste of my time. The part is on backorder with status of 'availabilty unknown'. You either hold it in your hand or lay it down to use it. I have a Nuvi 350 that is much better, and the maps are excellent ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift for my Dad","review":"This was a present for my Dad. He absolutely loves it.

The unit worked well for two days, then it started acting up. It constantly froze up and had to be reset. When it did stay on it kept rebooting itself for no apparent reason.

I just purchased the Nuvi 350, i hope i have a better story to tell about that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth its price","review":"I moved to a new town, thinking that with Magellan GPS getting around will become easier. The unit is useless in remote areas. I have used it for a few days and it is a complete flop. Absolute wrong directions.

It's easy to use and indestructible"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!","review":"I purchased this Because of Price and learned that going cheaper isn't allways better. I used it three times and now the unit won't even turn on. I've called customer service and get some guy in India who I could barely understand.

Reasons?1. Satellite lock takes from 5 to 10 minutes, even after latest software updates. Isn't it vaunted SirfstarIII chip set?2. It's reacts slow. Even the speed is 30mph and you missed your turn and the next possible turn is in 100 yards range it takes 1-2 sec to understand what I missed the turn, 2-3 sec to recalculate the route and no time left to tell you about next turn. So you missed the turn again and again and again.3. Some places, developed more than 2 years ago are still not on the map. I saw it in Newport, VT4. POI database is very old and limited."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont recommend","review":"i bought the 2200t and returned it after 2 days. it froze on me a few times while in route.

I then bought a garmin and have been very satisfied for the past week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Street","review":"I have found that many streets that I have tried to navigate to are not present on the system. Sub-divisions that have been around for about 2 years are not there. There was a part of an interstate that was also missing. I went to the Magellan website and submitted a support request but that went unanswered. I have a friend that paid $100 more and got a Garmin. So far he has not had a street not show up on his system. Navteq has the addresses on file, but it appears that Magellan has not put out an update.

Turning the system on the first time is not intuitive. There is a power button but it will only work if the covered reset switch is on \\"1\\" instead of \\"0\\". This was something I called customer service for to figure out. Beyond that I never needed a manual again. As soonas the unit is running everything is self explanitory. The menus are easy to use. Its directions are precise and satellite reception is not an issue. If you dont have all the bars youre likely to be inside a building. For most people I would say this unit does everything you ever will need and the price is competitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but not alas perfect","review":"I've used the Roadmate 2200T for about 2 months including a trip fron NYC to New Orleans and Florida.

I'm glad I can report that this game features some of the most addictive, pick up and play gameplay, as well as stunning graphics. The sheer size of the city, coupled with traffic and pedestrians dodging out of your way shown in beautiful high resolution graphics is jaw dropping. This is one of those rare occasions when a home game(of an arcade translation) features that \\"sheen\\" of smooth flowing eye candy. I've had this game for one day, and already my room is becoming very popular in my dormitory!

With the top limit of a 10 minute game no matter how well your doing. Lets face it racing around crashing into anything and everything gets a bit boring fast...I think Crazy Taxi needs to be put in the garage and taken out when you need to entertain a group of 11 year olds. What is really bad is the graphics are wonderful but the objective of the game is simplistic and overall unsatisfying. Dream Cast has a great potentential, do yourself a favor and pass on this one, unless your under 13."},{"rating":"1","title":"diminishing returns","review":"The first hour I played it, it was fantastic!

I cannot tell you the countless hours my roomate and I have played this game! It does tend to get a bit boring after playing it to death, but the Crazy Box levels (think mini-games) keep the challenge going, as you try to complete them and unlock even more levels.

How many times can you drive variations on the same person to KFC? I think the game could have used some additional features. First, your taxi should be able to sustain damage. There is no penalty for driving head-on into a semi other than a slight delay. Second, the taxi should have an ejection seat to get rid of unwanted fares. Many of the fares are picked up on accident when arriving at a destination. Finally, there should be cities other than the San Francisco knockoff. The repetition in this game was very disappointing. While I don't think Crazy Taxi is a terrible game, I would simply suggest you play the game before you buy it. I bought this game without playing it first and was very disappointed; I hope this review prevents the same from happening to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant play","review":"Once you play the first scene, all others are the same. You have the same type of customers and the same moves within the cities. I got bored after 30 minutes of play. The only highlight of the game were the soundtrack from hit bands, The Offsprings and Bad Religion. One of the bad games Sega had made."},{"rating":"1","title":"game gets old quick","review":"this game is fun at first, but quickly proceeds to being boring! i'd rather play grand theft auto for a good system, that way you can have the same amount of fun as you do with crazy taxi (you can be a taxi driver in GTA3)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"This is a good game, but I would buy Crazy Taxi 2 now and not 1. 2 has a bunch of more features that are worth the extra $20.00 or so extra."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most one dimensional game ever","review":"No game has ever been able to create boredom so quickly as this one-dimensional piece of garbage.for a contrast, check out how this entire game is encompased (and better done) in a very small side-mission in GTA3"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but...","review":"i think this game has some pretty awesome gameplay but itdidn't keep me playing it simply got boring finding out that thereisn't anything to do. And you can't tell your friends that you beatthe game because there never was a game-beating goal.So save your money and buy Resident Evil3 or Dead or Alive2. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Taxi","review":"A very satisfying game. If your thinking of buying it, don't, just go buy it now. If you have played the arcade version, just add an extra stage, optional time limits andd the crazy box and you get Crazy Taxi for Dreamcast. Buy it. Its one of those games that you actually want to play after a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 Stars... almost perfect.","review":"First of all I would like to say I love this game and think it is the best driving game, at least for the Dreamcast. But I really would've liked multiplayer and also the game gets boring after 30-45 min of playing. (It's not one of those games you play for really long periods of time, but you have many short plays) Overall it lots of fun... Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Taxi","review":"This game was good back in the day when I was younger. But now I wouldnt be as interested in playing it. But the game has pretty good graphics. The city scenes are pretty nice. The gameplay isnt bad, has pretty good control over the Taxi you drive and stopping etc. Its fun picking up people then afterwards dropping them off at their certain destination within a certain amount of time. And you have to drive through heavy traffic etc. Fun game but VERY repetitive. The WHOLE game is this. You cant really unlock anything. There isnt much to do in this game. Theres some Mini Games, that are easy and dont take long to beat at all. So what do to after that? No idea, play original mode. But its a decent game for a certain amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for a while","review":"I had heard a lot of good things about Crazy Taxi, so when I came across a copy for just a few dollars, I figured I'd buy it. It is a lot of fun. Good game play, humor, and Offspring for its soundtrack. There's not a whole lot I can say bad about it. Except for one thing, and this is a problem everyone has, it gets old quick. You can play for an hour or so, and then you have to put it away for a few days or a week. It doesn't have much staying power, which is what is important with a game. Still, it is fun, and it's a good game to play until you get your copy of Grand Theft Auto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lotsa fun for about a half an hour...","review":"This game is fun, but after you've got the gist, that's all folks! I will try other's suggestions to play it at a party - but I don't play it by myself anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy it is","review":"Now first of all, let's get this straight. i dont like dreamcast's and i dont like many of their games and i never will but this is one exception. Crazy taxi is one of the most original and most playable games i have seen for years but... you wont be playing it for long. You'll buy it, get home and play it straight away for hours, and then the next day for a little less time, then you've done it all and you wont see it again for a few months. Unless you have alot of friends over, this game is going to be brought out of the box very often. It gets extremely repetitive and is very easy, but get's 4 stars because it is such a good game.i suggest - dont buy it because you wont get much for your money but rent it out instead because it is a class game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets old Fast!","review":"This game looks awesome but should have been left at the arcades. The game is fun for 30 min but after you've driven all over the city two or three times it gets old fast. At best rent the game for a day and I'm sure you'll feel the same way. But if you just want a game to impress your buddies with and have lots of extra cash get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool game","review":"cool game. if you have a dreamcast you should get this game. i love this game. you will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's fun, but I can only get so far...","review":"Admittedly I'm not very good at these games, however I love to drive so this game was right up my alley!! It's fun and for me it took me a while to learn all of the tricks (I don't know them all either.) I have the strategy book, which was of no help. Well the book did have the map of the city.Anyway, if you like wild driving you'll like this. I figure everyone has this classic title so no need in convincing you to get it. Just get it (...)Crazy Taxi 2 has different drivers and a different city. Same fun though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy Taxi Is Not So Good","review":"If you are thinking about buying the game change your mind!!!!!

I thought it would be fun to play the role as a taxi driver in a big city. Instead I found a very frustrating game with absolutely no single player game. Instead you can play for about 60secs, 3min, 5min, or 10min. In the 60 second game you try your best to end up ranking 52nd and getting a class D liscense. Oh did I mention you also get laughed at by ranking last against no one! I got tired of Crazy Taxi after i played it for about 20 minutes. I returned that day and got NHL2k. If you are not interested in the racing and just want to have fun driving around this game is still not for you. It was repetitive and too difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"THIS IS A GREAT GAME IF U PLAN ON PLAYING IT FOR 10 MINUTES. THIS GAME GETS VERY VERY BORING VERY VERY QUICK. I DONT RECOMEND BUYING THIS ... CUZ THERES NO ONLINE OR MULTI-PLAYER GAMEPLAY. BOOOOOOOOOOOO. I ONLY RECOMEND BUYING THIS GAME IF UR 9 YEARS OLD. (MAYEB IT WONT GET AS BORING AS FAST)... ( I WOULDVE GAVE IT 2 STARS BUT MY GIRL LIKES IT SO I GOTTA GIVE IT SOME CREDIT)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Game Play Experience","review":"This was a good game, sounds and graphics are excellent. Controlling the Taxi is easy. The optional play modes, being able to choose minutes, allows less experienced players to play longer. The only trouble I had, the special moves are not explained very well in the instructions, I had to look elsewhere for an alternate explanation, otherwise I would never have mastered them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable. A frustrating guide for the traveler!","review":"At first glance this book seemed like the ideal guide for tourists or native New Yorkers, but when I actually pulled it out to use it found that the navigation system was hard to follow and not even accurate! The establishments I went to had the wrong address!! I went to call to verify another address before traipsing over there and the phone number was out of service!! After I noticed these mistakes I looked closer and saw that the facts were wrong. I decided the maps were worth one star, but the reliability factor was nil. By the author hype on the cover I excpected a masterpiece! This was a big letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"D@mn confusing","review":"I'm a New Yorker, and this book made simple trips seem complicated.

I moved to Queens from Manhattan a couple of years ago, and I would have been lost (literally) without it. It also helped me navigate my way through Brooklyn as I searched for apartments there -- and it's small enough to fit easily in a purse or backpack. As a former long-time Manhattanite, I find this book invaluable for finding my way around those other mysterious boroughs. Anyone who can't follow it doesn't know how to read a map..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL! This book of maps makes all of NYC yours!","review":"I've now been using this extraordinary book for more than a year, and it's been an amazing gift! I've explored NY from end to end--from City Island, the Bronx, to Tottenville, Staten Island, and all around Brooklyn and Queens (besides my home borough of Manhattan). The maps are aesthetically beautiful, wonderfully accurate, so easy to read, and full of useful info--post offices, subway stops, and more. In this walker's town, having the right map expands your horizons in every way. If you love the city and dream of seeing it in all its glory, this is your true companion. It belongs in the pocket or backpack of every New York resident, visitor, and fan. It's also a spectacularly appreciated gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for R.E.M. fans","review":"When it was released in 1983, R.E.M.'s first album, Murmur, immediately became one of my favorites. Sounding (and looking) completely unlike anything else at the time, the songs spoke to me even when I wasn't sure exactly what Michael Stipe was singing.After reading this excellent book from the always excellent 33-1/3 series, I'm beginning to understand that maybe that was the point.The book is much more than just a lengthy 'review' of the album; it also provides insightful background on the group and an intelligent examination of theories on songwriting, performing and recording. I listen to Murmur now with an increased sense of understanding and connection. This book is highly recommended for anyone, and absolutely esssential for the R.E.M. fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"mer rumrum","review":"its difficult to appreciate a book written in the style of no-wave dadfa enhanced mutuality before the settlement of refugees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry folks, too pretentious for rock and roll","review":"This, to me, is the weakest in the great 33 1/3 series that I have read. While the author is certainly knowledgable and learned, the prose is thick and I found myself skimming through long passages. This album was a seminal one for me as well (although I was slightly older than the author at time of release) and so while my interest in the topic was very high, I didn't feel this book added anything to my appreciation of it, other than some interesting sequences regarding recording details. I believe that rock and roll can be written about from a serious and analytical point of view, but this reads like a bad thesis from a general studies major."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly thought provoking","review":"I really didn't expect much when a friend guided me to this book. All he mentioned was the track by track analysis of instrumentation and arrangement. But the amazing part of this book is the latter section dealing with language and the effectiveness of non-linear, yet familiar lyrics in evoking feelings beyond logic and language. I became consciously aware of an intuitive process through the shared experience of the record and the author's thoughtful considerations. Quite a bargain for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"deconstructing pop culture","review":"This is one of the best books on contemporary music I've ever read. Murmur 33 1/3 explores the band [REM] and most impressively, the historical and cultural context in which the music was recorded. Niimi deconstructs Murmur with surgical precision while leaving ample room for your subjective interpretation. If you like REM, you will absolutely love this book. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good reference for intermediate user.","review":"This is a very good tutorial that covers a wide array of topics in Java. It has excellent audio and video quality. It covers from simple \\"Hello World\\" application to advanced topics such as JDBC and advanced syntax. However, the structure of the topics is not well designed for the beginner. I like it because I am in an intermediate level in Java programming and everything seems very clear to me. Still, it would be a little difficult for a beginner in Java to learn Java from this tutorial.

I found them on myspace and after listening to \\"Everyone's a Winner\\" I was hooked. After buying the album you can tell that this band is different from any band out there at the moment. My favorite part about them is the incorporation of piano and trumpets in their songs. The singers voice is amazing as it crackles and gives a \\"raw\\" feeling in some songs and a soft and warm sound in others. This is one of the few CD's I can actually say I can listen to without skipping a single track.Although I wouldnt recommend paying this much for this album, its definetly worth your listening time. I can guarentee you can get it for much cheaper from iTunes or Marketplace.If you just want to listen to a few standout tracks, I would recommend \\"Grasshopers In Honey\\" and \\"Everyone's A Winner\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight forward & entertaining!","review":"I would imagine the book is just like the vhs video. I loved it. The information is given in a women's conference setting. Dr. Turner gives great warnings on traps women can and do fall into. I've witnessed some of what she talked about. She makes you go wow, you're right and also have you crying laughing. Great info for women's group.Through God's word, Dr. Turner, caringly yet firmly and with humor, tells us like it is. She's empowering us with information to follow God's plan in order to not fall into a lot of sex traps laid out before us.Awesome!I'm looking for the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of overblown and a bit paranoid.","review":"I think the author has had very bad experiences with some of the women in her church and so she now thinks every woman is out to get her man and lay a sex trap. This book was amusing and it's mercifully short but like someone else has previously said, it's not that bad in the church where people are constantly devising sex traps for eachother. And what about the men? She seems to place a ton of responsibility on the women alone. Why am I not surprised?"},{"rating":"2","title":"believe the hype","review":"This is an awesome album. The guitars of TV Sky and Only Heaven are almost all gone, in favor of heavier electro-industrial beats. The electronics are really tight, and the production is as good or better than any of their other albums. In a perfect world, you would hear \\"Lucidogen\\" or \\"Supersonic\\" on the radio. Also, Ipecac Records will soon be releasing this in the US, so it might be in the stores and cheaper soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"mere mortals","review":"A bit disappointing. The Young Gods used to be at least five years ahead of everybody else. They were so far ahead of the game they appear to have lost their way somewhat. This new album is very techno but lacks good tunes. Everything sounds over-processed and stilted. It is also very badly mastered, my tip is to play it twice as loud as normal to get some decent noise out of it. I saw them play it live in London last week and it sounded much better but still very pale against the earlier material."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad Slow Food doesn't taste this bland","review":"I wish I could say this book was a good effort, but the fact that it's cut and spliced from various articles makes it a very disjointed reading experience.

Instead, it is an affordable, carefully chosen selection from Eliza Haywood's _Female Spectator_ (a magazine-like publication that ran for several years). The introduction is top-notch. I own this book and refer to it often. This is a great book to read a little at a time. It gives wonderful insight into issues of 18th-century life for women (marriage, manners, and morals).

It was a nice surprise to find that I enjoyed this album as much as I did.His song selection is quirky and fun. The perfect blend of familiar and obscure. His musical styling is unique giving the songs a personal twist and making even 'Cry Me A River' and \\" My Foolish Heart' seem fresh. If 'Maybe You Didn't Hear Me' doesn't bring a tear to your eye then you have no soul. And 'Cry Without A Reason', a sometime staple of cabaret acts, has rarely been done this sweetly. The medley of 'Just Around The Riverbend' and 'Corner of the Sky', is fun and fresh, and the vocal arrangement on Nobody's Side ( a long time personal favorite ) is wonderful. I've had a hard time turning this album off since I got it. I really loved this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally The CD...","review":"I saw Scott Coulter on tour with Stephen Schwartz last year, and was completely blown away by the beauty and control of his gorgeous tenor voice. His showcase of Stephen Schwartz's songs was my favorite part of the show, and I fell in love with several songs simply because of the way he sang them. At the show, it was mentioned that Scott was planning on releasing a solo cd, and I have been anxiously awaiting this release since then! Anyone who appreciates an amazingly talented singer with a great song list should buy this cd as soon as possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scott Coulter","review":"I caught Scott Coulter's release party for this CD - at which he was unable to sing more than one song! Despite this he put on a great show with a collection of hastily summoned, extremely talented friends. He had such self effacing charm and a great bunch of friends who said the nicest things about him that I had to buy the CD!. It's been playing constantly since. He has a beautiful voice, perfectly suited in this recording to a wonderful selection of songs. There are some old favourites, given fresh interpretations - there's a strong bias to Stephen Shwartz material - and it's pretty clear from the cover notes that they form a mutual admiration society! Of particular note is a first time recording of a wonderful new song by Tim DiPasqua which really stands out. Scott Coulter is a name to watch out for!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best -- Simple and Haunting","review":"I bought this CD after seeing Scott perform live at Town Hall last year in New York. I can only say that as beautiful as this CD is he is even better live. He really communicates through the songs he sings.The arrangements on this disc are simple -- just a piano and a voice -- but they are almost all incredibly haunting. \\"Maybe you Didn't Hear Me\\" and \\"Cry Without a Reason\\" were new discoveries for me but the rest of the songs were familiar. All are beautifully performed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tenor Histrionics","review":"Good Grief! The music for Stephen Schwartz's In Whatever Time We Have is marked \\"flowing, with simplicity and sincerity\\", but those qualities are incredibly lacking in this recording. Not only is Coulter's interpretation way over the top, but his tone is nasal, and his vocal technique and musical style are so poor that they distract the listener from the beauty of the words and music. He should listen to John Rubenstein's interpretations of With You and Corner of the Sky from the original recording of Pippin. I'm sorry I don't agree with Stephen Schwartz, whose music I love, but I would pay this guy NOT to sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I read a glowing review of this album so I couldn't wait to get it.

Sorry, but this just wasn't worth the hype that prompted me to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like the tenor of this CD","review":"I am afraid Mr. Coulter's voice is not my cup of tea. He sings so high that you think only dogs should be able to hear it. Sometimes I didn't know if I was listening to a guy or a gal. This isn't my idea of singing. It's more like musical shrieking."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a nasally and annoying voice","review":"Wow, am I sorry I bought this CD! Scott Coulter has one of the whiniest male voices I've ever heard. He swoops, up and down, vocally, and often for no reason, like a ''Star Search'' reject. This guy can make pretty noises, but Coulter has no sense of what he's singing. He also should've printed the lyrics to the songs, because I can't make out the words on most of them. The phrasing is self-conscious and overwrought. The songs are mostly draggy ballads. One wailing number sounds like another. ''Cry Without a Reason.'' ''Cry Me a River.'' And on and on. There's a song on the CD called ''Maybe You Didn't Hear Me.''

Because people are different in thier knowledge of God's word. Also, people understand history at many different levels.

For anyone who is truly seeking answers into why the current Christian down-grade in America is so prevailant, get this book and devour it from cover to cover. From Cain to Charles Finney, the author thoroughly traces the history of rebellion against God and His sovereignty right through to our current Jesuit-tainted protestant churches.After the history is revealed and the visible American church of today is found to be lacking, the author then offers solid biblical teaching that embraces the Doctrines of Grace and Predestination.\\"Swarms\\" is a must read for anyone seeking solid truth into the theological and doctrinal crisis of our Christian churches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book is a must read for those who understand that the Protestant Reformation and its martyrs has been under attack by the Catholic church since its inception.

One, by Mr. Santiago, seems more concerned with the typeset than the informative light thrown upon the subject. He may be a bit more of a Jesuit/Vatican fan than he realizes. When he states that this book is not \`objective', we may ask how you might be objective about a roach in your kitchen. Do you stop to consider that the roach may be a good addition to your kitchen, or do you smash it for the corruption you know it will inevitably bring?We pray God will use this book to open your eyes, and bring you into all knowledge of Truth.Gods will be done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor trees","review":"This book doesn't worth the paper and ink wasted in it. I'm not exactly what anyone would call a Vatican's fan, and I was trying to find objective data and an informed opinion about the Jesuits. It's not that the author is a fanatic. I could have endured that. It is that the fact are inaccurate, the wording is crappy and boring and even the typography stinks: an almost 15 point Roman type (that's the only funny thing about this book) as the used in books for younger kids.I'm still looking for some good titles on this topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll be more careful","review":"I had to throw out this book when I beganbeing sick reading it.

The graphics are amazing and the look of the game is excellent. But the playability is very weak. Scoring is almost impossible. The last game I played I had 68 shots on goal and scored once. The Computer had 30 shots and didnt score. There seems to be no difference among the players, Jagr feels the same as Barnaby! Checking is weak, breakaways are a common occurance because the defenseman pinch always. Line changing is difficult. Its also annoying that the computer team changes lines once for every 3 to 4 line changes you execute, so the opponents #1 line is always out against you. Penalties are random and not in synch with players abilities.(Selanne had 3 minors in one game against me)I could go onand on, but Ill sum it up with saying no one who actually plays hockey will enjoy this joke of a game. This game is a waste of money, avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasted potential. The game was obviously rushed.","review":"Lemme just say that the gameplay is great. I think the games are extremely fun, especially against another player. Scoring is kinda hard but not that bad. Graphics, of course, are state of the art. The options are severly limited. It differs a lot from NBA2K and NFL2K. No practice mode or anything. Season mode is a joke. But I'd still recomend it despite it not living up to Sega Sports potential. Next years game will be light years better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why wouldn't it be good?","review":"This is the best hockey sim I've ever played on a video game console. For being a first-generation Dreamcast Game, its graphics are really good. Jaromir Jagr actually looks like Jaromir Jagr. The commentators aren't the best(NFL2K1) but they also aren't the most annoying(NFL2K1) They get the job done. The control is very, very good. This isn't one of those simple hockey games where you score by running into the goalie. This game takes some skill. There are some downfalls, such as players changing numbers as they go to the bench, and the wrong players going to the penalty box(only to be in the next face-off) None of these small, miniscule details takes away from the game at all, and's thats why it still gets 5 big stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Score","review":"First the graphics are good, the scheduling needs to be where you can make the schedule to fit the year, if you are really into hockey, and the rosters are just a bit off a couple of years.and the scoring is to easy in the All Star mode with all Penalties and a Strict ref, I averaged 16 goals a game,??"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have GAME","review":"NHL 2K is a great game it has it ups and downs like it takes up a ton of space on the VMU and when you play 2 player when you pass it it goes to the 2nd player insted of your player thats when you play on the same team.

I played this game for a total of 10 minutes, before realizing that it was a huge waste of money.

The game lacks what hockey is all about, checking, violence, passing and SPEED. The guys skate like they are in maple syrup. One timers are really the only way you can score consistently. The graphics are clean and up to dreamcast standards, however the game play was not. Why no multi- team season mode??? no injuries??? I haven't heard if they are making a NHL 2K1 yet, but I'd definitely rent that one to try out before buying a newest version to see if it's more like hockey.

A very, very large flaw. When every sports game for every sport comes out I buy it. I love sports and I love sports games. Me and my friends have the habit of playing a season with our games. This game does not allow that. I know that there are many many people out there that feel the way i do too. You can not play a multiplayer season in this game. Whether the game is good or not(which i believe it is just so so) the mere principal that Sega Sports would leave this option out of the game causes me to hate this game and refuse to buy it. I suggest all of you out there do the same and if sales are not good for this game then they wont make the same mistake again."},{"rating":"2","title":"what i'd expect","review":"Well it was pretty much what i'd expect from the first generation hockey for the DC.

I was sadly disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloom shows flowers in a new light.","review":"I really didnt think any more could be said on the subject of flowers but this work really shines in the spirit of Bleckner and O'keffe. Whats extraordinary to me about these photos is that Solberg was able to capture some beautiful parallels between some of nature's smallest and most fragile creations to those that are vast and indestuctible-- namely Nebullas or deep space images, which is what the compositions remind me of.

It wasn't until the 1960s that megamileage became common among distance runners. Now, the tendency is to overtrain, which leads to both physical and mental breakdown. Clarke's book is about achieving optimum balance between energy and effort. It's about coordinating the effort with the energy that allows for adaptation, i.e., better performances in the sport. Clarke offers a matrix in which workout effort is classified in varying degrees on one side and in which energy is classified across the bottom. There are 30 possible combinations of this effort-energy matrix. Clarke says that only five are optimum adaptive workouts.The runner who want to improve should gain a lot from reading Clarke's excellent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Card for an excellent Price!","review":"I have been very happy with this CompactFlash card.

The work avoid clichés, maintains a somber mood that does not become overbearing or tedious, giving an incisive, articulate and well-paced account of Disraeli's life, loves, and struggles.Disraeli was a man of many facets of strength and determination, and McShane the perfect actor to adroitly breathe life into the role.Pure Magick!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant make it through","review":"And I love Ian McShane.

For anyone who fancies themselves an appreciator of music, this album belongs in your music collection right beside your BEATLES, WHO, PINK FLOYD and whomever else you consider great. For true Junkies junkies, this album is a necessity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem from the Junkies","review":"A new release from Cowboy Junkies is always eagerly anticipated, but the \\"Rarities\\" collection is a particularly fine CD. It is hard to believe that these tracks did NOT make it on to previous CD's for whatever the reason; there isn't a loser among them. Margo's voice--as always--sounds angelic. The variety of the tracks is another great aspect of this CD. \\"I Saw Your Shoes\\" gets the CD off to a rocking start; while the traditional \\"The Water Is Wide\\" closes the CD on a melancholy note--but not really, as there is an unlisted eleventh track that also stands out. I must confess: I like this even more than the Junkies last Geffen release. However, as this CD proves, Cowboy Junkies create better, more satifying music than most other groups ever even hope to release. This CD is in my personal top ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for CJ's fans","review":"Rarities, B-Sides... is a terrific album that any Cowboy Junkies fan will love. Unlike most b-side collections, the songs one will find here are more than worthy of their own album. Rarities... is a terrific outlet for showcasing the haunting strength of Margo's voice (check out the last track which is sans instrumentation but still powerful). This internet only collection contains both slow and powerful love songs as well as more upbeat, up-tempo songs. Already this album is one of my favorites! Many thanks to the Cowboy Junkies for yet another outstanding piece of work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laaaaaaaaaaaame!","review":"This game has blocky and awkward cinematics and the gameplay isn't much better.

I thought classical was always recorded in multichannel...otherwise, what's the point?

After reading all the on-line data I am concerned that it might not cut out if used on a 120 Volt AC unit and burn out the starting coil in the motor. Supco tech support does not recommend this item for 120V air conditioning systems usually found in RVs, so I returned it to Amazon without issue. Buyer beware for RV use.

While it is true that the sound quality is not what we've come to expect today, listeners must remember that this album is now 45-50 years old and that the recordings are likely older!Furthermore, the original source of this CD may have been someone's LP! In addition to these two factors, at the time this album was originally sold, it was on a label few had ever heard of and was an INEXPENSIVE LP.There was a related LP titled \\"The Guitar Greats\\" that offered a fantastic performance of \\"Get the Bird Flyin'\\" by the great Glen Campbell! But it may never have been published on CD.With the understanding that these are old performances on an old recording, I find the album to be notable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye stinky smells!","review":"This is a fabulous product. It is also the only product you can spray ON YOUR PET because it is food grade and completely non-toxic. It works by literally breaking apart the molecules that carry odors. You can use it for any kind of organically-caused odor - you name it, this spray eliminates the smell. I don't mean it covers it with deoderant (it only has a faint peppermint smell) but that it kills the stink. I have used it in the following ways with complete success: Every imaginable kind of dog-created smell; cat box odor; stinky cat rear-end; smelly shoes; burned dinner smoke; teenaged boys/aftermath of chili-fest; bathroom spray; and the sour end-of-summer auto carpet stink that we get here in the humid Midwest. We take our dog in the woods every day, and carry a big spray bottle of PureAyre in the car in case of skunk or decayed roll-ins. We take it camping, and have a bottle in the kitchen, in the basement, and upstairs in the bathroom. I'm 100% satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work at all on turpentine","review":"Bought this product to address problem with turpentine odor in my studio.Sprayed the turp. rag thoroughly and the odor did not go away at all.Same smell, same headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Text; Iffy Printing...","review":"I agree with the benefits and usefulness of this book that most other reviewers have written. My only discomfort with the book is with its printing... The Greek section is generally fine, yet the Hebrew printing is often missing some of the vowels and consonants. Some pages have a stronger, darker print quality; other pages have a more faded and at times non-existent print quality.

From reading the reviews I looked forward to receiving it and using it in study. However when it came the quality of the book was very disappointing. The print quality is very poor which makes the Hebrew difficult to read, and the quality of the book construction itself is also very poor. It seems to be manufactured in the cheapest way possible - what should be a delight to own is rendered frustrating.I decided that I could not live with it and that it would not really be useable - so I have returned it at the cost of 13!! Had it been more readable I might have kept it despite the poor quality - I shall get separate Hebrew and Greek interlinears I think!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great study aid.","review":"I had never heard of an interlinear bible before.

Since Genesis is available for review, I decided to look there. Genesis 4:1 looked okay. okay now Genesis 3:15 - oops. H7779 (bruise) was incorrectly labeled as H2233 (seed/semen).I'm interested in using a book like this to explore and understand the meaning of the underlying text, but if errors are introduced by the author of this book on the scale that it seems to be based on the sample data, this makes the book, which initially comes across as an authority on the bible, instead be an obstacle to correct learning.How can anyone recommend a reference tool prone to error?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing","review":"If you are considering this reference book it is most likely because you are serious about taking your study to the next level and desire to know as close as possible the authors original meaning. I would recommend you pass on this book. The very first passage I looked up, Mark 3:29 has an incorrect numbering for the Strongs concordance. 166 is numbered as 2496. Going back to the reviews I see others have pointed out other numbering errors. Also important to me was A literal translation. With all its difficulties I wanted as true a translation as possible. This is the worst of any attempt at a literal translation I have read. It seems the author was going more for his own paraphrase edition.

Rather, that I believe that they are attempting to present themselves as possessed of an intellect greater than Joe Sixpack vis a vis their lyrics, but I find the arguments somewhat less than compelling. Particularly (whether or not it's borrowed from Nietzsche) the assumption that \\"If it's real for me, do I have to prove it to you?\\" They must...if they want me to see the error of my ways (as they seem to assume I am, in fact, in error)."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW I remember why i loved these guys years ago!","review":"Its been about 2 or 3 years since i've concidered my self a bad religion fan.

I think they knew it too.The Process of belief is a step up for this band! It mixes the agresssion of their later releases (such as Resipe for Hate, and Stranger Then Fiction) and what they seemd to be trying to get across on new america.

Not the sort of \\"favourite band\\" that changes every other week when something new comes along, but the kind that is always the first thing I listen to when I get in from work.The first BR album I heard was Stranger Than Fiction and in my opinion, it is the best album. There is not a single on there that will ever grow old...and for me, this album is very similar to Stranger than Fiction vocally. Epiphany is probably my favourite song. But then that would be the kind of \\"favourite song\\" that does change every other week as every single song on there is amazing.

The back up vocals are much more matured than the previous albums as well. I really hope to hear some of these new songs on the radio, not that I would consider any of them \\"radio songs\\".

It's not realizing that experience counts for something and that the inability to see (or want to see) beyond the next election has dire consequences for the medium term and long term.

You don't use the analong stick, but the control pad. I first ignored the ignoring of my forwards stopping when I kicked the ball into my opponents half.

Then you can never tell where the keeper is if you have a fastbreak!! Then once the computer gets a cross in the middle they mostly score!!

I was wrong, had to return the whole system and the game. Virtura Striker 2 is like going back in time, way back. Graphics and realistic play are non-existant for the Virtura Striker 2. I have a few little things they could of done to improve a top of the line game like World Wide Soccer, they could of added Italian, Americian, German clubs, added snow, and also more countries.The makers of the new soccer game should of also made it possible to trade players and also made it possible to role play thus enabling the player of the system to control the player of their choice, and last of all improve on the graphics which should be done on all new video games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtua Striker not for the complex player","review":"If you love the FIFA series, this is definently not the game for you.

It is quite hard to control the own players, and, that implies no fun at all. Graphics can be awesome, but if we want to see realistic movements and not be able to play at all, let's turn on the T.V. and watch a soccer match.

So, I'm really amazed at the lack of options in the game overall and especially the control of players. I can't believe you don't have the option of manually switching players - this really hurts a game that had a lot of potential. It seems like everytime you're headed towards the ball, the computer switches your player before you can get to it. You can't even use the goalkeeper unless its a penalty kick or free kick.

Gameplay ... ..its boring...and as a soccer fan I love a good soccer game and I will ususally play an outdated one on psx for the heck of it just because I love anything that has to do with soccer.

Controlling and passing is very bad, and, the teams have nothing to do with the reality. Do not get surprised if you are playing with Brazil (a top team) against Jamaica (one of the weakest) and this \\"lazy\\" team scores easily and quickly a hard trick. Before purchasing VS2 I was doubting whether to buy this game or Striker Pro 2000 from Infogrames. Now, I know that the \\"Info\\" guys will certainly not be able to make such as bad game, even if they do their best to do so. The only acceptable thing: Graphics, which are very good.

I too may have been spoiled on the FIFA series, but it's a shame FIFA isn't coming to the Dreamcast any time soon.What are the problems? Where should I begin... the worst problem for me was the lack of a player switch control. That is, you have to go with whoever the computer thinks you should be controlling at the moment. You can't choose which player you control.Secondly, and almost as big of a problem, is that the stick isn't used at all! The D-pad just doesn't give the precision that you need to play soccer.Also, the graphics are pretty amateurish, as is the sound.Nice pace of gameplay, though. I do like the speed.

As someone else mentioned, you CAN NOT use the Analog Thumb Pad. I personally could NOT believe this! Buying this game is going back all the way to the player control capabilities of the FIRST Nintendo. What's the point of the \\"cool\\" graphics of a high powered console like Sega, if you at the same time, have the control abilities of the first video game consoles? This makes no sense. Unless you want to control your players just like you did the FIRST Mario Brothers (remember that up/down/left/right cross?), and at the same time PAY for a CD, high graphic level game, then go ahead and buy Virtual Stricker.

You can't use the Analog Thumb Pad, you can't switch camera angles, there is no turbo button, there is only one type of tackle (standing or sliding depending on distance to player with ball), you can't switch players (crucial on foul kicks and throw-ins). FIFA might be an easy game to play agains the computer, but not against another player (and it allows for all that Virtua Striker 2 lacks). Personally, I wanted to return the game right after the first \\"vs Match\\" for the lack of challenge...unfortunately, I had already opened it.

It not only came from the creators of my favorite show, The OC, but it was based on my favorite book series. I was disappointed when looking through the episode guide to see how few episodes Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage actually wrote. Many of the story lines and character relationships seemed very similar to those of The OC. You can see how every character on GG is really modeled after one on the OC. With all these similarities I wanted a little more quick dialogue and ironic plots. As far as comparing to the books, they basically changed everything. It's not a bad show, it's extremely entertaining, but if you're looking for a direct portal into the books or a way to sooth the pain of The OC's cancellation, keep on looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Gossip girl speaks, talk isn't cheap","review":"This show is great and what is best is that it stays true somewhat to the books, but is different enough to not be dull to those of us who have loved the books.

But sapphire is really scratch proof, I cannot see even any tiny scratches at sapphire surface. Some people complained about mispositioning of second hand and dial. In my case, it points perfectly at tick marks.

Easy to set also. Like the construction better than my two Citizen Eco-Drives. Easy on/off clasp and relatively large face - not gaudy.Stylish without being something poofy.

But it's not really cyberpunk, or even science fiction. It's a rather poor fantasy novel, with more sorcery than science fiction. If the idea of the Morlock-fighting protagonists, including Merlin and King Arthur, running about London's oldest and deepest sewers, which are actually remnants of Atlantis, in a recovered Atlantean submarine sounds stupid to you, then you'll understand why it was a struggle to make myself finish reading this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly an appropriate Sequel","review":"Jeter utterly fails to make a convincing sequel to Wells' \\"The Time Machine\\" by worming magic and legend into a novel where it hardly belongs. Although Jeter does well in approximating Wells' style, his loping prose, he fails to carry through with the sort of \\"scientific romance\\" that so characterized Wells' work. Instead, \\"Morlock Night\\" is a piece of weak fantasy, almost entirely divorced from its scientific foundations, and almost impossible to finish. To add to the other wrongs, Jeter tries to reinterpret the Morlocks themselves, making them a highly technological species, and far removed from their origins, thereby dashing the allegories that Wells worked so hard to establish. If you must read a sequel to \\"The Time Machine\\", read \\"The Time Ships\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"J. Michael Straczynski, hack writer","review":"Spider-man is not Babylon 5. People care about Spider-man. A beloved character like Gwen Stacy should be left alone - she should not be part of a new story just to be defiled. The death of Gwen Stacy is one of the most significant, and greatest, stories in Spidey history. If J. Michael Straczynski wants to be remembered as the person who all but destroyed Spidey, then he is doing a fine job. Since writing \\"Sins Past\\", JMS has given Spidey a new costume, new powers, and brought us the unbelievably stupid \\"the Other\\" storyline - all just amateurish attempts to get more readers.

JMS just took that respect and specialness and drug it through the mud. The besides being an absolutely AWFUL concept and idea, the story conflicts with continuity at several points. It destroys the \\"tell all\\" type of relationship Peter and Mary Jane have. And above all else, it degrades Gwen Stacy and completely sours her reputation. I can't emphasize how truly horrible this story is. Please: if you haven't read it, don't bother. It will only taint your memory of that sweet little blond named Gwen.

Being a foreign language teacher myself, I am familiar with the development within methods of language instruction. The format in this book very different from ways of explaining and practicing foreign languages in the early 21st century, and according to modern standards the book appears more like a grammar book than a didactic book. I have given it one star because I do not believe the format is appealing to the average learner, but perhaps a very persistent learner or a language/linguistics aficionado could benefit from the book. Since I am only just beginning to learn Luganda, I can not tell if the Luganda described and taught in this book has more or less resemblance with Luganda as it is spoken in 2012, or if the book perhaps reflects a specific dialect of Luganda.

The set also contains some very informative special features which talk about the making of and the hows and whys of each of the films.

From making a crystal radio set as a teen, to snaring the top sound position with Frank Capra, Mr. Bernds entertains, informs, and delights us in the telling.One of the reasons why this book is so fresh is that its author works not just from memory, but from detailed diaries.

Luckily I was mailed a copy of this from MS (I guess you buy 36 copies of Office 2000 Pro and they love you). I have submitted numerous feedbacks, an average of 2 or 3 error reports per day, disabled com add-ins, etc. As it stands Outlook has been giving me hell. Also, the junk email filter, I don't know what logic they're using but it isn't half as effective as cloudmark or GFI.Excel now does rock, word seems slightly improved, access I have not played around much with but it appeared to work.

If there is such a thing as experiemental pop this is it and it is great. The sad thing is, it probably won't do have as well as Justin's album cause of all the shallow the girls that think he's hot and that's the only reason they bought it. It is better and more creative than Justins. I like every track on here. Highly recommended. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the sex theme is played out too much in this album. but other than that it is totally awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forward-thinking pop","review":"JC's album is not the expected template from a boy band exile. He did not hire the biggest names to generate only surefire radio hits. But have you really listened to the radio hits lately??? Heard one, heard them all. JC took amazing chances on \\"Schizophrenic\\" and the risks succeed spectacularly. The lyrics may surprise -- shock is too strong for the PG-13 sentiments, but the wordplay ranges from frenetic fun to thought- and emotion-provoking. \\"100 Ways\\" is pure dance groove and sexual hijinks. And I love the way his more potent sexual lyrics respect his female partners. \\"Build My World\\" goes beyond saccharine love songs and expresses true yearning. His Basement Jaxx track, \\"Shake It,\\" demands you do just that. Give this album the chance it deserves or be satisfied with the fill-in-the-blank, pick-the-usual-beat offerings now monopolizing radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underpromoted!","review":"This album has only recently come to my attention.

They all love it, but due to its lack of promotion they have never had the chance to hear his music.I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a second album, and hoping that it will be the big hit that JC deserves!This album lives pride of place in my music collection!P.S The reviewer who mentioned Craig David being better than JC has obviously not listened to this album properly.

I know it's called Schizophrenic...but, it's a little too all over the map for me! Which was obviously the purpose of it. But, he cannot pull it off. Not a strong voice & not a very good writer either. Very disappointed in this CD. I expected better. Not worth it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really curious about this. JC is an amazing vocalist, but this album does him no justice. It';s basicly a look in the mind of a sex-crazed teenager. I read really good reviews on this album, but I don't understand where they are coming from. The songs are awful. The one shining moment is \\"Build My World.\\" Why do these former mousekateers turn into such sexual beasts?

Jc, try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Voice is good but the songs are not.","review":"I just have one question,where the hell is the emotion on this CD?

Of course, until now.I take comfort in the fact that this album had not been successful in the least; we can all only hope that he returns to his exiled lands of his perverse, pubescent thoughts and crappy, \\"dance\\" music that all sounds the same. Ten years from now, he will be forgotten, alone, and nearing the age of forty with every breath. Ten years from now, talk show hosts will be interviewing the next big name in music and his existence will be brought up casually.\\"Oh, yeah! What was that guy's name?

It seems as though every song has a graphic sexual message. As a member of the former cute boy band N Sync, Chasez should realize the fan base he has. It is mostly girls under the age of 16.Chasez is either eager to escape his boy band past..... He needs better songwriters and a greater understanding of his core audience. Chasez is selling a CD of adult music to a non-adult audience. No one over the age of 18 is going to be interested in a teen idol unless they suffer from stunted development.Chasez needs to reevaluate his music options, or risk becoming a cartoonish male version of Britney Spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aw come on JC, just come out of the closet.","review":"JC is desperately trying to look straight after leaving the fab five, but it just isn't working.

Although majorly oversexed, this album proves that you don't have to enlist top producers in order to get a great sound. Instead the album focuses on the different sounds and styles in music. If you like hard core 80's beats reminiscent of Prince, then this CD is a must for your collection. If you like the Police, Stevie Wonder, Lenny Kravitz, or even Jamiroquai, you will find a song or two just for you, or if you still like the old heart-breaking ballads of the boy-bands of yesterday... then you might as well buy this album. Its a music compilation in its own right, for every music schizo out there. I would suggest that you buy it with an open mind, don't think that this talented young man came from a boy band... but someone arriving new. I see nothing but good things coming to Chasez's way.

Talent is talent and this cd like Justified is no accident. Also when listening to this cd the title should never be forgotten. Jc takes the listeners to places within his own head. This cd is not meant to be thought provoking and it doesn't have a goal to change the world, it just wants to entertain you. The ballads are there, \\"Dear Goodbye\\" is vintage JC. One song call \\"Mercy\\" will be my anthem for days that I just can't handle. \\"Shake it\\" & \\"One Night Stand\\" just makes you wanna rock your body. \\"100 ways\\" would make Prince proud and make uptight NFL bigwigs think \\"nipplegate\\" was child's play. If you pretend you never heard of Nsync and listen to this cd without boyband predjuice you hopefully will be surprised.I didn't give this cd a 5-star rating because I believe music can't be perfect for everyone...but alot of this cd comes pretty damn close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just horrid.","review":"I can only compare listening to this album to giving the finger to a deaf person.

The cd is pretty good although I will admit that all the songs aren't that great and I can't see them being #1 hits. I did like \\"Build My World\\" and \\"She Got Me\\" the most. I thought \\"She Got Me\\" had that Justin Timberlake vibe to it. I really think \\"100 Ways\\" sound like a song Prince would do. I heard JC got his inspiration from \\"The Ladies Man\\" movie when he wrote \\"One Night Stand\\". It sounds pretty good for just \\"playing around\\" in the studio. I always wondered what JC is thinking. Now I know when I hear A.D.I.D.A.S. This cd basically talked about love and sex. I think it was made basically for grown folks. I would recommend it cuz I mean it's not a bad cd for someone going solo for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of star potential","review":"If you truly are a fan of JC then you will be honest about this album. Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex! That is what his album is about. Now don't get me wrong, JC is a very sensual and sexy individual but it seems as if he was tyring way too hard to sell himself in that light not knowing that his voice is the source of his sex appeal. What a shame. I am so disappointed in him as an artist. The best songs on the album seem to be \\"She got me, Come To Me, Dear Goodbye, Everything You Want, and Lose Myself\\" and they aren't even that great.The fact of the matter is that NSYNC is nothing without each other, not even Mr. Timberlake to whom that fans can blame for the dismnatling of the band. I love you JC but better luck next time if there is one. And for the sake of all your fans and yourself, I hope there is another chance in the future"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I bought this CD today hoping to hear that wonderfully tender melodic voice from \\"Drive Myself Crazy\\" from his NSYNC days but instead all this CD is about is chicks and how much he wants to have sex with them. Nothing wrong with that but almost every song had a similar theme with too much electronic studio noise which overshadows JC's incredible voice.

A truly satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding book!","review":"This book is awesome. Written by a non-mason, he did a very \\"neutral\\" job on the issue.

Highly recommended to masons and non-masons alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Important piece in Freemason and Templar history","review":"One of history's great mysteries has been the whereabouts of the Knights Templar of the British Isles, who virtually disappeared with most of their treasure and documents during late 1307. Robinson brings an impressive array of facts and deductions to explain that the Templars did not disappear, but went underground to form a mutual support and defense network for their once-proud order. That network became the Masons. Although some have claimed that this book cannot be called \\"serious research\\", owing to its lack of footnotes (a practice the author explains in his book \\"Dungeon, Fire & Sword\\"), such complaints cannot detract from the methodical deductive work that Robinson brings to bear on this subject. For any who are studying the roots of the Ancient Order of Free and Accepted Masons, or the ultimate end of the Knights Templar, this is a work that cannot be ignored"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, readable version of possible historical connections.","review":"Mr. Robinson presents a summary of his research in the possible origins of freemansonry. A cross between \\"historical research\\" and speculation, the book presents a possible historical account and attempts to justify historical correlaions with masonic customs and language. Mr. Robinson is not a mason himself and this lends a somewhat objective look at masonic origins. Lack of footnotes and occasional \\"leaps of faith\\", removes this work from true research but it is still a thought provoking account and a good book for jumping in among the various chapters. Recommended for freemasons or those interested in masonic history"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but unsupported theory of freemasonry's origin.","review":"Author starts with a few interesting coincidences, presentsalot of circular reasoning, and asserts that freemasonsoriginated as English Knights Templar who went undergroundafter the order's suppression in early 14th century.Earliest documented evidence of freemasonry dates from mid16th century, and author fails to fill in the gap andjustify his assertion. As a sideline, author gives defenseof freemasonry from charges it is antichristian andconspiratorial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second part is better","review":"The book is a bit of a tough read during the first half, which discusses the Knights Templar.

Much older then when the first supposed lodge was opened in England in the 1700 are the roots of masons. Robinson Rightly traces it back to Scotland and the Remains of the Templars who where persecuted at the hands of French king Phillip. He does a great job linking the two groups and I know from Masonic ritual that there is traces of the Templars in certain rites. He also goes into there links to the peasent revolt in England and other midevil events in europe after the supposed fall of the Templers that have Masonic influence written all of them. A great book and his history is very well researched. If you are a mason and do not know some back history then this is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Answers","review":"As an educated person and a member of the Fraternity, I can whole heartedly say that this is the truest, most fully researched and logical explanation that I have read regarding the Brotherhood. How Mr. Robinson (now Brother Robinson) was able to compile such information is amazing.To the reluctant buyer I would say that, the author himself was not a member of the fraternity before he wrote this work, but was so impressed with his findings, that he now is a Freemason. Additionally, any serious student or member of Freemasonry will understand that the common \\"beliefs\\" discussed in other books are really a red herring and are correctly explained and disspelled by Robinson.Furthermore, it is understood by the general membership that Robinson, then as an outsider, hit the nail squarely on the head when he wrote Born in Blood.As a member, I can honestly say, \\"If you want the truth, the whole truth, read Born in Blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"book and dvd too","review":"there is a book that goes with the dvd set. i suggest having each. much more helpful and a joy to use together."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY dangerous product","review":"This product ends up lifting the lower lap belt off of the hips and legs and ON to the stomach and soft tissue.

The lap belt portion of the seat belt should rest on the hips/thighs of the passenger. Devices like this can cause the lap belt to ride up onto the soft part of the abdomen, which can cause serious internal injuries in a crash. If your child is too short to use the seatbelt properly (no putting it behind their back, and no shoulder belt across the neck/face) they should still be in a booster seat!

But unless you are a very great fan of Chopin and willing to overlook some VERY bad acting, I would save your money! I honestly threw it away after watching it one time. The characters are completely wooden, the dialog incredibly boring, and the sets, well they look like sets. I have very few requirements when it comes to period movies, but I neither got a feel for the time, got lost in the movie, nor was I able to connect to the characters(probably because the acting was so poor). This is an interesting story, with lots of movie worthy drama and intrigue. However it will be left to someone else to produce a better version."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Chopin, buy a CD...","review":"The movie is poorly done, and hard to follow. The plot makes very little sense.The music itself is pretty good. However, if you just like the music, then buy a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"The movie concentrated on the acerbic, immature and utterly repulsive relationship between Chopin, George Sand, her son and her daughter. It would have made more sense to delve a bit into Chopin, his motivations, and the draw between Chopin and his muse. Snippets of his music were the only saving grace in the film. I came away without sympathy for any of the characters in the movie, unable to identify with any of them, and disgusted with the lot of them, from Chopin's hatred of chicken thighs to Sands being oblivious to the impact of her affair on her family, to Selange's throwing herself at Chopin and to Maurice's immaturity and hatred of Chopin. Talk about a dysfunctional family! And how did Chopin put together his magnificent music and maintain his irrepressible talent throughout all of this? A very disappointing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language: English, Polish, nope","review":"This review is not about the movie, but about the DVD.On the product page it clearly indicates \\"Language: English, Polish\\".In my case it can only be played in that ridculously dubbed English and subtitle only in Spanish, not even English!Purchased & shipped from Amazon.com, LLC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chopin","review":"Disappointed in the whole movie.

Not a favorite of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for snuggling on the sofa","review":"If it fascinates you to learn more of the life of those whose music has surrounded generations of listeners, there are movies that satisfy this need. The original movie on Tchaikovsky (there are 2, the best is Russian w/English subtitles), this movie, and, of course, Amadeus (Mozart) are the finest of the genre that I've discovered. Enjoy a beautiful movie and beautiful music and hopefully, a beautiful evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an entertaining Movie.","review":"This movie is in no way is as good as \\"A song to remember\\" with Cornell Wilde.I don't understand how a polish made movie woulg present Chopin in such a way it did even if it was true. I prefer to see the more positive side of Chopin and his greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I wasn't able to play this DVD on my player - finally watched it on another and found it disappointing. The music is exquisite, of course, but I have several CDs of Chopin music to listen to without the talking. And there are visually beautiful scenes. But in all, it came across as a cheesy soap opera in an aesthetic setting. There was almost no attention on Chopin's creative process, thoughts about music, etc. It was all about the craziness of Sand and her children in relation to him. One thing I found distracting and annoying is that when we first meet Sand's children, there is a little girl and a son who appears to be in his 20s but behaves and is treated like a 12 year old. Then the story jumps to \\"years later\\" and the daughter (different actress) is a young woman and the son (same actor) looks and acts the same as before. It adds to the obsurdity of the story. A lot of artistic talent went into the making of this movie - it just wasn't put together all that well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Access 2000","review":"This software is not worth upgrading.

My only complaint is that the patterns look as though they are created for young girls, yet the leads are thin and fragile. I wish Papermate would come up with a mechanical pencil that contains a heavy duty lead for youngsters similar to the sturdier leads used in drafting pencils. Also how about some extra eraser tips in the package? However, what Papermate is selling is the look, and they've done a great job with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost vegetarian","review":"It's always a risk when you can't see the whole ingredient list before you buy. Just so you know, the flavor packet does contain hydrolyzed gelatin - so it's not totally vegetarian.

You can tell the seasoning is extremely sodium laden."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fridge is empty....","review":"My favorite comfort and fallback food. Extremely tasty and a very long shelf life, which makes owning a case of each flavor a little easier. Do yourself a favor and serve the noodles unbroken and boiling hot. Slurping your food has a bit of a negative image in the west but trust me that's the way to eat these.I was initially an original and beef flavor only fan of Sapporo Ichiban but for some reason the Miso really took hold of me after eatting a few over the months. It's high in sodium so it's not a great everyday item but if you like ramen you can't go wrong with Sapporo Ichiban Miso flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but...","review":"I like the 3.5oz size, but I can get 3.0oz packages of competitive brands much cheaper at the local grocery, and the taste isn't much different to me.

That's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than cordless!","review":"Knowing DEWALT is a good brand and most importantly this drill has a chuck key are the reasons we purchased it. We had a B&D cordless (with no chuck key) that would NOT hold a drill bit if you used it on anything heavier than paper so it went in the garbage right after trying this one.This drill works great and is considerably lighter without having to carry the extra weight of a battery pack around. The only complaint I had was that the vendor I bought it from sent it in just the thin box as you would see on a store shelf. No padding or anything at all just a box that it could slide around in. Box looked crumpled and kind of beat up yet and the drill is durable enough to survive it's packaging and still works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"No level, very good drill.","review":"Yes, it does not have a level, who cares. This drill will outlast any cordless drill on the market, I was getting tired of batteries going dead and weakening over time, this thing will drill all day long without effort, no plastic gears you have to worry about in cordless also, just buy an extention cord and get the job done, the keyed chuck is a good one, locks up tight, the 6 amps is plenty and will run circles around any 18 volt cordless I've used. Yes it is made in china but what drill isn't, not even Milwaukee is any more :( The cordless market is a scam, why do replacement batteries cost as much as the drill and battery put together? To keep you buying them, got tired of being scammed, so I got the good old fashion tailed drill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I work in metal alot. This drill does fine for light to medium duty. Easily drills 1/4\\" pilot holes through plate steel that had my cordless drill smoking. Keyed chuck has excellent grip. Runs smooth. Tool is now made in China. Padded grip would be a nice addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate description","review":"I needed a new drill.Corded. Had to have.Always did well with Dewalt.One thing that influenced my decision was the Amazon description.I knew the reputation.Amazon said made in USA.\\"tool made in Mexico\\" on the side of the box.48 hours from initial order to box on the stairs; shipped fast.Just very disappointed in the misleading description.Had I known then what I know now I would have spent the extra money for something else. OR spent less money for something I KNEW beforehand was made elsewhere.Already broke the seals on the box & used it once otherwise I would return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great study of the late witch hunts","review":"Although not the definitive guide on witchcraft, this book does do justice to the late Middle Ages and beyond, and describes the evolution and eventual downfall of witchcraft persecution. If you truly want to know about the history of witchcraft throughout the Middle Ages, you should combine this book with other books that cover the earlier history in more detail, such as R.I. Moore's \\"Formation of A Persecuting Society\\", which covers 950-1250; or Kors & Peters' \\"Witchcraft In Europe:1100-1700.\\" I read alll three in college for a witchcraft class, and I would find none of them to be definitive on the subject. Taken together, however, they provided a strong overview on the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Griffin","review":"\\"The Griffin\\" was an amazingly good series from DC. I would buy this collected edition like a shot ... except that this is a black-and-white reprint of a comic that was in full, gorgeous color. (And, yes, the color was gorgeous.) On that score alone, I can't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?!?","review":"I loved this series when it came out BUT it is supposed to be in color. Why reprint this in B/W? It is such a great story but loses much in this transition."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Heard This One Before","review":"The writing was good, but I liked the story better the first time I heard it, when it was called Degrassi Junior High. It was more of an after-school special than a meaningful short story. Anybody who tries to find significance in this story should delve into the symbolism of The Cat in the Hat."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfying gem","review":"Recently came across a cut-out version of this CD and was suddenly reminded of how much I had liked this program when it first appeared on records some years back. Eileen Joyce is a name that won't mean much to American audiences, but she had asignificant career that went back to the days of World War 2 in the UK. The playing has great style and feeling, and the collection includes both chestnuts and a few out-of-the-way items. The Dohnanyi for me is the highlight, a great (underappreciated) piece played with impressive bravura, but I didn't think there was a clinker among the selections.Saga was a budget British record label that dates back to the 50's. There is some tape hiss in the digital transfer. The listening time is not great measure, but I will bet you will be converted if you happen across a copy of this long before the last selection plays out. A very satisfying disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful take on a modern Sherlock Holmes.","review":"This is what Sherlock Holmes would have been if he were a modern detective. Great acting performances by all the cast. Hillarious lines. The DVD has director commentary by the first time movie director. It shows from the performances he gets out of his actors that the director is an old hand at play direction. Other than the star actors, all other extras were locals."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than i expected","review":"This movie was not as funny as i thought it would be, but it was interesting. It's a movie in which i couldn't honestly say why i enjoyed it, but i did. I think i liked the movie because it was kind of like a detective movie with a little bit of comedy. I honestly had no problems with the movie except for the fact that it seemed like it drug on forever. It was a fun movie to watch though so i think it deserves the four stars i give it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, if familiar, mystery","review":"Pullman and Stiller are excellent in this modern day remake of the Sherlock Holmes story \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\". Plot twists keep you guessing, and Kasdan doesn't let us down with contrivances or cliches. Offbeat and and occasionally strange, highly entertaining and well worth seeing; with Pullman putting in an astonishingly good performance as a present day American Holmes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pullman Effect","review":"I have seen this movie a few times and it keeps getting better. The beginning is a little slow but once I got drawn in by the quirky Darryl Zero (played brilliantly by Bill Pullman) and his sidekick Steve Arlo (a great performance by Ben Stiller), I couldn't wait to see what happened next. This movie has a lot of funny lines, some suspense and a compelling love scene. I hope there is a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"complex, interesting story but a tad too drawn out","review":"I found the whole basic story of the film to be quite fascinating, the idea of the drug abusing, yet brilliant recluse gumshoe was great, Ben Stiller was a good straight man through the entire film it was not until the end with the whole intimacy between bill pullman and the girl that I lost interest in the story. All together though I would still say I would recomend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"This movie is horrible. boring. not funny. bad acting. really, no redeeming moments whatsoever.Badly written, badly acted.

Just lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts well but...","review":"The first half hour was promising but after that it just drags on and on. I don't care at all about these people. I'm amazed S&E gave it two thumbs up. Mind numbingly boring...struggled to stay awake..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films of the year.","review":"This film has got to win a prize as one of the most pretentious pieces of garbage ever made. The characters have been designed to plug in to the audience's expectations without any actual attempt at giving them depth. The entire film consists of a series of phony plot points designed to allow the characters to exhibit ridiculous behavior that is supposed to be hip and sophisticated. As a result this film exists as a superficial piece of junk, as obviously the director was too frightened to create any real dramatic tension using emotion and logic, instead relying on stylistic posturing and hollow dialogue. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Effect","review":"The name says it all doesn't it. It had Zero Effect on me and my two buddies who watched it with me. I hope Ben stiller and Bill Pullman gave what they earned to charity. At least that way their time would have been waisted for a good cause. If only I had given the five euro rental charge to charity instead of the rental shop. I would have save myself a major BARF session. I'm giving this one five thumbs up, my lowest rating yet! The time I put into Zero Effect could have been spent talking to this babe I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent detective.","review":"Modern version of Sherlock Holmes...with Ben Stiller as Watson. Pullman is electric as the troubled PI. There are some holes in the plot but the overall effect of classic mystery elements & colorful detective in a 1990s setting is well worth checking out. Excellent music; although nothing is made of surround sound and the transfer to dvd is just ok. Technical aspects aside, this is above average fare. Great atmospheric shots of Portland, OR."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUITE SUPERB","review":"I can only give this 4 stars because I came very close to turning it off after 10-15 mins. The beginning is very silly and strange but I am SOOO glad I kept with it b/c once the story starts rolling I really really enjoyed it. A wonderful involving story and you have to be on your toes to catch all the humor. Bill Pullman fits the role to a T."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So Knock Off","review":"This is a well made and well acted effort to update the classic Sherlock Holmes mystery. Despite its positive features, it fails in the end because it doesn't bring anything novel and interesting to the genre. The characters are a virtually a transposition from Conan Doyle and the basic plot idea is lifted from A Scandal in Bohemia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live In NY City - The Abercrombie, Erskine, Mintzer, Patitucci - a concert/clinic DVD","review":"Wow! Once I had collected this DVD from the post office, I rushed home to give it a listen. I felt like I was in the front row (pound seat) from the very first note from the Band. I could not single out anyone who stood out but the band performed as a perfect unit - in sheer unison! I recommend this DVD to anyone who wishes to spend his hard-earned cash on quality.

These bikes are very fast but do not turn corners well due to the chopper design handlebars. They are also very low to the ground so you really need to watch for cars when riding. The box says for 12 and above but I would say more like 6+. The seat is only about a foot off the ground.

However, if you are interested in an intro to the AR-15, and basics on how to use it/clean it/shoot it, this book isn't for you. I ended up skimming the first half of the book, as it didn't read very well, and had many tangential points.

Each letter of the alphabet is highlighted, and is tied into a short sentence about the picture.For example:A\\" is for all aboard. \\"All aboard!\\" calls Thomas the Tank Engine.\\"Q\\" is for quick. James the Red Engine comes to a quick stop.This is a delightful book that introduces the alphabet for small children, and is especially engaging because of the colorful pictures that are actually clear still from videos (at least, that's what they look like). Young train enthusiasts will especially love this book-as well as parents wanting a short (but educational) bed-time story to read to the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful for Early Learners","review":"This book is horrendous. It starts out strong, or at least normally, matching pictures with actual sounds, but after about \\"F\\" it goes completely wrong. The book uses pictures that in no way match the letter or the word that they provide with the letter. For example: \\"T\\" is for tracks. That would be fine, except that on the tracks sits Edward and it confused our boy horribly. Why not put Thomas on the tracks instead? \\"W\\" is for \\"Whee!\\" Why not use Whiff? (Yes, he knows all the trains by heart, and therefore so do we.) \\"X\\" is the worst. \\"X\\" is for \\"eXpress,\\" REALLY? Don't waste your money. Even if your child is a die-hard Thomas fan like ours, there are numerous books that actually teach children appropriate letter associations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read","review":"My 2-year old boy loves this book.

I use it mostly for drilling pocket holes with a Kreg jig. It's so much easier to drill pocket holes with this powerful 2500 RPM corded drill, compared to a slow cordless drill. This drill is super powerful, well balanced, and has a very comfortable hand grip. The Jacobs ratcheting chuck works nicely and has a great feel when tightened. The Dewalt case is also very nice with plenty of extra storage space and metal latches. My only complaint, though, is that this drill is very noisy. I wish Dewalt would focus more engineering on lowering noise output."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great drill","review":"This drill works fantastic!

I will have to put up with the inconvenience of plugging in a drill again, but this DeWalt drill is a fair-priced quality tool suitable for my home project needs. Additionally, I will have a drill with a reliable power source, and one that will last for years - far longer than the few years it took for the B&D batteries to die a sudden and unexpected death.

I also have the same trouble as many people, in that it goes from slow to fast instantly, and if you are trying to tighten the chuck it will do everything it can to rip the skin on your hand off. I've spent time trying find some way to steadily increase the speed from slow to medium, but the trigger on mine has no such ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Customer","review":"I am very pleased with the quality and performance of the drill. The variable speed trigger is sensitive when using at a very low speed, but with practice one quickly becomes adapt at this. I really like the 2 way level feature for maintaining straight drilling rather then just guessing.The case is a nice item for storing when not in use or for transporting to job site."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice drill","review":"This is a nice corded drill---I use it as a complement for an 18v cordless drill and the 7v DeWalt screwdriver. I will always pick up one of the latter for driving screws or drilling smaller holes. But the DeWalt corded drill is far superior when I need to drill multiple holes or use large bits. For example, when drilling a bunch of pocket holes, this drill is much smoother and quicker than a cordless drill. It's also great for using large spade or auger bits. The other day I had to drill holes through the end of a pressure treated 4x6 with a 1\\" auger bit, and this drill powered right through the timbers---EXCEPT: it did get stuck pretty bad in one of the timbers and I had to go forward-reverse-forward-reverse a few times to get it unstuck. Might have hit a knot or something---might have also helped to drill half-way, bring out some of the waste, then do the rest. But it shows that you can get this drill stuck under extreme loads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but expensive","review":"I tried the Sears 2 ton aluminum jack first, my old steel jack was leaking oil and 20 years old. The Sears unit would creak and slowly go down even with just a regular car. Not very convincing, tried 2 units, same thing. This unit is certainly more robust and heavy. It is heavier than the Sears and it does not have the quick lift, which I liked. You also have to be careful where you store the jack, if the handle falls it drops all the way. Pleased with the purchase. Mine is also blue..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifting weights","review":"Great quality at an decent price. I did alot of research and shopping before I pulled the trigger.

In other words, Mr. Rachell was asked to play as if he'd not been influenced by St. Louis, Chicago, and his rediscovery in the 60's. The result is spectacular - a earthiness that isn't raw, a very personal sound on either mandolin or guitar. This is blues that are blue but not embittered. This is blues that nearly every cut alone would justify the album - a blues that is \\"mainstream rural\\" yet specific to Mr. Rachell.It is not accidental that in the review, I refer to the artist as Mr. Rachell not Yank.

These National Geographic specials are usually quality productions. But this one seems more of an afterthought than a serious effort. The actors walk around in cheap high school costumes that make no effort at all to be historical. And the expert commentary seems very tongue-in-cheek. Nothing in this special is at all special.

Make sure ladder is on level ground both inside the pool and out. Make sure you get ALL the air out of the inside section of the ladder. I submersed it and turned it around in all directions to do so. This ladder is much better than the ladder that was included with our pool. I can't imagine how it could be any better.

Unfortunately, this bicycle is too small, but otherwise, it is a really wonderful little bike, easy to put together, all the parts were there, and we feel so bad that it's too small. But, we wrote to Santa, and Santa said his feelings would not be hurt if we got our daughter a larger bicycle, more suitable for her height, as long as she gave the first bike away to a little girl who doesn't have one, so that's what we will do. It's unfortunate that we couldn't find the same bike in size 16 inches that is pink. Found a blue one, but not the same. It would have made life a lot easier on everyone if the new bike looked the same just larger. Anyone from Huffy reading this, please make a note that manufacturing the exact same bikes in different sizes would make sense.

The point is, you need an understanding of the basics of Java programming or you will be wondering why your programs aren't compiling. Otherwise it is pretty complete and up to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those with some basic Java knowledge...","review":"Now, this is one of those books that I can say I'm glad to have in my collection of game programming books. I'll just put it next to my Black Art Of VB Game Programming, excellent. An excellent resource for game programming since it goes deep into the explaination of game design, game development, and down-to-earth explainations of the example code. The only gripe about this book is that you really do need some basic Java knowledge to start. I'm familiar with c++ and vb, but knew nothing about Java. The 5 bonus chapters on the cd were a great help, but not good enough. It did, however, recommend getting the Java Programming For Dummies since this book wasn't meant to teach Java from scratch anyway.

Life in the city orphanage is harsh, and when overcrowding causes city officials to ship the orphans out west by trains, it seems an opportunity for a better life. Oliver takes his young brother Edward under his wing, and they hope to be taken in by a loving family. But do the people who meet the train in Kansas want sons - or cheap labor?

In an unprecedented move they allow Dick Couch(ret.) to return to the training grounds as a reporter/writer. He goes through beginning to end with Class 228 and tells you everything they go through. And not only that he gets the trainees response by being able to interview them during the training! This isn't like most books where people try to remember how it was when they went through. There is also a great description of Hell Week in that he was allowed full access to the entire week (although he didn't manage to stay awake for the entire period).

One of those things is exactly how we did our surf-runs that first PT on the first day of trng. Too funny to print, I guess.Good book, though. If anyone knows how to get ahold of Harry Pell, one of the best guys ever not to make the Teams, tell him parl2001 at yahoo is looking for him.And, just in case anyone believed that earlier review, this book does not take place during \\"the Vietnam Era,\\" but rather in the fall of 1999.EDIT Aug 2006: back still jacked, and the other reviewer was right about the dam academy bias. oh well. academy grads take care of their own I guess.

Citizens and residents of the US are very fortunate to have such soldiers defending the nation, and what Seals endure to serve their country is inspiring.The writing is simple and clear. But the characters are uniformly portrayed in a two-dimensional way and so ultimately it's kind of a gung-ho but boring read.As with many non-fiction books, it could have been done as or more effectively through an in-dept magazine article."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Dick Couch takes you on a good look into the training of Seal Class 228.

I am an aspiring watercolor painter myself and a lover of Western art. Several years ago I noted the stunning art work on the cover of the western Novel \\"The Streets of Laredo\\" in the Lonesome Dove series of books. I had no idea at the time who Maynard Dixon was, but I couldn't forget the image of the desert and the sky making the figures on horseback appear so small and fragile. This book provides so many great pictures, including my book cover, and it is also a fine biography of an inspiring life. If you like Western art, this might be described as a bridge between Remington and Russell and Edward Hopper.

There wasn't enough material to make a film about. Or the director didn't showcase the material well. I don't know which. After the film made it clear that her talents weren't appreciated, there wasn't much more to tell. She was a great talent, and it was unfortunate that she wasn't given her due. Marie Feret was very good. I wish the director had spent more of the film in closer observation of her and not so much on her family which seemed like \\"filler\\".The reviews on the DVD cover are exagerated.

The Pandora Peaks segments are stunning for two plainly obvious reasons--her doctor should get a plastic surgery award for creating such nicely-shaped, yet gargantuan, works of art. The harem segment is erotic in the same way that steamy novels can be erotic, especially considering that the only thing getting between these three girls are some loufas and a bottle of bath oil!

I even accidentally drilled all the way through the door, so there is no wood in between the lock and the magnetic key, however the key still can not open the lock.The locks do work when they're not installed in the door, but once they are installed there is too much space and wood in between the magnets.

Absolutely NO measuring is required to position the lock or catch. (You DO have to measure the thickness of the door, however.)There is some drilling involved, but rest assured all hardware remains inside the cabinet or drawer, and is completely invisible when the storage is closed. A drill bit depth-stop is included in the package, but I couldn't figure out how to make it work (it seemed too large for the bit). I used a simple piece of clear tape.Frankly, I don't understand the 1-star review below...

They lock automatically when you close the door, so you don't have to worry about forgetting to do it. They are also much more convenient to open than other cabinet locks, which is a bonus for my husband and I. The only complaint I have is the installation process.

The magnet part worked fine with the extension, that was not the problem.

The key part is pretty easy to use for opening the cabinets. We keep ours on the side of the fridge so they won't get lost.

In a sentence, any cabinet thicker than 1.125\\" is entirely non-functional.The magnet that comes with the lock is great and strong--and activates the lock consistently across the 3 packs of locks I bought through 1/8\\" of wood so long as you're not using the extension slug.

This solves the problem. I like this product because it works and works well.There is a video on youtube on how to install this that is recommended viewing. The templates are excellent but be sure to use when you open as the dry air will ruin the adhesion(As I have found) and make it difficult to get the holes lined up properly.

Although we weren't thrilled with the prospect of drilling into our cabinets, we did like that the mechanism seemed sturdy. After reading some reviews, I was concerned that the magnet might not be strong enough, but those reviews related to thicker cabinets (over 1\\" thick), and ours are only 3/4\\". Plus, in the store, the included magnet was strong enough to stick to our shopping cart through the packaging.At home, installation itself was pretty straight forward (though it never specified the size of drill bit to use for the anchor screws, and the bit size needed for the magnet locking mechanism was not part of our standard drill bit set). However, even when installed properly, the magnetic lock wouldn't release through the remaining 1/8\\" of cabinet we hadn't drilled through. We even tried drilling a second set of holes in another location just to be sure. No luck. Good thing we have wood filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great locks, difficult install","review":"I agree with other reviewers -- these locks are fantastic when installed, but you might pull your hair out during the installation! A few pointers:- Use an 18V+ cordless drill, these screws are extremely difficult to install into hardwood with a handheld driver- Use the drill stop, or better yet, borrow or buy a more robust stop. This is especially important when going into laminate, you can easily bulge the door if not careful. I found that I could back off a little bit on the hole depth and still have the magnet work. Try this first.- Be careful if your doors have varying thicknesses, the screws can find their way through the door as well- Pilot holes are a mustThis is an excellent product, but considerably less time was spent on the instruction design. If you don't understand them, stop and find someone who does, because you will damage your cabinet and you will regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical for for thicker cabinet doors","review":"This product might work well if you have thin cabinet doors, but we have found that the magnets provided don't work very well in our kitchen. It's a really cumbersome system in any event, so much so that when I'm in a hurry I have to leave some of the cabinets open which defeats the purpose. It requires two hands and patience to get the door open with this system. In retrospect I wish we'd used this method just for the few cabinets that have dangerous chemicals or medicine in them and used the latch system for the other doors."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best child-proof lock set","review":"Even though the Tot Lok is a bit pricey, it's well worth the money.My daughter's room has a cabinet that has 2 doors with an open shelf space between them. We didn't want her to have access to the cabinets, as we store her nicer books in the cabinets. We tried several different methods of keeping her out of the cabinet doors. I could spend several minutes rigging up what I thought would be a kid-proof barrier, only to have my daughter get into the cabinets within minutes.I found the Tot Loks one day when we were looking at child proof products, and boy, do I wish we had found them sooner. These things are great. After a lengthy install process - my hubby is a do-it-yourself handyman type and it still took awhile to install - our daughter can no longer get into the cabinets.I would highly recommend these to anyone who needs to keep kiddos (or even pets) out of cabinets.

However the lock is very difficult to open even for the parents because the magnet isn't powerful enough to open the lock when mounted on the cabinet door.Hard to believe because when I opened the package the key would open the lock from about an inch away. Once we installed it on the cabinet it took a lot of struggle to get the lock to open. My wife amd most people wouldn't have the patience for this lock.I'm looking for a more powerful magnet from a hardware store otherwise I'm returning these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept... poorly made","review":"We are just starting to baby proof our house (our son is just rolling and scooting) and thought that these locks were a great idea. And yes, the concept is great but they are very poorly made. After installing two locks (we had to drill twice for one lock because the guide sent with the kit didn't line up correctly!!!) one lock just didn't work. The latch piece of plastic didn't fit well into the lock and kept rubbing on the top. The magnetic field wasn't strong enough to counter this. We had to unlock this door from the inside by opening the other door, luckly that one was working. I figured, oh well I can always just open the other door to unlock the second... but now it doesn't even stay locked. We are just going to install the old fashioned plastic lever locks. This is great concept and I hope another company takes the idea and builds a better product. Don't waste your money... these locks definately need some work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"This lock is great in theory, but in practice it's a pain to install and an even bigger pain to use.

In looking at the pictures of the door and door, I am none the wiser as to EXACTLY where to position the locks. I hope that once my husband figures it out they will be worth the trouble, but at this point I'm completely baffled as to where they attach, and a bit annoyed that I wasn't able to install them when I had planned to. I would really appreciate any help more successful installers can offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happens when they break???","review":"We purchased the tot locs after hearing rave reviews. After a couple of weeks of use, one cabinet would simply not open. Luckily there is a drawer above this cabinet and my husband was able to stick his hand in and open the cabinet from behind. We could see that the lock was broken. It had completely lost it's magnetic power--how, I don't know.Now we don't know what to do. If this happens again, especially on a freestanding cabinet--we're \\"in trouble\\" How are we supposed to open our cabinet if it breaks? The only way would be to ruin our beautiful new cabinets. We'll probably take them all out and go with the old-fashioned latch locks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Install on High End Cabinets","review":"These were impossible to install.

My autistic children figured out every type of cabinet lock I had, including spring hooks. These can't be seen and work great - just don't lose the magnetic key!Works best on cupboard doors, although they do work on drawers too, but you can get into the drawers by slipping in a knife or screwdriver if you do lose the key.Directions could be clearer but once you put in one the rest go quite easy. Highly recommend for safety and convenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a full set of drill bits, it's not a problem at all","review":"I wouldn't consider myself a handyman at all, and these locks were easy to install. It seems like people who had a problem installing these either A)were afraid of/didn't know how to use a drill B)had abnormally thick cabinets or C)didn't read the instructions. Just follow the instructions, and you'll be fine. Our cabinets don't budge an inch, and I'm confident that my daughter won't be able to pry them open. Heck, I can't pry them open. They are more expensive than the other kinds, so we just got these for our cabinets that have sharp objects or chemicals in them. For the other drawers and cabinets, we just used the cheap, plastic hooks.Overall, very good, very effective, and very easy to install."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This author describe the incredible life of a viking noble.

The best feature is the ability to open the pliers with one hand. That comes in very handy when you have a rod or a fish in the other hand. The wire cutters went through fireline very well, and the scissors handle every other type of line. The file and knife blade came out easily and locked into place so you don't have the issue of it folding back on it's self. Not to mention it's a very sharp blade! The only down side was using the split ring spreader was a little awkward it's pretty far back on the tool. One piece of advice, USE THE LANYARD.

Since the new formula has been released, it is no longer a good product. It does smell more like olive oil and lost the lemon oil smell as other reviewers had mentioned. While lemon oil shows higher on the ingredient list now, I suspect it is of a lower quality. Something is off about it. The consistency is also thinner. It no longer feels like a good quality lotion. It would best be compared to a facial cleansing milk consistency now (which Avalon has and I used until that formula changed for the worse as well). I have given this version a chance for the past three months, but lately have been reluctantly getting through the bottle. I will find another brand that maintains their quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Girlfriend Loved This","review":"My girlfriend loves the smell of lavender and uses hand and body lotion regularly so I took a chance and bought her some for Christmas.

No plastics, either. I like the shampoos, the scent is awesome and they're great for4 everyday, though they won't remove product buildup if you're into gels and mousse and so on. As for this lotion, I like the texture - smooth, not waxy, disappears pretty well. The scent is very deep, very authentic, and quite soothing - I use this at bedtime most nights. My husband loves when I put it on while we're getting ready to sleep. One negative - it has a very little bit of stickiness to it that I dislike.

In addition, the way the products are labeled it's almost impossible to tell which is lotion vs hand wash without a lot of light and glasses.The \\"off-lavender\\" odor of the lotion is very strong, almost overpowering, and the lotion itself is cloying and greasy.This was not a good choice at all - I should have looked more carefully at packaging and such before purchasing. But who can mess up lavender? Avalon. That's who.Can't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It might be new, but it ain't improved","review":"On the label it says \\"NEW! More essential oils!\\" I thought, great. Yeah. No. It has a more pepperminty smell in order to mask some chemical smell behind it. It makes your hands smell like peppermint gasoline.

Value per page definitely beats the others hollow (e.g., Killer App, Blur, Blown to bits, Enterprise.com). Schwartz is very focussed, and precise in what he has to say.

I have read the author's sci-fi series of Intrepid Force novels, which are much longer and more in depth-- but this story, though shorter, is also quite inventive in plot. I feel it would also interest teen readers, as a large part of its focus involves an occurence that happened when the main character, Jim, was twelve.The story has a good deal of nostalgia for those of us who's childhood spanned through the seventies. You will read about many familiar things from that era as you make your way through the story.The struggle to set things right and establish the correct timeline is interesting in the ramifications that result. It shows, in several instances, that the power of love is strong enough to make huge differences in people's lives.I recommend this book to all readers, and now I am off to read Timothy Wise's new fantasy novel, The Sign of the Sword."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not have been released","review":"Love Shah Rukh Khan and I have a pretty extensive collection.

I totally agree with the other reviewer about this movie--VERY CONFUSING, like she said--disjointed and didn't flow, and Shah Rukh was hardly in it! At the beginning of the movie it starts when the kids are young then tells you it's 10 years later and they're in college...and then jumps from????????? They don't fill in the huge gaps in between and then it just continues on like that. It was very weird. There was no smart dialogue, the acting wasn't that great and not even any catchy or memorable songs!

That is, a book that step-by-step takes you through the process of setting up and using a program.David Mercer's book does the opposite. He uses a lot of words and anecdotes that are of little/no relevance and make it hard to find the information you need (if it is there at all).I bought this book because I needed to learn quickly how to set up osCommerce sites. Had expected that it would show me the process in a fairly clear and straight-forward manner, but found the explanations so confusing and lacking that I could have saved the money.Ended up going to Zen Cart instead.Which seems a lot easier to use, and has much better instructions.Live and learn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"the dremmel gets very very hot, very very quicklyI am actualy afraid of melting the thing. A minute of use and you realy want to put on a pair of gloves. It never got hot enough to burn me, but was too hot to justify not using gloves. And by using gloves you just end up blocking more of the airflow (lovely how the vents get covered by your hand) thus getting the thing ever hotter. The accessory kit is very deceiving - most of what you get are cheap cutting wheels (not the good reinforced ones - not 1 of those) and sanding drums - each counting as its own \\"piece\\".Its unwieldy, not comfortable, if you want to do anything you have to buy tons of expensive acessories. Also the thing screams it is so incredibly loud at higher settings.

He told me she had a cavity in her front incisor and how he could fix the problem if I had a Dremel Tool and some Temparin Filling Material. He sedated Precious and selected a small grinding tip to remove the decay from her tooth. He filled the hole with Temparin and used a felt polishing tip to smooth the surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great versatility","review":"This tool has great versatility and performance.

Would recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, just a minor complaint","review":"I love the Dremel. Works like a charm including the flex shaft. Make sure you read the directions on how to use the flex shaft, specifically the proper operation. The dremel motor should be held (or hung) above the business end of the flex shaft for proper usage and safety.My only complaint- minor- the accessories are all lumped together in bags with no labels. You have to go through the manual and match the pictures with the accessory and sometimes with ambiguity. I eventually figured it out and used a label maker to make things better. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It gets 5 for performance and 4 for packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for pet and home owners","review":"Chose the Dremel after reading product reviews and because dog owners and groomers recommend it for trimming dog nails, which is my primary use. So far, so good. It does a great job on the nails. I like the variable speed and the extension tool, which is easier to wield and less obtrusive and scary for the dogs. Only gave it 4 stars because I haven't had it long enough to know if the Dremel will last over the long haul. I think I'll buy a Dremel for my cousin who's hobby is mosaics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best rotary tool ever!!!","review":"This is a great product. I highly recommend it. It's very powerful and there are so many different applications for the flex-shaft adapter (which is the main reason I purchased this kit). The price on Amazon.com was great because it was an open box item but this is easily worth about 50% more than the highest price you can buy it for.The only downside is that you're really only buying the dremel, flex-shaft, and case. There isn't a very wide variety of tasks you can perform with the included accessories. So an additional accessory assortment is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"This rating is about honesty. I haven't tried this tool yet.

You now have to go and buy those."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as I was hoping","review":"I bought this for my husband who was less than thrilled by it. I used it a few times and it worked okay. The packing case was a big dissapointment, very poorly designed and one of the cutting tools arrived broken which was not surprising considering how poorly they were packed. I was happy when my husband finally took it out to use it and it died halfway through the job. Just stopped working for no apparent reason. Let's hope the warrenty is better than the tool.

I had given up hope of ever seeing anything returned after more than 6 months of waiting when finally a package came with the replacement for it.

I find this one superior to my original, I think the quality is good and the flexible shaft and accessories provided will cover all of my needs.

I didn't use the tool often and about a year later (maybe 30 min of actual run time over the life of the tool) it ran for about 2-3 seconds and died. I purchased the black and decker rotary tool for 30$ and it's almost as good and doesn't break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accessories a disappointment","review":"While the tool itself is satisfactory, I'm very disappointed in the limited types of accessories that came with it. I had thought that the package would be a bargain with its 77 accessories, and that I'd have what I need for my simple projects, yet I now have to buy several more accessories at great expense to me because most of the accessories are similar sanding items.Also, the included polishing pads are not thick enough to cover the sharp metal point on the end of the attachment piece, so my projects get scratched from the protruding point! I'm very disappointed and discouraged about this tool package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my jewelry making.","review":"I bought the Dremel 3956-02 variable speed after using a two-speed cordless mini for several years. This model is a great improvement with the variable speeds and increased power. It is used primarily for lapidary work and silver polishing, and it does a great job for me.

It does, however, exemplify exactly how dynamic the health care industry is and how the best laid plans can be suddently dashed by forces external to the organization.One note of subjective personal opinion: The authors tone is somewhat arrogant.

For my own use, I tend to use it as an oracle rather than a tarot deck; i.e: I use it in specific circumstances and not for everyday readings, but it's well worth the money. If I were reading for a client, I would use this for my clients who tend to be more connected with earth-centered religions and native/aboriginal belief systems.Not only do most of the cards really connect with the concepts they are meant to symbolize, but the pictures are clear, crisp and vivid.

I have learned in the past through mistakes that you can't always fight the truth the decks can reveal. I fought long battles with my first deck thinking it couldn't be right I was too new. It was. When this deck came in my life it helped me through a divorce and finacial difficulties telling the truth and giving me the hope to continue. I have since become closer to nature and more at ease with myself and the things around me. If you have a connection with nature and animals this is the deck for you.

Is is a coincidence that he wrote this book after Harry Nielson had died? As previous reviewers have mentioned, there are many contradictions in the work as well. Lennon had an uncontrollable libidio, but was also impotent??? I think that the truth lies somewhere between the author's presentation and the near mythic qualities attributted to John Lennon. I am actually sorry that I even read the book, the truth be told."},{"rating":"2","title":"THis was such a great book","review":"I read all of this book and it was great.

This odious \\"biography\\" makes the late but not lamented Albert Goldman seem scholarly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"I think the number one thing that struck me about this book was how quick the author was to put Lennon's life under such a negative light. In just the prologue he lists various sexual encounters Lennon experianced. It seems like the author is more interested in schocking the reader, then giving a good biography. Many of the experiances listed are ones the witnesses claimed to have seen or been involved in. Anybody can make something up about John Lennon. I mean its quite easy for any individual who lived in New York around Lennons time to say \\" I had sex with John Lennon\\". Pure crap. I don not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"GUILIANO'S BAD KARMA","review":"Geoffrey Guiliano's book \\" Lennon in America\\" is a devious piece of lowly thrash out to make a few quick bucks.Mr. Guiliano has dedicated this book to his mentor and master A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada of the KRSNA consciousness. Being a hindu myself, i wonder how a genuine disciple of \\" KRSNA Consciousness\\" can sink to such prurient depths... or is it just the author living out his bad karma?As a Lennon follower one is left cheated because most of Lennon's supposed escapades ( as recounted by the author) are nothing but cooked-up hogwash without proof or substance.It is easy to write such books. I paid Rs 500/- for this garbage and i don't suppose Mr Guilaino will return the money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biography: But the clothes and buttons of a man","review":"I haven't read this book--I just leafed through it while in a bookstore today. That means that I can't give an assessment of it. All I can do is quote the song \\"Look at Me,\\" from the \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" album: \\"Who am I?/Nobody knows but me/ Nobody knows but me.\\" I'd say that about says it all, doesn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Lost John","review":"I'm very sorry I put down thirty dollars for this book. Giuliano, who includes five pictures of himself in the photos section, takes every opportunity to portray himself as the sole crusader for truth in a world of profiteering phonies ruled by Yoko Ono. The number of small, snide, petty comments and uncorroborated accusations is staggering. Giuliano doesn't seem to think that accusations of rape, incest, and abuse need any more than anecdotal evidence to back them up, and very little of the book discusses Lennon's talent and genius. Giuliano also takes unprovoked potshots at Julia Baird and her book, which he had co-author credit on, oddly enough. The author has something to prove and his book isn't worth your time unless you're interested in seeing how Geoffrey Giuliano wrestles with his issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giuliano At It Again....","review":"You think after seeing the other junk produced by this individual that people would learn. So, this message goes out to those that may not know Mr. Giuliano. Some of you may think \\"Wow, this guy really knows what he is talking about.\\" Don't kid yourself. It's all his assumptions. This guy reminds me of someone who is given 3 dots on a piece of paper and is told to connect the dots and draws the Statue of Liberty. He will make up whatever he thinks fits or sells. If you really want to see how amateurish his Beatles work really is, check out BEATLES- A CELEBRATION dvd. Actually, don't buy it! Just go read the other reviews on this site. They alone will be enough to steer you clear of this man's Beatles meddlings."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I was excited to read this book when I first heard about it, but now that I have, I feel like a great opportunity was missed. Things are hinted at and then never returned to, built up conflicts end with a one-sentence resolution, and the main subjects (Lennon and Yoko) are extreme cartoons. Giuliano introduced this book by saying it was going to portray the non-saintly version of John, but even as he's relating tales of John beating May Pang, the next sentence will be, \\"To his credit, John wanted to change.\\" Yoko has an equally one-sided portrayal, this one as the devil herself. I'm sure this book is mostly true, but it's so badly written its impact has been lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe there's something to this","review":"After hearing all the controversial buzz over Lennon in America I decided to read the book and keep an open mind. For those who say their beloved Beatle John couldn't possibly have behaved this way-ie, bouts of physical violence, drug use, manipulation by his wife, check previous sources: John Green, Albert Goldman, Fred Seaman, May Pang. I guess they're all lying too, right, and it's all a conspiracy? And remember way back when, when Yoko Ono was universally despised as the \\"Dragon Lady\\" who broke up the Beatles? I guess this must be revisionist history at its finest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lennon in America","review":"John Lennon himself admitted his shortcomings many times in his short life, so this book comes as no shock to me. I read it out of curiosity and suspicion of what the author was up to. Almost everything in this book was revealed by Lennon himself during his life. Yoko Ono had nothing to do with breaking the \\"Beatles Bubble\\". Ego clashes did the deed. The greatest truth of all was written by John Lennon himself when he wrote \\"All You Need Is Love\\". It takes a coward to put out such a book when it's subject isn't around to speak for himself. And by the way....John Loved Yoko, so why should anything written by anyone else matter. Yoko was/is John's Angel like it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filthy, disgusting garbage","review":"Giuliano is a well-known Beatles fanatic who decided to write an extended poison pen bio. He claims to have tapes or copies of John Lennon's diaries, but can't explain why his interpretation of the diaries seem VERY different than other people who really have seen them, and he claims that his copy of the diaries were given to him by someone who probably didn't have them. This book is poorly written, seems rushed to press in time to beat _Anthology_ and doesn't offer anything more than a bunch of unsuspported and ridiculous assumptions. Giuliano, for his part, claims to be telling the truth because he \\"sits on a throne\\" and because \\"people worship\\" him, as he said in an interview in a Buffalo NY newspaper. So why would he lie? I dunno, because the combination of money, arrogance and nuttiness is a difficult combination to live honestly by maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very imaginative","review":"This book is pure tripe. Particularly offensive is the outrageous suggestion that Stuart Sutcliffe an early Beatles band member and John's best friend died from Lennon kicking him in the head, and allegedly also had a sexual relationship with Lennon.Ok, we all know Lennon was flawed and insecure and paranoid and who wouldn't be having been abandoned by both parents as a child, and then as an adult having achieved fame wondering if people were interested in him because they genuinely liked him or wanted to exploit his fame and wealth.But this guy really goes beyond the pale by trotting out every half truth and rumor, and presenting it as the truth. If you are a Lennon fan and really want to read this book, just pop into your local bookstore and browse through it, you will get the general flavor. Do not reward this guy for pandering to the lowest common denominator."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMAGINING DONE LITERALLY","review":"I think all anyone needs to know about Geoffrey Guilliano is that this man faked his own death to avoid being chased after all the money he owed.And he did it by taking advantage of the 9/11 tragedy where he had messages sent to dubious sources to say he'd been in one of the Twin Towers that day.After which his body was one of many never discovered thus saving any positive sighting of it and an obituary.At first he got a heap of sympathy messages on a Beatles websiteuntil he was rumbledIts Reassessment Time here.His Harrison book bears the blurb \\"Guilliano knows more about my life than I do\\"Which is doubtful as Harrison threatened to sue him!So he no doubt added that himself1 Star is because you can't award lower"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can always blame the dead","review":"This book looks like rubbish knowing that : 1) it's based upon Fred Seasman memories (Seasmen was jailed for stealing Lennon & Ono properties) 2) memories of reading of John's diaries (what a reliable information) 3) you can always blame dead people, they won't answer youLike Albert Goldman or Steven Gaines, this author simply exploit John death."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A BUNCH OF LIES!","review":"This book which claims to be based on the \\"lost lennon diaries\\" which it odviously is not is about 10% truth.Giuliano is a liar who does not have anything nice to say about John in this book which i wish i had never read because it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor reading of life's downs","review":"I'd like to say, nicely, that the truth is a secondary object on these pages. The facts ARE jumbled, but it's the INTERPRETATION which is even more jumbled. His tales of Lennon's drug intake and sexual \\"misconduct\\" are told in the tone of the mid-to-high dudgeon of a disillusioned spiritual acolyte. Anyone who has walked, crawled, tried to run, in the fallow periods of the soul, will recognize Lennon's hypothermia. Giuliano attacks the star image - - walk lightly among this, we're in the hands of someone who doesn't know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Rock Did This Guy Crawl Out From Under?","review":"This book reads like poorly written fiction, and there is a heck of lot better fiction out there then this. It obviously doesn't take a lot to write and publish a book. How many times is John Lennon going to be killed? It's a shame every library across the country will circulate this on their shelves.

If you agree with that viewpoint (which I do), then you would love this book. It is very detailed and has many wonderful color charts which explains O.T. and N.T. prophecies such as that of Daniel and Revelation. If you don't agree with the premillennial/ pre-trib viewpoint, you may not like it that much. But I believe that no matter which millennial viewpoint you adopt, you would still find this book beneficial and informative. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a word of truth","review":"I got this book for a gift many years ago and read prolifically into it. While it has a multitude of charts that look good and presents the view that is accepted as truth by the majority today, they all blatantly disregard the prophecy's key, the Old Testament prophecies.If you want to read and understand Revelation, you need only to study the Old Testament, with an emphasis in the prophetic books. From John's getting caught up to heaven and eating the scroll(see Ezekiel 1) to the two witnesses (see Zechariah 4), and onward to the vision of Christ in Revelation 19 (see Isaiah 49:2-3)-the Revelation becomes unlocked. Its all in there! Through this we can discern between what is truth and the clever stories thought up by man.Ultimately Revelation is just what it says - \\"The Revelation of Jesus Christ\\", looking into his power, authority, and attributes. Don't be tripped up on the theories of man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the real truth lies....","review":"... People should realize that such \\"End Times\\" nonsense was concocted and is perpetuated to scare people into \\"being saved.\\" That of course means financially supporting and obeying a ministry that will flatter your ego, telling you that you are now a \\"true Christian,\\" and superior to everyone else. Fortunately, there are good books available that tell the real truth, such as Real Prophecy Unveiled, by Joseph J. Adamson, and The Isaish Effect, by Gregg Braden. They provide an accurate view of prophecy, while Jeffrey's book merely pushes right-wing propaganda in the guise of \\"God's Word.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I absolutely love this book!

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"Not all of this book is about the end times.The time periods in the charts don't match up. i.e. one chart says one thing, another chart contradicts the previous. Two of the charts give two different time spans between creation and Christ's ascension.Ok, now for the theology. This is the same old faulty doctrine that's been reworded so many times that no one has bothered to see if the Bible actually says everything LaHaye is teaching..... I did check. The Bible does not support this view of the end times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy","review":"After paying for this item on Feb 28, I still have not received it as of today, April 10.

The problem now is, even if they work at the beginning of a haircut, we don't trust that they'll finish the job, and cutting boys' hair is such a big undertaking at our house, we hardly look forward to getting the job half-done and then heading back to the store for another clipper to finish it.

So having all of them break has rendered the entire set useless. No sense trying to replace the combs at Remington; they don't appear to carry parts anymore for this model.

I can't wear Sony's headphones for more than an hour before the cartilidge in my ear starts to hurt.I don't know much about sound quality, but they sound pretty good to me.

Not an overwhelming negative, but probably more complicated than it needs to be, considering kids grow up and you may want to uninstall the locks at some point (leaving your cabinets riddled with holes). The reason I'm giving this one star is the weakness of the magnets. Performance was poor. Even with the extension piece on the magnet, it only picked up to open the doors / drawers intermittently. Also, the drill depth guide only works on a 9/32\\" drill bit, which doesn't come in a standard set of drill bits. You will want to pick one up at the hardware store if you plan to install these locks without drilling through your cabinet doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to install","review":"These locks were so difficult to install I returned them. To be fair I was trying to install them some drawers that were a tight fit, so it was almost impossible to drill the holes. I'm sure it would work well if you have the proper cabinets, but make sure it is easy to drill holes where you want the locks placed. They do make magnetic locks that are stick on. I plan to try those next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, too hard to install !","review":"I had heard these locks were great and thought I would try them considering my 18 month old son can open every other type of child lock.

I now have ONE cabinet that he can't get into and that is where I'll have to put all the \\"un-safes\\".

We had no such luck are cabinets were to thick but were not thick enough to use the extender. After mean attempts and many failures we returned them. Our friends also had the same problem.

Just be weary and save your receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"You want me to do what?","review":"This product is a great concept, BUT it has a critical flaw for me. The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter. I mean, why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers? Hello? Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed. What about those holes? It is cute that the manual says \\"do not drill through the door,\\" hugh? Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors? Also, what happens if say the door cracks while I drill? Who pays for that? I know the answer to that one -> ME! Soooo....product is going back. Non-starter"},{"rating":"1","title":"Installation is ridiculous","review":"Such a great idea but...installation is ridiculously difficult but I suffered through to protect my child. I ended up with holes in my nice furniture and a system that will not work. My entertainment center is a hardwood, maybe that's a factor I don't know, but my cabinets aren't thick enough for the extension slug so I'm at a loss. Maybe I'll look for a stronger magnet and try again since the damage is already done.Oh well I guess that's why they make wood filler and stain, just add that to my list of a million projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cabinet-lock system","review":"We tried Safety 1st's alternative cabinet lock, the kind you press down with your fingers just inside the cabinet door, as well as Tot Lok. We put some of each system on various cabinets in the kitchen. Tot Lok is vastly superior to the other kind. It works every time instead just most of the time; it makes it impossible for our 18-month-old to smash her fingers in the drawers and cabinets; it is strong and secure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this concept","review":"This a great tool to keep toddlers out of cabinets. I've tried the product that latches on the cabinet or drawers and I found them harder to install. This install can be rather tricky but it's worth it once they are in place. It comes with a guide to help you figure out where the screws go, the main tricky part is drilling the required hole and stopping just before you go all the way through your cabinet. Although it comes with a piece that helps you know where to stop, you have to do one cabinet to figure this out first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will definitely keep your kids out","review":"We installed these to keep the kids out of the knife drawers. They worked well at first but had a learning curve. Visitors to the house found it impossible to work, because we had to have the magnet positioned just so. That is actually a good safety feature, because the kids know the magnet opens the drawers and would attempt to open the drawers when they get their hands on the magnet.As far as keeping the kids out, it worked well. I'd say it's been in our drawer for about six years. We no longer use it and it hasn't worked well for about a year or so. The magnet no longer unlatches the lock and we can't get into the drawer.This is a good lock, but require the willingness to drill into the woodwork of your cabinets. It takes work for people to learn. I think it should have lasted longer than five years, but maybe that's all most people need. 4 stars for the fact that it does what it's designed to do but not 5 stars, because it has issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"This sounded good in theory, but didn't work at all. They were correctly installed by my husband, but the magnet is just not strong enough to get it to open. It was a waste of money for our cabinets. It may work if you have the thinner particle board cabinets, but it definitely didn't work through our solid wood cabinets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but what a pain to install","review":"These locks are fantastic, but wow, what a pain to install. The directions are all but useless, so it was kind of trial and error. My husband had to drill and redrill a couple of times to get the lock in the right place so that it would work.I would recommend these locks only for cabinets/drawers where there are dangerous/harmful goods inside.

If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it's a duck but then the author has B. getting it on with the redhead from Scalamandre's and wanting to get it on with Eydie Von Gunn. The author might be implying that B. is bi. Who really cares and who needs this sort of \\"intrigue\\" anyway?The book sold like wildfire initially because her fans ran out to buy it but let's see if it will have staying power. I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"her worst","review":"While trying to impress us with her knowledge of decorating, architecture and food, Trigiani forgot to tell a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I started with Big Stone Gap series and was hooked. From then on out, I read EVERY book this author put out and was VERY satisfied. However, when I got to this one I was almost instantly disappointed. The book was filled with pages and pages of details that only an interior designer would care about. I MADE myself finish this book. I hope that the new book by this author will be as good as her earlier ones. I HIGHLY recommend any of her other books, just not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleck","review":"Ok, so it's set in 1970s. Maybe we can chalk the whole book up to qiana, leisure suits, and bad facial hair. But there's more than that. This is a badly told story. One reviewer described it as a book about B, who realizes that everyone in his family comes to him for help, and then realizes that the whole town loves him and will help him when he needs it. George Bailey, he's not. And the Irish Catholic painter friend is no angel Clarence. I guess the Priest is supposed to be Mr. Potter. Hey, just rent It's a Wonderful Life, and skip the wannabe.And what's with the recipes printed in the story, and the catalogue numbers of fabric B used in his decorating jobs? Do we WANT to go out and order swatches of fabric (by inventory number) of items used in 1970s decor?Don't get your hopes up on this one. I've not read the author's other work, but after this one I won't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rococo Rocks!","review":"I have been an Adriani Trigiani fan since the publication of her first book. Because I am Italian (and Catholic) her books always seem to hit a tender spot. The characters remind me of my childhood living just outside Boston in a large Italian neighborhood. Adriani really captures the human condition to the point of you feeling like you are right there in the moment. I also have some experience working with an interior designer so I can almost place myself in the rooms that \\"B\\" decorates. Adri can make you feel like you're in the room with him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lack of interest","review":"I have loved all her books but should have known when the book cover shows her name at least 3 times larger than the name of the book that this was a bad sign.

What a disappointment after the great stuff she's written in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I have read all of Ms Trigiani's other books, even bought them on tape to listen to in the car. Without any hsesitation I purchased this one. darn!--guess they can't all be winners. :*(That this book took place in the early '70's did not come through clearly. B seemed so stereotypical gay with all his references to detail, color, food, etc, yet Ms Trigiani went to great lengths to make sure he was a hot blooded male. This was a bit schizo and did not work for me. The detailed descriptiions, after a while, seemed like so much filler so I began to skip them. I have not yet met a man who is straight who sees like that and talks like that and emotes like that all the time as B did.I did like the receipes and the family interactions. They were fun, silly and a bit outré. I will wait untilt her next book is published to make any broader conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While I don't believe a writer has to follow in his/her own footsteps and write the same type of books over and over, this departure by Adriana Trigiani is not successful.While it has the obligatory trip to Italy, it makes little or nothing of the trip and since a decorator is making the trip, I would have thought that she would have included a wealth of description here. Instead the trip is glossed over and we are treated to only those descriptions of ottomans and fabric that adorn the homes of di Crespi's New Jersey clients.The book is filled with caricatures and not characters and no New Jersey Italian stereotype is left unturned.Not much of a story and the main character is rather boring as well.If you insist on reading it, save your money and go to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone knows a family like this!","review":"Anyone, Italian-American or not, knows a family like this wild bunch.

It was definitely much needed after all the tears I shed with The Shoemaker's Wife.B and Toot had such an amazing relationship. Hilarious family dynamics. It reminds me of the one I have with my older brother of 11 years.This was a book about a designer that was married to his work -his art. I enjoyed all of the details about his work and the designs, because he was so passionate about it. It was like reading about how much you love your spouse and all of his amazing qualities. I love to see the passion in people. When someone loves something or someone so much that it's all they can think about. That was B. He loved interior design so much it was his life.This was also another book that was so strong regarding family. It doesn't matter what shape or size your family comes in, all that matters is how you cherish it.Great, funny, light-hearted book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Trigiani/ Annoying reader","review":"This is not up to Adriana Trigiani's usual storytelling standards in the first place, but the reader of the audio version makes matters even worse. When he's reading the narrator's part (a hunky straight 40-year-old interior designer) he sounds like a girl, and when he's reading any of the female parts, he sounds like Harvey Fierstein on speed. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and listened to 2 of the 4 audio CDs, but then I just could not take any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"32 oz rubber mallet","review":"The Tekton wood handle 32 oz rubber mallet was a great purchase.

It just squeezes onto your head like an alien claw leaving your ears in pain if you wear them for more than a half an hour.The microphone also seems to produce good quality sound, but the swivel adjustment on it doesn't hold well so it constantly keeps falling away from my mouth.Lastly, the foam ear-piece covers are cheap and kept falling off, after two years I have lost them completely. This makes wearing the headphones that much more painful, so as you might imagine, I don't wear them much at all anymore.If you are going to shell out this much for a headset, make sure it is a comfortable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mic, bad noise isolation","review":"Sennheiser makes great headsets.It works great with Skype, ooVoo and many other VoIP apps. Over Skype the quality is crustal clear.However the sound of the headphones lacks bass. Plus noise isolation is almost non existent. I would strongly recommend PC151 instead, cause it provides better noise isolation. It's on sale now, so at the same price it's a much better deal.Sennheiser PC151 Over The Head Headset with Noise Cancelling Mic and In-line Volume ControlOverall a Sennheiser product is way better than any noname or some brands like: Phillips, Samsung, Panasonic etc...My personal favorite with this model is a 3m cord. It comes really handy at a desktop PC, cause I can sit in my chair as far from the table as I need.Use it extensively every day for more than a year now. No signs of malfunction or any other problems. The cord and headset itself although do not look very sturdy will last for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well but a tad tight...","review":"The sound quality is good and the microphone works well. I use it for Battlefield 2142. I bought this headset after having microphone problems with Logitech's Internet Chat headset. I can't give it five stars because it is a little tight and I would have liked the volume control a bit closer to the headset. I was able to fix the tightness by just leaving it in a stretched position when I wasn't using them (I leave them wrapped around my computer case) but it would be nicer if it were a little less tight to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"These headphones are definitely worth buying at the price.Pros: Great sound quality although not the best. Never had any jarring of bass or high frequencies but the sound could have been a lot fuller. Nice inline volume control. Mic quality is super. These headphones are extremely lightweight.Cons: Prolonged wear leads to an aching of ears. The most comfortable design is big earcups which cover your ear. Small earcups which dont cover your ears completely are worse than an open air design like this pc130. Secondly, the build doesnt feel very solid. It remains to be seem how long it is before it breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate at Best","review":"This vac is noisy, so wear ear protection when using. Power cord is too short. It is attached to the motor/blower which sits atop the unit. If you place the motor/blower in a position so that the cord is facing away from you, the blower directs the air back at you during vacuuming.Not as much suction as you might imagine. The \\"anti-tip\\" design is a misnomer. The wands are too short, causing you to have to bend over while vacuuming the floor.The blower seems to work better that the vacuum.All in all, look for another unit.

I found this alarm clock to keep very good time and the batteries last in this clock. I would highly recommend anyone to buy this type clock,---it's not only for the sight impaired. It's so easy to just reach over to the nightstand in the middle of the night and hit the top and hear what time it is without having to look. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"youngdale hinges","review":"I have used these hinges on many doors, both inset and overlay, for cabinets and furniture and had no failures. A slot must be cut in the door that is 25/32\\" deep and 9/16\\" long. Therefore if you are using a frame and panel door the stile should be at least 2\\" wide for strength and to hide the hinge for glass insets. I have used them on 1-1/2\\" stiles and had no failures but I am uneasy about weakening the stile so much at the slot on a 3/4\\" door. Thicker doors will provide more strength. I have cut the slots on a table saw (overlay) and hand chopped them for more control on 3/8's inset doors with 1/1/2\\" stiles. Youngdale has some installation tools on it's website that seem to have been developed by cabinet shops. In spite of my concerns about strength I continue to use them because of relatively low cost and low external profile. However, I suspect I will switch to euro hinges in the future for frame and panel doors if I can find them at the right price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great replacement drip pans.

The main character Ryel is surrounded by a building sexual tension that changes his role in the world as he discovers the machinations of the malevolent Dagar. From intensely intimate scenes between Ryel and Edris, to Michael's stark cruelty, this book was crafted with word by word care and it shows.

The characters all fall instantly and irrevocably in love. The \\"good\\" characters are all beautiful in every way while the \\"evil\\" ones are ugly. My caveat to readers, if you are looking for a fantasy novel along the lines of Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind or Melanie Rawn then this is not the book for you. However, if you are looking for a harlequin style romance fantasy novel, then this is just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true one percenter","review":"In that I didn't make it past the 1% mark.

Like another person posted, the diameter of the hole for the saw was slightly off and required a bit of work to get it to even go on the saw.

I ended up going to Lowes and buying a SkillSaw brand diamond blade for 4 dollars more and it has already exceeded this one.Overall, if you need a blade to make a couple cuts and you want to save a few bucks, then this one might work for you after a bit of fine tuning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond Turbo Blade","review":"I am very pleased with the performance of this blade for cutting cement fiberboard siding/hardee plank.

It's a candy coated treatment of the world, and quite unengaging and limited in both scope and content. Have your children read Grimm's fairytales or else Aesop's Fables.

I enjoyed the tongue in cheek humor used by the author when her main character, Cat Moselle keeps seeing headlines from her paper as the events are happening to her. I will be looking forward to a sequel, as the author ended the story with that expectation. One thing I did find interesting that I didn't notice mentioned by the other reviewers, was the idea of diffences-weremen & werewolves-also the family interaction was interesting because it was more like animals. Anyway, I enjoyed it & would recommend it for anyone looking for a dfferent type of werewolf story."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I expected more from this book, but it ended up feeling like just another horror paperback (for which I paid a hardcover price). The tabloid headlines were cute for a while, but there wasn't much depth, and the twist at the end was both dark and disappointingly cliche. The book left me both depressed and uninterested in what would happen next. The convention of using italics and capitals to refer to gender/family relations when speaking from a werewolf's point of view was stylistically annoying and distracting, to boot. I'm generally a fan of werewolf books, and eager to go along with whatever the new spin on the mythology is, but this just wasn't fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good and Disappointing.","review":"I gave this book a two, because it really is good if you don't like \\"Happily-Ever-After\\" It has good ideas, but it has a bad ending.

It makes the game different though.However, my favorite part of the game is the cheats. Being able to throw unlimited newpapers like a maniac is just really funny and hitting anything in your way or not in your way results with a funny response from the object.If you are looking for a seroius game, don't get this.

This book contains useful chapters on topics like refactoring, RSS feeds and security issues. But if you are looking for a basic tutorial that will get you up to speed quickly I would suggest the \\"AJAX For Dummies\\" book. At about half the cost and size, it's a much better read.

The current web-world is spinning around Web2.0 and AJAX technology - there must be more than that. Then I went back to the store and picked this book up - I am glad I did. It covers many more areas that an AJAX programmer must equip himself/herself, topics relating to MVC pattern, working with the server side programs and performance, security, as well as the basic topic: building standalone RIA using CSS, DOM and DHTML.This one definitely shines over the rest on the topic, however, for a hands-on programmer (that's me), I would appreciate more code samples will help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but unfortunately way out of date","review":"It's amazing how much the JavaScript world has changed.This book has a relaxing style, and it was enjoyable to read.

These days, having studied Dojo, jQuery, and Douglas Crockford's videos, it's clear that closures are at the heart of how modern JavaScript is written.The copyright for this book is 2006, yet the index doesn't even mention Firebug, YUI, dojo, or jQuery which are now staples of the JavaScript community.

Vague writing. I don't think the author has actual experience Ajax or design patterns ,he talks about.The chapters and sample codes looks more like written by a beginner . Too much plumbing and bad coding practice.And did I said verbose ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine as a historical document but that's it","review":"The rule of St. Benedict is an important historical document as it guided Western monasticism for close to 1500 years. Anyone who attempts to follow it today to the letter needs to have their head (and heart) examined, though. He advocates physical beatings and other cruelties, even of the young. His advice that each monk be provided with no more than a pound of bread as their sole food daily provides no more than 1200 calories-an amount certain to lead to malnutrition in many people.Yes, I understand that Benedict was laying down rules for large communities in another age and era. Now, if only those who think that we should use this as a guide TODAY would only accept that this is not the middle ages and the context NOW makes many ancient texts irelevant. Read this for spiritual reading?! To what purpose? You can spend your time more profitably with another book that does not require another volume of commentary to expain, and apologize for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply delightful.","review":"This book is charming and hilarious. I have given it to many, many people, all dog lovers. The first half is about his childhood and crazy relatives, and the second half is about his experiences (with his wife) training dogs. He is wonderful at describing the dogs personalities. The illustrations, by his wife, are delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for any dog-lover","review":"Daniel Pinkwater is a very smart and funny writer -- one who knows the value of not taking himself too seriously. This thoroughly enjoyable book points out what most perceptive dog-lovers know: that dogs have a lot to teach us, about them and about ourselves. Pinkwater's dogs have taught him, among other things, that having the capacity to be both silly and dignified enriches a life.I ended up reading this book one chapter at a time before bedtime, and each night I'd go to sleep with a smile.If you loves dogs, you'll enjoy this book -- which also makes a great gift for the dog-lovers in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"America to know the rest of the world.","review":"This book describes facts and events that are not easy to find in the press.

Well in my brief reading she deeply offended me with two GREAT historical innacuracies that would throw into doubt anything else she wrote in the book.1. She claimed that Canada entered the war against Japan AFTER pearl harbour was bombed!! this is blatantly false and perpetuates the idea among americans that they led us into war.2. She claims that canada has decided to disarm its nuclear arsenal, when in fact canada has NEVER had a nuclear arsenal!!I was so shocked at these blatant mistruths that i almost tore the book up on the spot!!BOYCOTT this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea in theory. Simplistic jabber in practice.","review":"One important thing that Americans -- or anyone else -- should know about the rest of the world it that the world and its problems are complex.Unfortunately, the author misses this point. She seems instead to think that in order to \\"fix\\" Americans' understanding of the world, she must spread her own dogmatic oversimplifications; and that's exactly what the book does.The book reads like a giddy 15-year-old's diary, and at the same time like a propaganda pamphlet.Though Rossi's handling (and understanding?) of complex topics is clumsy and shallow, she seems certain that every American should share her narrow opinions.For those looking to be told what to think, this book might work. For those looking for facts and nuances about the complex world, I'm afraid you will have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"What every American should know","review":"I waited too long to order it.

Yes there are many references but the references are slanted to the left also. Don't buy this book if you want fact finding from all perspectives."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad but def. left of center","review":"I actually own this book and for some reason never thought about it being biased until I delved into topics I know more about than she does apparently. I could go into detail about it but won't bother.She tends state her opinions as fact and it is obvious that she takes a \\"blame America first\\" attitude; almost as if she is taking the standpoint of somebody who lives in Europe who wants to placate her European friends by showing she is subtly embarrassed to be American.The world is much more complex than she would have you believe, and she is by no means a well read diplomat. I mean c'mon she encourages people to read the BBC. I will credit her with her endorsement of the Economist though, I believe that is a very fair and balanced magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh!","review":"Sit down, kick back, and get plastered while you read this book.Obviously the author did when she wrote it!So full of holes, contradictions, and glaring fairy tales that it makes \\"Peter Pan\\" look like a history channel documentary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy correct version!!!","review":"Be aware that there are (probably) 2 versions available: One with 6 tracks and the other with 12.

This is a very well-written, pedagogical book that goes through many aspects of the soliton theory and experiment that are not covered in other books. There is a good balance between qualitativeand mathematical analysis in the book, as well as between the theory and experiment. To facilitate understanding of the material, the authors provide readers with many illustrative examples. The reader will find one of the most extensive list of bibliography at the end of each chapter. The index is complete and useful. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the soliton theory and its applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Action Game for the Western scene","review":"The game was a lot of fun to play, but can be beat in about 4 to 6 hours of play.

There are very, very few games out there that are worth $50.00 to me. I've learned to rent before I buy to save the heartache.I expected greatness from Rockstar of course and I got \\"pretty goodness\\" from Red Dead. It's fun and once you learn the controls it's challenging enough without being too hard. I was hoping it would be a little more non-linear like the GTA games. Not quite that good I'm afraid. I've yet to find a game that stacks up to Vice City on all levels. VC simply is the best - so far.Once you play a level there's no need to go back to it. It's not gonna be any different. But again, that's not to say it wasn't fun! It IS fun. Just not worth $50.00 to me. I like the vibe. I'd buy it when it hits the used market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Dead Revolver","review":"Great game that is so much fun and is so addicting. The multiplayer action is so good I love this game.\`"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a peice of garbage","review":"I am in general very proud of what the boys at Rockstar have accomplished in there carear. The prestigious GTA and Max Payne series are no doubt the greatest in there genre. I have found that Red Dead Revolver falls far from the mark. This is just not an impressive game at all. The graphics are chopy, gameplay is repetative, and the characters are shallow and almost just a formality. The only highnote is that the multiplayer mode is a lot of fun but to truly experience a range of levels, characters, or weapondry with your friends, you need to play the monotoneous main story. In the end, it is just not worth it. If you are looking for a good Rockstar game, I advise Bully, or GTA. If you want a good western game, buy Gun. It is a lot deeper and cleaner. If you just want a fun game, I highly recomend Destroy All Humans 1 or 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Video Game Art","review":"No other game looks or plays like this; The missions and locations are varied and colorful; The villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials; And, as usual, Rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating; Lots of unlockables offer high replay. This is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system, period. I still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru. The story is straightforward and engaging; Lots of really interesting concepts(machinegun in the coffin, crazy midgets, that whole 'dead-eye' thing...)and it controls very well. Another great game from an outstanding company. Hopefully a sequel is in the works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for multiplayer","review":"While I enjoyed playing RDR in one-player mode (but like everyone else said, the levels are short and uninvolved), I found multi-player mode to be exceptional. As far as I'm concerned, beating the game in single-player is just a means to getting more \\"showdown\\" characters and levels.I loved the levels, the number of \\"power-ups\\" and guns, and the variety of characters; it made this as fun a party game as Goldeneye or Super Smash Bros."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tougher than nails","review":"I love challenging games, that's what makes them fun for me. But this game is too challenging to be fun. I normally spend way to much time playing anyway but I'm ready to return the game and play something else.

I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are really patient and use to using the analog sticks for movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected","review":"Graphics: the environments are done well,However the animation and character models could have been alot better.Audio: the only thing in the game that is remotely competetive. AI: very rough , with far too many characters running into walls, it does make them easier to kill. Story:The script is hillarious, but the acting almost made me wet myself.I really wanted to like this game as i was a big fan of \\"outlaw\\".I have heard a western RPG is coming out based on \\"the good the bad and the ugly\\" I hope it's better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game lacks story","review":"I rented this game and what a waste it was. I dont even want to finish playing the game and I have the game for 4 more days. This game lacks a real story and it doesnt really hook you into playing the game... It just gets more boring.

Having owned several reporters and always being pleased we were disappointed when a set of batteries corroded a unit. We bought a replacement package and were shocked that the effective range could no longer work where we had the original system set up. This was approx 300' and now they cannot reach 100'!!! We bought an additional sensor and it to cannot achieve over 100'. The sensors have been downgraded somehow as I've set it up to work with either the old or new base station and the range stinks with either. I understand that advertised ranges are a pipe dream (1200' for this unit) but there is no reason a replacement unit should be of inferior quality to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reporter Wireless Alert System","review":"We have these sensors mounted on at the entrance of our driveway, on our shed, and at the back of our property. This is such a great, inexpensive way to secure your home, and be alerted when someone is on your property.

We live in a salt water environment, which is tough on electrical systems, but the Chamberlain has held up well and the battery life is incredible. We have the usual problem with small animals and bushes in a strong wind, but overall a good system. I especially like the one-hour \\"time-out\\" feature, where the receiver stops buzzing for one hour, but then comes back online automatically. I use this when a pesky cat decides to play in the driveway or a windstorm keeps the bushes moving. The alert system we had before this one did not have that feature and I kept forgetting to turn it back on after a big storm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive, ineffective, easy to throw in garbage","review":"I bought this product plus two wireless sensors about a month ago.

Obviously, this person missed the intent of the book, most likely because s/he does not have MS. Williams's time spent in the military is not what prompted him to write the book; therefore, it is not the main point he is trying to make. Perhaps since the person who wrote this review does not actually have the disease, s/he could not focus on the main issue - dealing with MS. Speaking from personal experience as one who does have MS, I can promise you that just knowing someone who has it, even if that person is your own child, is not knowledge enough to say you truly understand what living with it is like. Additionally, her/his daughter might be taken aback by the implication that she \\"overcame\\" MS; sadly, until there is a cure, the disease will never be overcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"This book is absolutely life changing, even if you don't particularly like Montel.

University studies back it up.

The theme of a regional Greek cookbook is well taken. However, the utterly useless index renders the book little more than a coffee table book - without photos. And it's a shame, as the recipes themselves are quiet good, but trying to find a recipe is virtually impossible. Or, even worse - trying to find a recipe a second time - was it in the Thessaly chapter? No, no - it must have been the Cyclades chapter. No - perhaps, Epirus. The Complete Book of Greek Cooking by St. Paul's Greek Orthodox Church is still the gold standard for a useful Greek cookbook filled with wonderful recipes. Except those who simply enjoy reading cookbooks cover to cover, this is not the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXPENSIVE !","review":"I am a fan of the writer and i believe i have all her books. I really enjoy the way she writes and her recipes even most of them are difficult to accomplish and to transform them to a tasty plate. I was expecting in this book to find more simple Greek recipes.To me this is not a normal cookbook but a way to travel around Greece via a cookbook.If this is what you are looking for then this is it!Details about distinctiveness in food of each one of the Greek islands i think they are boring even for a Greek reader like me! Books about Greece with nice pictures and details exist too many and much better than this one who supposed to be a cookbook.And not only this but you can check yourself its price"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"As a collector of cookbooks,and a fanatic when it comes to cooking I was very disappointed in the layout of the book.

This one was passed along from a friend and I was quite disappointed. I have traveled to Greece twice in the past year, and none of my favorite (traditional) recipes were depicted as I would have imagined from the title of this book. To be honest, I found it to be poorly researched and rather dull. Greece is famous for its world renowned recipes and I believe that they were not properly illustrated in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Book, But With Faults","review":"The \\"Glorious Foods of Greece ....\\" is an excellent introduction to the superb cuisine of that ancient land, and, as the title suggests, the subject is treated with all the gusto and enthusiasm that it deserves. However, as is often the case with those affected by an extreme enthusiasm for a particular subject, the author may be tending toward too narrow and rigid concept of what constitutes authentic Greek cooking. Greek cooking not only varies from region to region, but even the same dish may recieve a different treatment dependent on family tradition. Keeping that in mind, it's best to just enjoy that which is set before us for its'own worth without so much forced reference to supposed standards of authenticity."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best Greek cookbook ever!","review":"I think this is a great book. It opened the door to a whole new world of really healthy, really easy, really unusual, and really good food. It's also beautifully written.

I wanted to read it because it was supposed to be about Catherine Cookson and Trotter was tooted as the \\"new\\" Cookson. I strongly suspect if Ms Cookson read Trotter's book all she would recognize is her name, the location, and perhaps the poverty. The plot is weak and I hate John McMullen with a passion.

As you read the account of what Kate had to endure, you experience the pain and suffering right along with her. You even understand her plunge into alcoholism to cope with the ridicule she faces from an unforgiving mother and step-father. When you finish reading this book, you will be thinking of Kate and her circumstances as if she is a dear friend whom you'd like to help. You will quickly want to read the last book of the trilogy to see how she and her daughter, Catherine, manage to survive the prejudices they suffer throughout their lives.

The first 20 minutes are spent on the same kind of stretching and warm-ups you did in gym class or can read about for free anywhere. He then does 10 minutes of chigung warms ups, which are simply more slow stretching (and better presented in any book). Next theres a 10 minute demonstration moves from the short form, all seen from the front and not structured for the beginner. When he finally gets around to the form there's one runthru (front only, no replay) of about 6 minutes, and that it - 40 minutes of warmup for one demo. The production values are crummy, looks like the whole thing was shot on a home camcorder with poor focus. Having taught martial arts for years I can tell you that few beginners will get the moves from presentations like this. As a learning video for people of any age this video is poor, but putting \\"for seniors\\" in the title to hook novices or their caregivers is cheating.

A fourteen movement form is shown, using the movements previously used as exercises. The form is shown from the front and again from the rear. This is a good introduction to Tai-chi and provides a well rounded exercise program. The DVD is manufactured by the \\"burned\\" system which 95% of DVD players play. Some of the players manufactured several years ago, which only play movie type DVD's, have trouble with the burned variety.

I usually cringe when I watch yoga or other tai chi videos because I know my knees, back, neck, hands, wrists, etc. can't handle it. This one, however, seems to hit the right notes for a beginner. While I hope to progress to something more rigorous, this video is something I can do NOW. The initial stretches/exercises are easy to follow and do. The final exercises are more complicated and are harder for a klutz like me to nail down, but they can still be modified to the condition of my body. From a production prospective, it looks like it was filmed in the late 70's in someone's finished basement, but glitz isn't something I need.

These battles took places during the American civil war, World War II and Vietnam war.- The over-doing of the conversation makes me wonder how accurate this document is compared to history books. For example, the back cover of this DVD reads \\"Sun Tzu was the Nostradamus of warfare...\\" In the film, the narrator says \\"Sun Tzu predicted the outcome of the Vietnam War and the Allies' landing in Normandy...\\" No, Sun Tzu could not do that. He died thousand of years before these historical events.- In short, the DVD is informative and entertaining. It's the only one of this kind. I own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Prison of Memory\\"","review":"\\"The Prison of Memory\\" by Peter Rodgers is a tautly-written first novel that engages at two levels. At the first it is a political \\"who done it\\" which draws us in but leaves us unsure of the outcome. At the second level it paints a very realistic picture of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict,hi-lighting the differences between liberal and conservative elements within each community. Rodgers shows the importance of the attachment to land in this conflict and how Israelis and Palestinians are both held hostage by their memories of past wrongs. The novel underlines the uncomfortable truth that whatever formal agreements exist it will be many generations before the two peoples sharing this troubled land are \\"at peace\\". This is an engaging and rewarding novel for anyone interested in the Middle East."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Fodor's Martha's Vineyard","review":"As a regular traveller, I was most disappointed with the latest edition of Fodor's 2000: Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket. It was very concise in its information about the area, but as one who arranges travel, shopping, and accommodation over the internet, I was amazed that in the Year 2000 edition, it completely lacked any web sites/addresses. For instance, Martha's Vinyard Chamber of Commerce has the most informative web site for local travel, accommodation, weather, etc., but Fodor's has not listed it, just the 1-800 phone number...coming from London, England, this is of little help. Unfortunately, this was the case throughout the whole book.

Prior to purchasing and listening to it, I could never understand why the 7th is said to be one of Bruckner's better (and more popular) symphonies.

It dosn't show much blood at all when you kill someone only on bosses usually(its ok for little kids my little sister even thinks it's cool).

It was just eh. I would have given it 3 stars. After playing the arcade version, I thought different of it. The arcade game was perfect. Probably because I had quarters at stake though. It also had FMVs and the graphics looked a heck of a lot better. I understand the N64 can't support FMVs, but that's not that important. The graphics are just okay in the N64 version.

Over all, it is just an awesome game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gauntlet legends review","review":"This game is awesome. The controls are pretty easy to learn and the game play is slow enough to let you focus but its fast enough to keep you concentrated. Also the enemies and power-ups are really cool. The bosses are neat too all having their own special attacks. You can find certain items in the levels that will help you beat the bosses a lot more quickly. Believe me I tried to beat the bosses without certain things you pick up in the levels in nooks and crannies(example:the ice ax of Untar)and it was alot harder! I would have had to be at least at level 30 to just be able to contend with the first boss. The level growing also makes it fun. Finding the powerups and using them is cool too. Good luck!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than Playstation, and that is saying something!","review":"First, to start out, this Game is possibly the most addicting, fun, and best games to ever be made by Midway, for N64. The graphics are fenominable!!! I couldn't believe how addicting it was. I was on that game for 4 hours, before I finally switched of the game and did something else. It is a very long game, but it is worth the time and effort. Unlike most games you are cooperating with up to 3 other people on the SAME screen. No stupid split screens. You work together and share items, gold, food, (for health), and other things. An absolute blast for parties! NO, I repeat, No adventure game collection is complete without this game.

I have been unable to establish the proper angle, force, or twist to remove the strainer the next morning after a single use, never mind the same day. It is as if this was designed to be used with warm liquids; since once I have put on the strainer top for more than 5 seconds with an ice and cocktail mixture, the strainer top will not yield its grip and cannot be reused. Applying hot water does nothing. I have been tempted to try vise-grips but that would damage it. Even the few times I have managed to remove the top for proper cleaning, the same method does not work the next time. Don't bother, spend more money and get one that works. On the good side, with melted water left in it for hours or days it hasn't rusted and it definitely does not leak.

Bome sculpts very attractive figures. I like the Dead or Alive video game series as well so I knew I would love this. She is very well made and the paint is perfection. As said before the packaging is one of the things I love the most about Bome's figures (my favorite being Yamamoto Isoroku's) and because of this you can leave them packaged and still admire them and preserve their value. This particular figure was priced very well and I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend you do the same if you are a fan of Bome's, of sexy anime style figures or of Dead or Alive.

This isn't a problem for us since I am mostly concerned with people coming in off the road, just wanted to note it. This could also be due to the distance it is mounted from the driveway (20'+). So far we have had no \\"false\\" alarms due to animals or whatever. The little buzzer sound the unit made was faily quiet. Wish it had an adjustment for loudness as well as length of time it buzzes.

Transmission to the receiver from the sensor could not be established if the receiver was in the house, where, of course, you would want it to be. I followed all directions, I already thououghly understand how PIR sensors work and how to optimize them, batteries were new etc. This is all too similar to the Chamberlain long range garage door opener I once bought which only worked if I transmitted from inside the garage.

So if a 50ft range works for you then have at it. But the box and the instructions still state a 900ft range which is absolutely false according to Chamberlain. They claim that there should be a disclaimer in the box, but there was none in my box.

The Reporter is an inexpensive enhancement that provides an addition level of protection to my internal, professionally installed, security alarm system.Update: The receiver unit for this system failed after only several weeks of use.

It is so unreliable that we do not pay attention to it. I am going to go back to the magnetic field type drive way alerting systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertised","review":"I bought this system because it was advertised as getting approximately 600 yards. On open ground I was lucky to get 100 yards giving me less distance than I was getting on a wireless camera. Reading some of the other reviews that were getting good range I decided to open it up and see if something was broken. I was right, sort of. The original design had a transistor as an RF amplifier. On my unit a zero ohm resistor was bypassing the amplifier circuit and the antenna was only being fed by the output of the IC. Given the way this one was built I doubt that anyone is getting 600 yards on new units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to Find One that Works","review":"While I highly compliment Chamberlain's Customer Service Department for working with me, the product has MUCH to be desired.

I spent a week trying to make them work, and exchanged them twice, thinking I may have had a bad unit. I could never get more than 100' feet of distance, making the units useless for our purpose. I returned them the final time, and bought a sub $20 unit (similar to the Driveway Patrol unit), and got almost 400' of distance down the driveway, which is enough unit I can find enough positive reviews for some more expensive models.Sadly, these recent units made by Chamberlain are not worth the money spent, and they will not achieve the range advertised, even in perfect line-of-sight conditions, at least for the three sets I tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driveway Alarm","review":"This alarm would not work at our house.

I removed the sensor and walked toward the house stopping every few feet and setting off the sensor with my hand while my wife listened for the alarm. I know the sensor went off because the green light on the sensor flashed. I had to get within 30 feet of the window where the base station was before the alarm would go off. This was with brand new batteries in the remote unit. My house has wooden studs and wooden window frames so it wasn't metal blocking the signal. I'm sorry but it just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at represented","review":"I am very upset that the reporter is not as represented.

After much trial and error I have come to the conclusion that this particular unit is \\"JUNK\\". I have since moved the sending unit to the edge of the garage door where I am about 32' from the base station. After two days of frustration I think I will be sending this unit back!!!

The book is an affirmation of a philosophy that I have been approaching from several angles: Don't sweat the small stuff, Less is more, Buddhism and so on. Our society is insanely trying to out-achieve itself in an upward spiral that has caused many a crash. The book helps me to understand the art of a deep-thinking, meditative life, keeping me from sharing that fate.Experimenting with the concepts in the book led to immediate insight, and a peace of mind that enabled me to carefully, calmly, study a problem. Due to the deep thought I used to analyze the problem I came to a fix that kept the project from failing!

The author does not preach, he just takes you on an invesitagation round the world where there can only be one conclusion: that slowing things down a little would be good for all of us.

But, college music theory is normally a two year course, and the book is written that way and is very thorough.This book, is marketed as \\"A Comprehensive Outline in Easy-To-Use Narrative Format\\" and \\"Supplements Major Textbooks\\". Nothing could be further from the truth!Yes, it is an easy read, but you go through half the book before even reaching a starting point for college theory. The content doesn't cover more than a third of the material covered in a college music theory text, so a comprehensive outline it is not. I also found glaring differences in termonology.If you are looking to LEARN music thoery, then stick with the original Piston. If you are looking to review, I highly recommend \\"Graduate Review of Tonal Theory\\" by Steven Laitz and Christopher Bartlette.As for THIS book, at least for theory, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"On the surface this book might seem like a bargain. It covers a lot of topics, it has a lot of pages, and costs very little, relative to other music textbooks.But then when you try to actually learn from it, you quickly see why it is so cheap. It is nearly useless imho. It \\"covers\\" topic after topic, \\"machine gun\\" style, announcing what it is trying to teach, includes a few very brief paragraphs describing it, a few bars of music, then moves on. Owch. Compare that with other texts that devote a lot more discussion, examples, exercises, and most also include some music that you can listen to, to more fully describe the concept. And also the pages are small, the font is small, and the diagrams are small and often so scrunched that they are difficult to read. Then you start to understand why they are practically giving this book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Very badly done. The author uses technical terms many pages before explaining what they mean. He includes numerous examples, but often does not explain the examples adequately. He blows past complex concepts with scant regard for the confused reader. The explanation of figured bass is completely incomprehensible. Some of these problems can be explained by the brevity of the outline format, but for others there is no explanation other that the author's cluelessness on how to teach."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it purports to be...","review":"There are many complaints below concerning this book's rapid introduction of more complex topics. If the book in question were intended to teach theory from the very beginning, this might be a valid denouncement; but, frankly, such was not the intent. It is a \\"college outline,\\" and, in fulfilling the expectations for book in such a series, it does a relatively good job. It is true that some of the examples could be more thoroughly explained (and a small handful are even mislabled), but if you are already generally familiar with the material, this book serves excellently as a source from which to review. If you are looking to refresh you memory quickly after a breach in study, I cannot think of a better choice.

Throughout his work, Markson runs through details about how famous literary figures have died, what philosophers believed and what artists said. There are no characters except, perhaps, for the elusive \\"Writer\\". There is no plot. Nothing thrilling happens. And yet its amazing to me how drawn in to the book I was.Bottom line: I don't know what it was but I'm glad I read it. Experimental fiction can either be disastrous (see The Castle of Crossed Destinies by Italo Calvino) or monumentally successful (see 253: The Print Remix by Geoff Ryman) - there's usually no middle ground. This Is Not A Novel definitely fits into the latter category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Title","review":"This is not a novel? Damn straight it isn't. I'm usually the first person to applaud experimental fiction, but Markson's book reads like the literary journal of a manic depressive. Not exactly groundbreaking, just pretentious. For those of you not already aware, the book is simply a collection of seemingly disordered facts about famous writers, historians, and philosophers. It turns out that the sentences are not completely disordered, because they tend to follow a very subtle arc that echoes the pattern of life. However, aside from offering the occasional interesting fact, this book has no appeal. It is the first book I couldn't finish in six years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half facinating literary facts; half phony self-inflation","review":"This is a maddening book. Roughly half consists of facts (I assume - no citations) concerning writers and other creative artists, some of them wonderful.

And the final quarter consists of spare comments (often just a sentence fragment)on themes of life and death, meant to invoke pity and awe but instead remindful of \\"Deep Thoughts\\" written somewhat in the manner of the Cantos, phony and inflated.

I can't conceive of a lazier way to manufacture a book than Markson has come up with here. The impression is of a tired old scribbler (the author has been collecting Social Security for a while now) who still needs to think of himself as an artist, even though what little of the Divine Flame he once tended (his major effort was a pretentious melange of recycled Malcolm Lowry called \\"Going Down\\") sputtered out decades ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dessert cookbooks I've seen","review":"I have both Jacques Torres books and they truly are fantastic.

I replaced that drive, at which point it said it would take 173000 minutes (that's 120 days!) to re-establish the array, hung, and has never let me access any of the data on the surviving drive since, even after removing the new drive.

Nice job D-Link!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap NAS, works well","review":"Physically, the box is nice and small and is a perfect stand for my cable modem.Installation was painlessly easy. Just inserted a 750gb drive and off it went.You definitely want to upload the latest firmware from DLink to get the most functionality.The only other thing I'd recommend would be to get a gigabit router. Copying big files over 100baseT is awfully slow, compared to what the box can do at 1kBaseT. If you think the transfer is slow compared to your other external harddrives, upgrade to gigabit.As for functionality, it's awesome. We now keep our digital pictures there, so that anyone can upload new digital photos from their cameras from their own computer. I no longer need to keep my main PC on to serve that purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note all the 1-star reviews - Don't waste your money/time","review":"Great idea - poor product.

When you configure the Ethernet interface at 100/full, you can get 80mpbs.The security design is not good:1. Only allow 8 characters passwords and special characters are not allowed.2. Each time you add a user or group to a share, it creates a new share instead of adding to the share3.

Item did not work right out of the box!!!!!!!!","review":"I opened the box. Followed the instructions perfectly. Not drives. Plugged in power cord and network connection, and powered it on. Should take, according to the instructions, 50 seconds or less to boot up. The light on the front should turn solid when it is ready. It blinked for 1min, 2min, and is still blinking. I was told by tech support from D-link that is should turn solid when ready. The item is evidently defective or something.

It is noisy and i find on the forums that people have had problems with it wiping drives. The problem i have is that the power button does not power off the unit and the Fan keeps running even when it sleeps. ( I set it to automatic power off mode ) It ran all night, so its not that it had to cool off the drive.How do you NOT get this right?You push the power button when the drive is asleep and it spins up the drives before turning the whole thing off.You have to keep pressing the button several times to get it to turn off. holding the button down does not help either.When I shut it down via the web interface it turns off without issue, but that is a hassle. The only reason I want to shut it off is because the fan does n't stop, contrary to the advertising!!!!BTW, i upgraded the Firmware to latest 1.09 Version.

The edges were cut at terrible angles. I had to re-trim the edges to try and get them pretty straight! The dragon adornments were tacked on with little nails, right smack in the middle of the plaque, and not even at all. In fact they were quite crooked! They are made out of thin tin, and I had to bend them up slightly with the edge of a sharp knife so that I could tuck the edges of the crooked flags behind. They only included enough small black rubber bands for five belts. (I only used two per belt, to hold each side). They did include plenty of semi-clear strips of adhesive type tape to secure the rest of the belts on the slats. All in all, this product cost me about thirty dollars with the shipping. Probably worth about five bucks! The box says \\"Made in China\\", and I hate to sound stereotypical, but,.........FIGURES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The item came with no instructions and part of the assembly was stickers that we're cut in half.

However, we bought it for overnight use and either it churns out copious amounts of steam and runs out within 3-4 hours, rendering it useless for an 8-hour overnight stretch, or it just sort of puffs pathetically, releasing tiny amount of steam throughout the night to where you don't even feel its effects. I've tried different additives (salt, baking soda) to figure out if it's a hard water/pH issue or whatever, and I can't figure it out. It's completely inconsistent, so we don't use it all that much. If I could go back I'd skip this one and get a 2-gallon humidifier instead in the hopes that it would at least get through the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after three days. Do not recommend.","review":"Purchased the product and followed all directions, including mixing small amount of salt in water. After two days, little black plastic pieces began to fall apart from the humidifying mechanism into the basin. By the third day, the unit stopped working altogether.Unfortunately, I had thrown out the box by then so the unit found a new home in the rubbish.Flimsy, poorly constructed, not dependable. Would not recommend purchasing -price seems low but is high relative to the fact that it eventually became just a plastic bowl with a night-light. Pay more for a unit that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT","review":"Awful. I bought this to go in my son's room as it is seperated from the main house. I plugged it in, and when I went back to make sure it was working properly it burnt my hand. I later went back to check on it, and burnt my hand again. Needless to say, this was a waste of my time and money, and will NOT be in my son's room. About a half hour out of the box, and it found it's way to the trash barrell. Very disappointing and would never recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, but delicate.","review":"These are great. I'd always wanted air twist stems similar to those I'd found on historic archeological sites dating to the 18th century.

With more awareness and care, the others are fine.I'd buy more, but have not found them available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Product","review":"I planned my kitchen upgrade with care. I needed to replace some items to add value, quality and beauty to my home. I shopped at local high end kitchen shops to educate myself. To save money I decided to shop online. This Danze faucet sold at a Portland retailer for about $400. I got it for much less without sacrificing quality. It is made entirely of metal..no plastic and is very heavy. It also has ceramic cartridges which is important with the hard water in my area. My plumber was impressed with how easy it was to install and felt like I had made a great purchase. It is a beautiful addition and works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work book","review":"I am using this workbook for a 6 year old and a 5 year old. Both love it and ask to do the work. What I enjoy about the workbook is that it comes with a variety of levels of work and most of the work is fun and does not make you think your sitting down to do 'homework'. Having solutions at the end of the book helps too. All in all, a great book, I would love to buy the net level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring.. Better books out there.","review":"My son loves logic games and was practicing for the gifted program. I purchased this book along with a few others from amazon. The cover looks nice and after reading about it I thought it would be engaging and a fun book we could do together. The book's inside is black and white and very boring with long instructions. It can't keep my 4 year old (or myself) interested for long at all. There are many many many other books on amazon that have the same quality but are presented in a much better way suitable for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Review/Practice/Assessment","review":"I bought this for my daughter mostly to see how she did with it. She was 4 (couple months shy of 5), and it was mostly easy for her, until the very end when there were a couple I had to talk her through a little. I agree with other reviewers that it is preschool-level. She really enjoyed it - although she is admittedly pretty easy to please as far as activities. :) I would buy it again because it served my purpose of assessing her ability, and logic ability isn't something I feel I can easily evaluate on my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"was not what i saw on the net to buy","review":"the clamp that they showed was not the one that i resived,and the is very bad for buiness.i bought the clamps based on the photo that i saw ,and that is the clamp that i wanted. not this set of junk that they sent me,I AM VERY DISPLEASED,WITH THE CLAMPS.WILL NOT BE BUYING THEIR PRODUCTS ,BEFORE I FINE OUT WHAT I AM TRUELY GETTING FOR MY MONEY.."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"I ordered this frog, for my 6 mo. old son, and niece.

There is just no point in buying a manual which you already have. I strongly recommend Truespace 2 Bible - which is also for 'dummies' but explores many of the tools with EXAMPLES and ILLUSTRATIONS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book completely overlooks some of the most exciting new features of TS3, such as VRML, object physics such as wind, gravity, and density, as well as object collision.

For those who pirated the program, it's a manual, for anyone else, it's a paperweight. Our only hope is that Peter Plantec, Frank Rivera, or someone with a great skill of writing AND Truespace3 will write a Truespace3 Bible, so that this book will be forgotten.

A masterful visual artist himself, Clayton knows how to put pictures in words as well, and along with treating the reader to a moving canvas that encompasses the South of the depression and the sixties, shows us the hardass, cutthroat, coke-snorting art world of New York City in the 1980s. One example will show how good this book is as the reader sees Clayton's sexually-confused artist hero attempting \\"to find an abstract form that spoke of the faded, Army green aura of alcoholics sleeping on the sidewalks, ashen faces and dull, boozy-pink rims around whitened eyes.\\" This is the real thing.

This was not a workout at all!!! Her voice is so irritating and she NEVER stops talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for beginners...","review":"This is a good, basic workout for beginners, and for those of us who prefer simple, straightforward workouts without complex choreography. If you're a more advanced stepper, you may be bored to tears with this one! But for those of us starting out, or who haven't worked out in quite some time, this fits the bill.My only complaint (hence 4 out of 5 stars) is the low quality of the VHS and sound. The music sometimes is too loud, and you can't hear Denise. And Denise really needs a microphone! She should create a DVD version with better sound quality.Otherwise, once you do this a couple times the sound quality won't be an issue. It's a 25 minute aerobic workout, followed by some toning. All in all, a good purchase.I actually like Denise's personality - perky just suits her ^^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary Magic--total bore or book written for adults?","review":"In this book, Ganesh is the main character, and he goes through a lot in India and America alike. I think that the author wrote this book to be for adults, but when it wasn't long enough, he simplified it and made it a child's book. If this book had been originally written for a child, then it would have had a more \\"believable ending\\", and not have this short process.

The format of the book is a challenge, no doubt. It doesn't have a linear structure, it goes on tangents and jumps around in no logical order (well, except for alphabetical). At first this was annoying to me, but as I read on the beauty of the approach became clearer .. by taking chronology out of the narrative, we see Armed Forces in its totality, and the focus is on the end result of the process of making the album rather than focusing on the process itself. If you're an EC fan, I recommend this, but be prepared for an unconventional read that takes some getting used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"This is a great recourse for daily devotion and reflection on spiritual growth.

I thought I'd give the book a try as my wife and I visited Beijing in 1996 and I figured the travel experience would make the book that much more interesting. Swing and a miss. I made it through the first 100 pages, then gave up. I found the writing sophomoric and the editing poorly done. The characters were shallow and the story line was slow to develop.

A small town is plagued by what appears to be aliens inhabiting human bodies, but the script is plagued with an unfocused narrative and confusing red herrings. Alison Eastwood gamely plays an alien hunter, but we're never really sure where she's coming from or how she came to know about the aliens. A seemingly perfect family of father, mother and son are at the heart of the upcoming \\"event\\" which seems to be taking place on the son's 18th birthday.

So I went out and bought this. I wish I had a RAM pack because the graphics are weak sometimes. The lack of ammo and health herbs makes it challenging. But each character has to essentially solve the same puzzles, fight the same bad guys. The police station is too long and Leon's ending is a let down. With a reputation like RE has I was expecting a more replayable game. But its challenging and its rare that a games scared me enough to make jump out of my seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best version of Resident Evil 2!!!","review":"This version of Resident Evil 2 is by far the best one of all. Others might not think so, but who cares? First off, the graphics are much more detailed and really stand out. But, that's only if you have the expansion pack. Without it, they are pixelated and choppy. The FMV clips are like watching a bootleg movie, but still descent anyway. Also, this version has great extras like Blood Color change, Violence Control, EX Files, Randomizer, and added zombies not in the Playstation or PC versions (You see them close to the end, and they're really creepy.) I was totally blown away by this port. It definately is a must have. If you never played this game before, I suggest this one. Especially with all the added stuff. Have Fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done by Capcom","review":"Capcom did a great job bringing this game to the Nintendo 64. Graphics and gameplay are nearly identical to Sony, if not better on Nintendo. FMV suffers though, due to the lack of space on the cartridge, but still looks great considering how it is done. I'd recommend anyone who doesn't have a Playstation to buy this game. It's a lot of fun and some of the extra options give it great replay value."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST FREAKIN' GAME EVER!","review":"Hey! I just wanted to say that this Video Game series is the best series EVER! Resident Evil 2 is probably the best game of the series.

Moving around is like moving in quicksand, you are constantly being attacked from all directions. If it was in a first- person setup, it might make for a challenging& fun game. Instead you get a overhead view& constantly you are attacked from the rear& loose much health while slowy turing around.I have been playing games since PONG & played 2600 games untill I flipped the score counters several times.Resident Evil is a tedious game."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARGH ! Why did they have to put THIS on the N64 ?!!!!","review":"Okay, first off, I'd like to say that R.E. is one of the best puzzle/shoot-em'-up games I have ever seen ! However,re-releasing this for the N64-console was a BAAAAAD idea . The controls are poor(and hard to get used to) the sound is sometimes crackly, and the gameplay is harder than the PSX version . Want something better ? Get the R.E.2 on the PSX ."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABOUT TURN","review":"Change of heart for n64? Nope the machine start with no gore games.

After having played it I was happy to see that they had the FMVs more or less, but the game just didn't feel right with the 64 controller, and the idea of changing the colour of the blood is all fine and dandy for Turok but it has no place in Resident Evil. Also Nintendo has seen it fit to make this game less dark and dreary than the Playstation version which I think was a poor choice. If you only own a N64 and want to play a survival horror game rent it, if you don't care about survival horror much or own a Playstation or Dreamcast don't even bother looking at this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Scariest Games I've Played","review":"This is definitely a good horrific game that can scare even older gamers. It kind of plays like the third-person Duke Nukem games. The violence of this game is higher than most and sometimes just downright nasty. The graphics are very well done. The music is very eerie and will keep you tense for the whole game. The challenge of this game could be a little different because you spend most of the game solving puzzles and little time killing zombies and monsters. Unfortunately, the play control needs a lot of work because it takes time to get used to. I suggest playing with the first-person control option (it's a lot easier). This game might have been better as a first-person shooter (like Doom). You'll want to play it to the end because this is one of those games where you'll want to see what happens next. And sometimes what happens next can scare the daylights out of you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE RESIDENT EVIL SERIES","review":"Im one of the biggest fans of the entire resident evil series:*RESIDENT EVIL*RESIDENT EVIL 2*RESIDENT EVIL 3: NEMESIS*RESIDENT EVIL: SURVIVOR*RESIDENT EVIL: CODE VERONICAI love all of these games and to tell you the truth Resident Evil 2 was my favorite it had the most intresting characters (Claire Redfield & Leon Kennedy) i think and story line was awesome and even better the graphics on the N64!!! so i recommend this game 2 anyone who isnt afraid of bloodshed (ALOT)"},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome, cool, and great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think Resident Evil 2 was a pretty cool game for the N64. The graphics were awsome. Espesially for the n64. That was only because it was a short game though. The story line is really cool. I like the part in the beginning (on Leon's file) where clair is running out of the diner and there is a zombie behind her and she dosen't know it. Then she sees Leon and says \\"Dont shoot!\\" and then Leon yells \\"get down!\\" and she drops onto the ground and Leon caps that zombie right in the middle of the forehead. there is Really good graphics when Leon's jeep drives into town. the only bad part was that it was too long. I would buy this game if it weren't for the fact that I like to rent the games for the 64 and not buy them. I am such a Resident Evil fan that I can name off all of the RE books and I haven't even read them, any of them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"a difficult fit","review":"For some reason, in reading this, I had difficulty fitting myself into the story. The locale almost seemed desgned to be a bubble isolated from the rest of the world. I would have to agree also with another reviewer the sense of disjointment. There were a number of places in the book where the author seems to abruptly slip between thoughts and never clue the reader in. Characterization seems poor, or I at least had difficulty identifying with any. I had another difficulty and that was the much too quick acceptance of the phenomenon of time travel by other characters throughout the story, and the poorly researched character of 1908. The author has a nice time travel concept but does little with it that is enjoyable for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, not GREAT","review":"This time-travel story did not grab me the way TIME AND AGAIN (Jack Finney) did. There are several intersecting plot lines centering around the main character, Josh Winkler, and some of them seem rather contrived. The method of getting to the past, by walking quickly along certain \\"paths\\" in the town, seems capricious and awkward. At least in Finney's world there is a reasonable technique (a kind of self-hypnosis coupled with deep study about the desired time period) that allows the subject to slip the bonds of current time.The fact that marital relations are lost as a result of the time travel in this novel really bothered me; it seemed to be a perversion of what was happening with the other plotlines, in which problems were solved, not created. Or perhaps my reaction just reflects how I would feel if I were to \\"lose\\" my wife in this manner.In any case, this is not a novel that I will reread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I thought the characters were well developed. I certainly did not guess the end to this book.Athough, I might have liked more details describing how the Main character's life changed I enjoyed this Hitchock like ending.I would recommennd this book. I have read many time travel stories and this was a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discover this writer.","review":"Charles Dickinson is a wonderful writer who should have a much larger readership than he seems to. He employs his clear and winning prose to describe the lives of ordinary people living their daily lives, but there's always an interesting little kink in those lives. In \\"The Widows' Adventures,\\" two elderly sisters leave their suburban Illinois homes for a trip to Los Angeles. One of the sisters is blind. She's the one who's driving. The sensitive protagonist of \\"Waltz in Marathon\\" is a loan shark. The artist hero of \\"A Shortcut in Time\\" lives in the town he was born and raised in, yet on a familiar neighborhood path he meets people slipping back and forth in time. For a man with many regrets, there is the temptation to try to tweek the past. Unfortunately, he is not the only person with this compulsion.I recommend this novel highly, and I envy anyone picking up a Charles Dickinson book for the first time. A banquet awaits you."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Stars - Disappointing","review":"The premise of the story is good - time travel, back and forth. The characters are weak and unbelievable. They don't speak to each other in a normal way - and the girl from 1908 is totally stiff. The ending was so disappointing that I threw the book on a chair and when I came back my puppy had torn it to shreds --- that was the best ending for this farse of a piece of literature. Save your money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shortcut in plot?","review":"The author definitely had some fun with the concept of time travel and created a fast-paced and entertaining story, which didn't get bogged down in concerns over the intracacies of time travel and its paradoxes or explanations as to how the the characters were able to skip so freely through time. However, I agree with many of the other reviewers that the ending was absolutely inexcusable. I've never encountered such a sudden and abrupt ending. I had to track down another copy of the book to ensure that I wasn't just missing pages. I can only assume that the author simply fell through a time hole himself and wasn't around the finish the book. The characters are left hanging without any resolution or explanation. While I appreciate that not every story has a happy ending, at a minimum, I expected an ending of some sort. Readers of this book will definitely feel cheated at the \\"conclusion\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this published?","review":"This book started very well. It had me interested, curious, thinking ahead. Good signs for a book. But then some holes start to appear and they slowly get bigger and bigger. And then after 287 pages it just ends on page 288. How did this get past the editors? Was this a joke by the publisher? \\"Hey lets see how many people will buy a incomplete book?\\"The story was very interesting until he gets back to his \\"second time around\\" life. There are lots of hints leading you to think there is more to it. But nothing leads anywhere and all of a sudden it is over. What about the brother? How can there be a daughter if there was never a union with the mother? Time travel flaw!!I just can't get past how angry I am about the way this just fizzled out!

I kept thinking that perhaps some pages were missing from the book becuase it just ended.I wanted to like this book. I know the suburbs he talks about and lives in, and I enjoy a good time travel book. But the ending was inexcusable. I've never been more upset after finishing a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...!","review":"I just finished this book, and like other reviewers, am bewildered by the ending. I guess the author had a deadline, and just sent them what he had...RIGHT NOW? I dunno.You have the protagonist, Josh, married with a daughter. He travels through time, just a 15 minute blip into the past, and then when his daughter Penny goes missing, he finds through microfilm in the library that she disappeared further into the past, 1918, and died of Spanish Influenza. He goes back to 1918 to find her and learns that Penny doesn't want to return to the present. When he returns to the present himself, he finds he changed history somehow, and that his life is totally different. So here is where the story might have gotten good - really interesting.But this is where all plot development goes away.

It's too bad because it really was good up to that point.

I started reading it about 6 pm and read until I finished it well after midnight.Of course, the whole premise of the book requires you to suspend your belief in reality. But the ending really forces you go back and think over which of Josh's actions caused the really surprising ending.I'm not normally a Sci Fi or fantasy reader -- but I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just adding to the bad reviews!","review":"Ugh! At least I am not alone in staying up late at night and then being disappointed. I stayed up until 2:30 AM because the beginning of the book drew me in. I was willing to overlook the fact that the characters have no dimension because I LOVE time travel books and the premise of the book was very intriguing. But then, just when the book should be getting GREAT because the main character traveled to the 1800's...putt, putt, putter...putter.........done. Did the author not want to put the work into investigating what it would be like to live in the 1800's? Did his publisher call and say, \\"That is enough! We need your book.\\"?

And to do this, you must FIGHT your way trough very sluggish menues.The graphic design is also lackluster, from the confusing queue line to the translucid matrix that make you loose tetrinos depending on the background image, specially the blue ones.If I have to do it again, I probably would choose Tetris Splash from the Arcade, wich cost less than 10 bucks, is a lot better at music and graphics and you can fire up directly from the HD w/o changing discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"great drill, bogus batteries...","review":"this drill kicks butt, when it's charged.

I didn't quite get it correct and during the night it ran over the dam and down the side a little. It takes overnight to get hard to the touch. I left it for a couple of days more before walking on it.I used masking tape for the dam and the glue from the tape stuck to the adhesive. I expected it would, but the paper did't stick.

You can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mining The Romance of Richard Rogers","review":"Stacey Kent is a young, native New Yorker who now lives, and generally performs, in England: that's what might happen to an American singer who falls in love with an English saxophonist. She's jazz-oriented, mining the great American standards: in this album, principally Richard Rodgers. In others, also the Gershwins, Cole Porter. Her touch is light, conversational,transparent; her attack fluid, swinging. And she's cute, too.She and her husband, tenor sax man Jim Tomlinson wind and curl around each other's voices, bringing to mind the great romantic collaborations of Billie Holiday and Lester Young;of Astrid Gilberto and Stan Getz. Or, in more contemporary terms, John Pizzarelli and Jessica Molaskey. Liner notes on this album were written by the English Booker Prize winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro. I've been so lucky as to see Kent (and Tomlinson)in person, at New York's famed Algonquin Hotel, and it was one wonderful show. Fine, mellow, and romantic, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"When?","review":"When was it decided that for female jazz singers it only about slowing all songs way down and having a nice cover photo???

It is a much more roomy changing pad than the ones that come with most diaper bags. It is nice to hang on the stroller handle when you dont want to bring the whole diaper bag. It also works great for making any regular old bag into a diaper bag. We mostly used cloth diapers, and those will not fit into the little pockets, but for disposable diapers it works great, holds about 2 to 3 diapers and a wipe case. We slipped anti bacterial hand cleaner (mini) and some keys into the front zipper pocket, no problem. Great value, and I love the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but there are better options","review":"I was looking for a second diaper kit that would mostly be used in my gym bag and in the hiking baby backpack. This seemed perfect but in reality once you fill it it doesn't fold up nice and neatly like in the picture, in fact the velcro closure hardly reaches. Maybe if you were only bringing one diaper... Our SkipHop Diaper Kit is far superior in terms of design. It has all the same parts including the wipe case but once you fill it the kit still closes! And I can fit 6 size 0-3 diapers and probably 3-4 diapers in size 4 or larger. I wasn't real excited about spending 2x as much on a second SkipHop kit but I think it will be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient","review":"I bought this to put in the basket of my City Mini since it isn't big enough to fit my large diaper bag, and it's perfect for what I use it for. I wanted something to hold diapers and wipes and keep them together. It is a little bulky when it's rolled up, but considering how much stuff is in it, it's not bad. I can fit two (and possibly more) size two diapers, and a good amount of wipes in the case that comes with it. The changing area is large and wipes clean very easily. It also has a little velcro strap to attach to the stroller which is even better, so I don't have to take up space in my already small basket. I just keep it in my car and transfer it to the stroller when I need it. I'm very glad I purchased this product, but if you're looking for something small, this is definitely not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent watch","review":"I love this watch so much that I wear it everyday and also this watch doesn't require changing battery.

Unfortunately, this is a typical example of Aristotelian analogical reasoning that relies on resemblances and similarities based on surface attributes that fall apart on closer investigation..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book--Best I have seen yet","review":"This book is a definite must read for anyone serious about the abortion debate. It gives clear, easy to understand answers to some of the most common questions. I seriously have not found one argument that can stop this book. This will seriously convince you of the pro-life side. Without a doubt the best book on the subject. Get one for anybody you know on the pro-abortion side that is really interested in the truth of the matter. Can't recommend it any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clap clap clap","review":"Dr. Beckwith is one sharp hombre, and this book is a masterpiece. I know of no other books that is able to make such a definitive Pro-life case that this does. If you put the seatbelt on and engage the power source of your mind, he makes complete sense. \\"Politically Correct Death\\" ought to end the debate on whether or not abortion is justified. The slippery slope--can anyone say euthenasia and cloning???--created by our political system is costing American society a great deal. May God have mercy on us. For those who are \\"Pro-Choice,\\" I challenge you to read this book with an open mind and see if you are able to refute this man's intellectually clear points. Truly this book is recommended to anyone who wants a clearer picture regarding the issue of abortion and ethics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any involved in the abortion debate!","review":"Dr. Beckwith provides a more than adequate defense for the pro-life position. His arguments are tight and he has done his homework to verify his statistics and sources. While his position is clear from the beginning, those who are looking for a loophole or inconsistency in his arguments are going to be very disappointed. The position he takes is direct,and many will be unhappy with the implications, but will not be able to disagree with him and maintain any sort of intellectual integrity. I recommend this book to anyone involved in the abortion debate. Those that are pro-life will find further ammunition in their endeavors, and the pro-choice advocates will see just what sort of opponent they need to be prepared to face."},{"rating":"2","title":"People SHOULD DEAL with the ARGUMENTS DIRECTLY!","review":"People definitely say that it is the BEST BOOK EVER on the pro-life position. Dr. J.P. Moreland writes that it is a thorough catalog of the issues with a sophisticated response that remains accessible to the general reader (Dr. Moreland is a well-known professor of philosophy and ethics). It is FASCINATING to look at arguments with a TRULY OPEN MIND. For example, ask if the arguments that Beckwith gives are REALLY RIGHT OR WRONG. A person MUST DEAL with the arguments that Beckwith gives DIRECTLY if they want to FIND THE RIGHT VIEW. I hope this review helps people understand the significance of this book. I also hope that it helps people look at arguments directly and with a truly open mind. A person should get Politically Correct Death because it is the best book that has ever been written on abortion. This is definitely the book a person should get if they want to get a better understanding of abortion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bounded Rationality Impresses No-One","review":"As a male medical student, I contend that Beckwith's work is factually incorrect. I'm sure that his self-referential Aristotlean and bounded logic convinces anti-abortionists and the naive undecided who are unfamiliar with anti-abortionist a priori premises and manipulation of the debate, but it does not impress rigorously critical sources of opinion. Beckwith's argument is bounded rationality and logic, and is not proper rigorous Socratic dialogue"},{"rating":"1","title":"No axe to grind, but...","review":"The abortion-rights respondents are right. Francis Beckwith does use skewed and a priori reasoning, and from what I've read about Aristotle, the anti-abortion position is heavily based on that series of prescientific propositions"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deontological \\"Logic\\" Versus Substantive Factual Detail","review":"Beckwith's defence of his stance is based on a premodern, Aristotlean \\"natural law\\" a priori ethics, theory of essences, teleology, and not on proper Socratic dialogue, which rigorously examines both sides of a claim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Encapsulated Discourse and the Abortion Debate","review":"Beckwith's work is no more different from earlier attempts to do so, and just as flawed due to its absence of accurate scientific detail"},{"rating":"1","title":"Medically Challenged and Misleading","review":"Anti-abortionists continue to laud this book as a notable contribution to the abortion debate, although its presuppositions are based on data that destroys the a priori Aristotlean logic of its basis. It is not \\"politically correct\\" to argue that below twenty-eight weeks of gestation, foetuses and embryos cannot feel pain, it is medical fact, from the American College of Obsteitricians and Gynaecologists. Similar problems beset anti-abortion \\"research\\" on postabortion syndrome,and other elements of a priori anti-abortion reasoning. Despite ad hominem attacks, this work may be coherently organised, but it fails to impress objective readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Zealand Doctor Asks Questions About Truth","review":"I must say that Beckwith's book is light on empirical and scientific fact, and is a self-referential resource that only his own movement will lionise. Nevertheless, I agree that pro-choicers should keep books like this under surviellance on the basis of strategic preparation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Instead of dealing with the contingencies of policy, Beckwith deals with the moral grounding of one's view on abortion. After all, whether or not one affirms or discounts a particular policy based on its effectiveness, the policy must be morally justified. One must not forget that slavery and women's marginalization \\"worked\\" for large segments in many societies. Of course, if it is wrong,it cannot be good policy, for no one has a moral right to do a moral wrong. One cannot be entitled to what one is not entitled. Think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This work is superbly done and offers a complete refutation of all the arguments that the relativistic \\"pro-choice\\" crowd offers. This book soundly demonstrates and exposes the faults of the transparent arguments put forth in favor of abortion.

This work could not be recommended enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book about abortion?","review":"This is the most reasoned book I know on the issue of abortion and it is natural sciences, ethics, some cases of law and even Biblical theology, etc. All of this with a perfect, flawless logic.

This book is so poorly edited that information at times becomes incomprehensible and/or inaccurate. His Animal Wise Tarot suffered from the same problem. This is an insult to readers.

I'd rather have the ability to customize the labels. Judging by other reviews, it seems you can't be sure exactly what spices will come with this set.

I should have read the details more closely, but I was hoping to have empty bottles and fill them with my own spices and also not have preprinted labels. The spices that come with this are OK, but not as diverse as one would hope. Also - why give spices that need to be ground up in bottles without grinders...? So my 2 star review is due to the cheap pre-labeled plastic lids that don't include grinders where appropriate and also the generic collection of spices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfecto!","review":"Este rack es excelente.

As a compilation of jokes, it's not necessarily the funniest (although all these sorts of things tend to be hit-and-miss) but that may also be because I tend to read a lot of humour and have seen some of these before. On the other hand, the strengths of this book are not necessarily in the humour alone, but in a couple of unique aspects you won't find elsewhere. Namely, the jokes are all clean - the level of profanity is extremely minimal, which is a rare thing indeed. Despite this the humour level is maintained. The other unique aspect is that Asimov provides an analysis of jokes and joke-telling that is again rare to find in any other publication. Both of these take the book from being merely funny to being an invaluable resource for the humour connoisseur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye of the Beholder","review":"Musty, dated, old boy humor of the kind floating around breakrooms and water-coolers.

Don't buy this; you will only end up with a nagging distrust of Rall that you didn't have before. A caring friend should ensure that his doctor reads the thing, but that's about it.

Almost all of the information about defensive guns, appropriate caliber rounds, etc. is ancient at this point - the book was written in 1980. It's also pathetically sexist; for instance he states that the .22 is a good defensive round for women, which is nonsense. I have yet to teach a woman to shoot who can't handle at least a .38, and many who deal with 9mm or even .45 with no problems. The .22 is no longer considered a reasonable defensive round...it's use should be confined to training or plinking purposes. Take this out of circulation, or give it a complete re-write.

When discussing guns for women, he doesn't promote calibers above .38 special \\"Unless you're a big girl\\".

Buying a gun on a whim and sticking it in a drawer is just not adequate or responsible. You must be both psychologically prepared to shoot someone and practiced enough to operate the weapon under extreme stress. And the time to think about the legal, moral, and even tactical issues that surround shooting another person is long before you're in a situation where it might be necessary.

It has not been updated since its publication in 1980. As a result, many popular new calibers (such as the .40 S&W; and the 10MM) and more recent gun designs (like the ever-popular GLOCK) are not covered. While the book still contains useful information on the justified use of deadly force and the basics of carrying a concealed weapon, it has been overshadowed by Chris Bird's \\"The Concealed Handgun Manual\\". Bird covers the same material as Ayoob, only in much greater depth and with an emphasis on more recent calibers and handgun innovations. Bird also goes into the many varieties of holsters availiable and discusses current concealed carry laws in all 50 states.In short, Ayoob's was a groundbreaking book--but Bird's is better and much more current."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you own a gun then you need to read this book.","review":"\\"In the Gravest Extreme\\" is an excellent resource.

The arguments are compelling, the conclusions are reasonable... a very important work for those who might use a firearm against another.Criticism: it's a little dated, which affects the discussion of firearm selection somewhat, and which affects the discussion of laws quite a bit. Also, as the author is a police officer, some of his positions are standard law-enforcement doctrine. (For instance, he states several times that carrying concealed weapons is a priviledge, not a right. Um, ever heard of the Bill of Rights? That was disapointing)But overall, it's a fine book, and I'm glad I bought it.

A lot has happened since then, and it goes without saying that laws regarding the use of deadly physical force, even in self-defense, can vary a lot from state to state. Ayoob is undoubtedly an expert in the field and I've always like his writing. However if this is something you're serious about, reading this book is not going to help you out that much, let alone complete your training.

There are a few other books that should be considered, Chaput's \\"Virgil Earp: Western Peace Officer\\", Tanner and DeArment's \\"Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait\\", and Bob Boze Bell's books on Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp. All reach pretty much the same conclusions although there are some variations in viewpoint that will make the reader think (for example, Tanner's view on just who was the target at the Boarding House is intriguing).

I've been using a number of other Tarot decks. Buying the Thoth Tarot was like buying a new computer equipped with all the new programs and having all the new facilities - eye-opening, exciting, bright and unlimited like the world itself - with my understanding only few of them... The symbolism of the Thoth Tarot deck also surpasses my knowledge of the occult, which is restricted to astrology and some Jungianism and which is short of Kabbalah so important for understanding Aleister Crowley's creation.

This is one of four tarot decks that I own, and one that I have found is best used on a more intuitive level. This is a deck that not many people will be able to use unless they read Aleister Crowley's \\"Book of Thoth\\" first...for me it is best to get the facts straight from the man himself than have someone else explain it.

It makes doing readings easier. The deck has more dynamic pictures than other decks. There is a sense of vibrancy and energy. Another feature of this deck is that it has Knight, Queen, Prince, and Princess as the court cards. This makes the deck more gender balanced than the ones that have King, Queen, Knight and Page. This is an important feature to look for, since the Qabalah, the underpinnings of the Tarot, is partly about the Middle Pillar and balance.

Now, I can't wait for the remaining seasons to be released. Season 2 is being released in June so I expect the following seasons will be following. Season One has some very good story lines, but I always liked Peter Graves better than Steven Hill as Mr. Phelps. He is involved in the story line much more than S. Hill was.

Being hard of hearing I always look before I buy to see if a DVD has English Closed Captioning so I can at least see what the actors are saying. \\"Mission Impossible\\" said that it did, not only in the Amazon listing, but on the DVD's themselves. It's not there. Nowhere can I bring it up or see where it is. I won't be buying any more seasons unless they can prove to me it's on there. False advertizing. (Added April 17, 2007) After contacting Paramount Home Sales in California, about the lack of Closed Captioning on my two DVD sets, they sent me a brand new DVD set that the CC worked perfect on! I was amazed! Thank you Paramount!

The more sophisticated filmmaking that is common on television today does make it look dated, though. You \\"know\\" you're looking at sound stage sets and backlots. But set that aside, the storytelling is still smart and the cast still the tops.

You get 28 episodes which is more than enough to keep you occupied for quite a while.

Great DVDs!","review":"This seven disc pack has the whole first season, in the order the episodes were aired. If you like the series, you'll like this DVD pack. The episodes are of high quality (not HD but pretty good for 1965). Also, each episode is pretty good. It reminds me of a time when TV was good and writing was smart. And since I was born in the 80's, that's not even a time I remember. Nevertheless, I've enjoyed these DVDs and I think you will too if you like smart TV or just espionage-thrillers in general.

We are hearing impaired (both deaf and hard of hearing) and we want to see what they said from this legendary TV classic show. We survived and endured through hearing impaired discriminations, prejudice and bigotry such as Audism. Please don't buy this DVD without subtitles and no closed captions because they deliberately copied from TV screen show to video without mastering of high-digital video techniques such as coloring, subtitles, etc. Paramount Home Video company often made cheap and flawed DVD video in order to boost their profit while lower the video quality.

My sister has the Breville IKON model and it is what inspired me to try this brand instead of much costlier brands. I expected to buy the IKON model because of the price point and the quality of the product. I found the ELITE model through Amazon was not nearly as expensive as it was locally and bought it. It performs and looks like a unit that would cost twice as much. It has a heavy and sturdy weight to it and juices so quickly with a VERY HIGH yield of juice that is impressive. With some items just the weight of the plunger itself is enough to pull the item through. It otherwise requires very little pressure which is a real bonus to a disabled person such as myself. If you can afford it you won't be disappointed......"},{"rating":"1","title":"easy to use and quick, but very wasteful","review":"ProsThis is very easy to usefeeding stuff in is much faster than with auger type juicersit is fairly easy to cleanConsit wastes a lot of juice leaving it in the pulpI feed greens, fruits and vegetables in and got about 3.5 cups of juiceI then fed the pulp in to an auger type juicer and got another 2 cups of juiceNormally when I use an auger juicer with the same amount of stuff, I get about 5 cups of juiceThe only advantage to this juicer is that it takes a little less than half the time to process everything.So now I regularly use this first since i own it already.

We used it exactally as directed and have kept it very clean, however about a week ago it started spitting out large whole chunks of fruit! It was just a few at first but the problem has just gotten worse and wore since then, and I am now having to attempt to re-juice all the pulp (however that does not work well either). I am on day 21 of a 60 day fast & can not just send it back in, I NEED it! I am very upset that I read all these wonderful reviews for it & yet should have paid attention to the few negative ones!

They both juice very well. Omega model squeeze out more juice when it comes to leafy items but it takes longer because you have to chop the items to small size in order to feed into its small chute. On this Breville model, that's not a problem. Its huge feed chute swallows whole apple without cutting to small size. Real time saver. Some people talked about juice from this type of centrifugal machine is inferior to one from masticating juicer because of heat generated by its high speed motor kills nutrients, but I couldn't tell. My juice was ice cold so I don't think that is a issue. In my opinion, convenience trumps hypothesized nutrient value because you will juice more frequently with this machine than the other one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Composting Organic Juice Money","review":"Half of the juice is going into your compost bin. After you juice put a handful of the pulp in your hand and make a fist. Watch how much juice comes out. If you are buying organic produce you are wasting your money with this juicer.

Takes a little longer but over time you will save lots of money and your health."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hyped!","review":"We purchased the Breville juicer about 3 yrs ago. No we haven't been using it that long. We only got a few months out of it when the juicing basket literally fell apart! We replaced it at 33.00. But that only lasted 3-4 months. So add it up-every 3 mo. that's over $100.00 a yr. to run this thing! Also company service was terrible!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional grade, easy to clean","review":"After obsessively researching my options, I decided to pay a few extra dollars for the Juice Fountain elite. My mom has a Breville product that serves her well, and the easy clean up promised in the description calmed my fears of leaning over the sink for fifteen minutes after every juicing session. I couldn't be happier with my decision. The unit is surprisingly powerful, and it comes apart and cleans easily with the included brush. The stainless and thick plastic design provides an impression of solidity and quality and adds to the kitchen's decor. Time will tell if the juicer is as durable as it looks, but it has delivered so far. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just TOO great and TOO beautiful!","review":"This is the most perfectly engineered and best performing juicer I've ever had. It spins up slowly to prevent the unit from jumping unexpectedly upon startup, looks absolutely fantastic on the counter, has very solid feet with treads that grip the counter, and is a pleasure to use. I had a Juice Man previously, and oh what a piece of crap that was compared to this. The Juice Man (and its La Lane, Waring, Krups, and other similars) is a toy, while the Breville 800JEXL is a professional grade appliance that will last the test of time.Well, there is one downside. It's just so beautiful to look at that I am compelled to meticulously clean it after every juicing, which is insane but necessary with such a gorgeous appliance. Oh well, I guess I can live with that! :)Buy it. You'll LOVE it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and dependable","review":"We've had this juicer for 16 months now, and it is like new. We purchased this Breville to replace another less expensive juicer that did not do as much and lasted about two years. While the Breville was three times the price, it will no doubt outlast more than three of the cheaper juicers and make better juice with more items and less headache. It's easy to keep clean and a great way to start the day or make a snack. I'm a huge fan; also the pulp can either be used in a bread recipe (if you make your own bread with vegetables) or compost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Greens - Not for Me","review":"This unit is a spinning centrifugal type so it just shoots greens out the waste unless you do some fancy footwork to get them to work.

Since most were favorable, I made the move, and am very happy with my investment. I love that its components are stainless steel and BPA-free for the plastic juice pitcher (although a stainless juice pitcher with foam separator would've been nice). I also love that the juice pitcher has a separator to remove most of the foam.I also pay attention (thanks to the previous reviewers' comments) NOT to ram food down the chute, and to use the appropriate settings for soft or hard fruits/vegetables.Moreover, cleaning the parts after juicing is not all that difficult (just a fact of the \\"juicing life\\").I am very pleased with my purchase!Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite 1000-Watt Juice Extractor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Juicer","review":"This is the best juicer we've ever owned.

This is amazingly easy to clean. I was a bit scepticle of the price but once I used it I realized that it was worth every cent. I hope that if you are thinking about a juicer that you don't let the price hold you back. It has already earned its worth. I have only had it 2 weeks and I have already used it 5-6 times. It is so easy to put together...I only had to glance at the instructions. Did I mention how easy to clean it is?

The juice is great and makes you never want to buy store juice ever again. The taste is so good and unlike store bought juice it does not break your mouth out due to the acid. I wish I would have had this all my life. Fresh juice is so good and the kids love it as well. There is some foam at the top but when you pour into your cup there is a catch on the lid to help keep the foam going into your glass.

Incredible machine...","review":"This is my first juicer, purchased based on the reviews here in Amazon.I clean it after every use (common sense) and use the provided pitcher to capture the juice, and the plunger to feed the food, so there is no 'spitting' as one reviewer stated.This is a rock solid piece of equipment. Its simple to use and very easy to clean up afterward. And it looks goregous.We throw pretty much any combination of oranges, apples, pears, celery, asparagus, grapefruits, tomatos, berries... through this machine and the result always taste fantastic.

There's not much I can say that hasn't been already said, but man, this thing is a beastly machine. I'm glad now that I got this, the cleaning isn't as bad as I thought it would be, and I prefer stainless steel over plastic. I never eat enough vegetables, and this thing just cranks them out.

I would recommend this jucer to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It - Even with one tiny complaint","review":"This monster is worth it: easy, very quick to assemble and disassemble, and not as loud as I thought it was going to be from the other reviews. The only thing I've found is that sometimes the waste is wetter than I expected it would be - I think this has something to do with how much power the juicer has. It's like it's going so fast sometimes that 1/3rd of a lemon will be shunted off into the waste before the machine can break it down further. Otherwise, I am a particular purchaser, and I'm thrilled. I would honestly buy this one again if I had to start all over, and anyone I've talked juicers to sees mine and compares it favorably to theirs or we find we have the same juicer. That's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breville 800JEXL Jumpstarted My Weight Loss","review":"I have been trying to get motivated about weight loss and have not been able to do it. When I first saw this machine online, the simple design caught my attention. When it arrived, I am very pleased but the weight of the box. It is a substantial machine on your countertop. The base of the machine is diecast. When you turn it on, the engine purrs like a German car. I like heavy duty appliances and this definitely fit my need.It works very well with all kinds of vegitables. Good for fruits too, but I do see the fruit pulp being a bit wet. Some people don't like foam, I am not bothered by it. I let the juice sit a while and stir it, usually most foam dissapear.I have been using it for about 4 weeks now. I have been juicing + a big salad each day, occationally I cheat a little bit when going out. I have lost 10 lbs so far.

If you sandwich them between some celery stalks they get juiced a little better, but I would suggest getting a masticating juicer if you think you will use a lot of parsley/cilantro.Otherwise this juicer rules!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breville 800JEXL juicer works flawlessley","review":"We bought this Juicer about 6 weeks ago. We have been using it almost daily.It is fast and fairly quiet, quieter than a blender. We have tried various fruits and vegetables. It juices them in seconds. Once done it is easy to clean the four parts. We use a plastic bag to catch the pulp. So that further saves cleaning time.The stainless steel body makes it look nice and professional.We have not had a single problem with the juicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my new juicer!","review":"I recently purchased the fountain elite, after being very disappointed with my Jack Lelaine juicer. I like juicing harder vegetables such as beets and carrots. The Breville juicer is so powerful I don't even have to use the pusher to get the vegetables down the chute, it does it so flawlessly. I can also put the giant horse sized carrots into the chute and no problems. Putting a plastic bag over the waste container was a big help too, only a word of caution: make sure it is tucked tightly or tape it down to the sides of the waste bin. I had one incident where the suction was so strong it ripped the bag into the centrifuge and I had plastic shreds everywhere. I did agree with the other reviews in that the juice can sputter out the top, but it wasn't a huge deal, just a few drops that I've noticed. I've had his juicer for a month, and I use it all day everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"The Machine is awesome.It is powerful and easy to handle.We feel the upgrade from our Black and Decker machine was a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time juicer...","review":"Did research and discovered that this is the best juicer out there. I purchased it and within 3 days I was pushing carrots into it! It is amazingly easy to disassemble and clean and then reassemble. The foam catching feature on the juice collection pitcher is great. I will be using this appliance for a very long time! I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this juicer to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one problem","review":"It seems like a good quality item, even though it is made in China, but there is one glaring engineering problem, it's a bit difficult to describe but i'll try, the cutter disk is made with little teeth that cut the food, the problem is that the teeth are perfectly lined up in rows instead of being in a random pattern so the food molds itself in the shape of the cutter and just sits there and nothing happens until you press down very hard which is hard on the motor, it's really incredibly stupid and easily fixed if they cared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great juicer!","review":"This is the first high quality juicer I've gotten. I actually got it second-hand for just $45 and it works amazingly! Tastiest juice ever. And the stainless steel finish is really nice.

The power and quickness of this machine made me very happy. Now fruits and vegetable are on my weekly shopping list.Thank you Breville!A very satisfied customer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Addition To My Countertop.","review":"Juicer looks great, and is very well made. I would buy it again.It is easier to clean than the other juicer I have used. It also has a very large feed chute that means less cutting. It never slows the motor down.Pulp is usually a little wet still, especially tomatoes.Juice is usually foamy, I think that is all juicers.I really like it, and I use it almost every day.I recommend getting a compost container for under your sink with any juicer. The pulp turns into great topsoil."},{"rating":"1","title":"licking, spitting, inefficient juicer","review":"This juicer is not efficient as it requires much more fruits than my previous juicer to extract the same amount of juice. To get two pints of juice I used about 6-7 pounds of apples! At the same time if I squeezed waste by hand, I would have got, at least, one-two glasses more.You will never get carrot juice, it comes out as puree, so forget about vegetables.Moreover, pulp container licks and spits."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent juicer","review":"I love this juicer. I had another one previously, and for my needs, primarly carrot and celery juice, this is much better. It can handle the hard carrots easily, with very little effort on my part. The clean up is a little bit of a pain, but that is the case with all juicers.If you are doing more than one item, make sure you juice the softer item first, for instance with carrot and celery juice, if you do the celery first, it won't be as pulpy. If you do the carrots first, more of the carrot pulp is in the final product. You may like that, I don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Durability","review":"This was a GREAT Juicer and GREAT design.the problem is that the company only warranties the product for ONE YEAR, compared to Champion juicers with a lifetime warranty!good design, but POOR QUALITY workmanship outweighs the benefits - mine broke after 1.5 years - buy another brand"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved this juicer when I first bought it. It was so efficient and fast. The pulp came out almost dry. We used it almost daily to juice carrots. After 6 weeks, the pulp started coming out wet with lots of chunks. It was spitting juice out the side near the pulp chute and producing a lot less juice. I think this is because the blades in the filter are already dulled. What a disappointment. It's going back to the store today."},{"rating":"2","title":"juicer","review":"Wow! This is truly the greatest juicer I've ever owned and well worth the money. I've juiced everything. Even beets (which make a great base for juices) It runs rather quiet for a juicer and the clean up is really simple. It appears to be really tough and durable. It's all stainless steel except the pitcher and the holder for the particles. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in a juicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Motor, Amazing Juicer.","review":"I like it, it has the speed for it, and it amazed me how it works. The parts are easy to clean, only about 4 parts to clean. The juicing time for me has dropped from like 10 minutes to like 3 minutes. It takes longer to set up the veggies/fruits then anything else.One thing I notice and it's why I gave it a 4 star; it's because just about a week and a few days after I notice that some of the teeth are half way missing and some or bent back? I'm not sure how that happened, however I'm willing to buy another mesh to test it out again. I juice everyday, and I've had no problems wit it, I would say that this is the juicer to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful!!","review":"This juicer is absolutely wonderful! It's easy to use and the instructions are very easy to understand. The instruction booklet also contains a variety of tasty recipes...so far we have liked every one we have tried. Cleanup is a snap. The funnel for puting in your fruit,veggies, &/or herbs is wide so there is not a lot of chopping that has to be done. I also like that the makers encourage consumers to use fruit/veggies that are in season, tell you how to use the leftover pulp or if you choose not to, encourage you to put them in your compost pile.I highly recommend this item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works as good as all the hype about it.","review":"We love the large chute at the top, you can throw in most apples whole at once. most times you dont have to worry about cutting anything. there are very few parts to clean especially if you put a grocery bag inside the pulp catcher--then you wont have to clean it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple","review":"I love this juicer it's so simple to use easy clean up easy put together the only thing that could be better is stuff like kale or smaller and lighter items I find it slings it up into the pulp part with out juicing so I put the big stuff in first then the kale on top so I can be pressing it so it doesn't just fly up... Anyway it's amazing I'm still in love"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought this juicer in January and have been using it regular. It can be a little loud, but boy is it fast. Clean up is a snap too. You just have to remember to clean it within a few minutes of use. I just use a regular dish washing brush and some dish soap and I'm done cleaning in 2 minutes.I have a masticating juicer as well (Omega) and that's great too for leafy greens, but this one powers through everything. I do get a bit more juice from spinach and kale with the Omega, but not much more than Breville. It powers through hard vegetables like beets as well. Just remember to push down slowly when juicing and you get much more juice.It looks great too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Dollar","review":"This is my second juicer from Breville and it just perfect for me. The design is perfect to make three 32oz. juices. before doing clean-up. I recommend anyone who's interested in juicing, that the price is worth the investment. If you want quality, then pay for it. I believe Breville is second to none when it comes to juicers and this by far perfect for the beginner and the veteran juicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every day for the last 2 years","review":"We have been using this juicer daily for the past 6 months and still think it is an awesome piece of equipment. It is powerful, effecient and easy to clean. We shop at a local asian market almost daily and make vegatable juice to get my wife and I through the day. We put everything through this machine and it is so powerful that it isn't fazed by anything we have put through it. It is very effecient and wastes very little. If you are serious about juicing and don't want a machine that will discourage you from making this a way of life or that won't end up in the back of your pantry or under a cabinet, then this is the one to get.Update: We have been using this juicer for over 2 years now and it is still awesome. Juicing has made a big difference in our health and our lives and if we didn't have a stout piece of equipment that is easy to use and easy to clean we may have been tempted to stop juicing. Highly recommend this juicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, Quite, Effective","review":"I was able to even juice kale using this juicer.

Don't let sellers use that as an opportunity to take advantage of you, check your product and the claims by doing your research first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid juicer","review":"I use to have a Breville juicer that had a couple of plastic parts and sometimes it would leak. I decided to buy this model and it's pretty darn good. I usually will put a few carrots, apples, celery in Pyrex before I go to sleep. When I wake up I just run them thru the juicer and the juice is ready within a minute or two. I have a little dish bin that I soak the juicer parts in afterwards and it works great.

If pressure is light, fruits or vegies do not go through, and when more pressure is pressed, they go through too fast. And usually at the end of juicing there is a strong jerking motion because fruite or vegies go through UNprocessed, no matter what speed is.If you use Jack Lalanne before you will love Jack's much more than this. I think this machine is for someone wants to waste fruits or vegetables because the pulp in container is heavier than Jack's.I use it for 2 weeks and I come back to Jack LaLanne. Breville better RE-designs this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer a Breville fan","review":"My Compact Breville was wearing down after a year and a half of heavy use, so I upgraded to the Breville 800. Very dissipoiting experience. First, the pulp of my greens was quite wet, (even after juicing on low as they suggest). Second, it sprayed juice out the sides where the cap fits over the pulp bucket. And third, the motor began to vibrate during my second use and got worse each use after that. I was thankful I was still within the thirty days. I sent it back and after further research I bought the Omega 8006. I can confidently say that after three weeks of use I love it. It is much easier to clean, with a higher quality of juice and dryer pulp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Horrible.

[...]REALLY? I $300 juicer that has such a pour design and/or tolerance of part fit that I need to augment it with a grocery bag?

If you are thinking about buying this model, I would reconsider! sad customer here!!! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"One Bad Juicer","review":"This juicer is the worse buy I have ever made on amazon. It spits food everywhere, and I mean everywhere. The pulp container leaks liquids, the feeder shoot can pop out whole pieces of veggie up in the air and away from the unit, and please wear a rain slicker while using because it is going to get on your clothes. Easy to clean? I guess so, so long as you are willing to also clean every inch of your kitchen within 6 feet of the unit including the cabinets. I ordered this unit special fast delivery because my elderly father needs the juice. I was a fool, I hope you are not as big a fool as I am. I will return it, and hopefully get my money back. This juicer is a disaster. It even throws whole pieces of veggie and fruit away into the pulp container after just 4 uses. This is a waste of time and money, especially for the organic juicer. Who can afford to throw away whole pieces of veggie? This is on my DO NOT BUY list, and should be on yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome juicer","review":"Does a fantastic job juicing all veggies and most fruit (although tomato tends to splatter- make sure you're not on high speed for soft fruits...). It's easy to assemble, take apart, and the parts go easily into the dishwasher. the cutter blade needs immediate cleaning, but that's a small price to pay for great performance in other areas. Oh- and the plug shape is ergonomic and incredibly logical- I wish it was used on most appliances."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL Customer Service!!!","review":"Breville has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I recently spent $300 dollars on a die-cast elite juice fountain. I used it once and was not happy with it.

You would think that a company who advertises so much about quality would do more to stand behind their products and make their customers happy.

I have followed the directions from day one and have even tried their suggested vinegar soak on the filter basket to no avail.My final conclusion is this just isn't the juicer for someone planning to juice 2-3 times a day, 7 days a week.

But apparently pretty good is not enough. After 6 months my 3 times a week carrot-beet juice seems to have KOed the filter basket. Plus the \\"titanium cutting wheel\\" seems now to have dulled itself sending gobs of wet pulp to the waste catcher rather than into my juice. It amounts to $60+ replacement. What a sting!For 10 years I had a French made Tefal juicer ($49) and it worked just fine. This super high-priced replacement has failed me in 6 months. Sorely disappointed and feeling ripped off especially after reading all these glowing Amazon reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, Until It Breaks","review":"I loved this juicer when I first got it. That was just a little over a year ago. Today, it stopped working just as I was making my breakfast juice. When I called Breville's customer support, I found them to be rude, disinterested and totally unhelpful. Read your warranty, folks, they support their products for only one year. After that, you are on your own as far as replacement and repair are concerned. If you think, as I do, that a $300 juicer should last more than a year, then this is not the product or the company for you. I will never buy another Breville product again.

It looks great on the counter (pro-tip: measure from your counter to your cabinets to make sure it will fit - fits for me but it is a tall guy), it is very well-built, and it makes juice super-fast. As with any juicer, there is a lot of clean-up, but this one breaks down easily and isn't too tough. I carve out 25 minutes each morning to gather ingredients, make juice, and clean my juicer. The wide mouth is another awesome feature. It fits whole 2.5\\" Fuji apples, big bunches of spinach, or multiple carrots/celerty stalks/etc at a time without having to cut stuff up first.

When working, it does a good job with all sorts of fruits. But like another reviewer mentioned, because the mouth of the feed is large and also the design of the feed is directly above the motor, frequently pieces of fruits get spits back out. My eyes got hit a couple of time. Also the two speeds work pretty much the same in term of producing pulp in juice (like another reviewer mentioned, there was NO difference, what a waste of the two speed). Biggest travesty of all, the juicer stopped working after just 2 month. Tried to put in a medium juice apple in and the blade made some noise and then the motor just died.

When I contacted Breville, they said that the seller on Amazon was not an authorized dealer and would not replace it. Amazon said the refund period ended December 9th. I am so upset with this juicer and the Amazon/Breville refund system. They should both stand by this very expensive product and give me a full refund or a replacement.

First, grill brushes have been known to leave behind metal bristles, which are extremely dangerous. These bristles can get caught in the roof of the mouth, the tongue or anywhere in soft tissues of the mouth. And if swallowed, can require surgery to remove. It does happen, it can happen. I would never put my family at risk using a grill brush. Besides, the Grill Stone cleans the grates of a grill far better than a brush. Just remember to wipe off the \\"dust\\" the stone leaves behind with some oiled paper towels. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing really works","review":"This thing really works. Better than wire brush or scotch brite.

They easily and quickly clean off the grime and bring my grates down to shinny metal.The negative is that they do not last long. I have a very large grill and I only get one cleaning out of a stone. They quickly disintegrate. Other reviewers have stated that they last for several cleanings. This is simply not my experience. Now, I do not clean my grill after every use. I only clean it when it is very dirty. So, it takes some scrubbing. If I used them to clean up the small spots every time I grilled they would last much longer.Are they worth it? Yes. They work much, much better than a wire brush. $3 for a clean grill is expensive, but worth it.Be sure you spray down your grates after cleaning as they will be covered in stone dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really works!","review":"This product is amazing!!!While I agree with the customer who gave it a 1 star because the pumice wears down really quickly, I was able to completely clean the barbeque grill three times with one block. I would normally need at least three SOS pads to accomplish the same thing -- only the results wouldn't be as good and the time it would take me would be at least three times as long.I was truly amazed at how quick and easy cleanup is with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I expected and more","review":"My family and I love Ziggy.

But another, now deceased scholar of all things Wildean, Rupert Croft Cooke, did. Cooke, author of dozens of novels, biographies and other books, knew Lord Alfred Douglas when he, Cooke, was a youngster. As a result, his book, entitled Bosie: Lord Alfred Douglas, His Friends and Enemies, gives an intimate look at Bosie in more mellow old age. Cooke, a former newspaperman in the glory days of Fleet Street, was also a much more lively writer than Douglas Murray. His book is out of print, but can commonly be found in used book shops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Stuff!","review":"This biography is a poorly researched and dishonest apologia for a rather tiresome and spoilt aristocrat whose poetry was as irrelevant and old-fashioned as his \\"Christian morality\\". All is explained by the fact that the author is one of his descendants. (Dishonest/poorly researched? Example: the author claims Douglas organised a petition of French writers to defend Wilde and then criticised their hypocrisy for not signing [p. 94].

The second time I picked the cage up to take the cat to the vet, the cat slid against the back door, thrashed once or twice and then TA-DA the cat was free.If you trap an animal you can expect that it will thrash around trying to get out.

The real conflict doesn't come into play until 250 pages into the book, and the constant flowery descriptions became tedious very quickly.

That is with lots of zooming, flashing, and fidgeting with the setting. BTW if get the \\"battery exhausted\\" messages appears you can turn it off and let it sit for few minutes and get a few more shots. The CRC-V3 recharables has lasted 200+ so far (they just came in). Well worth it. The flash also charges faster. The LCD is accurate and has no dead pixels. It is also smaller than I realized.

Most non-name-brand batteries made in third-world countries don't work at all as digital camera is a high-drain device.

It's my second digital camera, and after a fair amount of research into small 3.2MP models, I bought it before a two-week vacation that culminated in a wedding. On the trip, I took some 350 pictures and also made a few short videos. When the camera works, it works very well, but I found that it was almost impossible to get it to focus in low light, i.e., lighting where a flash is needed. Furthermore, after several seconds of pressing the shutter release and having it fail to focus, I'd lower the camera, only to have it focus on the floor and take a picture at that time. I ended up with a lot of pictures of the floor. The video feature works quite nicely, and the various \\"scene\\" modes do well, too, but when the lighting got tough, this camera gave me nothing but frustration.

It's not a book on how to design, program or play games.Instead it is a book that attempts to answer the question \\"what does it take to be asuccessful video game producer?\\"Here is a behind-the-scenes view of what it takes to succeed. It is about today's video game business. In the early days game production was usually a one man show. One man produced, designed, programmed, tested, sold, even designed the box. But not now. Now a major game project cost perhaps $15 million, this book is on what it takes to put together a $15 million development effort. It covers what needs to be done in all the areas, not how to do them, it's what needs to be done and how to put together a team that can do it.The author was Executive Producer at Relic Entertainment responsible for a major game, and now consults to some of the biggest players in the business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This book is basically just a long list of platitudes, like \\"strive for excellence\\", \\"plan ahead\\" and \\"be nice to people\\". It contains very little of substance and is incredibly superficial.Apart from that, it is poorly organised (apparently every single paragraf deserves to get its own header!), extremely repetitive, and also contains annoying small mistakes (like referring to a reading list which doesn't exist)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable Sparty","review":"I bought two of these for gifts and they are so adorable on the baby boys, my niece's son and my nephew's son.

Save your money or you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dock Designs - Did not help me.","review":"This book might be okay if you are building a floating dock.

Their suggestion was for me to go out and buy another newer drive. Bad, bad advertisement!!The one-star represents product support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I purchased Plextor for what I thought was a quality product. However, now after about 18 months of not very heavy use it has failed (I can no longer burn a DVD).

And, their insistence that the problem might be my use of non-approved media was just plain silly.Ultimately, the RMA (return/exchange) process was quick & painless. It's never pleasant rummaging around inside the case, but all's well that ends well...presently playin' & burnin' to my heart's content."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Still Waiting","review":"The shipping date for this product states that it ships in 1 to 2 weeks.

This would make my total wait almost 7 weeks for shipping and probably another week for delivery, assuming that it ever gets shipped. I am very disappointed in the estimated shipping date that is posted. If I was given an accurate estimate, I would have ordered a different product. I now feel that I have a certain amount of time invested and feel obligated to wait it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book is not only poorly written, it is also poorly edited. I am not a textile engineer or textile technologist, and I found obvious errors in the first chapters that would actually affect the quality of work anyone using this book would perform.

I've been on the road for several years, spending most thanksgivings eating room service turkey or having some European Film Crew Chef attempt to prepare the quintessential American Feast. Do they even eat Turkey in France? This year I found myself at home and, under pressure from my very large Italian family, I made my first T-giving turkey dinner.I happened upon Rick's book and studied it feverishly. I stashed it in my kitchen in a strtegic location; lest I be accused of cheating. My meal went off like a charm. So well, that my Catholic guilt got the best of me and I confessed. Each of my five sisters summarily went and bought the book. I can't wait until next year.Thank you Rick, With appreciation, Linda Fiorentino."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent \\"Prep\\" Book","review":"This book is great for all the steps leading up to the meal: shopping lists, ALL about turkeys, when to make and reheat foods, etc., and the author is an excellent writer - he's interesting and funny. However, there were many recipes that our family just would not utilize. Also, there should have been more pie recipes.His homemade version of jellied cranberry sauce is delicious and there are definately other \\"keepers\\" that you don't have to wait for the holidays for.I got this book at the library and I am purchasing it through Amazon for this year's holiday - for the turkey information alone, it is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down THE BEST cookbook for Thanksgiving","review":"Rick Rodgers is an expert!

I loved the book and I read it from cover to cover! All the classic recipes are there and there's different menues to choose from. You can go from classic to elegant.He shows all the basics about how to cook a turkey and the best and least best ways of cooking a turkey. I really enjoyed it and I'll use it every Thanksgiving! My only complaint was his recommendation to put the yam casserole under the broiler to melt the marshmellows...I had them in 30 seconds and they caught on fire and burned up! I would recommend just putting the caserole back in the oven instead for a few minutes to melt them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview of Mazatlan","review":"Of all the guidebooks I've every bought, this one proved the most useful of any. From restaurant reviews to medical or real estate info, this book delivers. Written by a person who really knows Mazatlan. I highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Mazatlan. Also just an enjoyable format that makes me want to meet the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I had done my homework on Mazatlan by reading reviews and the forum on TripAdvisor but thought I needed more. Apparently I didn't. The book doesn't deliver and the author, as one reviewer pointed out, is a bit annoying (he claims to be a great negotiator, even at Nordstom's, and has a drinking section even though he is allergic to alcohol).As any travelor can tell you, restaurants change so a published book cannot keep up. And if it doesn't change, the fact it is published in a tourist book certainly will change the clientelle. The rest of the information seemed common sense or found on the internet.Not a lot to glean from this one. Read the forum section of Mazatlan TripAdvisor (hint: the author's contributes to the site) and you will get the answers you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine Intervention - a great book by a new author","review":"This is an exciting book by a new author who very successfully blends interstellar colonization, religion, physics, and politics into a sci-fi novel with great characters and a rip-roaring ending.

I would definitely recommend this book, and am looking forward to more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I had never heard of Wharton or this book when I picked it up in the bookstore, so I considered it a ...shoot, but I liked the premise. It wasn't quite what I expected, but I really enjoyed it. I think some of the characters were a little thin, and I would have liked to learn more about the society it was set in. But I thought it was interesting how the history was presented alongside of the story and how it came together at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive!","review":"How is it that the Star Trek series can spend $2 million an episode, and only come up with a halfway decent script about 10% of the time? Meanwhile, writers like Ken Wharton, working all alone, can come up with a fast, action-filled, provocative book like this one, and do it for probably less than a $10,000 advance. I don't particularly like \\"hard\\" science fiction, and I am sooo bored with authors pontificating about God, the universe, and everything. But Wharton has some genuinely fresh ideas, they're clearly written, and he's got a sizzling story to boot. I only gave it 4 stars (because I'm against grade-inflation!), but it's one of the best books I've read this year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yeuch","review":"horrible, I'm afraid. I picked this up at my local drugstore, the concept looked interesting. The concept is interesting, but the execution was very poor. The characters are poorly sketched, some of the concepts seem to be just thrown in without much thought (the whole fana thing?), the conflict between the city dwellers and the 'burnouts' is never developed ... I could go on, but the book isn't worth the effort. The book might be a little interesting to someone who has never read decent SF, but you have you can see how far short it falls"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skunkzilla","review":"I love reading this book to my boys 3 and 6. We actually were crying with laughter the first time we read it! So its a little gross. I want my children to see how fun reading can be and this does the trick.

I mean who wouldn't want to hear about Skunkzilla and Skunkong."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY!!!","review":"This has got to be the funniest book my kids and I have read to date! It is kinda disgusting, but my kids (6, 7, and 9) and I laughed so hard that I could hardly finish reading it. Definetly a must for a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this poor book","review":"This book represents the worst in children's books. The rhyming is awful, and the author is highly unskilled at contriving nonsensical words. This book is representative of a current trend in children's books that mixes a weak storyline with poor wording to create a text that is not worthy of a child's time. Please avoid this book, or, if you must read it, simply check it out at the library so you do not waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent offering from new author","review":"Wow! Chinchuba starts out a lot like a James Bond movie with a big action sequence upfront to hook you. Casey then weaves an interesting tale of science, religion, science fiction and romance which keeps the reader entertained throughout the book.Frankly, I made the mistake of starting this book in the evening and I found myself not wanting to go to bed without finishing it (even though I had to go to work the next day). I also found myself a little scared of the dark (ok, a little silly, I know), something I haven't really experienced since the first time I read Stephen King's It. I'd say the style in this novel is a bit of a cross between King and Dean Koonz,perhaps leaning more towards Koonz. I certainly look forward to reading more of this author's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"iwilson295","review":"\\"Chinchuba\\" was a pleasant surprise from a new author to the horror genre. I had to show restraint to place the book on the nightstand shelf, turn out the lamp, and try to sleep each night until the novel was finished. Well, I just finished and I must say it was money well spent. I look forward to seeing more work from K. Michael Casey in the future.Readers who enjoy Dean Koontz's popular horror literature will definitely be able to plug right into this novel. Although the writing style is different from Koontz's, Casey's method of quickly launching you into the lives of characters you care about is highly effective and in the same fashion as koontz manages to pull it off in his novels. Casey's book will get a deserving place of honor on my bookshelf beside Dean Koontz's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good overall view of the music business.","review":"The video is well organized and gives important information for anyone getting started or currently in the music industry.

The information I gathered from this book brings absolutely nothing to the fight, but brilliantly and clearly defines the scenario of today's operational environment. It does not possess any practical information on how to negotiate the challenges without completely neglecting current established treaties and policies. One of those \\"good to know\\" books."},{"rating":"2","title":"response","review":"The first reviewer despite his technical expertise may have missed the point, this is use of current skills and inventory against those who employ asymmetical warfare methods.

It projects the time on the ceiling if you use the outdoor weather gauge, which is unobtrusive, but, the clock display turns different colors depending how cold it outside. Under 50 degrees, an intense blue that might keep you awake. Probably fun for children that have no concept of quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I have had this for a while and it is still working. The color corresponds to the temp outside. The time that is projected on the ceiling is large enough that I can see it without my glasses. The radio works fine. The outdoor temperature is awesome so you will know what temp it is out side. It has one radio alarm and one beep alarm that you can set at different times especially if you have two people waking up at different times and do not want to bother setting the alarm for the other person. Easy to use. Snooze is set to 10 minutes for the Beep alarm. I use the radio and never hit snooze for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor reception, poor projection","review":"I was disappointed, having my expectations set by reading their description of the product (and not reviews).

Alarm is ony 7 day, and not so easy to turn/off, so I get the alarm 7 days a week.

Ripping open my box I found a smallish book with a rather homely British woman on the cover. I didn't let this discourage me so I opened it up looking for the glossy pages of naked culinary artists. \\"WHAT!\\" I exclaimed. There was not a single photo in the entire book. How was I supposed to figure out what food worked best on the human body without this aid. Furthermore, there was not one reference to the erotic properties of food. I could not figure out why the illusions to nudity were attached to this book. Finally, I sat down and produced some of the recipes in the book, which were decent at best.

If you can look past Oliver's imprecision in measurement, this book is quite enjoyable. Meals like tagliatelle with pesto and mussels are tasty and easy to prepare. It's also nice the way Oliver 'seasons' the book with short anecdotes about his own experiences cooking in restaurants.

A must to have for the bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipies and enjoyable reading","review":"Ok I'll admit that the recipes in this book are simple. However, that doesn't mean the flavors are simple. Some of the best recipes out there are ones that use fresh and simple ingredients, which is the premise behind this book. The recipes are good and most are relatively easy to make. Oliver combines great ingredients together to create good food and that's what good cooking is all about. While this book is great for a relative beginner to the kitchen, I think that experienced cooks will also gain some inspiration from it and truly appreciate the message that Oliver is trying to get across, which is that good food doesn't have to be complex and expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brit is Best","review":"Jamie O brings simplicity and style to cooking at home.

Either he hasn't described the process clearly enough, or the recipes aren't fully formed. A perfect example is the simple roasted chicken. First, you have to figure out exactly what he's asking you to do. Once you get the fresh herbs stuffed into the chicken and pop it into the oven, you're tantalized by the incredible smell. But when the chicken comes out, the flavor is disappointing and even unappealing. Some of the herbs he suggests using leave a nasty, bitter taste. Others simply leave no taste.The recipes in the book give the experienced cook some interesting starting points to jump from, but I think the mixed results might leave a more inexperienced cook discouraged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rissotto worked at last","review":"Having watched the TV series, this book was a must.

Instead, she spends the rest of the book going on about an affair she had with a married Thai man. How angry she is at his wife. How unfairly life is treating her. And on and on. It is boring, not even remotely informative. As a reader, I felt as used as the Thai people with whom Ms. Odzer interacted, and I felt no sympathy or empathy for the author or her actions..."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY, THE AUTHOR ONLY TALKS OF HER THAI BOYFRIEND","review":"if you want a book dealing specifically with prostitution in thailand, how it is done, and what the prostitutes do, and how they live, this book is not informative enough. this book is a description of the time the author spent in bangkok. more often than not, she does not interviewing prostitutes, and she does not bring you into the lives of these slums. she sees the whole prostitution business in a way that is rather naive. rather, as said before, she spends a lot of time talking about her thai boyfriend and other non-relevant things. she does give some important insight on thai prostitution and the white men involved, but it is very little. read this book like you would a novel. i wouldn't recommend you purchase it for research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Know It Was So Easy to Get a PhD","review":"First things first: no one could or would read this book without a prior fascination with Thailand. Which is to say it's awful. But what impressed me most was that such a sloppy, amateurish, ego-ridden, childish and effortless piece of work can get you a PhD, at least in the soft sciences. Maybe \\"Dr.\\" Odzer ain't so dumb after all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's the prostitute here?","review":"As a Thai-American, it's appalling to be unable to find good research material on this subject. The issue is a lot more complicated than presented. Thais have a wide range of opinion based upon class, etc. It's a very proud and beautiful country, in which many aspects are more reasonable than the US. To concentrate on such a sensitive topic without strong objectivity is just plain wrong. I would like to see more detail about the actual women, children, legal processes, \\"farang\\" men, and so forth, not some silly woman's sexcapades. Perhaps I'll have to do my own research..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotional not Analytical","review":"What a wasted research opportunity.Academic funding (and I presume a decent supervisor), an extended period for study in the Kingdom and... what interested me the most... a woman's perspective on a subject usually \\"sensationalised\\" by parachute journalists or men that have arguably lived in Bangkok too long. It could have been so good.This is definitely not ground breaking social anthropology of the Paul Harrison calibre. Rather it comes across as reminisces from an extended vacation cum study trip.If you are looking for an in depth analysis of the Pong, or the intricacies and the drivers behind the sex industry, you are not going to get it here. Leave it on the book shop shelf next to the trash novels written by men attempting to gain closure on their experiences of the Thai bar scene.\\"Pat Pong Sisters.\\" Tosh. It's more like \\"My Girlie Mates I Met In Pat Pong. And a Fair Bit About the Local Bloke I Fancied.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the Truth","review":"I was hoping for a reasoned treatment of the subject, but found instead a book that says more about the author's own lack of perspective than about her alleged subjects. She should have spent more time learning about Thai culture and society before undertaking her study. As it stands, she was a limited observer on a world where she often failed to make basic connections and conclusions that would be readilly apparent to any one who has lived for an extensive period in Thailand. She is more tourest than reasoned observer. If you can get a doctorate for this sort of work, then it can not be much of a degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but highly inaccurae","review":"Having communicated via email with Cleo Odzer, and having spent many years living in Thailand, I was eager to read her book, Patpong Sisters. Unfortunately, the book, while interesting, was highly inaccurate. Her supposed conversations with bar girls lacked a ring of truth. And her \\"AIDS Statistics\\" haven't proven to be true in the real world. Patpong is but a small, though highly visible, section of the prostitution industry in Thailand. An industry that far predates contact with western civilization. Odzer fails to bring this perspective into her book, and generally, takes a limp wristed view of the whole Patpong scene. Still, this book, through it's uniqueness alone, is worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing and Superficial","review":"Though Odzer describes years in Thailand, most of the book focuses on her own *inability* to get any information. She is stonewalled over and over again, but shows no inginuity in exploring the \\"World\\" she seeks. Lacking any real oportunity for insight--and often being played for a sucker by those she purports to study--the book rarely rises above a boring account of her love life."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique style","review":"I have had multiple comments about the stylish great looks of the watch and that is what made me decide to buy it.

I've always been a sucker for analogue chronographs and this one, with its unique style and awesome price (over 1/2 off here at Amazon) was impossible to resist. All the features I wanted, serious heft and durability, and a true \\"conversation timepiece\\".

I did not really like this one. Not much in it was the real life of Doc Holliday. It seemed like several chapters were a repeat of the previous one. Doc would get up, dress, go eat breakfast, go play poker, shoot somebody and then go back to his hotel. The next chapter he would be in a different town, get up, dress, go eat breakfast, go play poker, shoot somebody and then go back to his hotel. The towns changed and Doc always had to agree to show up at a hearing the next morning to explain the shooting. Was really disappointed in the book, started just skimming pages as it was so much like previous pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"WHEN I BOUGHT THIS BOOK I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME HISTORIC INSIGHT INTO THE LIFE OF DOC HOLLIDAY.

This will not attract you to Conan, the mythical Cimmerian superman. The Conan Chronicles are a disgrace to Robert E. Howard and a slur on his name. All three novels are basically the same. Robert Jordan has only rehashed the same plot and cliches over and over again in three separate tomes. To qualify how bad these three novels are, re read the criticism levelled against mr Jordan in the last sentence. Any Conan reader will know that the plot is always very predictable and that each novel is full of a standard set of cliches. This reflects on the new lows that Robert Jordan has succumbed to in his pathetic attempt to write on one if not the, greatest fantasy super hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't put it down. Wish I'd never picked it up.","review":"There is more chauvinistic macho-ness in this book than I've seen in a while. Some of his descriptions appear to have been written on a long night with only a Roget's and inadequate caffeine for company. One doesn't really get anything out of it, except a glance at how writers can improve a lot with time - because Jordan's Wheel of Time series is so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"My nape hairs do prickel","review":"Simply put this book is TERRIBLE. Go buy any Conan book with a Frazetta painting on it and enjoy. Put this (stuff) under the creaky step in your basement.I pray Jordan doesn't try his hand at Bond or Star Trek - oh thats right! He's too busy killing defensless trees on his endless WOT series.

The negative reviews this book has received are indicative of the latter comparison and most likely, some comparison against all other books in the genre. Some reviewers almost seem to be implying that THE CONAN CHRONICLES is a 5-star book \\"for Robert Jordan,\\" while some are saying, \\"this book is terrible.\\" I'm in the latter camp; while readable, THE CONAN CHRONICLES is pulp--predictable and repetitious beach-reading not worth re-reading or even continuing to own. My copy will end up at a used-book store.(Oh, and what IS it with Jordan and the \\"round breasts\\" bit? Jordan's women seem merely the two-dimensional product of puerile fantasy. Has he ever really KNOWN a woman? This becomes almost embarrassing after a few hundred pages.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Conan-lite","review":"After seeing the trailer for the new movie ( I have not seen the film yet) I decided to reread the classic Conan novels that I carried around in my teens and re-read constantly....only to discover they are hard to find...none at either on my local libraries and NO REH books at Barnes and Noble at All! So I checked this out instead and cannot believe how bad, boring, formulaic, and dull it is...the main thing to me is that the Man Himslef Conan does not come across as the intense ultimate bad-ass as he should....even the times when he is fighting or angry it seems kinda ho-humnothing smolders hereAvoid with extreme predjudice...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"As an avid reader of fantasy novels, this series of books was one of the biggest dissapointments ever.

Honesty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly meat and potatoes","review":"If you have picky eaters, avoid this book. I bought this because it got wonderful reviews. I wanted to make healthy meals for my toddlers. I never made a single recipe. I wish I had been able to browse through the book before I bought it. My family is used to typical American meat and potatoes type meals. I did not see much of this type of meal in the book. Many of the recipes seemed a bit gourmet for those of us used to eating basic meals. My kids wanted nothing to do with a spanish omelette, salmon fishcakes, fish in mushroom sauce, etc. There were a couple of basics like tomato sauce or macaroni and cheese, but I didn't need a toddler meal planner book to know how to cook them. This is probably a very good book, but it just didn't meet my expectations. I think I was looking more for something like Deceptively Delicious by Jessica Seinfeld (Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good recipes, but no pictures & bad layout","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this book, since everyone raves about Annabel Karmel's books.

Annabel Karmel is a recognized world author of making infant, toddler, and children's meals. It is easy to use. Breaks things down so you are only learning what you need to know for the age of child you are cooking for. She gives you important information in the beginning that was a wealth of knowledge. It wasn't too much but focused on the important stuff that everyone needs to know. Great quick reference when you are not sure about something. This book has all the recipes that you need. Once you get the hang of it you can tailor it to your own child's likes. I bought quite a few books because I wanted to make all of my own baby food. This is the one that I used. Many of the others I took to the used bookstore.

I saw it in the theater and bought it on DVD. I thought Douglas played his roll very nicely, always convincing. While its true, there is no \\"Good Guy\\" in this film, dont let it shy you from at least a rent, and possably a buy. The only thing I didnt like was that is seemed to me, it progressed a little too fast for me early on, but after the first half-hour the pace slowed a bit, and I was able to get into it quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"twisted","review":"Michael Douglas is so convincing as a cold, calculating criminal/big business man, who hatches a scheme to do away with his cheating wife. Since the other man in the picture is also quite deviant, the plot gets complicated and things don't work out as planned. The result is an intelligent thriller that will draw you into the intrigue and keep you guessing as to what will happen next. Definitely the kind of movie that can be enjoyed again and again.
