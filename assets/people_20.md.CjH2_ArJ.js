However, they have a strange \\"fake\\" taste and worst of all, they are like eating rocks - LITERALLY! Every fourth or fifth pea I tried to eat was a solid rock. I actually chipped my tooth. My dental work is going to cost me a lot more than what I saved on these. They're not that hot, either. If you like Wasabi Peas try some other brand. These are not worth the $11+ shipping.

Obviously, this movie could be used as a \\"What's Next\\" to those unfamiliar to the origins of Christianity after they have watched JESUS for the first time. It was Paul who took the banner of Christianity and stretched it into the very heart of the Roman Empire. This is an outstanding film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZ....","review":"This movie is so bad. They hit all the high points of the book of Acts but it does bring the book of Acts to life at all. The acting is mediocre, the script is terrible and they added things that they shouldn't have. I was bored and wandered off halfway through the movie.

The story was nothing special and the book isn't nearly as gruesome or gory as The Bighead or Exquisite Corpse. If you're looking for a story that's really nasty and disturbing, you may as well skip this one, and if you're looking for a novel with an intriguing plot, you should still skip this one, because overall it's just a pretty big let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly dull","review":"I bought this book based on the two previous reviews and am very disappointed - can this be the same book?!? The characters are one-dimensional, flat and boring; I couldn't get interested in what was happening to them. While violent and sexually graphic, the style of writing is limp and spiritless and is unable to provide descriptive support to the story. What should be shocking or exciting comes across as just blah (like reading a description out of a newspaper). After plowing through half of the book, I just gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda gross","review":"I didn't like this book that much. It is the literary equivalant to a snuff film.

This book was filled with them, literally filled! That earns it a zero right there.The story tried to hold onto the base of Hinduistic mythology, tenuously at best. For instance, there was no clear explanation how or why Jeff's son got caught by this serial killer. And there is no valid explanation why this kid had a boyfriend from juvie who was willing to die for him -- not enough background was given for this Shawshank style buddy-buddy relationship at all. Nope. Not at all!Because the characters where poorly developed, the story earns another minus 5.Yet the story does have its strong dramatic points. Yet, if I were to write this story, then try to sell it, it would be kicked right back in my face.So, Johnny S., here's it back in your face.

Pedestrian story aside, Shirley writes without an iota of style or subtlety. The prose is clumsy and liberally peppered with adolescent profanity usage that is distracting and dull. It's not that the content is explicit -- look at Lucy Taylor for an author who can write graphically, but with finesse. This is low-grade work.As a side note, Dorchester Publishing ought to be embarrassed to release an edition so fraught with typographical errors. The book is filled with misspellings, forgotten punctuation, etc. How about a little more care in editing, and also a more careful selection of material?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Magnificence","review":"There are certain recordings that even dated acoustics can't diminish.

Though the video/dvd probably keeps you interested longer, the CD is great for old and new Rammstein fans alike.One thing I love about this CD is that it stands out from many bands by having all original songs. Every song has its own unique sound. Songs like 'Du Reicht So Gut' (You Smell So Good) come off properly forceful and songs like 'Speil Mit Mir' (Play a game with me) come off with a creepy edge.

The double CD set is extremely hard to find but well worth it. First of all it covers the entire Rammstein concert from the DVD Live Aus Berlin and more.

Like most live CDs this one could sound a little louder. The sound level seems low for some reason. But all in all this is probably the best Rammstein CD out there!

The thrashing drums and grinding guitar work has never sounded better, and all together \\"Live Aus Berlin\\" is one of the best live albums from a metal/industrial outfit. The DVD of the same title is also strongly recommended, just as long as your not afraid of fire or any of Rammstein's other infamous live shenanigans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live album... metal opera","review":"American metal is for teenie-boppers.

My husband is 5 ft 10, and I am 5 ft 2. My husband wore this carrier on a two hour walk, and his back was in agony afterwards. I cannot wear this carrier for more than an hour, without having a sore back for the whole next day. Part of the problem is that the straps won't adjust to bring the baby higher. I see other moms with the Baby Bjorn, and their babies look so snug and comfortably high up on their chests, while my baby is swaying, and so low down that her legs are kicking against mine as I walk. My husband can usually fix anything. He is a great handyman, but we cannot get these straps to shorten. I will phone Maclaren and see what advice they can offer. If things change, I'll change my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This is the only carrier that I found approved by the JPMA. It is designed with safety and comfort in mind.

I thought that she just may not like carriers, but I bought the Bjorn and she abosolutely loves it! Now that we have used both, there are some serious differences in the way the baby is held and this carrier just does not get it done - at least for us.

Every mission all you do is capture enemy positions and blow up artillery pieces and you don't have any variety of weapons and vehicles. Not to mention the story, which is that the US and England is fighting Russia and China over the remaining oil wells, has only two characters and is very slow. And to add to that the controls suck.

I felt as if the book weren't just trying to convince me that Christianity is Jewish, but that I should be Christian. Maybe these feelings come from what I brought with me when I began this book, but Edith Schaffer approaches this topic from a /very/ Christian point of view, almost never trying to approach it from the side of a non-Christian. Though her point that Christianity comes from Judaism is well founded, she doesn't convince me that Christianity and Judaism didn't split ways centuries and millinea ago.Also, there are a number of fallacies in the book, such as the statement that Abraham only had one son or that Noah's ark was available to any who wanted on.

Far from being a \\"liberator of slaves\\", \\"savior of the nation\\", or man of peace, Lincoln is exposed as the Grandfather of Wilson and FDR, on a far more horrible internal level. Even as a child in government school, I used to wonder why Lincoln didn't vigorously sue for peace throughout the war. Now we know why. He started it, continued it, micromanaged it, and ironically, had the hero Booth not killed him, would have ethnically cleansed the country.How different would the USA be now if this monster had lived?One thing is certain, the Leviathan State starts with this evil man, and continues to this day, ever growing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyrant in disguise","review":"This is a very good book which dispels the commonly-held view of Lincoln as a great President. This man began the destruction of our Constitution which was furthered by FDR and continues more disastrously under Obama. People need to see through the hype and get to the real character of the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much new here","review":"This book summarizes the Noble Lost Cause version of the Civil War (or perhaps I should say \\"War of Northern Aggression\\"). It's perhaps significant that all the jacket blurbs are from teachers at southern colleges or right-wing columnists (or both). The war was all the fault of the North, and the South can do no wrong... all the atrocity stories are trotted out (there are five pages on the burning of Columbia, but you won't find any mention of the burning of Chambersburg or Lawrence by Confederates). Writers who disagree with his views are tarred with the brush of \\"leftism\\". The title seems to imply that we'll hear new revelations about Lincoln's iniquity, but the book's just a summary of secondary source material. On the plus side, it's clearly written and a good place to go to find a presentation of the extreme pro-Southern view of the war. But read something a bit more balanced, too (McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom is a good place to start)."},{"rating":"1","title":"How wrong can an author be????","review":"Robert Toombs the Southern fire-eater to Jefferson Davis on the eve of Ft Sumpter:\\"The firing on that fort will inaugurate a civil war greater than any the world has yet seen.

Legions now quiet will swarm out and sting us to death. It is unnecessary. It puts US in the wrong. It is fatal\\".But he fired anyway--so who started the Civil War??? Not Lincoln. Remember in his inaugural he said to the South:\\"In your hands my dissatisfied countrymen and not mine is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will NOT assail you.

As a history buff I find it interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Bias Book which tries to rewrite history!","review":"This author tries to rewrite history and probably watches Fox News religiously. Not a book written for anyone with a brain who wants to read the truth about Lincoln and his repeated documented statements and speeches against slavery. Lincoln's bravery and courageous spirit changed the face of the United States for the better. He made a choice against slavery and it was the right choice. He kept the Union together and paid the ultimate price by being murdered by an prejudice idiot.Throw this book in the trash where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The war to end slavery?","review":"I have no interest in reading this book. The author is incorrect in conveying that the civil war was fought to end slavery. The civil war was clearly fought to keep the states from seceding from the Union. Freeing the slaves was a strategic maneuver to weaken the confederate army."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Bad","review":"Easily the most incompetent work of non-fiction I've ever read. The author, Dilorenzo, is not a historian. He is an economist by training and a Libertarian gadfly.

I find this more of a right wing politically driven book than a true picture of the events and the life and decisions of President Lincoln. This is changing history to fit states rights ideals.

The only reason it gets 1 star, is that the combo box doesn't offer negative numbers.The left may attract the loonies, but the far right seems to have a magnetism for third-rate minds, (consider the rulers of the Third Reich). The states right Dilorenzo is so eager to defend were built round the assumption that it was OK for one human being to own another. Sorry, human rights come before states rights. This book is simply another in the long dreadful line, that says its OK to be horrible to people different from the writer, because, according to the writer, they aren't really people (cause they aren't like them).Frankly, don't buy this, and I'd rather hope my profile doesn't give me any similar recommendations in the future"},{"rating":"1","title":"An \\"uneccassary\\" war?","review":"If I recall I believe that it was the South that fired the first shot of the civil war at Fort Sumter, not the North. And as regards Lincoln's suspension of Habeus Corpus, and violation of the Constitution, I would reply as Julius Caesar did. \\"War does not allow for free speech.\\" This is simply axiomatic. The United States violated this rule in Vietnam and paid a steep price for it. Luckily they learned it for the Gulf War. This whole book is ludicrous and filled with a bunch of crazy nonsense that any serious student of Lincoln should disregard. A more balanced study of Lincoln reveals that he was America's greatest president, a man of genius and massive erudition on Constitutional Law as well as having a deep compassion for mankind. Like Winston Churchill Lincoln can truly be said to have been \\"the man who saved the world.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern Bias","review":"It seems that the author of the book has a strong hatred towards Lincoln and the North. The author seems to appease the southern view of the civil war quite well as the War of Northern Agression. The Author was also born and and raised in the south. He was probably brought up with a strong hatred against Lincoln and other great heros like General Sherman. The Author clearly left out Lincolns reconstruction policies that would bring back the south with open arms and his childhood being rasied in pro-southern society. It seems that most of the praise about this book comes from the readers from the south. Even after 137 years there is strong hatred to a great president and states that he represented. I strongly suggest read Lincoln: The Man Behind the myths if you truely want to know the real Lincoln."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking!","review":"If you dont know much about Honest Abe other than the Gettysburg adress, emancipation, so on..... this is an absolute MUST READ!!

It distorts the historical record about the reasons for secession. It also misleads and distorts the facts about Lincoln's motivations. It calls him a racist when his actual views on race were very complex and more advanced than most of the people of his time. The book is worse than useless because of the many distortions and misrepresentations."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not a balanced treatment of the subject","review":"The book is not a balanced treatment of Lincoln's place in American history.If you want to find out everything negative about Abraham Lincoln, this book is the place to look. However,it is not a balanced treatment of the subject and you will find almost nothing that conflicts with the author's viewpoint, even though there is substantial contradictory information available. For instance it faults Lincoln for not arranging for gradual emancipation of slaves but does not give him credit for the tremendous effort that he made for compensated emancipation. This omission is astonishing, because some of Lincoln's most famous quotes come from his congressional message in support of compensated emancipation. Overall the book is just a rant. It is not a scholarly contribution to the works on Lincoln."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas DiLorenzo is biased and ignorant of U.S. history","review":"I have been studying President Abraham Lincoln for nearly forty (40) years and have a firm understanding of the times in which Lincoln lived in this life. Thomas DiLorenzo does not have a thorough understanding of Abraham Lincoln and ignores much evidence that proves DiLorenzo wrong and inaccurate. It seems that Thomas DiLorenzo had his ideas and his slant on Lincoln and Civil War times decided on before writing his book. I do NOT recommend DiLorenzo's book. If you want to read ACCURATE information about President Abraham Lincoln, I suggest that you start with LINCOLN by David Herbert Donald, WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE by Stephen Oates, and ABRAHAM LINCOLN: A BIOGRAPHY by Benjamin Thomas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decidedly provocative","review":"I think that the importance of books about well exposed historical figures is to make us rethink their role in history.

Despite the slander and nuisance reviews from both slants, read the book. I highly recommend it as a civil war buff. History should be done without generlisations, and I think Dilorenzo's method of getting to the presuppositions of history makes it startling for a culture who fancies in being told what to think than looking at the facts with a critical lense. After all, all facts are interpretted facts. You be the judge. A book that will clearly be here for posterity sake, despite the institutionlisation of American education.

The book appears to have been written by someone whose intent in writing the book was to discredit Lincoln and then searched for enough material to cherry-pick the negative and pseudo-negative episodes in his life to emphasize the dark side of the man. Could Lincoln have prevented the Civil War? Possibly -- but probably not, and if so, at what cost to his Presidency and the Union? At best, the outset of war might have been delayed, but that's all. What is lacking in DiLorenzo's analysis is an honest understanding of the Southern mindset for a good 50 years before 1860. DiLorenzo's claims fly in the face of contrary views of dozens of respected scholars and authors who saw Lincoln in an entirely different light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we have less than one star?","review":"So Thomas Dilorenzo writes that BAD Abe Lincoln was the cause of the Civil War, oops, I mean the War Against the Invading North. Only one problem here, the secession started BEFORE Lincoln was in office. But facts never stood in the way of the \\"Lost Cause\\" folks, a.k.a. flat earthers. By the way Dilorenzo, why didn't the south negotiate a peaceful means to remain in the United States (that's right it was then and still is now the United States thanks to Pres. Lincoln)?What really galls me is how many of these flat earthers are the same ones who tell others that if they don't like this country, then they should leave! There are so many people wishing they had a country like America, and here we have so many wishing that their ancestors had taken them out of the U.S.Well, I proudly fly my flag and last I checked, the U.S. has a free exit door, so God Bless America Mr. Dilorenzo and don't let the door hit you on the way out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas J.

What scares me is that the general public may choose this work as the first Lincoln book read and take it for gospel truth. I've always advocated that any opinion about Lincoln is best formed, for one, after reading several books about him. I've been studying Lincoln since 1969. He is one of those historical personalities that those with specific agendas and causes use to promote them- most of the time without any factual basis for doing so.

If one reads Lincoln's own writings one easily sees through the overt agenda of Dilorenzo; one that should be denounced for the pitiful piece of clap-trap masquerading as research.There are too many records of the handwringing Lincoln went through over comitting to war and his committment to emancipation.

He cherry picks. If your ignorant about Lincoln you will fall for this book. The Kansas-Nebraska act is very important. So is Lincoln's reply to the Dred Scott case. Neither one are mentioned in these books more than one or two lines. If you knew the truth about what Lincoln stated on just these two subjects, you would know DiLorenzo takes Lincoln out of context or doesn't mention things that make him look good. Carl Sandburg made more out of Lincoln than he was - Almost as if he was a god. Lincoln was no god. We do need books that tell both sides. This book only tells the bad side of Lincoln, but he is taken out of context.

Many times a contemporary or revised view can really shed light on the true nature of things; this is not one of those cases. Clearly Mr. Dilorenzo, although well researched and well intentioned in many areas was clearly trying to shock people by uncovering the legend of Lincoln. It is true that Lincoln was indeed a politican in every sense of the word but to say that Lincoln is the cause of the Civil War is completely irresponsible. One can simply look back throughout the annals of American History from the Consititution to the Kansas-Nebraska Act and finally to Sumter and it is clear Lincoln's 'secret seizure of federal power' is not the reason the conflict arose. To call the Civil War a play for power by Lincoln is pure fantasy and this book should be regarded as that; fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great research and insight","review":"This is the best book on Lincoln I have read.

Even if the two separate countries made it to the 1900's what would WW1 and WW2 have been like, what about the great depression? The look back over the history between now and back then clearly shows the wisdom in Lincoln's decision.

Do a few searches online to see that he is not a credible scholar. He traffics his ideas mainly to extremist groups in the South. Visit the wikipedia sources at the bottom of his entry.

Slavery would have fallen by the way side (peacefully) as it did in every other country that abolished it.

He was an old-line Henry Clay Whig, in favor of banks, internal improvements, and protective tariffs. DiLorenzo is correct in this. Lincoln was absolutely a Federalist. Other Federalists: a couple guys you may have heard of named George Washington and Alexander Hamilton. If you want to make a case against the Federalists, that's OK. It's also OK to re-examine the lives of our cultural icons; there should be no sacred cows. But DiLorenzo so distorts Lincoln's record that it absolutely fails as a biography of Lincoln.In short, read this if you like, but be prepared to be lumped in with the 9/11 \\"truthers\\" and Holocaust deniers if you try to use any of the arguments contained herein."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Lincolnby DiLorenzo","review":"This is without a doubt the best book available that enables one to understand why and how the federal government has taken advantage of the people of this country and built(unlawfully) just what Jefferson had feared.

Numerous other negative reviews detail the text's numerous technical inaccuracies, and there is no point covering that ground again. I find it difficult to call this work a history. It contains no new information of consequence, and reflects no meaningful original research. Its conclusions are based on assumptions that are in many cases fallacious, and it advances its \\"interpretation\\" by setting up absurd \\"straw man\\" cases and then \\"proving\\" its point by knocking them down. In consequence, it offers no genuine insight into the period.

It is interesting, though, to see so many other reviewers calling the author a neo-conservative (or worse) -- assuming it seems that he must be some extremist with views opposite their own. If you read the book you see he is anti-war and pro-civil liberty, and in the book he often criticizes neo-conservatives for what he sees as their pro-war and anti-civil liberty philosophy.

But this book became tiresome to read with 'waterfall of nonsense' attacking Lincoln every step---I was shocked it was an academic that wrote it.I see that the author wrote a second one to this--I browsed it at Borders--it looked like a rehash"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read other books on this subject.","review":"If you read this book, I would suggest that you do some homework and check the validity of it's contents. Read other books, do some research and then judge this book.It's easy to misinterpret and misrepresent history and this book does a lot of that.I've wrote before to stay away from this book, but as like any book, read it and come up with your own conclusions and opinions. Realize that this book was written with an agenda to find anything negative about Abraham Lincoln, and through his acts of picking out random quotes, taking quotes out of context, and \\"fudging\\" facts, DiLorenzo does a good job of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionism !!!","review":"Lincoln among many others both of the north and south, thought that the impending war was going to be short. Certainly not the long bloody conflict that was the Civil War. One of the reasons that the war was so bloody was because the tools of warfare were far ahead of strategy and the means to care for and aid the wounded was still in the middle ages. If indeed slavery was going to end by its own accord, this must not have been known to the supporters of slavery, for why make an issue of wanting slavery to extend to new territories ???Jeff Davis said that he wish he could have exercised some the powers that Lincoln did, such as suspension of habeas corpus.The southern states were a bunch a selfish fiefdoms and that caused them the war. You bitter eager critics of Lincoln, he realized what was needed to win the conflict and he did what was necessary to win it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain wrong","review":"I agree, the guy seems to have an ax to grind.Lincoln's hagiographers didn't do much service to history, what you need is a balanced, scholarly account, not a partisan political treatise. Read David Herbert Donald's biography: there you can better understand president Lincoln."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies fabrication and tomfoolery","review":"The base argument ehre is that a peaceful settlement to the civil war was possible. Which peaceful settlement would that hve been? The peaceful settlement when the COnfederates fired on Ft. Sumner or was it the peaceful settlement that would have allowed Slavery to exist? Was it the peaceful settlement that would allow states to suceed from the union any time they wanted? This books argument is wrong and the idea is nonsense. Any true student of the Civil war knows that the war, once Lincoln was elected, was inevitable. Regardless if you support the South or think the war was a catastrophe(it was) it doesn't mean you can just re-write history and decide it didn't need to happen. This book is almost as realistic as claiming that America didn't need to enter WWII.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its commentary, not history.","review":"This book reads like its falls somewhere between the Dixiecrat pages of \\"Southern Partisan\\" magazine and the leftist historic revisionism of Pravda. Far from being an objective historian, Dilorenzo writes with a huge chip on his shoulder. Slogging through this nausiating diatribe, the reader begins to wonder just what personal slight a man who's been dead for over 130 years could have done to fill the author with such anger. DiLorenzo just can't seem to find anything good to say about Lincoln, or America for that matter. (He and Sean Penn should get together.) The book reads like another one of those consipracy theories. Every little problem we have today is all Lincoln's fault, or so DiLorenzo says, and according to the author, there is plenty of material to back this harebrained claim up. Unfortunatly most of the works he cites are from both far left and far right fringe writers, commentators, and revistionist historians. As the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage.","review":"Throughout this book, DiLorenzo purposefully misleads the reader by misquoting Lincoln and other sources, completely neglecting context, and leaving out vital information to understanding the truth. DiLorenzo has one objective in this book: convincing the reader that Lincoln is pure evil. He doesn't care what he has to say, he doesn't care if he prints the truth; all he cares about is that the reader agrees with him.Anyone with a basic understanding of the Civil War and 19th Century America could riddle the pages with counterpoints disproving virtually EVERY SINGLE point that DiLorenzo makes. I wouldn't exaggerate; Dilorenzo flat-out lies constantly, and if he isn't intentionally lying, he is incredibly misguided on the issues discussed. PLEASE do yourself a favor and avoid this book. If you're being forced to read this for a class, I beg that you question his points and think critically about the topics because this book is full of extreme propaganda. It is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good History","review":"For a solid review of the book and its many inaccuracies see [...] The book is faulted for a poor understanding of the history of the Civil War era, numerous historical errors, and misquotations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Real Biography","review":"I agree with the last two reviewers. The \\"facts\\" can be molded or shaped to fit any agenda. This is clearly what has happened here. Revisionist history at its worst. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE for serious political and history students","review":"In this book, the author states that any serious study of American government should start no earlier than 1865. Lincoln radically changed our nation's form of government, and many of the problems we are faced with today are a direct result of his destruction of states' rights and powers. His actions precipitated a war that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and forever placed the iron boot of national government on the States' necks. This book neatly explains Mr Lincoln's views on race and his not so secret desire to remove blacks, free or otherwise, out of America. This book does a good job of getting to the real causes of the War Against the South, and starts to chip away at the whitewashing Lincoln has received since his death. You've been fed the victor's side of the history of this war in the school system, now take a look at the other side that is never discussed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Lincoln","review":"If you what to know the real Lincoln then this is a must read. It tells why the civil war was started and that it was ready not needed to settle the matter about slavery. It tell how and why West Virgina came into being a state ,it was not by the will of the people. So much of what happened then was all because of Lincoln wanting it to happen that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this.","review":"Yuri Temirkanov is one of the most controversial russian conductors. His performances are unpredictable,so you can love some of his readings when he is \\"in the mood\\" and hate the rest. His Tchaikovsky is oftenbizarre, mannered and even perverse. This album is an excellent sample of these statements. They areweird and underplayed performances, with absurd rubatos that ruin the score and make the music sound uglyand affected. This is not Tchaikovsky, for my taste. Avoid this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and user-friendly.","review":"Chileans must be happy to have such a nice, well-organised bird guide: many countries lack one. The illustrations are good: I particularly like the seabird plates (which also show the birds sat on the water), and have uploaded one to give you some idea.

No way to keep it from leaning to the side. I have 2 other tower fans with remote, they are Lasko and are a far superior product. Also, packaging on the delivered box said it could be returned to the store, and we have Target in this area, so I took it to the store. They had no clue how to return it, were not interested in helping, and so my rating for customer service is 0. Amazon always makes return easy....Target EH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"waste of money. It came with no screws. We tried to get the required size but they weren't carried by the local hardwares..including Home Depot and Lowes.

If we still had the box we would send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby","review":"The fan is pretty good. Not too noisy, and puts out good quantities of air. The only reason I rank it 4 instead of 5 is because the 1st fan didn't work...which I wouldn't have minded, except I had sent it as a gift. Oops. 2nd one works perfectly though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than my old one","review":"I assembled the Aloha this morning and am very happy with it so far.

Then I realize that the sound is my new fan. The first night I went back to sleep, but the second night I got up and turned it off. I think I'm going to have to return it.

The gap was large and the book was a wonderful help.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this CD!","review":"If you have an adolescent, you NEED this CD (or if you prefer, the book which has more detail). At this point, this is my hands down FAVORITE resource for adolescent-parenting issues. I consider it the adolescent \\"bible\\" and it has saved me from losing it many times. As I said, the book has more detail, but the CD is a great summary and for those who don't process information from a book well, a life-saver. I would recommend the CD for the car and the book for the bedside! Easy to read, \\"easy\\" to implement (if any thing is easy with an adolescent)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining book on today's teenagers","review":"This book is entertaining, but I can't say that I agree with what I view as its basic premise, which is that all is well as long as one's spoiled, vulgar, misbehaving child doesn't end up a criminal. I think we must still demand that kids treat parents with respect, and that consequences for misbehavior or not following through on commitments must be enforced. The one section I did find very insightful was the part on how to help a kid change his study habits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pesimism In Disguise","review":"The title of this book caught my attention, and the first couple of chapters made sense. However, I found that most of the advice offered boils down to imposing limits with the knowledged that teens are going to do whatever they want. His general approach seems to be for parents to accept what their children do instead of insisting on good behavior. His dialog is engaging and even funny at times. He doesn't offer much hope or constructive problem solving though. The cursing in the book was offensive to me as well, and that type of language would never be tolerated in our home. Acceptance of it as inevitable is unacceptable to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful & Helpful Suggestions for Parents","review":"Wolf uses humorously portrays adolescent behavior offering insight and helpful suggestions for parents. He describes adolescents, explains what they do and why and addresses what it means to be the parent of a teenager. I've got to admit that it not only alleviated my guilt for not being a perfect mother, it helped me to understand that making mistakes helped my children to BUILD self-esteem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Language Unnecessary","review":"This book was recommended to me. It has a lot of good ideas about understanding and dealing with teenagers. However I was very distressed by the use of bad language throughout the book. It was used while quoting \\"typical\\" teenage responses to parents, but it still is unnecessary. I am a teacher. I don't allow that language from my teenagers at home, from my students, or from the adults I work & associate with when they are talking to me. I certainly don't need to read that kind of language in my parenting materials. The more we accept bad language in our media, the more of it we will hear. It is something we do not have to tolerate. Because of the language, I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"filthy","review":"I was shocked by the condition of this used book. There was coffe stains on the pages. The cover literally had food or something stuck to it. I had to use cleaning products on it to wipe off the crap on the cover and back.

I was a bit afraid to use the book not know what other germs could be on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book to read to try to understand your teenage daughter or son","review":"This book is great to calm you down and to give you explanations about your children's transformation into a \\"normal horrible\\" teenager. It helped me put back some humor and perspective on the whole situation. The rationale behind the behavior helps you understand what is going on during this growth period and even though it does not give you a magic wand, you can avoid falling into the fights and arguments with your daughter so easily. Also it reassures you that it is important to set rules and that they need and want the rules and limits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful, but Extremely Offensive Language","review":"I found this book very helpful in putting the trials and tribulations of raising teens in perspective. I now view my son's new independence with pride and understanding rather than sadness and concern. I also feel better prepared for handling future issues in a supportive and mature way.The only problem I had with this book was its extremely offensive language. I \\"get it\\" that Wolfe was trying to present an honest representation of teenagers. But I think he's off target. If any teenager I know spoke to an adult in the nasty and disrespectful way that he presents as \\"normal\\", they would be in DEEP trouble - it simply is not tolerated. I find it hard to believe that any teen is allowed to speak to parents using the \\"F\\" word and would rather not have to read it, myself. I almost trashed the book several times due to the repeated use of nasty language and feel the book would have been more effective if cleaned up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for every child!","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child.

To learn the photoshop basics go get the Classroom in a book series by Adobe. After you know the basics this book then adds considerably.

Overall a very good bok on Photoshop if youwant to use it on your photos. This book is not for you if you want deep and detailed explanation on each command and filter in Photoshop.

The built in ruler is reversible for English or metric measurement. It also is adjustable for declination. A separate ruler/scale is included to allow you to determine Lat/Long on maps as well.

Put in other terms, the work is done more in the organized spirit of the symphonic form. The last movement methodically works a central theme, but you always have Glazunov's brillant orchestration, which some have said exceeds that of Rimsky-Korsakov. The whole Naxos series, by the way, offers great value when one considers, price, audio qualities (Naxos is a large company that afford the techical expertise.) and the performance of the conductor and his orchestra. On a value basis, I would add the fifth star to my rating.

Prior to this I used DeLorme Street Atlas USA which was a better product but not updated for OS X.Route 66 has a confusing interface and forces you to do trip routing their way instead of doing it your way. However once you learn their way the software becomes quite usable. The routing interface needs work.The aquafied buttons, while very pretty, aren't very intuitive.The Appearance and quality of the maps are excellent.The speed of the program while not optimal, is usable(15\\" PB 1.5Ghz, 1GB RAM).I have high hopes for this software. Hopefully the developer will realize that the Mac market is starving for this kind of thing and Apple's notebook sales are going to continue to create more demand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the next version","review":"This is a great idea for a product for the Mac, and these guys could own an entire category on the Mac platform without any competitors, but sadly the products quality and design is very poor. It is if they designed the product cheaply knowing there was no competition, vs. making a killer product knowing there was no competition so they could own the segment.Anyway, wait for the next version, assuming it is better.

I should have kept my money.The entire program is awfully slow on my PowerBook. I can't believe how long it takes to zoom or scroll. No really, it's slower than what you're imagining right now.The user interface is very confusing and clunky. They need to read up on Mac user interface standards.The GPS interface seems to be a 2nd thought. You can't add waypoints with GPS coordinates. The program doesn't update your itinerary as you progress along. All it does it draw your position on the map. That's it. Never mind vocal turn-by-turn directions.Outdated maps! Holy cow. It's missing roads, and old roads are still there. It wouldn't be so bad if you could plan routes where the roads should be, but the program restricts you to the roads in it's database. It makes route planning on new roads impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishing for something useful","review":"This product is terrible.

As a matter of fact, I find that naming it \\"2004\\" is very misleading. There are areas of this city that have been developed for over five years that do not appear on this program. In addition, many streets are incorrectly named, do not exist in the manner that this program shows them to, or both. On a daily basis I have to use MapQuest to find the actual routes when my drivers call to inform me that this program is again incorrect.

I'm sure Canadians would want the same if they want to use this and not have to install US info unless they want to. Could be made simpler and faster intuitive locate of streets. I don't need every thing that says San Antonio like a bake shop when I am looking for the city map of San Antonio or just a street. 2005 is almost over and I don't see any updates on their website.

In 1992-4 I made trips to the East coast and visited most of the original fighting grounds and read and watched the material presented at those historical sites. It was touching how they tried to include minorities of ALL persuasions as standout heroes in the struggles. This and the total lack of academic accuracy was insulting and led me to question many of the few details that seemed familiar. I watched the first 3 episodes twice to be fair and invested the time to check the details I wrote down, I can honestly say, wait for it to come out in a \\"classic comic\\" since it is likely to be a more interesting story and have more detail and accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"For beginners only...","review":"A nice overview for those who know little or nothing about American history.

Lots of other programs out there that get the story right, with credible and believable historians to help tell America's story. Maybe too big of a project? Too hard to keep the PC'ers away? I recommend a 'pass' on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"While the production is clean and tight, hearing history from 'rock stars' and actors is pretty pathetic. When I saw this on TV, the irony I noticed was that the commercials from the sponsor had HISTORIANS in it and the documentary had actors, musicians and others who know nothing about history, but would attract the 12 year olds that don't know anything about history anyway.

My absolute biggest beef with all of these type shows including the Discovery channel is that they treat us all as ADD (attention deficit disorder) patients by constantly flashing scenes so fast before your eyes that you cannot possible enjoy them, to say nothing of the dizziness, vertigo, and anxiety they cause. They are a bunch of phaggot video editors who hide filming mistakes by flashing them sometimes as many as 4 scenes in one second, (perhaps more). I appreciate fine art and fine video, but this series is typical of Hollywood's ADD style of keeping your eye glued to the set. I actually have to turn my head sometimes and it makes me mad to watch it. So I wouldn't have bought this series had I known how flashy it was. I've stopped watching TV for that reason.

How does the maximum range compare with an average shot?I mention \\"cheap\\" and this is obvious every minute. The same animations are repeated countless of times and the show is bloated with repetitions to artificially extend the length without actually producing additional footage.The problem with this video and with so many other science or history shows released these days is the following: the producers considers us, the audience, as a bunch of easily wowed idiots with no critical thinking whatsoever.

I can see Neil Armstrong (Modern Day space pioneer), GEN Colin Powell, Giuliani and Bloomberg since they actual worked on behalf of the country. But the authors like Balducci (not a historian) and all the movie stars and music artists detract from the story. I don't hate these people I just don't think they represent real America in the least.

I am using it as the History curriculum for a Homeschool student and he is really gaining a lot of knowledge from it, being able to do projects and assignments that I make & relate to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for younger viewers","review":"I found this to grab the attention of my viewers (high school students). This wasn't full of stuffy interviews in front of volumes of books. Yes, the interviewees are celebrities but that does not mean they know nothing about the issues and it does help keep students' interest. These are people they know, at times they were interested just to see who the next interviewee would be. The footage and senarios were extremely relevant great use of CGI and narratives. This is an excellent supplement to a US history or Government course.Entertaining and interesting... what high school kids are looking for. Great Review Tool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"History brought to life, and much easier to understand. The only history lesson I haven't slept through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for any teachers teaching social studies","review":"I use several clips from this DVD for my social studies lesson with 3rd-5th graders... It's engaging, historically accurate and educational. Much better than other historical films that are often dry. It includes a diverse historically significant figures that are sometime forgotten in the text book. LOVE this DVD series. I enjoy watching it in my own time too. A must have for any teachers from elementary to high school teaching social studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Margaret Cho?","review":"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was very disappointed with this documentary. It could be that the scope of the project was just too much to do it justice, but several major parts of the \\"story of us\\" were missing including the Constitutional Convention, the War of 1812, and the First World War just to name a few.I also thought that the selection of commentators was extremely poor. Seriously, why was Margaret Cho, who is of Korean decent, chosen to speak about the immigrant Chinese laborers who worked on the trans-continental railroad? It's almost as if she was selected because she \\"looked\\" Chinese and therefore credible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Why, oh why, did they feel the need to have hollywood celebrities, who know nothing of anything, bring commentary to this documentary? I expected historians, archaeologists, and professors, and instead they ruined this show with celebrities who contribute nothing to program in terms of knowledge or expertise. I couldn've been on this show for all that was worth, but I'm not famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as bad as sitting through History class!","review":"Because I didn't know any better back then, History was my least favorite subject in school. I had no interest whatsoever. However, now that I am older and have a better, wider understanding of the world, I love history! I am not a buff by ANY means, and have forgotten far more than I care to think about. So when I saw commercials for this, I was VERY excited, thinking that a history lesson in a narrative format would be excellent. I don't have cable/satellite/dish/whatever, so as soon as the DVD release date was available, I pre-ordered it. I was so excited to finally receive it! That excitement lasted 30 minutes, at best.This was so boring that I quickly fell asleep. Try as I might, I could not hold my eyes open. And the digital animation was TERRIBLE! I think my teenage sister could do a better job.Perhaps one day I'll take it off the shelf and give it another try. After a few cups of coffee and/or energy drinks so I can stay awake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"Love this series- beautifully filmed and well done. They summarize the key events in each major era of our history and it feels like a history book come to life. I'll be using these episodes with my 7th grade US History students this year- they're perfect in length to show an entire episode in a class period and I know my middle schoolers will find them interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"escape from death row","review":"It a real great record, everybody should go out and buy it, so Tupac and Suge will not be forgot for banging the west side\\" Nino 96\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Start\\" touch pad","review":"Only 3 months after 2 yr warranty expired, my \\"Start\\" touchpad will NOT work.

Recently, it started smelling like there might be wires melting inside, too. These problems could be just this one, though.The other issue is that despite all the claims of even cooking, it is not even as good as our previous cheap microwave was. That one, we donated to Good Will after around 14 years of use. It was still working at the time we donated it.Keep looking, if you want a really great microwave.Ours died after almost 4 years as compared to 14 from a no-name brand.

I can only guess that the device that senses whether the door is open or closed broke. Got a nice Amana 1.0 Cubic FT Stainless through Sears (looks like the Kenmore except with a stainless look alike plastic handle (The Amana is very attractive and would have been a home run if they had given the handle a stainless front instead of stainless look alike plastic). Saved shipping by having the Amana delivered to the Sears store. Panasonic used to be one of the best mass market microwaves. I am guessing that the bean counters (accountants) asked the engineers to come up with a new part that is breaking and should be recalled at least on this model. This particular microwave is made in Shanghai China."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book and the other ones in this series are the coolest!","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!It was so good.

The occasional typo is understandable with the transition from paper to electronic. You'll find entire sections deleted and inserted in other places. Words inserted into the middle of other words. There were only a few spots where I really had to stop and think hard to figure out what was going on but that really breaks you out of the immersion when it happens. I'm giving this a 4 star rating because I don't feel right punishing the authors for amazons screw ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!!!","review":"Extremely wonderful, as with the entire series. We get to see more of Alfred here, which is good; predictably, Chelestra is just as well-conceived and fascinating as Arianus, Pryan, and Abaraach. You MUST read this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy in Paperback and Save Yourself a Headache","review":"Before I go into the negative, I'd like to mention that I would give the novel itself five stars, hands down. Like the rest of the series, it is well written, complex, and an absolutely phenomenal read.That being said, the Kindle download of this book was shot to hell. With obvious (and sometimes confusing) typos in just about every single freaking paragraph, it was obvious that there was no attempt to review or edit after the translation to digital. I am ashamed to have paid money for this garbage, and am definitely buying the rest of the books in paperback to save myself the frustration of trying to figure out what what the authors had actually written. I've come to accept a certain amount of errors in my Kindle downloads and can ignore them for the most part, but this was absolutely unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh???","review":"Oh where oh where have the real authors gone oh where oh where can they be?

The whole thing was about 3 little girls who kept messing everything up. A little dwarf, elf and human.

(They could have made this series about 5 books instead of 7 if they took out this useless bumbling fool, and the hundred's of pages dedicated to him.)

I'm not faulting the soundtrack in any way, I just found it fascinating to hear the references cue in at the following times:00:00 - 00:10, you hear Kingdom of Heaven's Track 10 \\"Battle of Kerak\\" (00:00 - 00:10)~1:15 - 1:30, you hear Kingdom of Heaven's Track 09 \\"The King\\" (~3:35 - 3:50)None of this detracts from the brilliant score, and I actually love both soundtracks for their richness and scope. Harry Gregson-Williams has done a great job with the Narnia soundtrack and it's definitely worth adding to your collection if you love film scores."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD is USELESS if you can't play it!!!","review":"This CD is as useless as all the cheerleader comments on it (probably posted by paid shills). The FACT is that this CD is useless as anything other than a coaster if you can't play it and listen to the music you paid good money for.

I was looking for a book for a young boy (4)who recently lost his father to Leukemia. This book might be good for young children who are very angry and going through the extreme emotions that can happen with a loss like this, but the boy I wanted to give this to is not having such extreme emotions. He is sad, as can be expected, and misses his Dad, but he's not acting out in anger or \\"mad at the world\\", as the boy in this book. Maybe this would be better suited to someone who had more of a sudden loss, and isn't coping well emotionally. It just wasn't right for the situation in my case. Overall, I felt it was too negative, and just not the right choice for someone who is already coping with a loss in a healthy way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everett Anderson's Goodbye","review":"I ordered this book to read with children in my school who are dealing with the death of a loved one. It is a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A playful Van is a memorable Van","review":"Though it was recorded in about nine minutes and Linda Gail Lewis isn't always able to figure out Van's phrasing, (yeah, like you could) this is nonetheless Van's most engaging album in ages. Freed of the burden of having to come up with another set of lyrics about how swell God is and how much everybody since 1970 has ripped him off or lied about him, he simply delights in singing the music of his heroes. He is clearly having a grand time here, the band is tight but never showy, and Ms. Lewis is absolutely the Killer's sister. For those who found a lot of joy in Van's previous forays into tributes and genre exercises, this one's for you. By the way, Linda Gail Lewis recorded a smokin' album of duets with Jerry Lee back in '68 that stands as the greatest country duet album of all time. I believe it's only available as part of \\"The Locust Years\\" box set, but it's worth the high price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent exploration of roots rock.","review":"It's always interesting to hear artists talk about their influences. Here, Van Morrison pays tribute to the music that turned him on to rock and roll by doing a duet (several actually) with the sister of one of rocks creators.It may not be the contemplative music you normally hear from Van Morrison, but it wasn't intended to be. It is nothing more than a collection of songs played by a musician having fun. It is nothing less than great. Anyone who complains about the country feel just doesn't understand where rock and roll came from. Thankfully, Van Morrison does."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCKIN MORRISON","review":"I think Van Morrison shows us where his (and many of todays top rock recorders) real roots stem from. Rockabilly was here a long time before Van was popular and he uses some of the feelings and boogy that made the great ones great. I really liked it, and if you let yourself be open to other types of music,I think you might too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I got this cd last year against the advice of the other reviewers and am sorry I did. I truly tried to like it-listened many times thinking it just needed to grow on me, but it couldn't. I have very ecclectic tastes in music, but Linda Gail's overly twangy/country nasal/harsh voice is just too much to bear. This might have been good as a solo effort, or even as a duet with a different voice, but it will never be played again in my house the way it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Show Fo' Van Mo","review":"This is a fun album and the songs Van chose are rich with heart. My roommate and I were jamming to \\"Pedro\\" and \\"Cadillac\\" last night. However, the real quality of the album is questionable. Linda Gail's vocals, though enjoyable, aren't assertive enough to keep up with Van's and The Pokers sound cheeesy. Van himself gives an unremarkable performance. Usually Van Mo's covers are as touching as the origials. \\"Jesse James\\" and \\"Irene\\" off SKIFFLE were enough to make me ball. The only touching moment on this album that I've found in my few short days of listening is where Van says \\"make up your G.D. mind\\" on \\"Pedro\\". It sounds like he really meant it.

Van Morrison ranks in my book as one of the the all-time greats, but I don't understand his need to do this C.D. The concept is good, Van doing some old rockabilly, fifties tunes, but where & why does Gail Lewis come in? If Van felt the need to do something with a female singer, why not his daughter? My guess is he owed Jerry Lee a favor of some kind. Do yourself a favor, take the money that you were going to spend on this and buy Emmylou Harris's new one--\\"Red Dirt Girl\\", you'll have the best C.D. of 2000, instead of the worst!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Show Fo' Van Mo","review":"I'm not sure what to make of Van Mo's latest.

I purchased it based solely on the fact that I am a Van Morrison fan. Well, I should have managed a way to hear it once before buying it. I love duets but I don't feel that Lewis and Morrison's voices meld at all. It has a poor quality honkey tonk sound to it. Also, it has a County Western feel to it.

The music is predictable, given that he teams up with Jerry Lee Lewis's sister (roots rockers, including tunes by Hank Williams, John Lee Hooker, & Lewis himself). Although she certainly inherited her brother's ability on piano, Linda Gail Lewis's voice is unexceptional, bordering on irritating. And the combination of the two voices certainly doesn't work. If you're looking for this type of music, you'd be much better off going with Jerry Lee himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Win Again","review":"I am a big Van Morrison fan and I was soooo disappointed with this CD.

It is hard to have 2 singers singing lead at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"going through the motions...","review":"I had to respond after reading the last review. Who are you kidding? If anyone's phrasing and tempo have made in impossible to harmonize with it is Van's. Look, Van has been one of the most emotive and inspired singer/songwriters of the last 30 years, but recording duets with Van at this point in his career is simply a bad idea. The duets he did with his daughter on \\"Days Like This\\" had the same problems - two vocalists with different phrasing, intonation, and execution. It almosts hurts to listen to it. I love him dearly, and Linda's efforts are admirable, but I'll stick with Moondance and Astral Weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Is Van just tired?

These are songs that Van grew up listening to from his father's record collection. Songs are written by his idols, including Hank Williams, John Lee Hooker and other musicians and songwriters from his childhood. The only Van Morrison original is No Way Pedro, a really fun track that sounds like a slice of rockabilly from the 50s.Linda Gail Lewis has a great voice and blends in with Van almost perfectly. She also play a mean killer boogie woogie piano and is quite talented in her piano solos.I would recommend this disc for anybody who is a fan of 50s or 60s rockabilly, C&W or blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Youth Sweatpants","review":"It came without a package and they were dirty.

Mixed in with that, as is done in all movies, are various pieces which set particular moods and change the tempo or feeling of the story. This album seems to be composed of only those little pieces.

It lasted 10+years and made decent coffee, but sounded like an airplane when it ground the beans. We replaced it with a Melita Mill and Brew which worked good for 3 years until the lid clasp broke off. Then we were given this for Christmas. They still haven't quitted it down. One of the first things we liked about the Melita was that it was quitter and easier to clean because the grounds stay in one place.We probably could have lived with the airplane noise, but the coffee was bad. It was very weak. Three different people made coffee with it and none of it was any good. We made about 10 different pots and one was OK. There isn't enough room for the grounds and many of the grounds stayed in the grinder. We would empty the basket and the top of the grounds were still dry. There are plenty of other grind and brews out there don't waste your time, money or coffee with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Much like everyone else, I had high hopes that were soon dashed after the first couple times using the unit.1) The grinder doesn't hold enough beans2) You must use the \\"strong\\" setting to get a decent strength brew3) Cleanup is a pain and must be done everytime. Seems like the beans might be getting too humid when stored in the grinder overnight4) The grinder sends grounds down a chute that gets clogged up easy5) It sounds like a jet aircraft when it starts grindingIf I had anything decent to say, it woudl be that if you grind separately, and use the \\"strong\\" setting, it works OK as a standard drip maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poor execution","review":"When I saw this in the store, I thought it was a great idea. Waking up to a pot of coffee, made with freshly ground beans, seemed lovely. Unfortunately, this machine does not brew coffee worth being excited about in the morning.My primary complaint is that the grinding chamber is too small. You can't put enough beans in there to make a full pot of decent strength. Compounding this problem is the fact that the machine seems to make very weak coffee anyway (even without using the grind feature). As other reviewers have also mentioned, the grinder is extraordinarly loud. I didn't mind the noise but if you have late risers in your household, they will hate waking up to that sound.Another aspect of this machine that I've realized I dislike is not being able to select my grind. This is not exactly a fault of the machine but something to consider if you're particular about the grind of your beans. I've happily gone back to my seperate grinder and my old Krups machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy when grinding","review":"The coffee maker makes an incredible amount of noise when grinding the coffee beans.

I replaced it after few short months. The coffee was just awful! I scoffed at the other reviews with the tasteless coffee due to perhaps the type of beans they were using. I was wrong. I do not recommend this machine Along with more Cuisinart coffee makers than I care to admit to....the best grind and brew is the Melitta 10 cup (how I wish for a 12 cup from them) programmable...not the expensive one. It makes GREAT tasting coffe. You can choose your coffee strength, etc. etc. Also easy clean. I came out to purchase one today as I had replaced the Mr. Coffee with yet another Cuisinart....which after regular cleaning and only about 6 months takes a hour to brew a pot. But I digress.

While the previous reviews of this coffee maker being hard to clean are a bit exaggerated; the real issue is the weakness of the coffee that the machine makes, and the capacity of the grind chamber.

To bide his time until his application to Satan goes through, Slick tries to be a pimp, and sometimes a coffee house beatnik. All this while trying to win the affections of the dropdead gorgeous poet babe Monique. If you loved the original Bloom County comic and are at least a part-time anime fan, then this one you can't pass up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a book for the best web comic","review":"Sinfest is the best web-only comic I've read. I've been reading Sinfest since 2002 and I'm surprised that it's still not syndicated.This book contains comics from 2000 and 2001. Tatsuya Ishida's art has improved since then, but even his older material is good. The Sinfest comics are all online, so you can check it out and decide for yourself if you like it before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anna Coogan","review":"I have enjoyed discovering Anna Coogan's CD's.

I'm not sure if he was written that way on purpose or not and that is part of the problem.Second, I figured out the answer to the \\"mystery\\" immediately after a certain character was introduced. It was that obvious.Third, the villians are reputed to be totally evil yet their stated goals were worthy albeit the methods for obtaining them were violent and terrible. The author never addressed that contradiction.Overall, there seemed to be a confusion of intent. That being said, the story had a lot in it that was diverting and interesting but I can't really recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worthwhile","review":"The novel is admittedly uneven -- I suspect that hard-core mystery fans will become impatient with the see-it-coming-a-mile-away nature of some of the occurances -- but worth reading. Anaya's prose is frequently lovely and the characters resonate. In addition, it's a pleasure to read an author who presents the mystical/spiritual with respect. In my opinion, Anaya wasn't preachy, but he clearly agrees with Jung's assertion that the religious impulse in human beings is as ineradicable as the sex drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"still bangin' and nice","review":"Another great production by The boys at Subliminal. They're signature is definitely there. I've had this for years and still find myself coming back to these two CDs. Exactly what I expected: some deep house, soul, great beats and the tracks are beautifully arranged- blending smoothly and with a vibe that takes you down a euphoric stroll. memories with this CD. Sound productions is great- not too much bass and for those with awesome cans (headphones) or sound systems at home, teh surround sound is great for those off the wall parties. CD 1 still remains my go to for Sunday cleaning as well. lol! Listen to the samples to see if this is your vibe.

I am really not feeling this album I bought it with high hopes but surely I was let down... Yet I have to admit the tracks \\"Keep Your Worries\\", \\"All I said\\" and \\"Plenty\\" were plenty tight... but that was only due to the featuring artists... His rap style is simple which I like but at the same time it is not advance, not very articulate and not enticiing... it doesn't pull me in with head banging lyrics, it doesn't capture me with the nicest compilation of eclectic (electric) rhythms. His style is like that of the 80's , kind of monotonous, kind of boring if you ask me... but that is my opinion don't let what I say stop you... Most people who bought this album were fans of his previous releases and dig his sytle but I can't say the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Too Damn Mellow","review":"I'm down with the jazzier hybrids. I'm down with the cool guest stars. I'm down with Guru's deadpan rapping style. And I'm definitely down with Jazzmatazz Vol. I, which was plenty of good fun.What I'm NOT down with is this album because, frankly, the rhythms are so limp. Laid back is okay once in a while but there is not one cut here that I would spin live while deejaying--it's all so damn sleepy. Nothing ever rises above midtempo at best, and the downside of having lots of \\"jazz\\" all over it is that there are no hooks--just lots of watery, bland music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The concept and the music are incompatible.......","review":"I'm not exactly sure what made Al feel impelled to enlist Laurence Juber as the producer of this project, but I must say very bluntly that it was a mistake. He cannot shoulder all of the blame however, because Al should have known, via his album Russians and Americans, that theme albums don't always work. Yes, I would have to admit that this work does have a Napa Valley cellar feel to it, but the songs are merely fair. I return to this cd to hear Millie Brown, but all else misses the mark in pacing and appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down in the Cellar","review":"A few years back, Al Stewart brought back the idea of a concept album in Between The Wars. He tries to do this again in Down in the Cellar with the focus being on Wine. The problem is that it doesn't go anywhere. The songs, with the exception of House of Clocks, just don't work.It irony is that Mr. Stewart recorded this CD for an US audience, but the record company that was going to distribute it went out of business before the album came out. It's available in Europe under the EMI lable.While Down in the Cellar is interesting, it's no gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al Stewart is Back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Anyone who grew up with the early Al Stewart records will be thrilled that this guy is back in business. Very well produced as always, but some songs are great reminders of the Year of The Cat album. It will have you listening to the old stuff again.Good going Al!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Resisting the wine puns is hard ....","review":"It's so tempting to title this review \\"vintage Al Stewart\\". Even the press seems to be unable to resist. (All the UK reviews I've seen of this disk fall prey.) The thing is,it IS a wonderful disk, full of Al's trademark wordplay and subtle musical brilliance. \\"The Night That the Band Got the Wine\\" is a long and funny tale that basically says \\"Vino Veritas\\", and \\"Down in the Cellar\\" is simply so beautiful it has moved some people to tears. If you enjoy Al Stewart's work, you simply MUST by this as an import while they are working out the kinks in the US release. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Vino Veritas!","review":"When I heard this album for the first time I was not sure of it. I was ready to relegate it to Chateau Rivage but with repeated play, I realize it has superior blending and cleverness and overall is a Grand Vin selection among Al Stewart recordings. The songs are interesting, different and good like a Chateau Pereguay Sauterne with Strawberries. Under a Wine Stained Moon is among quite a few tunes that are catchy and inventive. While it may not be the best Al has ever done it is designed for the Piano in a Piano Bar setting and contributes to the diverse creations that this talented songwriter so elegantly displays. Worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made a fan out of me","review":"I came upon this CD totally by accident about 2 months ago, and it was one of the nicest musical surprises I've had in decades. My awareness of Al Stewart's music has been, until now, limited to the Top 40s stuff he recorded many years ago. After listening to this album over and over again, I have become a true fan. This is good solid musicianship coupled with intelligent storytelling. The band is crisp and tight, the recording bright and full of depth, and I strongly recommend it. Is it a masterpiece? Probably not. But it sure is great to listen to. Go ahead. Take a chance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't even get what you pay for","review":"I got this on Friday special from Amazon for $25 shipped, thinking how much I would save in Mystic tanning sessions by doing this myself at home. I am not impressed-- I acknowledge my unit may have been defective, but I'm not taking the chance and I'm returning it to Amazon for a refund.In short, it did not work well at all. The plug on the recharging unit got too hot to the touch after charging for a little while. The reservoir was very difficult to remove and it did not spray very strong. Worst of all, it did a poor job on me-- although I tried to coat myself evenly, I am only tan in places here and there. I am tannest on spots on both of my hands, which is very noticeable and embarrassing. In addition, the spray gun seemed to be a bit leaky- yuck.So, the experiment did not go well and it's back to Mystic for me. This is a poor product and based on its performance, I would say that if you paid a penny for it, it would be one cent too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"This is my first Amazon review because this is the first disappointing item I have ever bought on Amazon. I got my first IBOD Tanning System and tried to use it. The gun clogged immediately and the battery wouldn't hold a charge, so I returned it (paying alot for shipping to return it). The second gun arrived and when I used it, the same thing happened. Since I couldn't justify another expensive shipping charge, I am now stuck with this horrible piece of junk. Oh, by the way, they only give you 30 days to ship it back. It took 2 weeks to get my return spray gun, thus my time ran out. I will never order another Viatek product again. My Aztek gun was 1/2 the price of this one and worked much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"First, the tanning solution bottle appeared to have been previously opened, or at least the foil inside the cap that seals the bottle wasn't sealed.I carefully read and followed the instructions to the letter. The tanning solution is not a bronzer, which makes it difficult to tell if you have applied it evenly. It took overnight for the tan to develop - and what a disappointment! I ended up with a very streaky tan as well as drip marks in a couple places. Determined to try to it again, I had my husband carefully apply the solution again. The results ended up being not much better than the first application. I gave it a final try a few days later, but again, it seems impossible to get any even tan - now I've been waiting/exfoliating for a week trying to get rid of what's left of this bad fake tan.The solution does give a decent color tan, but I'll stick with other products or the salon before I ever try using this device again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even use it!","review":"I bought the IBOD Airbrush Tanning system. When I got the item and went to use it i found out that a special plug in (230 Volt) was needed. I dont know if I was missing a part with this package or what was going on because the instruction said use a standard outlet but it didn't work. I never got to use the product but if anyone wants to buy it for personal use make sure you BUY the IBOD PERSONAL AIRBRUSH TANNING SYSTEM.

Everybody already knows that and besides it is not always true. In a stock market crash it is better to panic sooner rather than later. Also, I recall that a number of people in the WTC horror died because they decided to stay put in their offices rather than to rush down. But what I really don't like at all about this book is that it is marketed as a book for investors. This is nonsense.

Shiny stainless steel that is brushed just enough that it does not show every freak'n fingerprint. If you are used to numbers on the touch-pad then you have a very short learning curve to use the functions since there are no numbers on the pad. The pop-up dial is a little strange but works well. Powerful for it's size? YES. Spacious for it's size? YES. My main beef? The rubber pegs that the microwave sits on allow the entire unit to slide everytime you punch the spring loaded door-open button (the unit is quite light weight). I can fix this with some thought and a trip to the hardware store. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and, as always, I'm again satisfied with Amazon.com service.Note: This Microwave died within months of my purchase.

This seemed clever at first but turned out to be annoying because I could never quite get the hang of getting the time I wanted without a lot of fiddling. Would have been faster to just punch in numbers.The \\"quick min\\" button is not all that quick. Unlike most microwaves you still have to hit \\"start\\" afterwards. This is evidently because the engineers could not figure out a way to add time while the oven is running (which is a problem all by itself).The display is unreadable unless it is at eye level or above. Fine for a built-in over the stove or something, but this is a counter-top model...Finally, I got to hate being told \\"ENJOY YOUR MEAL\\" every time I used it.

How is it possible that he could have penned this?I was brought up in the world of classical music loving the likes of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach and the likes. When I got older I learned through my brother of a band called Pink Floyd. Wow. I was fortunate to listen to today's Mozart. Then I accidentally came upon Porcupine Tree while listening to a progressive rock station. Man, where in the world did this come from?

During flashes of light(lightning) the DVD will skip for a second or too.Least to say I was outraged. It was due to several factors. The delayed shipment, the price of the DVD, and me finding out the DVD skips and made me wonder about the craftmanship. Now, this would not be a problem if I got my order on time OR that the price was significantly lower. If I am only the person with this problem, then the product I received was low in quality. But if anyone else does not have this lightning problem, then buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All 20 Episodes from Season 1","review":"As described in the description, this DVD contains ALL 20 episodes.

Maybe it is formatted for a specific type of player...just be careful of this before ordering!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Hey Arnold On DVD!!!","review":"This DVD set includes all of the season 1 episodes in great quality. When you first put the disc in, it goes straight to the menu which I love. It has an episode list and only plays the opening Hey Arnold! theme song at the beginning of the disc, so you don't have to hear it during each episode. I would've liked to see some special features, but this is a great start."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Introduction for Younger Readers","review":"I often give talks on space flight to school children of the age targeted by this book. The subject of animal space flights always proves a big hit with these young people, and the author has done a remarkably good, and certainly well researched job in putting this book together. Most people can only remember the momentous flight of Russian space dog Laika in 1957, but this book shows that our canine friends were being sent into space on top of research rockets well before Laika's historic, but ill-fated orbital journey. Excellent photographs accompany the well-written and evocative text, and I have a feeling that a lot of curious adults will find this book every bit as fascinating as its younger readers. I know I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Engaging ala Peter Sellers and Peter Falk","review":"Enjoyable, especially if you love to listen to the Italian language. Coliandro is a bit like Inspector Clouseau and Columbo.

Ignore the profanity and you will find it likable. The plots are very good and most of the acting is worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars fix for a Star Wars junkie","review":"Not sure anyone other than a real Star Wars junkie would get very excited by Clone Wars, Vol. 2. unless you grew up a fan of Star Blazers and other sci-fi anime.

The animation looks cheap and the characters look disfigured. The story is just constantly action packed jumping back and forth from battle to battle. I do not like mace windu in this one in where he punches droids into scrap metal and can defeat thousands of them with the wave of his hand. Imagine in Episode 2 when the Jedi are surrounded by droids at the stadium. In the cartoon mace would have just closed his fist and crushed the droids, it was like he was magneto. The story jumps way off with Anakin trying to save some primitive race from being converted to a new weapon used by grievous. He saves them at the end but I didn't get why the writers would even add such a long story to something that seem pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Clone Wars Vol 2","review":"Very creative, it is a must have, along with volume 1, for all star wars fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this DVD!!","review":"I have this DVD and absolutely love it!

I look at these & the current CG Clone Wars & wonder \\"why isn't the CG Clone Wars as good as this?\\"As far as I'm concerned these are the true \\"Episode(s) 2.5\\". If you're a Star Wars fan & also like animation, you do yourself a disservice by not having both volumes in your collection.

They are more like the movies than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring compared to volume 1 !","review":"Volume 1 was 10 times better than volume 2.

This site should carry their second CD \\"Feeding Time On Monkey Island\\" which is a little more rock driven. Cosmodrome is a concept album with a sense of humor about itself.

Very let down by this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing it...","review":"The only thing that saves this mix is the fact that there are some really nice tracks on it. Other than that...

I do not know what other reviewers were looking for, but I was looking for simulations as in building something that will mimic the real world experience. The book is about how to \\"simulate\\" role-paying and child play.I kept reading, hoping for the good part to come but, beside the title nothing of real substance came out.

Don't get me wrong, I adore English comedy, but, although this has all the hallmarks, it is nowhere near the top of the pile, and given the vast amount of excellent English stuff to choose from, you should give this a miss.The only exception to this would be if you are English and served in the Far East during WW2.

OK, it's powerful. But then it decided to die on us just a month after the manufacturer's warranty expired! How convenient. We ordered this through Amazon and I don't know if it got damaged in the shipping, but a microwave shouldn't die after a year. We have an old microwave at work that is utilized constantly by a rather large staff and it's amazing this thing does the job. So there is no excuse for this appliance to have such a short life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This Microwave is the Worst Ever. Here is why.

Not to mention the guy in Customer Service couldn't speak English and Understand me. NOT his fault, but frusterating all the same. I know they could care less if I shop with them or not, obviously due to the way I was treated. Anyway, It worked Awesome for 3 short months.

It was by far the WORST book I have ever read in my life. It is written by a pompous author who wants to sell his views and his personal \\"consulting business\\". There were only 10 questions on my exam...I wish I would have not even studied it. If you are a true believer in \\"the best person for the job, should get the job\\", you will find this book ridiculous and you will be sickened by his ideas. At one point, the book tells you how you make your employees feel/think \\"the way they should\\". As if, we have lost our free thinking when we work for a company. The author pulls most of his \\"facts\\" out of his incredibly narrow studies of a few companies (mainly ALCOA-which was referenced about 1000 times). He also uses unneeded, difficult words to attempt to make himself look like a scholar.

I have overcome a few physical concerns as well such as arthritis and fatigue. It has suggestions for various issues but you must read it, along with other sources, to understand the practice of Ayurveda because just doing the practices for whatever is bothering you will not work unless you are committed to the practice physically, spiritually, and mentally. Its not a religion. You do not give up your faith in whatever you believe. Its just a lifestyle that strengthens you in all three areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ayurveda Dumbed Down","review":"I purchased this book on the strength of other consumer's reviews, but was disappointed by how simplistic it is. Ayurvedic medicine is a life-long study, not a \\"handbook\\" for looking up routine symptoms. It may be an introduction to this ancient form of healing, but the book really can't help anyone get an over-all picture of their state of health, or give good advice on how to treat yourself.

It had poor animation, Terrible voice acting, and a somewhat corny plot. Now your probably wondering what exactly it good about this movie. And the fact is: it's actually quite entertaining. What I hate most about this movie is, it stops right in the middle of the story. In order to see the rest, you must rent, or buy the second one. Another thing I hated, was it just seemed so kiddy-like. It was barely a step up from pokemon. It had no blood, gore, nudity, or swearing. I'm sorry, but these things are pretty much mandatory in a good anime film. It was also very un-emotianal, and unrealistic, like a kiddie cartoon-show.Here's the bottom line: It is great for \\"Pokemon\\", \\"Dragon Ball Z\\", and \\"Sailor Moon\\" fans, but not much for those hardcore anime fans who like: \\"Ninja Scroll\\", \\"Macross Plus\\", \\"Ghost in the Shell\\", \\"Akira\\", etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Flop of Entertainment","review":"This video was a flop.

I contacted Mr Watch to let them know the watch was defective and stopped working. To my surprise, they told me that they COULDN'T help me because the watch was now considered used and that I had to deal with the manufacturer personally. Well, we all know what a headache it is to try and do that!!!! I would highly recommend dealing with a different company!! A company that stands behind their customers and the product they sell!!Good luck to anyone that uses their company and hopefully the watch lasts longer than a month!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't keep time","review":"I had a crystal SEIKO before this one that kept time to the second. This watch gained about a minute a week. Love its durability and looks, but worthless. Gave mine away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Timepiece","review":"Have used this watch while SCUBA diving and it performed fine in keeping the minutes underwater. The one way rotating bezel is a nice safety feature that will not allow you to subtract time from your dive if accidently bumped. It is a heavy well built watch. It feels like a quality watch on your arm. However don't plan on this being your daily wear watch. It keeps time lousy. It looses nearly 15 minutes a month if you don't reset it. This wouldn't be so bad if the watch was easy to set but you pull out the knob and there are three increments to set the time, date, and day and it is very hard to get it just right. I dreaded setting this watch. Very disappointed in this watch from such a well respected brand name."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe these reviews","review":"The reviews on this watch are unbelievable. I guess there are a lot of Seiko employees. This watch keeps horrible time. I want to send it back for repair but Seiko says that + or - 20 seconds a day is normal! I have had other automatics and this is unacceptable. Mine is fast by 30 seconds a day! Do the math after a month you will be ahead 15 minutes! 10 minutes a month is apparently acceptable to Seiko. Not me, don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working within 24 hours of Arrival","review":"I ordered this watch and it stopped working within 24 hours of arriving. I never even took it out of the box. I am returning it. Very unhappy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belongs Under Water.At the Bottom. Done With Seiko.","review":"I've owned Seiko dive watches for over 25 years. This was purchased about 10 years ago, and has worked...sometimes. After owning about 1 1/2 years, the watch began running fast...by about a minute every few hours. Back to seiko for $100.00. Worked for another few years, then the second hand fell off (!). Returned for repairs. Wouldn't fix unless I paid for a new crystal also, as the original had a small scratch. $175.00 this time. Now the watch has been running about 2 hours fast each day. I am done throwing money at this junk. My original electric Seiko diver (20+ years) is still running fine. This is having the band removed as a spare for my other one, and going to the bottom...of the landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor time keeper, but durable.","review":"I purchased a SKX173 about six years ago and was initially impressed by the weight and build quality of the watch. Over the last couple years, I have grown tired of its inability to keep accurate time. The watch is consistently about 10 minutes fast after about a week of operation. I am looking for a new watch this holiday and would advise others this is not a good watch and to look elsewhere for another make or model.Pros :+ Durable and has held up against the elements+ Comfortable and Attractive+ Reasonable costCons :---- Inaccurate ; 10 minutes fast after about a week- Wristband quality (even with Seiko branded replacements) is poor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pictures do not do justice...","review":"I looked at Omega, Heuer, watches that cost 10 times as much.I don't like flash, this watch is anything but. It has an honest, workmanlike look and feel, that makes it very attractive.Agree with many of the fine reviews on this watch, it is a mechanical watch, there is no battery and chip running this thing, and for an automatic movement, it's very accurate, 2 weeks in, it's on the money, I wear it all the time, I've put a black 4 ring 22mm Zulu band and it looks sick.Skater slang aside, send it, I love this watch.J"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not last much...","review":"This will be a great dive watch... while it lasts. After a year the band broke, this was no big deal and was expected being plastic and wearing it everyday (replacement was around $15 here at amazon). The problem was around 2 years later when the watch din't hold a charge, if you shaked the watch it would start to run but stop after a few seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it but runs way too fast.","review":"I really wanted to like this watch. My father has one that he has had for 35 years and 3 tours in Vietnam. So my expectations were for a simple but quality item. Unfortunately it runs fast, real fast. It gains about 10 minutes ever five days.It is also pretty heavy, if it kept time I could put up with it but since it's fast, no dice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled ... Don't buy this watch","review":"I have had this watch for approx. 45 days now. It is a beauty and appears to be well made ... like you expect from Seiko. BUT, it doesn't keep accurate time. The watch GAINS 2-3 minutes PER DAY. What a shame for a timepiece at this price. You can get dive watches for half the price that do keep accurate time. Since I am past the 30-day return period, Amazon will not take it back. Seiko will give me an \\"estimate to fix\\" after I mail it to New Jersey! I'd suggest that you look elsewhere for a good dive watch. Not sure about all the good reviews here (I trusted them) ... maybe I just got a lemon ... will you get one too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that reliable.","review":"I love the looks of the watch, the automatic movement is not that good, thewatch stops working while you're wearing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great deal for a great watch","review":"I have over $10k in expensive swiss watches and I enjoy this $150 watch a lot. It is a great deal for the money, solidly build and classically styled. It's just the right size, not rediculously large nor too small. It wears just slightly larger than my Rolex Submariner on my wrist. Still able to fit under the cuff of a dress shirt. The rubber strap is very long to allow wearing over a wetsuit, it will be too long for a thin-framed person.There is no room in this world for digital and/or quartz watches when you can buy such a solid little mechanical for so little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Seiko standards","review":"I've had good look with Seiko watches and expected the same with this \\"divers\\" watch. While I like the look, weight and durability of the exterior, unfortunately the movement inside just leaves you wondering if Seiko didn't just outsource this to some Malaysian company and forget about it. Since day one the watch has always run fast, gaining 5-7 minutes a day. Within the first year, the self winding mechanism began losing its efficiency. Now if I don't take the time each day to remove the watch and shake it for several minutes, it will stop overnight. Also, the band is fairly uncomfortable and stiff, but that is really a more personal assessment and others may feel differently. My suggestion is if you are looking for a sports watch with the perceived reliability and quality of a Seiko, you need to keep looking past this timepiece. It just shouldn't carry the Seiko name."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Won't Last","review":"The band broke after 1 year. The multifunction set stem broke after 2 years. Pretty darn poor for a $300 watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they used to be.","review":"I ordered this watch to replace my old Seiko Diver which gave over twenty years of great service. I was somewhat concerned when I noted \\"Malaysia\\" stamped on the back but decided to keep it based on my experience with Seiko products. The watch that I received is a dog. It loses or gains ten to fifteen minutes a day...one day it gained six hours. I have never returned an item from Amazon before but this one is shipping back Monday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halfway decent watch but poor poor customer service","review":"I've owned this type of Seiko Divers watch for over 16 years. It's held up quite well. However, it has NEVER kept accurate time. Within a week it will be 5 to 7 minutes fast. And after several letters and emails to Seiko, they have NEVER replied. No doubt the majority are quality watches, but I got the lemon and no customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage...","review":"This watch has never kept accurate time. It lost a minute or two a day, which quicks adds up enough lost time to make the watch essentially worthless. \\"Too bad\\" said Seiko, \\"the watch is an automatic and won't ever keep very accurate time\\". As if that weren't bad enough, the watch completely stopped running after about a year. I sent the watch to Coserv, the Seiko authorized watch repair facility in New Jersey, and for about $100 dollars they fixed my watch. Great! (Except I had to pay $100 to get a watch worth about twice that to work). Anyway, the watch was a gift so I paid to get it repaired and it ran great for about 3 maybe 4 months. Now, the watch is broken again. I'll send it back to Coserv, they do provide a one year warranty on their work, but this watch has obviously been a tremendous piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy from Jomashop","review":"The watch arrived defective with a crown that would not screw back into place. I was unable to contact Seiko directly to fix the problem because the warrantee was not stamped by an authorised dealer. On contacting Jomashop they told me to take it to a local watchmaker. I refused as I didn't want to void the warrantee nor have a watch that was broken brand new. Eventually they agreed to take to watch back, at my cost for postage, but I am yet to receive a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"seiko dive watch","review":"I purchsed this for my husband, who is a Diver & Surfer, he wanted a Seiko as he loved the one that he had for years that finally died!He was VERY disappointed with this watch, as the Bezel was very loose, which means it would NOT have been of any use when he was in the water!!I actually exchanged the 1st watch, hoping that it was just a lemon, the 2nd watch had the SAME exact problem!!! so, the 2nd watch I returned for refund!!We looked at the same watch in a Dept Store, & it was fine!! HOWEVER, it seems this watch in the Stores has a DIFFERENT \\"Makers Mark\\" than the watches we ordered!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"crappy crappy crappy","review":"As a kid I loved my Seiko diver's watch. With high hopes, I ordered another one recently -- and what a disappointment! Still looks as good, but after about 60 days it started to add at least ten extra minutes a day! And I live abroad so the hassle of using the warranty to fix or replace it is huge. I chose a \\"reputable\\" watch for that very reason. But now the damn thing is of no use to me. What a waste of 250 bucks. Never again. Seiko, schmeiko!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't Seiko Known for Accurate Time Keeping?","review":"I purchased this Seiko impressed by Seiko's reputation for smart style, rugged design and accurate time keeping. Well, two of the three proved true but keeping accurate time, what I consider the keystone function of any watch, is where this time piece fails. The watch was losing 10 minutes every two weeks.I sent it to Seiko for repair which tinkered with it and returned it with a note saying it's not design to keep accurate time. And since they worked on it, it now runs fast.Still, it's a beautiful watch and can take a pounding but so does a Timex at a quarter of the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointing","review":"This watch runs quite fast, and must constantly be adusted (which is not easy as you think). Also, the self-winding mechanism does not perform well, leading to even more adjustments. Unless you wear this watch for several hours a day, every day, it will wind down. It has essentially no reserve power, and you cannot manually wind it. I expected much more from Seiko."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seiko Men's Automatic Dive Watch #SKX173","review":"First of all its a great looking watch...but you should know it was made in Malaysia with Malaysia movement. The wrist band was made in China. Calibre #7S26-0028 engrave in the back. Is it me or do all SKX173 made in Malaysia??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't drop it!","review":"Unfortunately, this watch stopped working when I dropped it about 4 feet onto asphalt pavement. I liked the easy readability and utility of the rotating bezel. It kept decent time; nothing great. The failure after such a trivial knock would make me wary of relying on it. Users needing a reliable dive watch should choose something more substantial.BTW, I did not look into getting it fixed as I consider additional spending on the watch to be throwing good money after bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest disappointment of a watch.","review":"So like you (if you're reading this review), I can't afford a Rolex. I had always heard that Seiko had a good name and I thought this watch looked great! An automatic self winding watch! Now I could tell myself I was getting closer to that Rolex. Well not only is the not a Rolex its not even a Timex. It has been losing more and more time over the past two years and today just completely stopped working altogether! Now when it moves on my wrist it makes a clank sound instead of the self winding sound it should be making. That describes this watch pretty well- a total CLANKER. Save yourself the heartache and go buy a good Casio until you can afford the good stuff! Don't end up with a $200 paper weight as in my cautionary tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rugged Beast","review":"I have had this watch for over 20 years. I don't wear it all the time (dives, when my regular watch breaks, and weekends). I've had it down to 150ft with no problem. The large timing ring is easy to rotate even with gloves. It keeps perfect time and still has the original strap! It's one of those rare time pieces that seems to improve with age. The case is so massive that it feels like it could be used to drive nails (though I wouldn't recommend it, as rugged as it is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"works perfectly","review":"Keeps time accurately and doesn't need winding. I skip a day sometimes and it keeps on ticking. Much more comfortable than the expensive one, not too big, not too heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU CAN''T LIVE ON THE PAST","review":"All of these reviews are based on nostalgia, this was a great watch in the 80s but now is trash,i don't even think Seiko care about this anymore since young people don't used watches as they use to. If you want a mechanical buy an Orient diver, is a lot better than this Seiko diver. The past is gone, this is not what it used to be, be real."},{"rating":"1","title":"to bad","review":"I would have loved this watch if it had been solar powered and this maybe asking a bit much, but also w/the perpetual calender would have made it a slam dunk.With the automatic you have to wear it all the time and if you have another watch, forget about waering it, unless you like constantly re-setting the thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch, wish it had lasted longer!","review":"I bought this watch for my husband in 2006 for 155 plus shipping. In March 2011 (almost exactly 5 years later), it died. It had been sluggish for a while, and I thought it was because he wasn't moving around as much as he used to. But, then it quit working altogether.In that time, he had to replace the band once, but he LOVED this watch. He is really picky about watches, and I wish it had lasted longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This watch was a complete waste of money. It worked for a short period of time and quit. I sent it in for service and it did the same thing about a week later. I gave up. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't make them like they use to!","review":"I purchased this watch Jan 06. It was first returned for repair in Jun 07. Second time Nov 08. Third time Dec 08. It stops, and then when it does run, it runs at an accelerated pace. I have a similar watch purchased approximately thirty year ago that has been repaired once, the reason I bought a new one, and once repaired runs fine. Buy this watch only if you think a watch should last less than three years, and can tolerate sending it in repeatedly to Conserv for repair during those three years. After three years you are out of luck. The warranty does not start again for any length of time after each repair. One star is the lowest I can enter, it deserves none. Update July 09: The second hand fell off. The good news is that I charged the watch on my AmEx card and they refunded my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"keeps terrible time--runs fast","review":"I liked the look of this watch for years and finally broke down and bought one a year ago. Looks great but keeps TERRIBLE time. I just could not depend on it--10 minutes late to meetings, etc. I may have gotten a bad one but I would not buy another Seiko mechanical watch. I'm back to wearing my cheap quartz watch--at least I don't look at my watch and then immediately try to find another time source to compare it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch!","review":"I just received this watch so can't say anything about accuracy yet, but it looks nice with it's very sporty and cool looks. The case is solid and the rotating bezel is refreshingly easy to turn and the luminosity is very good. I like the strap but it could probably be of higher quality, but all in all the watch is good value for the $165 I paid for it.Will write some more on accuracy after a couple of months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for - keeps great time!","review":"After much deliberation, I'm very happy I finally purchased this watch. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews here but the watch has been great so far. I've had it for 3 weeks and just today adjusted the time. It was 1 minute fast so I rolled it back - not a problem. With so many sources of highly accurate time (cable box, intranet) its really not difficult. The watch looks great, just the right size and classic style that will always be cool. I especially like that the color of the day text is black during the week, blue on saturday and red on sunday... nice touch. The best feature is that the case looks deep without being huge. No regrets - I love this watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Watch","review":"This is one of the best watches i have purchased. It looks just like the ones you would find in the stores for 2x or more than i paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have had an early version of this watch for 17 years, and when it malfunctioned, I decided it was time to get a new one. The previous watch had been repaired 2 times earlier, and unfortunately every time I got it back from COSERV, it would be less and less accurate, thus I decide to get a new one. The new one was made in Maylasia vs Japan (I have read on this site that one needs to be concerned about that), and was lighter in weight, but kept time well for about one week. I bumped the watch on a table (nothing severe, the previous watch endured much more) and it immediately started gaining more than 10 minutes per hour. I had high hopes that this watch would at least meet, and hopely exceed the durability of the previous watch, but it did not make it passed one week of casual wear. I returned it in disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Little Golf Video","review":"I'm an avid golfer, and a big fan of Leslie Nielsen, and love silly humor.

And she's got a voice and delivery to match, plus on this album, a taste for superb material. My favorites are the Nick Cave, Elvis Costello and Tom Waits compositions, but what is really impressive is how her voice holds together the Scott Walker song Scope J (If one can call the experimental construct a song).Anyone who can sing along to, let alone intelligently interpret, such a bizarre and dark little symphony deserves 5 stars just for the effort. I like my divas dark and dangerous, like Nico of Velvet Underground and Marianne Faithfull sometimes, so Ute fits the bill. With songs like these and her vocal virtuosity, Punishing Kiss is a masterpiece.

Turner managed to convince me that this is an important and underreported side of the war, but we must still await the definitive work on the subject. This simply isn't it. It is full of interesting anecdotes, but was peculiarly unhelpful for me in putting my lecture notes together. It relies mostly on interviews done in the mid-1990s, but beyond these interesting stories there is not much hard information here. (How many women were at Dien Bien Phu? Who knows?)

It seems like Creative's drivers for the X-Fi are not up to the task yet, or they are clashing somehow with my system.

I was, at the very least, highly disappointed. Richard E. Grant gave nothing to the role of Percy and Elizabeth McGovern's portrayal of Marguerite was almost laughable. The only actor who shown through was Martin Shaw for his excellent Chauvelin. Over all this was possibly the worst version of Scarlet Pimpernel I've seen. If your going to buy one of the movies, go for the two most popular, the 1982 Anthony Andrew, Jane Seymore, Ian McKellen version or the 1934 Leslie Howard, Merle Oberon, Raymond Massey version."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful film with nothing of the classic book.","review":"The whole point of the original book and the early films were Blakeney's wonderful disguises. Here blakeney moves about in Paris as he might in London and that surely is stupid"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing production of a great novel","review":"This version of the Scarlet Pimpernel is infinitely inferior to the 1982 version starring Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour, and Ian McKellan. The screenplay is incoherent and confusing; events necessary to the understanding of the story are shown in flashback, usually long after the viewer needs the information. The dialogue runs the gamut from the witty to the banal (the prison scene between Marguerite and Percy exhibits the most offensively trite dialogue). But the worst aspect of this video is the casting of Elizabeth McGovern as Marguerite. Even playing a former actress is a stretch for her. Richard Grant as Percy and Martin Shaw as Chauvelin are quite good, although not nearly as good as Anthony Andrews and Ian McKellan in the same roles.The Scarlet Pimpernel is a wonderfully heroic, romantic story set in the French Revolution. This 1998 A&E production does not do it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Usually I enjoy A&E's adaptions of novels (notably Ivanhoe, Horatio Hornblower, and Pride and Prejudice), but this version of The Scarlet Pimpernel was such a disappointment! Reasons for this have been given in some of the other reviews: actors didn't seem to fit the roles, or didn't enjoy what they did with the story. I really disagreed with A&E having Percy go to a brothel for info, while at the same time, encouraging his young friend to \\"enjoy\\" himself. Quite a dark version. Skip this one. If you want to see a GREAT Pimpernel movie, see the one starring Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour, and Ian Mckellen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad casting, bad acting, bad script, bad show","review":"The above says it all. Elizabeth McGovern was a particularly bad choice, and the script managed to remove all the intrigue and excitement. Absolutely the worst thing I have ever viewed on television."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I usually love BBC/A&E productions, but was very disappointed by their adaptation of The Scarlet Pimpernel. A mediocre cast and bad lines ruined what could potentially be a wonderfully exciting movie. The man who played Percy showed little emotion, and just didn't suit his role well. There was little chemistry between Percy and his wife, making for a very flat romantic plot in the movie. Though it was only three hours long (very short by BBC standards!), it seemed to be monotonously slow. In my opinion, the only worthwhile performance was by Emilia Fox, who portrayed the traitorous actress Minette. The only reason I wouldn't give this drama one star is because of its excellent costume/set design, which is always an added bonus in any period film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Adaptation","review":"This was the worst version of the Pimpernel I have ever seen. It had poor casting (the actors neither looked their part, or played it very well,) and the story line was nothing like the book. Percy wasn't charming and funny as he should be, Marguerite didn't seem to do her witty lines very well, and Chauvelin was too old and not sinister enough. For any fans of the book, play, or other movies I strongly suggest the 1982 version with Antony Andrews, Jane Seymore, and Sir Ian McKellen. that is the best one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel, it's not","review":"A & E has a well deserved reputation for bringing classics to the screen. How utterly disappointing. The filmmakers obviously paid little attention to the characters' personalities, and tried to squeeze too many of the numerous Pimpernel stories into one film. There is no comparison to the 1935 version with Leslie Howard or to the more recent one with Anthony Andrews. Neither Grant nor McGovern match the physical descriptions of the characters. Grant was not foppish enough nor heroic enough in the dual role. McGovern, though attractive, could hardly be called \\"the most beautiful woman in Europe.\\" There was no chemistry or sexual tension between them. Change the title, divest the lackluster love relationship of the main characters from the passion of Percy Blakeney and Marguerite St. Just, and you have an entertaining set of movies. But don't call it \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"It works great!

But the Rowenta takes up more space in my closet (doesn't fit below the shelf) than a standard board.

One of them started being quite touchy and when I tried to add, say, 10 seconds, it goes 20-30 seconds, then I try to go back and lower the time and then it is now 20-30 seconds less.

Big props to McFarland for even comissioning a second study of the slasher genre after their good, if distressingly slim, Going to Pieces. The problem here is the lack of a critical commentary. After a brief overview of slasher film history and conventions, the majority of the book consists of long, boring plot synopses (spoilers and twist endings included) followed by one or two lines of lame \\"production notes\\" and the author's overall opinion of the film's worth. For $65, I was hoping for much more than rote recitation of slasher film plots. Where are the intriguing behind-the-scenes stories from Adam Rockoff's \\"Going to Pieces\\"? Where is the kind of excellent, in-depth analysis found in another McFarland book, John Kenneth Muir's eminently worthwhile \\"Horror Films of the 1970s\\"? Pretty much a washout, I'm granting an extra star for good intentions.

In some cases the information changed when restated. As a scientist Small should be ashamed that she confuses millimeters (a measure of distance) with milliliters (a measure of volume) when discussing the amount of semen ejaculated. Her discussion of AIDS is also poorly done. For a book published in 1995, it is out of date on epidemiological and risk factor information.

But I will not pass judgement on the watch yet, as it could be a bum unit just like other watch brands have theirs. What I can say right now in all fairness is that this is the first time an automatic watch failed me, and I've owned many and I mean many. I will, for now, be returning this Seiko for a fair exchange of the same kind, and will see what happens with the replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience with this product","review":"As a watch lover, I love the look and the feel of this watch. It is solid well polished. However, the one that I own does not wind correctly. I have to swing it for a long time to wind it as it does not allow manual winding. It runs for several hours and stops. Although my daily routine is not considered as very physically demanding, it is more than enough to keep my IWC GST, TISSOT PR50, and TISSOT PRC100 fully winded. Although I like the way this watch looks, I would not recommand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"vendor price too good to be true-beware","review":"if price is too good to be true, it most often is - even from an amazon listed vendor's deal offering this watch at $23.97. if an item is priced & listed here & order isn't fulfilled by an affiliate vendor, amazon should require them to make good on the price. regardless, if a vendor cancels an order, amazon should allow account members to make vendor comments. vendor comments are not an option to choose if the order doesn't fulfill! order wasn't canceled by the mister company(trying not to name them here) until 5 days after placed & i suspected the price as a leader/come on. i ordered it anyhow & am disappointed not to receive this watch nor an offer from the company to make it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Seiko","review":"My Seiko Black Monster purchased through Amazon has been the single most disappointing Seiko product that I have ever owned.

Save your money, or go Kinetic, or Eco-Drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Dad sent his watch back","review":"This Black Monster was a Christmas present from us to my Dad. He so liked it but after a few weeks it started to freeze-up and stop and lose time. The thingy that you use to set the time also started to get wiggly and loose that it kinda dances when you move your hand. ALso my Dad noticed that the watch stored only about ten hours if he was not using it but before it used to store three days worth of power. We should have gotten him a Seiko that was Japanese (not this one which is made in Singapore). I dont know much about watches but Im a computer freak and I know good technology when I see it and this SIngaporean Black Monster is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairness please","review":"I just returned my Seiko Black Monster because its hands stopped moving but that's all Im going to say. I appeal to all parties to please desist from giving immature rants (as well as comments). Just give your honest opinion or experience and leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seiko Black Monster to be recalled?","review":"Maybe it should be recalled. I dont care if it was a kid, an M. Paredes, a Mary, a Tom, Dick, or Harry who made a comment, but wherever it is made, the Seiko Black Monster is somewhat flawed just like any other watch OK? I take the side of those who spent their money on it uselessly. Whenever you buy one, you are not sure if the watch fail a few days or weeks from now. Unless it's a Rolex, buying a Seiko Black Monster in particular is risky. Whether you want to risk your few hundred bocuks is your choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best watch I have ever owned","review":"Great watch! Hands down the best watch I have ever owned. I love the fact that I never have to buy a battery - ever again! Keeps great time and is really comfortable on my wrist. I was worried when I ordered it, it would be to large (I have smaller wrists) but it looks great and fits perfectly (I had to remove a couple of links ). Can't comment on using it with scuba gear - yet but have had it on a couple times in the shower without any problem.Overall I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS WATCH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a sports car - beautiful and fast.","review":"I really love this watch. I hate a thin watch and band so this suits me just fine. Looks twice as good in person as in the pictures, especially the markings. The biggest complaint I have is its accuracy. I've had it about 3 weeks and it is consistently running almost 2 minutes fast every 48 hours. There's an adjustment that can be made to correct this but I haven't done so yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not function as designed...","review":"This was an automatic watch. I performed all start-up procedures as directed in the manual, and wore the watch all day, even on a 5K run. In the morning I put on the watch, and noticed that it had lost more than five hours. I corrected the time, wore it for an hour, then put it on my dresser. It lost 2 hours over a six hour period. I will not buy another Seiko. In fact, any watch priced under $500 is probably a failure waiting to happen. I have a box containing 4 Traser watches, all broken, or failing to keep proper time, all bought for between $200-$350. Lots of high speed energy put into the look (of the watch) and the advertising, but quality of product is very low. Bad Form..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Monster","review":"Finally broke down and purchased my Black Monster after mulling it over for a few months. So far, so good. Replaced the stock rubber strap with a Seiko Z22 strap...not too difficult a feat to manage, only required some trimming and the wider strap compliments the watch much better than the tapered original. As far as accuracy is concerned, although I've only had the watch for about three days or so, there has been no \\"break-in\\" period or severe fluctuation. The watch has been running dead-on. Let me repeat that...the watch has been running dead-on. I imagine that it'll start floating after another couple of weeks or so, but suffice it to say that I'm pretty impressed with the accuracy so far. Big wrist presence, but not \\"bling.\\" Just a good, substantial, solid watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Version Received","review":"Ordered the stainless steel bracelet version but received the rubber diving band version. I decided to keep it and so far it has performed correctly on my watch winder and on the wrist.It is running about 15 seconds per day fast so far which seems to be typical of Seiko automatic wind mechanical watches. For some reason mechanical watch manufacturers seem to favor running fast to running slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seiko Black Monster","review":"I have owned my black monster for 1 month now. I am completely statisfied with the operation and comfort of the watch. As others have stated, with proper sizing; the bracelet is very comfortable considering the fact that this is a rather large watch. The power reserve is between 28 and 32 hours as i have observed. Overall, I would purchase this item again."},{"rating":"1","title":"ran good before 1.5 year mark","review":"i bought mine abut 1.5 years ago, and two days ago the watch started to have problem, now it run about 2 or 4 hours fast per day..cannot use it anymore.have to return it and the repair website from amazon does not work. have to call them Monday and see how it goes.update: i called this morning and was told to send this watch to \\"swinford jewelers\\" for repair, and surely i will pay the shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch","review":"Its an amazing watch.

I push 'em back in, knowing there could be a failure ahead. Otherwise very attractive and sturdy. Tough to size by yourself, much better to be done at a shop. It deserves the superior Rolex screw-type assembly. Or just have an alternate diving band for safety since the watch will probably last forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great watch but somehow hard to adjust the time","review":"It's a great watch.

It has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination. The problem started when I went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists. The guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market, because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing. At the time I thought he was just po'd because I didnt buy the watch at the store. As soon as I was home though the bracelet fell apart. What a piece of junk! I regret buying this watch and I advise against it."},{"rating":"1","title":"observations","review":"got the watch Friday in the mail it looks cool and nice and teh band is shiny.

Well done Seiko!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ugly treasure!","review":"Really nice watch, solid and reliable. If you like the brutish design, go for it! I heard they are out of production. I love it, and it gets attention. I have both a rubber strap and a bracelet for it, but wear my rubber strap the most. Lots of good design details, like that the glass is domed, but still protected by the bezel, and wholes on the lugs mean that changing wristband is easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs fast. Way fast.","review":"I was really excited to get this watch, and have seen lots of really good things written about it. My first automatic, very excited when it came Friday.Sadly, the watch is not useful. It runs 7 seconds fast, for every minute. Not day or week, but every minute. Will try to find a way to send it back to Seiko, but this is a big disappointment.Otherwise, the appearance and feel of the watch are great, although the black rubber band doesn't balance out the heft of the watch itself. The steel band would be better for this, but I liked the more casual look of the black rubber band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the METAL band NOT resin!!!","review":"This is a great watch and I'm very happy with it but I received the metal band, not the resin one from \\"Mr. Watch\\" when I ordered it.

BE ADVISED I GOT THE METAL BAND NOT THE RESIN ONE LIKE THE TITLE SAYS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I'm fairly big and most watches look dinky on me. This is big enough to look normal on me.

The day/date did not work on delivery but I was unaware of it until the end of February when I tried to manually change the date. I found that it was broken at that time, about a week after I received the watch. The day/date did change automatically each night. Amazon refused t orepalce it because I had the band adjusted.

This is the third Seiko that I own right now (the second diver), and it is just like the other two--nice looking in the daytime, but if you want to read it during the night hours, you are going to need a flashlight. I was sincerely hoping this one would be different with all of the hype about the greatly improved luminescence, but it is not. The pictures of this watch's bright luminescence that are on the internet had to be taken right after the watch was exposed to a light source. It is not that bright otherwise. If you just want to wear it in the daytime, it is a great looking watch. If you want one you can read at night, buy a Luminox. I have two of those diver watches, and they remain bright all night long."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge watch","review":"i did not expect this watch to be so b-i-g! shiny, giant sized, and heavy. if that's what you want-then it's for you. i consider myself of medium height/weight and this timepiece appears to be built for a very big person."},{"rating":"2","title":"watch is fast.","review":"watch is bullet proof, never leaks, the illumination is great. don't get the rubber band it'll eventually split and fall apart. the metal is much better.

It really looks like an expensive watch. My only negative comment is that you can't wind the watch with the stem, which means that you have to wear it most of the day, or pick it up and sling it around to keep it wound (or buy one of those watch winder machines). Not keeping it well wound results in it losing a minute or so a day.Nevertheless, if I wanted a deadly accurate watch, I would have stayed with my $20 Casio, which keeps great time but looks like a $20 watch. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but after years of wearing cheap electronic watches, I decided to indulge myself and wear an impressive looking watch, and the Black Monster certainly is impressive.Because of the stem winding issue, I would downgrade my rating to 4.5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fan of the Monster","review":"I had not worn a watch in years--they seemed uncomfortable and bulky; but recently my interest in watches suddenly perked up. I did a bunch of research, looked at pictures, and most of all--kept my budget in mind. The Seiko Black Monster Automatic Dive Watch kept showing up on peoples' lists of great watches, and the price was excellent. Ordered this from Amazon and have not removed it from my wrist since!I think it is a handsome watch, rugged but not overly built. It is easy to read the time, and it feels like a substantial piece of tool/machinery on your arm. I have grown to enjoy that feeling.Seems to keep great time (remember, I'm not a watch expert). It does the job I need it to do, and it is a pleasure to have this watch on, very enjoyable piece.

There is no manual wind through the crown, but anyone who is intelligent enough to purchase an automatic watch should know to take the watch off and give it a few shakes to maintain a wind on the mainspring.

If you would rather have your kids learn from a professional instructor, then I would not recommend the \\"by kids\\" instructional video. My fault for buying this -- the video is as advertised.

They fit over most of my flat shoes, have enough traction for walking on wet sidewalks and pavement, and are thin enough that I can drive safely with them on. I know galoshes like this aren't a fashion statement but dry feet are worth it.My only complaint is that this sandal style leaves shoelaces exposed so in heavier rain it's likely that I would still end up with some water in my shoes. In retrospect, one of the high-top styles like [...] would probably be even more practical. (The catalog that the seller included in the box showed other styles but it seems like only other sellers offer those styles on Amazon.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong size","review":"The ladies 9.5-11 size was way too big.

This new version may have lots of new features but it stalls more than it runs. I used to do animations with my old Poser 5. I WAS working on a short animated film. This program runs SO SLOWLY that I can barely render a complex still much less do animation. It doesn't even load new figures without a wait that is two or three times what Poser 5 used for the same model. It may run fine on a MAC but NOT on a PC. I have kept up with updates and none has fixed the problem. Right now I am writing this review as I WAIT for POSER 6 to switch from the Figure Library to the Props Library. It has stalled (again) and won't let me open a folder. Incidently I have a pentium 4 with 512MB so this is not a slow system. They have a lot of work left to do on this program and I am seriously considering uninstalling it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great possibilities - very unstable","review":"When I first got Poser 6 I was excited about the possibilities of porting Poser animations to Flash. Poser may work fine as a tool for creating static figures, but the animation aspect is extremely unstable to the point of unusable.Poser 6 crashes often and crashes hard when rendering animations. It actually crashed and re-booted my computer several times!!! I kept trying because the potential is so great. I even bought more memory hoping that would fix the problem. I'm using an AMD Athlon 2.16 Ghz CPU and 1 Gig of RAM. That's more than double what Curoious Labs says Poser requires - so it's not lack of computing firepower.Such potential... unfortunately Poser is not ready yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"grindhouse goodness with Boobs and Blood to spare!","review":"its low budget crunchy grindhouse goodness!

In the end I figured out the program by myself -- no thanks to the authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Beginner's Guide !!!","review":"This is a great book to get started with LiveMotion. They use real-world examples, and put everything into clear language. There's none of the typical jargon to deal with, and everything is presented in the context of getting something accomplished. I wish they had more and better information on working with sound, otherwise they cover everything in the program. A great way to get started with this incredible animation program.

Sound quality is also very good. I do miss the very funny \\"Commercial\\" from the original greatest hits package, and the hysterical studio chatter on \\"Sunday Mornin\\" (The references to Richard Speck and codeine are priceless!)Still, this is well worth purchasing, and serves as a fine introduction to a sorely-missed \\"gang\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Did I Step Into A Time Machine?!","review":"By no means am I a critic, or qualified to critique music, musicians, or styles. What I do know is that Spanky and Our Gang/Elaine \\"Spanky\\" Macfarlan, were in a class unto themselves. And this Greatest Hits CD is quintessential Spanky & Our Gang. It contains a pot pouri of their multi-facited styles. It's a prizm emitting the spectrum of their vast talents in broadway, jazz, blues, r&b;, rock styles. Their musical abilities and impectible vocal harmonies are without equal (in my opinion). On as side note: I was not aware that their rendition of Stardust was the major impedus behind the formation of the Manhattan Transfer, until I read the liner/insert.Frankly, I'm wisked back to my high school and college days, volkswagon beetle, flower power days. You know, the more-or-less carefree days of youth. I had these songs on 8-track and I think I wore it out.

As such it has a slightly British-centric view of the execution methods, with majority of the descriptions dedicated to the axe, wheel and rope as the executioner implements. It also reads as a survey of the fate of Christian martyrs, which we known to be executed in great style. I would like to see more illustrations, for exposition to be clouded with less emotion, and for more space to be dedicated towards Oriental, Middle East and Ancient execution methods which are poorly represented.

You can't put separate blocks together & then transfer them to their location in the puzzle - they just crumble when you try to pick them up.#2) I needed to use a magnifying glass to look at the tiny pic on the cover of the box, & I still couldn't see it well enough! Buffalo supplies a slightly enlarged print of the pics on their boxes. All puzzle manufacturers should do this, especially when it is a long skinny pic (or change the shape of the box to accommodate a larger pic).Between the loose pieces & the micro-sized pic, this puzzle was a fight from start to finish. The quality of the pic & the pieces themselves (individually) were 5-star.Wouldn't it be great if manufacturers read these reviews & made adjustments accordingly?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for insulation","review":"We used this bubble wrap to cover our windows until we get double-pane windows.

She built up the story for 300 pages and then wrapped everything up in a neat little bow in the last 25 pages. I didn't understand why she did this. It was like she had a page limit that she couldn't go over. I enjoyed the interplay between the characters especially some of the minor characters. You definitely should read Ms. Foster's earlier book, Jude's Law before this book as it explains how the two lead characters met and their attraction. This is a definite beach book.

The lack of courage to write one's name in this case is just a licence to spew hatred and to further the far right political agends. The use of the \\"scare tactics\\" is nothing short of revolting, if it wasn't for the great damage that it does to human relations in this time and age.

To charecterize bin Laden as \\"distinguished\\" one wonders how the author would define Joe Stalin, Adolph Hitler, Idi Amin etc. Bin Laden has a \\"passion for martydom\\" seems easy enough to accomplish yet he has avoided \\"martydom\\" for more than 10 years. \\"Bin Laden has survived by the grace of God ... just as Iraq's Saddem Hussein has kept his regime intact\\". AHH on second thought...To compare this terrorist with the heros of the American Revolution is pure drivil. Who were the suicide bombers in 1776? Bin Laden started the jihad because american military were stationed in Saudi Arabia. Why where they there? Because bin Laden was trying to overthrow the Saudi government.

It's chock-full of quotes from the pioneers in this genre--Gram Parsons, Chris Hillman, Bernie Leadon, etc.--and tells the story of the various groups and individuals who were involved. If you liked Einarson's book on Buffalo Springfield (another must-read) you'll love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh...","review":"Since I own tons of records by this work's focal artists, I figured I'd get this book. Not the best move, for a bunch of reasons. First off, as one writer referred to, it totally lacks organization. The chapters jump all over the place, making it hard to keep things in mind. Second, why should a work that deals with such lyrical and evocative music be written like a college term paper? Excuse me, Mr. Einarson, you're not proving a thesis, don't be afraid to inject some imagery! The BEST books about musical artists from this period (see Bud Scoppa's Byrds biography NOT Johnny Rogan's, and the wonderful \\"CSN\\") are better organized, more pictoral, and livelier! Man, if the times were as dry as Einarson's writing, this genre would never have come about!!!!!And how anyone could knock the Byrds' \\"Untitled\\" album is beyond me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this watch.","review":"It's great looking, the crystal positively gleams.

He is pretty picky about what he wears. Watches are one of his passions and his knowledge about them is well beyond mine. I was, therefore, reticent in selecting one, not knowing if it would have been a timepiece he would have purchased.

There are plenty of modern masters who leave the SNZ's in their dust. Consider Bob Brozman. He deserves the recognition that the SNZ's have garnered, but his vastly superior recordings are mostly unknown. He did better version of You're Driving Me Crazy in 1988 on \\"The Devil's Slide, a record that the SNZ's have borrowed from (shamelessly, I think...their song \\"Hell\\" on the next record is a blatant ripoff of \\"Death\\" as performed by Brozman on \\"The Devil's Slide\\", right down to the faux spooky vocal). SNZ's are spirited, to be sure (if you ignore the fact that their lead singer has the charisma of a wet sock on stage) but they are so frankly derivative that it is hard to keep liking this recording after hearing more accomplished musicians tackle the same stuff with greater technique and fidelity to the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"Let's start off by talking about sucking. Sorry, but we have to be blunt. We don't know what the band is going for, but it's certainly not good. The horns seem as if they have no feel for rythym, or a good sound for that matter.

We bought it new three months ago and hate it so much we are replacing it. The door is very tight and unless you would like to bolt it to your countertop somehow, it will slide all over every time you try to open it. You have to put down your food and use two hands to open the door. You need one hand to open the door and the other to hold the microwave in place.

I figured it was a fluke, or maybe a power surge that \\"killed\\" my first one, so I immediately purchased another one - making sure to buy the 1.2cu.ft. with the inverted-defrost-whatever-technology.Fast forward two years ahead, to the present day. Once again, the microwave just completely died.

I really love the way it cooks/heats.However, I couldn't give it a fifth star because of two drawbacks: One, you can't read the indicator unless you're eye level with it and I hate having to bend down to see what I'm doing (If you're under 5' this may not be a problem for you; you could also build a shelf or something I guess). Second: when cooking \\"steamy\\" foods, there is so much steam buildup inside you can't watch what's happening, so how do you know whether or not you have to hit the more/less button? This never happened with my other microwave. I think the steam issue is because of the sensor cook feature--the oven uses the steam produced to know how long to cook an item (if I read the manual correctly).All in all, it's a great microwave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!

The problems with the Move2Mac are as follows:1) It doesn't convert Outlook mail, Contacts or Calendar to Mac format. You actually need to invest in an additional $[...] product called OM2 from [...]. OM2 worked very well. Detto only picked up the OM2-converted files from my XP PC and moved them to my Mac....I still needed to import them myself.2) If you use another browser other than IE, it won't move your favorites. I use Firefox, so no deal.3) I didn't want to move my screensaver as Mac's are much nicer so that option was of no value.So the only thing that Move2Mac did for $45 was to move my \\"My Documents\\", \\"My Music\\" and \\"My Videos\\" files....I could have done that for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well the first time; one-use software","review":"I used Move2Mac to migrate my Windows sytem to my new iMac.

So of course, I got Move2Mac to move everything except my music. It did not appear to recognize that I had anything in my music folder on my PC, and therefore did not move the hundreds of MP3s. I tried everything I could think of--and spent a good few hours on it--and then gave up. Considering that they advertise that it moves everything including music files, I was pretty annoyed. I don't know whether others have had this problem; maybe I'm the only one.

That is a joke. I had about 100 photos and 1000 MP3's (which I do not think is that far above average) and my estimated transfer time was 550 minutes. For the price it almost would have been worth it just to spend the time burning everything to CDs.Note that this product does not transfer programs, only your files. So you must install each program that you wish to transfer files of onto your Mac as well.I also had some issues of connecting both laptops to the internet and tried to opt to do the telephone option for verifying the license code. I waited on the phone for over half an hour to talk with a representative before I finally gave up.Before starting the project, make sure you have a lot of time to allow the files to transfer as you cannot shut down either computer during the transfer time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Very disappointed in this product.

Stop complaining...if it's not for you change the channel but don't bash the show just because you cannnot see the humor in a dysfunctinal family. The acting is great and so are the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST \\"Shameless\\" Comedy Satire Ever! LOVE IT!","review":"I just love this series. The best life satire of all times... it's funny, offbeat, graphic drama follows the lives and loves of the Gallagher family/ friends in a small neighborhood in Manchester. The mother figure of the family is big sister Fiona and her siblings who she looks after-- Carl, Ian, Debbie and baby Liam, by the way, the father is a total drunk SOB. Their chaotic lives of sexual adventures of all sorts, love and deception are a hilarious mockery of the world family as it is today. I laughed at the travesty of it all...it definitely was the most entertaining parody of life--dysfunctional at its finest! ...now, this is real life depicted. Just brilliant! Highly recommended for adult viewing! LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"This turkey glorifies alcoholism. The father abandons his children to slobber booze, fight and pass out wherever he ends up. The daughter mothers the other children, gets drunk and screws whatever strikes her. The rest of the children are liars and thieves. The only thing missing is the abuse that the alcoholic father should be perpetrating. They have reduced sex to the rutting of pigs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series I've seen in a few years.","review":"I won't argue with the others. This is a 5 star season/series. Maybe I was due for some British tele, but I soaked these 7 episodes up like a sponge. Shameless is very adult, very funny, and very well written. Loved these characters. You're hooked after the first episode. Frank the protagonist is the guy you love to hate, and all his kids you love to love. The accents and some humor are quite British, but they have all the same problems and issues any American might have. It was easy to relate to, though my family wasn't near as chaotic as the Gallaghers.I've enjoyed other shows on DVD recently, such as Weeds, Dexter and Californication. Shameless is more of everything, not less. Glad I found it at Goodwill for three bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME series","review":"The complicated life of the Gallagher family! They get by doing anything it takes. Even kidnapping a woman from the old folks home, and adopting her for awhile to prove Aunt dead Ginger is alive (for her SS check). Aunt Ginger is delightfully forgetful and sweet. The youngest female falls for her, but they have to take her back. Every character is featured in this whimsical show in every series about a big family being taken care of by Fiona, the eldest. Dad is an alcoholic, and Mom left for another woman. So many funny and dramatic incidents in this well-thought-out and well-made series. I would give it more stars if possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Shameless","review":"After spending one episode with this family I had to get season 1 on DVD.

Slatkin + Swan Lake = fine performance. But the orchestral playing is the real star here, leaving many a recorded version, including Dorati (and esp. Abravanel's) totally in the dust. I can listen to this just to wallow in the string tone. I wish Slatkin had brought just a tiny bit more to the score; then this would be a recording for the century.

They do a very good job of explaining economic terminology and giving examples to explain various concepts. This is a worthwhile start for someone who wants to learn more about economics. The authors admit from the beginning that they personally have a liberal bias. I think that admission is admirable. Honestly they do a good job of trying to argue for both sides of the issue. However, their personal liberal views do come out at times. This book should probably be accompanied by one from either Thomas Sowell or Milton Friedman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Did The Newest Edition Shrink?","review":"I'm still reading this book, which so far is exactly what I want - a general overview of how the economic system works. This subject put me to sleep in college, but now that the economy directly affects what happens to my job (or future job), I need to pay more attention.Something worth noting: the various editions of this book are quite different. First I found a damaged copy cheap at a book store, then I found a better copy at a used book store. But when I compared them, I found out that the newest edition (4th) was thinner than the one before it. I'm reading the fatter, older one now. Later I'll compare them to find out what's changed.

My Wusthof knives rusted in less than a week and it got to a point (after much procrastination) that I had to pack them up and ship them back to Amazon. They were pitted and covered in rust.These gorgeous, NEW knives, however, are holding up beautifully and feel great in the hand! Not a lick of rust to be seen.The metal is substancial feeling and I don't mind the \\"plastic\\" handles. Wood is known to harbor bacteria anyway.

The kids had a lot of fun hitting it with a small wooden baseball bat, and then after everyone had a turn or two, I let them take turns pulling the strings to open it. Just so happened that the B'day boy pulled the right string, which was an added bonus. Candy came out pretty easily, including some toys and confetti I put it, although it did leak some of the confetti inside the house when I used it as a centerpiece on the table, so keep that mind if you decide to go that route.After the kids had their fun, the two strong guys decide to beat the daylights out of the pinata, and I will tell you, that thing took a LOT of whacks before coming apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"I purchased this for my daughters 7th birthday party.

Meanwhile, \\"Grab It Attack It\\" inches towards funk and \\"Gap Accelerator\\" moves into some thick breaks. \\"Infrangible\\" has an industrial edge to augment the hard-set snare drums. The pure rhythm of \\"Drums in Friction\\" establish an unconquerable groove, but the crystalline downtempo of \\"Mirage\\" and \\"Frozen Reminiscence\\" restore a sense of calm. \\"Moonquake\\" merges the beats and the atmosphere, while \\"Sneaking Shadows\\" slips into noir funk.

Garth Brooks makes a wonderful transition from country singer to pop singer. Where most people thing this could be his downfall, i think Brooks could boost his super-star career even higher, being one of the only country super-stars to turn to pop music, and survive.

Practice with vocabulary words with pictures and simple phrases. This one had fill in the blanks, but the long sentences were in Greek and the multiple choises for the blanks were in Greek. No pictures, no hints. My boyfriend (Greek) made the comment, \\"Do they expect all the buyers to have a Greek boyfriend to teach it to them?\\" Obviously, I should have bought the text book to go with it, but that might have been too advanced as well.

I had never heard of the author or knew much about California's early history into the 1950's, but this collection of well written essays tells you everything you might want to know about the political, religious, historical and moral climate of California from the gold rush days to the 1940's. The essays are written from the 1920's through the 1940's and show the historical pespective of one who has lived during this time and is immensely knowledgeable about the climate of what is happening on all fronts.

It is more a discourse on the cultural attitudes of western European travellers (a topic already done to death by other academics over the past twenty years) than it is an original study of Ali Pasha.

No doubt this reformulation will appeal to some readers, but for many this will be a book to slog through."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's OK","review":"I'm a little surprised at the reviews saying this amp is plenty loud. It doesn't seem very loud to me. For a practice amp, it's OK. The various amp models are handy, I suppose, but not as useful as say, a number of guitar amp models are on a guitar amp. One of them is a hidden model, rather than something on the knob; you have to know which buttons to push to replace one amp model with the hidden one. The manual explains that. The synth seemed more like a fun toy than something I could get consistently good effects out of. Volume varies a lot between the amp models on the 110. If Amazon's current price is good for this amp, it's a very compact but decent practice amp, or (as the name suggests) studio amp or performance amp as long as you're running it into a larger system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great practice amp","review":"Just starting out and I got this as a practice amp.

A man who larded his board of trustees with non-entities to whom he doles out over $30 million worth of business every year in exchange for the USA's highest university president salary? He whined his way into a no interest loan - later forgiven completely - because living in the president's house had excluded him from the housiing market?! He once proposed taking our insurance policies on BU students, quipping that, in some cases, their deaths would be the only contribution they'd ever make. And of course, the final indignity - a $2 million payout to his hand-chosen successor whom Silber had fired before he ever started the job. Other universities that started at the same point that BU in the 1970s have gone much further than BU. Silber has stunted the university for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt a little cheated. . .","review":"The shipping was more than the product---the seller was Canadian, and at the time the dollar was more favorable, but the seller did not convert the $.I spilled coffee on my mac and this little gadget saved me a whole lot of headache. . . durable, rinses well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great player but drains batteries","review":"This is a really good MP3 player & USB storage device. I bought the previous version and this one with the LCD display is so much more useful.The only problem is that it constantly drains the battery (a problem with the previous version also) even when the player is off. So if you don't use it for a while and leave the battery in it, you will find that the battery has less \\"juice\\" or is completely drained (for you geeks: it draws 700uA to 800uA in the\\"off\\" state). I would guess that it's because Creative is using an electronic \\"power\\" switch instead of a mechanical one....poor choice. Just remember to take the battery out when not in use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile and bad sound","review":"I bought this player a week ago, when I opened the box I was suprised for all the stuffes that comes with it...software, belt, two colors battery bases, etc. I plugged it in my portable and copied some music. The sound was not good enough ( if you compare this with the RCA Lyra's one for instance ) , I tried by setting the equalizer but it did not make big difference. Some time later it started to sound worse, one channel was unavailabled because I could barely hear the singers in the song. I thought in replace it with a new one, but I asked for my money back instead. It's a really weak player, it seems more like a memory stick than a real MP3 player. I love music, and a like listen it very loud with my headphones or my car stereo, and this \\"thumb-drive\\" doesn't work for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!","review":"If you want a compact, high fidelity, and easy to use MP3 player, this is the way to go. It is incredibly easy to use, you just pop it in you usb port and drag and drop the files you want onto it. It also has excellent sound qualitiy (Except for the provided ear buds. I upgraded to new ones.) It can hold about 28 WMA songs at cd transparency quality, which is very high fidelity sound. If you dont want good quality sound, you could compress the songs and get about 40 or 50 on there easily. It is also one of or the smallest player on the market, so its good for joggin, running, etc. The only drawback is the expansion, but it's not the most important thing.I would recommend this product to anyone who loves portability, sound quality, and an all around good product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plays tracks in alphanumeric order","review":"This is a great MP3/WMA player with one glaring deficiency: It insists on playing the songs in alphanumerical order by track title. The manual states this, customer support verified it and I couldn't find a reasonable work-around, so it went back. Sure you can manually move from one song to another as they play, but if you want to load an entire CD and listen to the songs in the order in which you're accustomed, it won't do it without interaction. In my opinion, this is a colossal design flaw. The original MuVo 64 and 128 will play the tracks in the order which you load them but not this one. If that won't bother you, the MuVo NX is the one to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume Problems","review":"This product worked great for the first 3 weeks. Now, the sound cuts off unless I lower the volume. I assumed that my MP3's were clipping or over modulating so I re-ripped them using the normalize feature. No change. I have to lower the volume to almost half in order for the music to NOT cut out mid song. With these dinky headphones, I can hardly hear anything.Also, it takes a single AAA battery which dies very quickly.The size is great. The data storage is great. The voice recorder is adequate.

I can't remember where I heard about it, but someone recommended this one to me. They shouldn't have! I cannot believe this man has written 40+ books! Then again, Danielle Steele and Grisham are rather prolific, too. I guess this is one of those authors for whom quantity is more important than quality. Maybe this is the worst book he has written, and it is not fair to judge his writing ability (or lack therof) by this one, but I'm going to do it anyway, because I am certainly not going to waste my time with anything else he has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Even Finish This One","review":"Hate to say I wasted part of a Friday evening reading this book. Cardboard characters, the attempt to deal with huge issues in the space of a paragraph--totally unconvincing. I didn't even care whether or not the murder attempt was successful. My favorite scene was in the hospital when, supposedly devastated by his father-in-law's death, the writer was still able to wonder if his wife had had time to peruse his manuscript for the fourth time. I guess deciding not to ask right at the moment was real sensitive of him! And he was one of the good guys! Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Fast Should Have Gone Fishing for a Better Editor","review":"I really enjoyed several of Howard Fast's other books, but this one is a disappointment. Although many of the characters are interesting, and the setting is of special interest to me (since I grew up in Stamford, CT, only a few miles from Greenwich), the book fails to make the larger point that it is so obviously trying to make. It fails so badly that I'm not even sure what that larger point is. The book is also very clumsily edited. Misuses of words abound. Perhaps the worst example is when the author refers to Sally as a socially inept person who makes many \\"gaffs\\" when she speaks. A \\"gaff\\" is a piece of fishing equipment. Social errors are \\"gaffes.\\" Mistakes like this distract from the story. Mr. Fast should go fishing for a better editor for his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved Howard Fast, past tense","review":"I always enjoy reading Howard Fast. I read everything he publishes. Growing up in Greenwich, I was looking forward to a another good Howard Fast book about town I know. Unfortunately, he missed the mark in his usual writing style. The book never held my attention, It rambled on needlessly and had a very poor plot. It's almost like it wasn't written by him. My wife put it down after 50 pages. After such a wonderful beginning with books like The Immigrants and Second Generation, he should be embarrassed by this work. It ranks up there as one of the worst books I ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Greenwich?","review":"This book was on my list of recommendations and it certainly sounded intriguing. I found, however, it to be completely undeveloped - the characters, the story - it rambled on incessantly and then poof! was over and I was extremely dissatisfied - what a waste of time (and the price of a hardcover!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This was the first Fast book that I've read. I agree with the majority of the reviews that the story line and characters were thin.

This is one of the best Tangerine Dream CD's since the Mars Polaris (1999). Here is the track list:1. La Vision 12:192. La Joie 5:163. La Force du Courage 8:374. La Solitude dans l'Espoir 7:325. La Marche 8:366. La Sagesse du Destin 7:587. Le Combat du Sang 10:178. Le Combat des Épées 14:029. La Libération 4:39All tracks are good. My favorites are the last 2 ones. They are combined into a single one. So, for me, those 2 last tracks together are the best part of the CD (almost 20 minutes).Linda Spa is back togheter with Iris Camaa, Throsten Quaeschning, and, of course, Edgar and Jerome.I will see TD in Mexico City.

The book arrived more quickly than expected and in excellent condition. My husband tells me the translation is good (I have to take his word on this). My in-laws were thrilled to receive it and are looking forward to bonding with their granddaughter as they share this book with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A humble film for a humble King","review":"The Nativity Story is not the 'epic' biblical story so many reviewers were expecting. Just as the Son of God came into the world in the most lowly and humble of cicumstances, I believe this movie reveals the story of the birth of Jesus Christ in just that way. It's majesty is in it's simplicity. It's beauty is in it's humility. A Christmas Classic for the ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord works in strange and inconvenient ways.","review":"The great thing about this movie is that it shows the unfolding of the events surrounding the birth of Christ is something like \\"real time\\". We get to see day-to-day life in Nazareth, and how the lives of Mary, Joseph, Elizabeth, and their families were impacted by Mary's pregnancy and the attempts by the Romans to keep the Messiah from being born.I thought the sets were great, the photography beautiful, and the soundrack very appropriate.My one criticism is that the acting was for the most part dry and emotionless. It's like there wasn't a lot of acting in the acting, if that makes any sense.Certainly worth seeing once, epecially for Christians, but as for me I don't think it will be one of the movies that will be come a Christmas tradition. Once through is enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie to watch at Christmas time","review":"Very realistic dramatization of the events leading up to Jesus' birth.

I can only imagine it might have been that way for them at the time.

I recommend this film to anyone who wants to enjoy the Christmas story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Film That Brings Out New Aspects of the Story","review":"This picture brings out two aspects of the Nativity story that are just about never shown. The first is how people must have reacted to Mary's pregnancy when the baby was obviously not her husband's. This is done without dialog -- just the shocked expressions on peoples' faces as they see her upon her return.The second aspect concerns Joseph. He is usually just that (not very important) guy kneeling next to the manger, definitely a small supporting role -- to use William Goldman's phrase, \\"the Elisha Cook Jr. part.\\" Here Joseph is brought to the fore. After being visited by the angel, he ignores other opinions (and no doubt derision) and accepts both Mary and her unborn child. He protects Mary and the child, going without food so Mary, the baby and the animal carrying them can eat.All this is told in a very low-key fashion, and the film is more powerful for it. It's an important part of any Christmas film library. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The nativity Story shows how much God love us!!","review":"This movie inspired our family so much.

Thought the acting and screenplay were great. Looking forward to viewing each Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Christ's Sake","review":"Look folks, just because you are a Christian and Hollywood has made one of its very few stories on the event, does not make this a good movie. I was quite hyped to see it as I think the story is a remarkable one and had the potential to be terrifically recreated.So... I wanted to like it.But it sucked. It was slow, poorly written, lacking in Biblical event and down right corny.I have tried to watch it again and just can't get through it. I think maybe the Passion might have killed most future biblical stories. So remember kids, just because it is a story about Jesus, doesn't mean it was told well...

We were not able to finish the movie. The portrayal of Anne, Joachim, and the Mother of God were certainly less than flattering and based on my recollection of the film perhaps heretical based on what could arguably be construed as sin on the part of the Mother of God. I found it telling that while Elizabeth's greeting is captured, the actress portraying Mary fails to respond with the magnificat, found in Luke 1:46-55. This was around the time we decided to press with a different film for \\"family movie night.\\" Based on the portrayal of Mary to that point, the magnificat would have been out of place, which as pointed out, was telling..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Great things are accomplished when they are done via simplicity.

An amazing portrayal of the Nativity story! A MUST SEE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great depiction of the Birth of Christ","review":"Great depiction of the Birth of Christ. Riviting. It allows you to experience what the Biblical characters experienced. However, as with many nativity depictions, the depiction of the wise men being at the stable does not agree with the Bible. The music was rich and appropriate. The only negative aspect was that at times it was difficult to hear/understand what the characters were saying. Had to constantly turn the volume up to hear them speak and then down for the background music. The words spoken are critical and need to be heard/understood. If they would fix the sound issues, it could easily be a five star movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE NATIVITY STORY","review":"We saw the movie on a private screening and wanted to share with friends and family.

Call it the Christmas card aspect: it revels in the beauty of desert sands, landscapes, and human faces.Others have said it is well produced, with enough adaptation to turn the traditional Christmas story into a good movie. They are right.My favorite Bible movie is still The Miracle Maker, but my wife likes this one best. Give it five stars.I feel sure that some people enjoy giving copies of The Nativity Story. It must be easy to give, good to receive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done","review":"I have owned this movie for years, but someone in my house lost the disc and I had to buy a new copy to finally watch the movie! I enjoyed the setting, actors, clothing, and dialog. The script writer fleshed out the familiar characters nicely. I enjoyed the Maji's study of the stars as we had just watched the documentary \\"The Star of Bethlehem.\\" I was disappointed that the movie was not historically accurate that the Maji did not come to visit the baby Jesus until he was older, possibly a toddler (not still in the stable, or at the same time as the shepherds). Also, the order to kill the babies under the age of two did not come until Jesus was older (when the Maji actually came to visit him). My husband pointed out that it is called \\"The Nativity Story\\" and a Nativity scene comes complete with three wise men. Overall a good movie. I will watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Tradition","review":"This movie has instantly become our family's Christmas tradition. I appreciate the simple but powerful story!

We are in an audio and visual world,and this movie helps us to see, hear and feel in a new way the story we have grown up with. Katie, a 12 year old confirmation student, summed it up. I have grown up with the story and been in the Christmas play from the baby to Mary. This made it so real to me that I could take it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical shlocky Jesus movie!","review":"This is one of the few Christian based movies that are not so shlocky it's terrible.

The acting, cinematography, and musical score are very well done.My husband and I watched this movie a week before Christmas, and then again on Christmas Eve with my mother. She loved it, and both my husband and I agreed that it was even better the second time we saw it! Interestingly, Christmas Carols (both traditional and contemporary) took on enhanced meaning as their words called images from the movie to mind. This is certainly a movie that we'll treasure for years to come as we make it an important part of our Christmas tradition.This movie is so good, that we're planning to purchase several copies to give as presents next year -- but we'll give them away at Thanksgiving, so that folks will have plenty of time to watch it before Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Movie","review":"I really loved how this Nativity story was told.

Quite a bit of poetic license is taken with the journey of the \\"wise men.\\" It interesting and fun to watch (although there is some implied violence that parents should be aware of).

These are not areas that affect the essence of the Scriptural account.Along with the basic story, this movie does a great job of capturing the interactions between Mary and her parents, Mary and Joseph, and others depicting quite well what they may have been thinking throughout the story as well as the cultural context.I recommend this show for everyone.

All the difficulties they overcame, from public scorn to doubting the future, and wondering why they were put in the position they were in. Their relationship is loving, yet reverent for their bigger assignment. They are a team on a journey. So many times I wondered what the two might have said to one another, and the two people who play the roles are uniquely suited for them and they pull the whole thing off with splendor. This is a must-have for any Christian family during the holidays, and a wonderful story to show youngsters as they grow up.

But this film is a dreary and uninspir/ed/ing treatment of the Christmas story, all but ruined for me by the lead actress's wooden, callow performance. Surprising, since Castle-Hughes was so fine in the Whalerider film. She has much the same facial expression throughout the movie, no matter the emotional context of each scene. The actor playing Joseph, Oscar Isaac, gave much more depth to his character--a charming and tender performance.The story itself is rendered in a flatly traditional fashion, without any of the warm beauty one might hope for given the Christmas theme. (I'm reminded of the gorgeous birth-of-Christ preface to 1959's Ben Hur--just a few minutes, but oh so emotionally evocative!)All in all, not much to remember or hold dear in this movie. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise God","review":"I do believe this is a wonderful and beautiful movie of the birth of the Messiah. It's a very emotional moving film, that reminds you of God's amazing power, love, and sovereignty.

When they show the birth of our Lord and Saviour, it might bring a tear to your eye. The 3 wise men were sort of the comic relief. King Herod was a cry baby, why didn't he just accept the fact that God's son would some day bring an end to his rule. This is almost a prequel to The Passion of the Christ. Keisha Castle-Hughes was sexy as Mary. I highly recommend THE NATIVITY STORY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right information for the exam.","review":"This MS Press book does a poor job in preparing the reader for exam 70-297.

What is that noise we hear almost covering up the bad remake? It sounds like a cross between baseball cards beating against bicycle spokes and a steam pipe leak.Well, the steam ran out on this bomb of a collection long before it escaped...er... was released.

I was a little cautious at first seeing this shoe that is retail stores sells for about $75-$80 where I live, I thought that if these shoes really did cost the small amount that they do that they would be used or factory mess ups.

To have this music again brings back simple memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book started with promise but, the more I read, the worse it got. These are some of the problems I had with it:The relationship between John Driscoll and his partner, Margaret, felt more like a business transaction than a romance. The conversations were stilted, forced and emotionless. Margaret risked her career to pursue John, who is her boss. This supposed tough female cop suddenly behaved like a lovesick teen around him, despite the fact that they'd been working together for years.The part Moira, a fourteen-year-old girl, played in solving the case is beyond ridiculous. The professional police task force seemed more like a bunch of amateur sleuths. They needed a teenager to direct them through the Internet and were slow in responding to or investigating obvious leads.The Internet plays a large role in the murders, yet the author treats this vast space as if it's a corner cafe.The book has occasional high points but I had to sift through a lot of nonsense to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm","review":"Hmmm,not very good.Disappointing,as it was long on blood and gore(which doesn't bother me),but short on character development and back story.I may give this author another chance,though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book was so bad I couldn't finish it. Whoever compared this sorry effort to Thomas Harris' books has obviously never read Harris (although \\"Hannibal\\" was pretty bad storywise) - or only read \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" which is where O'Callaghan obviously stole the idea for his detective's comatose wife.Everybody in this book sounds like a character from a 40s C-movie and the plot is ludicrous.Don't waste your time or money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Actually the story could have been ok. The idea of a bone collector is, after all, pretty scary. I read this for the story or I finished reading this for the story. The writing of thestory was really elementary. There was no mood, the descriptions were limited at best, and the sentences were pure \\"Plain Jane\\". Itwasn't all that tense or suspenceful. I could and did put it down once or twice. Read Jeffrey Dever,James Lee Burke, Robert Crais and others for both plot and writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"This book reads like a romance novelist trying to move up the ranks into better-paying mystery/thrillers. The florid prose does not suit the subject matter, large plot threads are left dangling, and the author seems completely ignorant of police procedure, computer technology, and the medical profession.In addition, the editor of this book should be fired for either incompetence or negligence. The book is full of typos and errors. My favorite is the description of a character in a garbage dump climbing over piles of \\"refuge.\\"All in all, this was a sorry excuse for a crime thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"If at first you don't succeed...","review":"Please don't try again. I've searched my memory since finishing THIEF for a book that was maybe three-fourths as bad as this one, but no one stands out. Thomas O'Callaghan obviously did not put much effort into this. His agent should be given some type of award for moving heaven and earth to get THIEF published in the first place. O'Callaghan's writing style is so syrupy and disgusting and dramatic that each time I began reading again, I had to make sure I hadn't picked up one of my sister's bodice-rippers. THIEF is just plain bad. Period. He's overly-descriptive, which, I suppose is just another way of saying he's too wordy. I'd never actually had the urge to punch a fictional literary character until John W. Driscoll came along. If you want a good story about a serial killer with an obsession for bones, try Jeffrey Deaver's THE BONE COLLECTOR, which I can guarantee is where the idea for THIEF came from, whether O'Callaghan wants to admit or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut novel","review":"I think this is a GREAT first novel. I recognized some flaws but the story is excellent and kept me reading despite the typos (which are NOT the author's fault) and some technical errors concerning computers. I had a good several hours' worth of reading and I am looking forward to Mr. O'Callaghan's next novel featuring Lt. Driscoll. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who likes crime novels, especially about serial killers and how they are caught. This was one sick [...] and I think the author showed how he became the monster he was very adeptly (without making the reader pity him - after all, not every kid from an abusive family becomes a serial killer). I really liked the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fast paced thriller","review":"When I first began to read this book, I thought it would be too gruesome for me. But the plot moves fast, and knowing who the killer is from the beginning helps make it a fantastic read! A refreshing change from the average detective/who done it thriller.

Although the stories themselves are pretty good for the pulp novel status. Overall, a majority of the stories in this book are too defeatist in nature. The actual event though horrible and a loss for the US probably would not of lead to some of the time-lines that some of these authors pose. A number of them list the West Coast of the US being over run or captured. Finally, as others have stated the appendices listed are the good parts of this book. They explain the realities behind the attack, a time line of the attack, and finally an explanation of possible alternitives and the chances of them affecting the outcome of the attack. Possible better alternative histories of the attack on Pearl Harbor could be found in the book \\"Rising Sun Victorious\\" or in the books \\"What-IF and What-If 2\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"teaching local culture","review":"I found this book invaluable in developing a program to teach my third graders about the local American Indians, the Lenape.

If you want to here crappy interviews that you basically know what there going to say if your a real fan and see them record songs that you have on cd's all ready then fine buy the dvd.

But the constant zooming in on pretty boy Ed Vedder's chin cleft got a little nauseating after a while. I just wanted to put the YEILD album on, so I could listen to the SAME EXACT THING, and not have to watch this phoney crap.

However, I felt the same about the Da Vinci Code and look how popular that became."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???","review":"Okay, maybe it's my own fault because I assumed it was a fantasy, as I found it in the fantasy section of a used book store. This is not fantasy, it's erotica. What the heck is with this book?! I only read the first two chapters and was really turned off from the story.

This is one of the most fantastic and complete fictional worlds that I have ever discovered, marvelous in its rich detail and believable down to the brick and mortar. I've been a fan of Richard Adams ever since \\"Girl in a Swing,\\" and his talent with the English language creates settings and characters one doesn't easily forget. This is unique among the fantasy novels that I've read, in that it doesn't create a stereotypical sword-and-sorcery kind of world. The Beklan Empire is utterly believable, and the political intrigue serves to provide even more credible, seemingly historical detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"On my top 5 list of books","review":"I just reread Maia and again couldn't put it down.

Truly a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book begins slow but blossoms after the first chapter.","review":"One of the most enjoyable books I have ever read was \\"Maia\\" by Richard Adams. The first chapter begins rather slowly but the reader with patience will enter into a unique world of intrigue, danger, suspense and love.This book is difficlult to obtain at this time but I am hoping for a rerelease of this title. It would also make a very interesting movie. To read this book now, try the local library in your area. Other books by Richard Adamsare also intrigueing and totally different in atmosphere like \\"Watership Down\\" which has just about reached classic status."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but definately not Adam's best.","review":"I must admit this book took me several months to read. However, the book is written in a way that one can put it down and pick it up several days later without feeling lost. One reason it took me several months to read was due to the very strong sexual presence the book had in the beginning (first 230 pages). After getting past the strong sexual content of the book, I found it to be very engaging.Maia is a very lovable character. She is someone who you want to succeed. While falling in love with the character of Maia you are immersed into a story that involves power struggles, politics, the falling of an empire, etc.The author is very detailed, although at times the book becomes too detailed.Overall, I liked this book. However, I would not say that it is my favorite book that Adam's has written. It is not Watership Down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sparse, but effective.","review":"Not as lush, or as many lyrics to be found here as in other Calla releases. Wasn't entirely certain what this would sound like, and was a little surprised by it. More elctronic drums and noises; very very sparse arrangments of guitars/bass; and the drums barely keep a rhythm. Maybe after a bottle of cough syrup night time formula and a nice cosy hot bath, this might just hit the spot but as a casual listen it almost becomes musical wall paper, and certainly isn't recommended as driving music (where as Scavengers and moreso Televised are).Hmm, sounds a tad negative, well not really it's a good record and stands up well in amongst my other Calla records, you can tell it was a band with plenty of good ideas, and a real sense of space, so I fully recommend it especially at a reduced price and with the addition of bonus live material."},{"rating":"1","title":"focuses on tactics, not strategy","review":"I am an advanced excel user who did not gain much from reading this book.I have the following issues with the book -1.

Sure I can look out for issue x, y, or z, but in what situations would those issues come up in the first place?3.

Mr. Roeper merely cobbled together a bunch of stories from internet and print Urban Legend sites and made himself a book, and the whole mess is so pretentious and badly written that it's nothing less than shocking. I've never, ever seen such a poor compilation of urban legends. He debunks true stories, exaggerates false ones, misstates facts, and even writes himself into an urban legend. He couldn't have spent more than a couple hours on the internet researching this mess.

In Hollywood Urban Legends, Roeper has compiled some of the most interesting legends about Hollywood and its stars, from Lucille Ball and John Wayne to Eminem and Tom Green, and has debunked them all. There is something for everyone here, all in one place. What makes this book great is Roeper's writing expertise and his wit. His humor and natural storytelling ability make this book a fantastic read, over and over again. Roeper is a true master.

Miracle was fantastic. In just over 2 hours, they show a great progression, from the drive and motivation of Herb Brooks bringing together a unique lineup of players (several who greatly dislike each other) and mold them into a team like no other. The hockey action is top notch, and you will find yourself cheering along at the end. This is a movie for everyone, and everyone should see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie I have Ever Seen","review":"The film was great.

I remember watching every game on television, and feeling so proud of that team. I have been to Lake Placid and stood center ice in the arena, and it is indeed a very special place.The movie MIRACLE captures the story very well. We get to know the players and the coaches behind the famous story, and what makes them tick. This is also a GREAT movie for families, for anyone who loves hockey, or who wants to relive those glorious days at Lake Placid. WELL worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle","review":"Despite our knowing the outcome, \\"Miracle\\" keeps us riveted right up to the final buzzer, revisiting a glorious moment in the storied history of the Olympics without resorting to all the familiar underdog-team clichés. Russell, assured in his role as Brooks, is ably supported by Patricia Clarkson, as his wise, supportive wife, Patty; Noah Emmerich as assistant coach Craig Patrick; and Eddie Cahill as team leader and goalie Jim Craig. Full of humanity and fun period detail (just check out Kurt's haircut and wardrobe!), \\"Miracle\\" scores as a first-rate family film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allowed me to relive the 70s and feel good about it","review":"This is a great movie for the entire family. While watching I got to explain certain aspects of modern history to my kids and remember where I was when Carter took office, when the hostages were taken and when the Cold War dictated Olympic boycotts.Kurt Russell does a great job with the Minnesota accent. And, come to think of it, the hockey players put on their appropriate Northern and Bostonian accents as well, adding to the credibility of this retelling.It's a feel good film without being sappy. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I could watch this movie a thousand times and never get tired of it! I watched the original games on TV and get the same feeling of excitement while watching this movie. The movie demonstrates the time and effort that was given by all involved to make that \\"miracle\\" happen. It's interesting and entertaining, as well. Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: incredible.","review":"But, since you can't have a review with just the one word, I'll expand on it a bit.This film succeeds in capturing the atmosphere of the period. Americans were emotionally exhausted in those days, and Herb Brooks et al gave us something we desperately needed: a reason to believe that life would get better. That we would recover from the \\"malaise\\" that affected the entire country.Kurt Russell is absolutely outstanding as Brooks. The hockey scenes are meticulously recreated, and I liked the touch of having Al Michaels and Ken Dryden's commentary throughout the Olympic matches.Without hesitation, I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, boring movie.","review":"My 10 year old wanted to rewatch it.

I remember so clearly where I was when we defeated the Russians - watching in my livingroom with my family. We got so excited jumping and screaming \\"USA\\"..and they hadn't won the gold -- yet!(sorry if I spoiled that for anyone who has no clue about this story). It was such a difficult time for the United States - gas shortages, the Iranian hostage crisis and these 'boys' made us forget that for a hockey game...it really brought the nation together.I recommend this movie to absolutely anyone! Definitely a movie that motivates you to strive to be the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting memories","review":"My husband and I really enjoyed watching this rendition of the 1980 Olympic hockey game between U.S.A. and the Soviet Union. I remember that time and was in Lake Placid area then. (We attended a different hockey game there; in our experience, it's definitely better to watch a game on a DVD. There were a lot of problems with \\"reserved\\" seats.) It was very exciting and even though the film may have some inaccuracies, I still loved watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Rizzo!","review":"This movie is based (loosely) on the 1980 Olympic victory of the USA Mens Hockey team. The main character in the movie is Herb Brooks (played by Kurt Russel). The hockey games are filmed more realistic than in anyother movie that involved hockey that I've seen. I recommend this to anyone that is a huge fan of hockey. This is not to be confused with the movie \\"Miracle on Ice\\" from the eighties based on the same story, starring Steve Gutenburg as Jim Craig, the goalie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Kurt Russell was superb as Herb Brooks. I never realized what a intelligent and amazing man Herb Brooks was until I watched this movie. I didn't get to see the original Olympic win against the Russian hockey team in Salt Lake, I think I was like 2 or something, but this movie really captured that special moment. This movie will bring a tear to your eye, even way before the ending. The DVD special features are great too! It shows how they casted the actors who portrayed the players, it has a round table discussion with Kurt Russell and some of the original guys, footage of Herb Brooks, outtakes and other little treats. It's amazing at what the players went through and what the actors went through! Awesome sound, awesome filming!!!!! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced fun.","review":"This is the second Disney live-action film in recent months which I expected to be mediocre but was, instead, really good (Pirates of the C was the other).Kurt Russell's Oscar-quality performance and the terrific soundtrack drive this film forward with an exciting momentum. The film only drags when the side plot involving Brooks' wife comes into play. Thankfully, the director does not linger on this element for very long - most of the screentime going to Brooks' putting his players through the furnace in order to forge a team.I highly recommend this film as an exciting, emotional, intelligent and wholesome piece of entertainment grounded in historical reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is a \\"Miracle\\"","review":"with all the stuff that is going on in the news and world Today I.E. Michael Jackson and His sister. Peterson trial and all the news from over seas, this movie will make you forget about all things for the moment. I really liked Miracle even though i do not like hockey. during the movie I kind of imagined myselfin the ice rink in uniform with all the slushing of the ice and the puck being hit around the rink. it is one feel good movie. If you like or if u have seen the Rookie, Mighty ducks I & II and MVP (Most Valuable Primate) \\"your sure to like this one\\"even if the critics put this movie down, 1. they do not know what they are talking about or 2.

They got the look and feel perfectly right. The hairstyles and clothing were right on and it was fascinating to find out the behind the scenes things that went on while putting the 1980 Olympic hockey team together. Kurt Russell was excellent as Herb Brooks and while you didn't get a lot of character development with the players, they all did a good job in their roles and you really believed they were hockey players. The hockey scenes were so well shot, you thought you were watching the actual game and the use of the real soundtrack of Al Michaels legendary call of the game was a real treat. If you watched this game live back in 1980, Miracle will take you back there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED MIRACLE","review":"I absolutely loved this movie. I have never been so into a movie before. I felt like i was at the USA VS Soviet game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word: Wow!!","review":"I just got back from seeing \\"Miracle\\" and all I have to say is wow. It was an absolutely incredible story. It's necessary for every American to see. If anyone has ever felt any sense of pride in being American you must see this movie. The movie means a lot more to ppl who know the story and what these kids did for this country in 1980. I had to do a project on this for my sport class last semester and it was amazing to find out how much the victory over the Soviet Union lifted the spirits of America. It made ppl feel good about being Americans again and this movie captures it perfectly. I've seen a lot of good movies in the past few years and this is definitely one of the best. I hope that you will take the time and money to see this movie because it is well worth it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle","review":"Great movie based on a true story.

No amount of words can save any credibility for such an awful film. Stick with a better film about a better underdog \\"they call me bruce\\". Besides, we know the soviets should have won that game. Why else would they pull out the worlds number one goalie. It wasn't to win. America needed a turn and Russia gave them one. In return, the cold war blew over. This movie does not focus on the real issues that mattered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total American Crap.","review":"This movie ignores all the other teams that played in the olympics and focuses only on America. Which I suppose we should except from America. Second this film ingores all the corruption that even allowed the Americans to win the game. Stupid over glorified movie not worth watching. The Soviets are the true winners of that game not the Americans. This movie is full of lies. I find it funny how in American movies America always wins. Americans stop being sheep."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was no miracle","review":"this is not an honest portrayal of what really happend. The whole subplot with how the soviets agreed to take a dive in order to ease relations between our nations was never there. Furthermore there were no scenes depicting how abusive this coach was with his family and what fueled him to be on the olympic team. The soviets deserve better treatment than how this movie treats them. To beleive the USA really won this match fairly is like saying disney's mighty ducks can really fly. pure, false, garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"a white miracle","review":"The americans cheated in every way possible. How can anyone except this worthless made up plot. Most of us were watching soul train while this game went on and nobody cared. Kurt Russel's performance was ok but I think Wesley Snipes could have done the part better. The Hockey scenes could have been shot better but unfortunately there was no good hip hop music to back it up. In summation, I would have to say if you want to chant USA USA make sure you don't wake your neighbors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hockey mom","review":"This is one of my family's favorite movies.

Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery, Alaska is a better hockey movie","review":"Don't get me wrong, this filmed moved along okay, but it's certainly not the edge-of-your-seat movie that many here are saying. The story of the 1980 US hockey team is one that will always be remembered. However, this movie misses on several levels. The actors playing the parts of the US hockey team seem to have no real acting experience (and the sometimes lame dialog throughout also hurt the film). Kurt Russell was great in Breakdown, so there's no denying he is a fine actor...but he should have not tried to re-create a faux Canadian-accent for the film. And the dubbed-over Al Michael's play-by-play took the last bit of enjoyment from the film (he is annoying enough to listen to on MNF, and now you have to hear him in this movie).If you want to see a great underdog hockey film, rent Mystery, Alaska. That one really keeps your interest all the way thru."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you Disney and Buena Vista","review":"Great movie, bad DVD.Look at the back of the package.

Yes they picked the guys that can play hockey and were able to get nice shots that they would not be able to get with stunt doubles. But that was at a huge cost to acting ability. And they choregraphed some nice plays, but in the end the whole thing plays a lot more like a documentary than a dramma. Thats aside from the cheap and weak attempts to villify the soviet team. And that is why this film is a failure. It does not go beyond what you can get from any of the documentaries on the Miracle. Do not waste your money. Wait for it to hit cable and you will be satisfied with a sigle viewing of this mediocrity. No reason to add it to your video library."},{"rating":"2","title":"How about the game itself?","review":"5 stars for the movie and all aspects so nuff said. How about the actual game itself?

I usually lost it eventually but it never broke. This is yet another case of a big corporation buying up a small company so they can put out cheap crap under the respected name.If you want a pocket comb of equal quality to the Ace, look for the packages of 6 or more that come at a 49 cent unit price.

The reader does get a glimpse into the world of ultrarunning with names, places, and some (vague) course descriptions. Generally, however, the stories fail to take us inside the reality of ultrarunning or the runners themselves. The runners write about the challenges and rewards of their participation in one event or another, but the writing does not distinguish athletes or their events. The reader is left with a flat and one-dimensional view of the sport. The real failure is in the editing. Neither the editor or the publisher seemed to have clearly in mind what they wanted the book to say about this emerging sport, and the individual authors appear to have had little guidance in their choice of themes or style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure motivation and inspiration","review":"I have just started on the adventure of long-distance and ultrarunning and was in need of some motivational reading material.

The bandits draw lots to see who goes first. 43 is upset because she will be \\"mushy\\" by his turn. She is sold to a brothel, ends up in a saloon owned by Hong King,a cruel man who rapes and prostitutes her. Writing painfully too simple.

The setting was accurate but they could have put a couple of war scenes in it but didn't. The book would be good for people who like fiction. This book had a O.K. story line and the scenes were O.K. Lalu's name changes in the book to Polly Bemis. The story takes place in China then in America. The historical sites are good. For example, Lalu's house in the beginning is a farm. One thing I remember well is the manure pit. The family had to hide in it when the bandits came and took Lalu. Another place I remember well is the soloon across the street from Charlie. The last place I remember is Polly's death bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"suriving on your own","review":"This book was good. It reflected the life of Asian people how they survive in Golden Mountain.

The female lead, Sara, ruined this story for me. I have never hated a main character so much. She is hard-headed and has no common sense, repeatedly getting herself into situations that could have been prevented. I think the author was trying to make Sara look strong and independent, but she came across as an idiot who needed to be taken care of in an almost child-like way.

While Banco de Gaia, like many other ambient/techno entities, offers great dance beats, it soars above this basic form, creating something richer than most dance/dub/club sample music--something enticing and addictive that stands up to many repeated listenings...which is not something you can say about the majority of the music in the genre. Transcendent."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding!!!","review":"In hindsight, this album is definitely a platform of sorts for Toby Marks from which he plunged into ambient mastery.

Huge deep soundscapes and melodical texture combine to transport the listener to other worlds. Awesome album. Well worth the bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banco De Gaia - Maya","review":"_Maya_, Toby Marks' first full-length offering as Banco de Gaia, bears all the unfortunate hallmarks of mid-90s techno, back when ambient dub roamed the earth. Marks added his voice to the renaissance of ethnic-sample techno with \\"Heliopolis,\\" which uses the same Dead Can Dance riff as the Future Sound of London's classic \\"Papua New Guinea,\\" but the overall effort seems dated. On _Maya_, Marks focuses primarily on the Middle East (despite the South American title), and while there's nothing here that calls for jihad, neither are any of the tracks particularly inspiring. Indeed, \\"Mafich Arabi\\" suffers from a slight case of cheesiness, a symptom that reappears in the electric guitar and dull samples of the title track. If anything, this album is more of a chill-out test run, a first try that would only lead to better things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big sound, small price tag","review":"I use this in a bedroom converted to a small home theater.

Based on a lot of reviews these were the best speaker option in a 7.1 set for under $300 so i went for it. Fortunately I had them shipped to my mom's house since having this huge box sitting outside my ground floor apartment all day would have surely attracted attention!Now that they are home I realize that they will just not fit with how my living room is configured. I will need to rearrange everything, but boy is it worth it! The sound from these speakers is amazing, and I haven't even tweaked the setup yet.For the price, I don't think you can fail with this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speakers sound great","review":"And I got a great deal on them too.

I'm sure there are much better quality out there but I doubt for this price. Only issues I had was the package had a big hole in it from shipping but didn't hit the speaker. Also, I wish the side speakers had longer cords since I only had one hole to pull the cords through. I will probably replace speakers over the years but it is a good way to get into the 7.1 for people like myself who are not extremely picky. I can hear a little hollowness on some TV shows but does well on movies. I'm running this on a Pioneer VSX1022."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy","review":"Speakers are too heavy.

For anyone thinking of responding with comments saying I just don't know how to hook it up...stfu. I'm sure I got a dud but man does it make want to kick a hole through the damn thing.

We are a professional home Theater company and know this technology. I was extremely disappointed with the performance of the subwoofer. This is is only ok if you are not looking for quality sound. Subwoofer is pretty loose and especially for music listening you will feel the difference if you have listened to another surround system. I am giving it two stars only because of the price point. I ended up replacing the customer system's subwoofer with another woofer. I will update this review in few days to after this new sub breaks in."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Bargain","review":"These speakers do not sound as good as speakers even $100 more expensive. However, they do sound pretty good, and considering I got them for $169 after tax and shipping, I can't really complain. I hooked these up to my Onkyo TX-SR308 and they sounded decent without any calibration, but far better after boosting the rears and bass. Voices can be a bit thin. But hey, for $20+ a speaker, who cares? Also, they are freakin huge.

No sooner than I had the new remote, the whole receiver died.Tried their \\"troubleshooting\\" steps - no success. Seems there are far and few between places that even touch repairs on Onkyo. My local place won't answer te phone [...].

I have also played many games (Skate 2, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, and even Kingdom Hearts II) and all sound excellent! One thing I have noticed about the reviews on this product is how music sounds. I have to agree they don't sound the best at stock settings, but my receiver (Onkyo HT-RC260) has a music mode that use the full range of these speakers. With this mode on, music sounds awesome!

I called my Daughter in NC to see if she had gotten her \\"Christmas Present\\" and she had recieved the same item as I had and again no Amazon box.I called Amazon and they couldn't do much about this due to \\"No communication with their shipping Dept.\\" Unbelievable!They did however give a $20.00 credit to future purchases. $20.00 won't replace the \\"excitement\\" or the \\"wonder\\" of what's in my Christmas present package!!!Better luck next time Amazon Team!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it looks","review":"I bought this red one for Christmas2011. It came quickly. The color is brilliant. HOWEVER that's the only plus point. The shawl is not as wide as my others (I own 5 other pashminas), and the feel is rather coarse and stiff. I bought it for $15, but on the shawl was a $10 tag and \\"Made in China\\" label. I needed it for Christmas, so I don't have time to haggle over it, but I am thinking I'm being RIPPED OFF. I do not think it is made of the real thing, perhaps of cheap wool.

I had no idea of his previous bands and his work as a producer. I bought this record because I liked what I heard on Brookville's myspace.This is some very elegant music.

Although the videos are not \\"educational\\", our children could not help but learn and be inspired by Palin's witty, humorous style. These DVD's are first rate. They are a great way to introduce children to the many wonderful places in the world.

I have got four of these Palin travelogues now. I love them all. It starts off richly enough, but you can imagine that when you get to the Pacific Ocean heading for California and America it might get a little slow. My other complaint is that rather short thrift is given to America in an effort to beat the deadline and get back to the start point there in London. It is a cool idea to try and stick to the \\"80 Days\\" - but the story suffers a bit adhering to this requirement. I don't think audiences would've been that upset! But you do find yourself rooting for them to make it. Quite an adventure. You should go too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate","review":"One would think that trying to best a fictional record from the 1870s would be an easy task these days, even if one has to abide by the same modes of travel such as trains and boats, but we discover along with Palin that it isn't as easy at it would seem. We also discover the joys of simple travel, simple pleasures, everyday people from faraway lands, and such important lessons as how to remove a snake's gall bladder and - my favorite bit - the manly way to iron laundry. Yes, on top of being provided with a fascinating window to other cultures, we are awarded the constant presence of the wittiest, most charming and most informative travel guide ever to grace a TV screen. I love all of Palin's travel adventures but this - his first - is still in my book, the very best. I've heard that the DVD extras on this only include an interview with Palin, but that shouldn't dissuade anyone from buying this magnificent 7-part series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Around the World in 80 Days with Michael Palin","review":"The best modern travelogue ever made!

The journey is mesmerizing, funny, interesting and you feel like you're with him every step of the way.

About a half of the video clips were too offensive for me to finish watching. I did hate to see the scenes of lesbian and gay things as well as meaningless sex-oriented ones. And another half were too boring to keep watching. Some clips are like watching only one still image from the beginning to the end (for example, \\"One More Try\\" and \\"A Different Corner\\"). Can you imagine how boring it would be? I bought this with some expectation because I was a fan of his, but now I \\"declare\\" I am no longer his fan.

There will be comparisons to Peter Gabriel, prog rock and the recent crop of throwback bands, but it's more complex and satisfying than that would lead one to believe.

There's no pow, no bang, no anything. This just makes me sleepy, but not because it's beautiful and transic, but because it's so boring.

The two sets, one with the Johnny Griffin quartet and the other with Rickie Coles' quintet, were filmed at the Village Vanguard in New York. Cole is an enormous talent on alto sax, and his group contains the incredible pianist Bobby Enriquez and the excellent guitarist Bruce Forman. Griffin is a monster tenor player and check out his bassist, Ray Drummond. In a better world, these musicians would be playing in Carnegie Hall rather than Max Gordon's tiny indoor toilet.The film is slightly flawed in two ways. The sound and film are slightly out of sync. And there is too much Cole and not enough Griffin. Cole's piece \\"Punishment Blues\\" is another of his comic efforts.

The author does a great job of introducing many concepts in a way that is easy to digest without being slow. However, seasoned java programmers may get frustrated with the early chapters that speak to basic java while introducing the bread and butter of junit. This is only for the first 150 pages or so. The information and lessons on refactoring, best practices, and junit are well worth it though. The best part of the book is the author's style.

I also didn't recall seeing for 3+ when I ordered this puzzle. The pieces are rather big and the colors are clearly different on both sides, so my 5 yo worked on it for probably good 10-15 minutes and it was done! I'm sure my other 20-month-old toddler daughter will have some fun with it when she's ready to solve puzzles but for now she only likes to walk on them!

Our warranty is a limited warranty and does not cover wear and tear or normal wearing parts.\\"They then recommended that I switch to a model with replaceable blades. I doubt I am going to go that route since it appears that the replaceable blades are nowhere to be found.

Why? Because it works when you first get it, but then performance degrades and within 2 months, its a useless, non-functional product. But now it's too late to return it, the packing boxes were long discarded, so I am stuck with the loss. The only satisfaction left to me is to possibly head off other shoppers from buying a flawed product. This was supposed to be a \\"heavy duty\\" sharpener, but I was never impressed. You had to hold a pencil \\"just right\\" to get a even cut around the lead, and it never seemed to fully sharpen without a few minutes of jiggling and twisting the pencil. And sure enough, after only 2 months of use by our family, it no longer functions: I can't get it to sharpen to a point, and I get a ragged cut around the lead. I have taken to using a knife again. Primitive, but effective. Heavy duty? Well, maybe as a paper weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharpens well but container for shavings too small.","review":"I'm a second grade teacher and purchased this based on good review read here at Amazon. I've been using it almost daily since the end of August (it's early November now) to sharpen anywhere from 5 - 100 pencils/day. No problems on how it sharpens - love that. However I need to have a student bring the garbage over after just several pencils are sharpened so I can empty out the shavings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor reliability - waste of money","review":"I purchased this pencil sharpener and it worked great for a day or two. Then, after sharpening less than 20 pencils, it died and would no longer work. I sent it back and got a replacement and the same thing happened to the replacement. When it worked, it did an excellent job of sharpening pencils, but the poor reliability forced me to return this product and look for another. I would *never* recommend this product to anyone else.

Well, I have one word for you: don't.I generally make my own party CDs from my own collection of music, and even if I didn't have anything specifically Halloween in tone, I could do a LOT better than anything included on this CD, which has a host of no-name tracks and grade Z performers.

My son always agonized over which book to read for a book report, changed books midway through due to boredom, and dragged his feet on the writing process. After a careful reading of Books That Build Character, I chose about 25 books in the intermediate and young adult titles which I thought he would enjoy. As a first year homeschooling parent, I enjoyed the reviews of each book and the reasons they were recommended. My son is now into the second of the books I allowed him to choose from and I no longer have to hound him about reading for his book report! He reads because the books are well written, interesting, and educational. I also used the book to purchase some picture books and storybooks for our grandchildren as Christmas presents.

Electronic Arts outdid themselves in this game's general design and graphics. Start on the bottom and earn your way to the top. A fantastic variety of cars to include Porsche, Callaway, Panoz, and the supreme magnificent driving machine; the Raptor, designed to leave the competition way behind eating your dust.

Not a classic because what they do has been done by other artist before and in some cases better, but that isn't to say that Timeshard isn't that great. Hunab Ku is an awsome elctronic album from the pulsing 100bpm opener DREAM MESSAGES to the 130 bpm closer KCPTC. MIND TUNDRA is an especially enjoyable beatless trip. I wouldn't classify this a Dub, though it has some Dub elements, it is definatley more on the Trance side, yet a bit experimental at the same time.For me it is a cross between FSOL and Shpongle, though clearly not either. Not the best of the genre, but a very enjoyable listen all the same.

While we didn't spend a lot, I found this expansion set to be a bit pricey for what it offers. For one thing, the cross section (where two tracks cross over each other) is flimsy at best. Train usually derails when it crosses that piece, rendering it unusable. I would forgo this expansion set and opt instead for curved and straight track pieces to expand a layout. We ordered a set of 50, and are currently working on making a ceiling train. Fun! Finally, I will say the track assembly is very easy and sturdy. With the power-loc system, the connection between tracks is SOLID, meaning toddlers don't end up all frustrated at track coming apart. This track just doesn't. For that reason alone, I love this brand. This particular expansion set? Not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book is out of print, but well worth looking for.","review":"Since I had been looking for this book in used book stores for some time, then finally got it by placing an out-of-print order with amazon.com, it seemed only fair that I review it here.

Others, like \\"The Last Article\\" and \\"The Road Not Taken,\\" are very original and thought-provoking. Several of the stories have appeared in other collections or anthologies.

Excellent pictures and graphics add to the overall quality of the book. If I have one complaint against the book it is that I did notice several minor inaccuracies.

However, he had the courage and determination to hide in a cave for six months until the hunt for him was over. He then teamed up with a band of misfits to teach his evil hunters a lesson. The part of the evil hunter was filled with a captivating performence by B-movie veteran Jan-Michael Vincent.

It offers fun & imaginative ways to make your little one laugh. It also has a few old standbys!

This author definitely has a great sense of humor, & a lot of energy for his little one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is just dull.

Skip this one for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"The only laugh we got out of our baby was when we threw this book in the trash!!

Her personality really shines with her funny but very realistic series of \\"clueless\\" cookbooks. I received 'Clueless in the Kitchen' as a gift in my first apartment and to this day still use it. This book is no different. It covers all the baking basics in such a simple, approachable way that anyone feels good doing something adventurous like baking a pie from scratch. The recipes are delish, the procedures are clear and concise. There are numerous side bars with very usefull information and at the end of each section, (pies, cookies, cakes, breads, ect...) there is a trouble shooting guide so you can fine tune and perfect your skills. Very useful for any level baker. I very much reccomend this book!

I didn't believe it would be a great game for a weekend, but it turns out it is much better! This game has a very profound story line, and it's characters are amazing, with around 25 to play with. You learn many spells and weapon attacks during the course of the game, with finely integrated scenes and battle arenas. I would highly refer this game to anyone who likes RPGs, and I have given this game a 4 Star, as some of the spells and attacks are a tad tough to learn. If you decide to get this game, you will NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest disappointment of my life","review":"The first SaGa Frontier was absolutely incredible, so I bought this game... without hesitation. I would have been better off buying Soda Caps and root beer. I'm serious. This game is just plain no fun. The gameplay is like SaGa Frontier 1, but with anything to possibly differentiate your characters removed almost entirely. The fighting is pure tedium. The story, while better than the first game, is like reading an encyclopedia. Everything that made SaGa Frontier 1 so great has been removed or replaced.Two stars for the graphics and the concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Your Money","review":"This game is not worth your money, believe me. The storylines are confusing, and the battles are just boring, especially if you have to fight a battle right after the other. I would give it a higher rating if the weapons didn't actually BREAK!

However, unlike Portnoy's Complaint, this book fails to be shocking, interesting, or groundbreaking. It is, as the title suggests, about Rachel, a Rabbi's wife. Rachel is an ineffective dreamer who doesn't fit in with her community, and the Rabbi is an irresponsible, hypocritical, overgrown brat. I hate his character so much that I am forced to acknowledge that he was skillfully drawn-which is why this book has earned one star from me. Other than that, there isn't much of a plot--it's more of a day-by-day account of rebbetzin politics--and too often the author spends pages at a time talking about baseball."},{"rating":"1","title":"5\\" Chicago Bear Night Light","review":"I was disappointed in the appearance.

There's even information on how to synchronize your Palm handheld to Entourage, which helped me a lot when I did a recent trip. You'll be able to find most of what you need in this book, as it works quite well as a reference to those \\"How do I do that?\\" questions. This isn't the all-inclusive guide to Office 2001, but then this is a Dummies book, not one of the much thicker (and much more expensive) Bible series. Especially considering that Office 2001 doesn't come with ANY printed manual, this book should serve you well."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Admittedly, I used Office 98 and bought this book primarily because it is the only one now available. I had a number of questions, including what did the new shapes the cursor assumed mean, and do. Almost none of my questions were answered. There were not nearly enough visual images or screenshots to make explanations clear, and the level was so basic that I'm not sure who would get that much out of the book, rather than Office's own help system.

That should be a good thing but it isn't and I'll tell you why. I can steam a serving of Broccolie and Couliflower in less than 3 minutes. The problem is two fold, one they come out soggy. Second, the flavor is not there. I have found if I turn the power down on my Microwave to 30% and let it go for 15-20 minutes they will not be as soggy but the flavor is still gone.

The only issues for doing left overs that the plastic does gets stained a bit if you use tomato-based sauce or curry in the dish.If there are left overs I use the steamer to store leftover in the refrigerator (I put a piece of plastic under the cover for a better seal).I found so many uses for it, that I bought a second one!

Not enough to turn you into a programmer, given the space limitations of the book. But he covers many key ideas in the field. Including Usenet, email, virtual communities [think Second Life], and the World Wide Web. Naturally, he has to explain HTML, as the graphical language of the Web. HTML is so simple that he essentially explains all its important points. Including the crucial hyperlink tag.The book then segues naturally from HTML to XML. Where you can now write your own tags. Immensely flexible and popular.It is only after this, that the book goes into the traditional topics of computer science. The explanations of what makes a programming language. He uses JavaScript as one example of such a language. So you learn about constructs like for loops, if-else and while statements.The book is really dominated by the Web.

But for the squeamish, be forwarned that at its core \\"The Resort\\" is a gruesome tale and Little pulls no punches when describing the many moments of bloody mayhem and terror found within.Themeatically this book is very reminiscent of Stephen King's \\"Desperation,\\" so if you were a fan of that book reading this one should be a no brainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read worse","review":"This book was perfect to kill a couple of rainy hours.

I will remember this name so that I don't buy another of his books. The man uses the same formula again and again, and it's not a good one. The characters were shallow, the plot went all over the place, and the ending was a mess. Mister Little seems to think that if he throws everything including the kitchen sink into his books that it makes good writing,it does not. Leaving the stage littered with bodies and killing off one of the main characters in the end is the work of a hack, not a talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"I've now read three Bentley Little books -- The Resort, The Store, and The Ignored.

I gave \\"The Association\\" a go but gave up about halfway through because it's really the same storyline as \\"the Resort\\" and \\"The Store\\", plus it was even more ludicrous than the previous two. I see another reviewer called Mr. Little a \\"B\\" list horror writer and placed him in the same league as F. Paul Wilson. This is an insult to Mr. Wilson. I would categorize Mr. Little as \\"D\\" list at best. If you must read this book, check it out of the library or buy it used.

It drags on and on and on, seemingly goes no-where. Little goes into detail on everything and almost like Stephen King <yawn> he goes into too much detail. My advice is to get to the point, and make it interesting. Also, it is obvious by the middle of the book, what this book is about.Some parts were funny and some parts scary but all in all, not a good read. I would recommend the Association, one of his BEST books there, or better yet, try Graham Masterton if you really want the chills. His books are beyond belief!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I read it.","review":"The Resort is one of the worst books I've ever read.

It had one redeeming quality in that it came with a 'satisfaction guaranteed' offer. I'm sending it in and getting my money back.)To be honest, I didn't even finish the book. Around 40 pages from the end I decided I was wasting my time, since it wasn't entertaining anymore. Before putting it down for good, I did skip to the last page to see how it ended, but all I got from that was the satisfaction of rolling my eyes at the author.If The Resort is a 'good' example of Bentley Little's writing, I will be avoiding his books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This book was so awful!

Strange encounters and less then family atmosphere makes the Thurman's and other guest's question what is truly going on here.The hotel has a strange mind mend on those staying there, they forget, they hallucinate, they become highly sexual, they become barbaric. But leave it to a 13 year old boy to find the answer and save the day.By the end of this really horrible book I was repulsed. For a thriller it was even further out there than most.

When you order here, it took 2 months before you get the first number. But what I did not know is that these two months are calculated in the order time, so instead of having 12 numbers in the order you will get only the numbers that come when the magazine starts coming. For example, if you order in February and your order processing takes 2 months, your first number is in April... you would think that you will get your last number then the next year in March (12 numbers, right?), wrong: your order ends January because you actually ordered in February even if you did not get February and March numbers....I am not going to order this magazine again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Helpful Intro to Guatemala","review":"I purchased this book before going to Guatemala for the first time.

I admit that after having successfully done 14 exams in the last 9 months that I am a little mentally exhausted. However it was still easy for me to see that at least 65 -75% of the exam was somewhat foreign when compared to what I studied for. It was not a matter of being completely ignorant of the material being tested but more that the book totally missed the target in terms of preparation. The exam goes into GREAT depth on DNS, Certificate Authorities, GPOs and other aspects, all with a slight focus on security. This book merely skims the surface. The book is better suited to assist with a pratical introduction to Windows 2003.Let me reiterate - Do not rely on this book in any way, shape or form to prepare for the 70-296 exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not Enough to pass the exam","review":"The exam is heavily concentrated on DNS. In addition, the book is oriented on how to do the basic administration of Server 2003. The questions on the exam are much more difficult than the material presented in the book. The book is good for a general overview of the new product. However, to pass the exam you must really dig into the product with hands on the server. A much better product to use would be the Minasi book for server 2003 plus pulling ever resource from technet on DNS. Neither books covers the detail of DNS that is needed to pass the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Micro$oft press","review":"It's typical Micro$oft press garbage.

Susan Gregory tells her story that puts you in the school and on the street next to her, she uses the borrowed comb even though she remembers too late that it has pomade grease on it, she laughs with her friends in class, she yells \\"Hey!\\" when the boys in the car yell \\"Hey, white girl!\\" as they drive by.

There were so many good stories that is was hard to pick a favorite one of the bunch, but \\"The Great God Pan\\" is probably the one that will stick with me the most.The only thing that keeps this from being a five star review is that there were not enough stories included in the anthology, I felt. Understandably, there is only room for so many, but Lovecraft mentioned some stories that sounded so very interesting that I was disappointed to not seem them in the following pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Great edition, easy to read.My only complaints are1) the Relique sonata (C Major) is not in this book2) an early E-major sonata (actually 5 pieces) is in the blue Piano Works bookOtherwise, this book is superb, and it really is a must-have to any library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Pocket Dyno","review":"This is an excellent resource.

The constant references to the trial and how these character looked up to and admired OJ wasn't needed. It didn't add anything to the book if he took it out it wouldn't be missed. The characters weren't at all interesting, actually I found most of them rather annoying. I didn't like any of them. Unfortunately this book didn't hold my attention at all.

Could Hollywood deal with the OJ verdict?) -- but it is more than just that, cause it is written so honestly.

The rail lines and freeways have all been destroyed, so travel and trade is now only possible by air. This lead to the rise of airborne pirate gangs and the hijacking of cargo zeppelins. The North American nations responded by forming their own national air militas or contracting private companies to keep their cargo, and themselves, safe. It makes you wonder just how things would be like if history was just a little different.This is a collection of three novellas, two of which were originally published on the official Crimson Skies website.

When she meets con artist Davy in someone else's closet in the middle of the night, neither one of them is in a position to take the moral upper hand. From this is born one of the most entertaining relationships in contemporary fiction.Faking It is the best of Jennifer Crusie's books so far. It has all the stuff Crusie fans love--lots humor, good sex, food, art, snappy dialogue, likable characters & good friendships. But it also has something that we've seen Crusie move toward in her latest two novels--a strong plot. This book would make an excellent movie. There are so many twists and turns in the plot that I was constantly engaged and could never get a step ahead of the story. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hilarious success","review":"As deep as Fast Women, as lighthearted as Welcome to Temptation, Faking It is another delight from Jennifer Crusie. When last seen at the close of Welcome to Temptation, Davy Dempsey had stolen Clea Whipple's fortune. At the opening of Faking It, Clea Lewis (as she now is) has stolen it back.Although this book shares characters with Welcome To Temptation, it can easily be read alone; the focus is on what happens to the new cast. The quips are as funny as ever, the set pieces are hilarious, and you also get some insights on what it means to be authentic.Everybody I've ever recommended Jennifer Crusie to has thanked me for the recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intriguing and Wild Romp!","review":"I picked this up to read on the airplane and was pleasantly surprised! I expected fluff, but instead found complex, quirky characters with a lot of depth. The story will take you on a humorous and suspensful journey with romantic interludes. The reader really can identify with the characters who are all slightly damnaged, which makes them more \\"real\\". It was also a lot of fun to find out about the colorful family history. It was a lot of fun to relax and go on cruise control with Crusie (ok, bad pun!)I really got a kick out of this book, pick it up - I bet you will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is your man a muffin or donut?","review":"This book is fun, fast paced, engaging, and twisted with anintermingled plot line, sex, romance, family loyalty, and intergenerational wisdom.

It is a quick read and very light hearted."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not recommended.","review":"This book is the sequel to Welcome To Temptation, which was about Sophie and Phin. Davy had a smaller role in that book and now this book is about him. The plot didn't make sense to me. Someone paints pictures and signs them with a fake name in the way someone uses a \\"pen name\\" to write books. The painter in this story felt she might go to jail if anyone found out. That didn't make sense to me since the name she signed wasn't a name used by anyone else. Davy is a reformed con man who meets the painter and more events happen. I didn't enjoy the plot or the characters that much. Nothing surprised or delighted me. Only once did I chuckle at something humorous. I read this because I loved three other books by this author which are \\"Bet Me,' \\"Welcome To Temptation\\" and \\"Anyone But You.\\" I do not recommend \\"Faking It.\\" Sexual language: moderate.

Every author can pen a \\"clunker\\" and this is Crusies.Rated two stars because the English was readable, appropriate grammar etc.Bottom line, this plot is a loser, especially compared to other books by this author.

WRONG! It was NO whereas smart, funny, charming, SEXY and wonderful. I was really let down. It was full of characters I couldn't have cared less about (except Davey, who I always thought was charming in Temptation and his young niece Dilly (again from Temptation) and the entire plot was confusing and boring. I really wanted to give up on the whole thing --- but thought I needed to give Crusie the benefit of the doubt. Sadly, it never got better and never got sexier.The characters from \\"Temptation\\" meant a lot more to me and I think I was hoping for more from them, and an expanded story from the first offering. I was bummed and let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Normally I LOVE Jennifer","review":"but I couldnt even get 1/3 of the way thru this book. It never grasped me.

That's saying something because I'll read almost anything if it holds my interest. I have enjoyed reading the back of a cereal box more than this book. I really hate to say this as I enjoyed Tell Me Lies so much and have looked forward to all of Crusie's new releases. Sure hope the next one's better. I did not really like any of her later efforts as much as her first book. Too bad there was not a 0 star to choose from on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overboard with the antics","review":"I'm a fan of this author, but she tried too hard to make this book funny and it came off lame. It was also boring.

I almost didn't finish it, but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and plowed through it. The characters are so unbelieveable. They reminded me of stick figures. I did chuckle a few times, only because it was so ridiculous! If you want to read a fun, energetic, very delightful action packed book, read the Stephanie Plum series from Janet Evanovich. You won't be disappointed there. You'll want more, when with this book, I wanted to cry at the end from frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start, but worth the investment!","review":"I have found with most of Crusie's books that it takes a while to get into them, and 'Faking It' was no exception for me. However, once in, it was a wild ride! I loved the quirky characters, the movie references, the doughnut vs. muffin analysis of men. The situations were crazy, but fun. I was invested in all of the characters and hated for the book to end. I wish there was a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome To Temptation is better but this is a great follow up","review":"I own most, if not all of Jennifer Crusie's books as she's one of my automatic buy authors, but I must say I really liked \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" better although this was a nice follow up. It just didn't have the same chemistry as the first book. If you like a fun, easy read and have a great sense of humor then her books would be right up your alley.By the way, has anyone noticed this book for the Kindle is the same price as the paperback edition?? I've been replacing my book collection with e-books, but I'm going to hold off on repurchasing this one until the price comes down."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of Crusie","review":"This is by far the best book that Jennifer Crusie has written. It has the trickiest plot, the wittiest characters, and the most charming relationships ever written by Crusie.

As for me, I am busy re-reading this book and adorning my copy with post-its on the cleverest pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Davy Story","review":"We met Davy in Welcome to Temptation, now he has his own story and it is wonderful.As usual Crusie has drawn strong main and secondary characters. Davy and Tilda are made for each other. He's there to save her when she NEEDs saving the most. Ford rescues Gwen, both well-developed secondary characters, from Double-Crostics and vodka. And I haven't even touched on Nadine, Eve, Andrew, Simon, Ethan, Louise, Mason or Clea.Another great read from Crusie."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a fun, light read...","review":"...look to Jennifer Cruise. Hers is a voice that sparks up the reader's interest in an instant. Her dialogue is crisp, funny and insightful. I loved Fast Women and I love this one! The fine mess the protagonist gets herself into when she decides to assume the identity of a famous artist's daughter in order to maintain her family's art gallery is one of suspense, romance and thrill rides. I shall continue to look to this author for a fine reading experience. Ms. Cruise, I applaud this marvelous effort..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Characters","review":"Okay, in a book of 340 pages, there's Matilda (AKA Tilda and Scarlet), Gwen (AKA Gwennie), Louise (AKA Eve), Ronald (AKA Rabbit),Davy, his friend Simon, Davy's family--Michael (father), Davy's niece Dillie, sister (Sophie) and her husband, plus Clea, Mason, Nadine, Ford, Dorcas, on TOP OF THAT, the cat (Adrienne--I think!) and Steve the dog. I wouldn't be surprised if I left someone out. Yes, the book was funny in parts (I think Crusie had in mind a farce), but I was so confused and the characterization was so superficial (not surprising with a list of characters longer than Gone With the Wind's--and THAT was l,000 pages) it took me four days to read this book. Normally, I read Crusie in one sitting. So, bottom line: go to the library if you want to read this and if you do, print out my list of characters. And note to Jennifer Crusie: I'd rather wait TWO years (if I HAVE TO) for quality, which you've done in the past. This wasn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment!","review":"I was hard pressed to keep track of all of the characters in this book! I found the relationship between Tilda and Davy to be forced and unbelievable. Crusie fans would do better to just re-read Welcome to Temptation and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashed and Burned","review":"This author is usually very good but this book, which I so looked forward to reading, was awful. Davy's sex appeal and wit came through early on but fizzled fast. His relationship with Tilda was boring, as was the entire story.As for the secondary characters; there were WAY too many of them. I will say they started out to be fairly interesting, but I became very annoyed very fast with their strangeness and \\"different\\" outlook on life. Rather than let the reader accept these people for who they were, with all their quirks, the author must have thought she needed to push the envelope and make them weird so we'd notice them. It wasn't necessary; they were fine as they were.I especially didn't like how Davy's friend showed up at the door as an elegant, classy and even mysterious man, only to land in the sack with Tilda's sister literally within seconds of meeting her. He ended up being just another base character without intrigue."},{"rating":"1","title":"a truly FLAT reading of a simplistic story","review":"A waste of time...even if all you are doing is commuting to and from work.I listened to about 20 minutes of the audio reading of this book and then lost all patience.Grading the performance: The reading was uninspired and did little to bring the story alive. The reader's voice was annoying. The charecterizations were weak.Grading the author: The writing is as bland and simplistic as Minute Rice. Hearing the story read aloud seems to highlight the narrative deficiencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Worth It!","review":"I NEVER would have picked up this book, not even to read the back. I generally read fantasy. I was shopping one day though and this book was packaged with Nora Roberts Three Fates, another good read, and that one DID interest me though it too was not what I thought. This book is funny and keeps you on your feet. I Love Louise...you'll have to read the book to get that one. And the concept behind it was a good one. Not too mushy on the romance which is a plus for me since mush turns my stomach. I may actually have to look into other books by these authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I love this book I must have read it at least 10 times! I can't really be bothered to explain the story that just ruins it. The reviewer who said it had too many characters I dont get. It wasn't all that confusing its not rocket science.It was entertaining but yeh I dont recommend it to young kiddies a bit on the saucy side at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faking It - Is not a fake :)","review":"This is the follow up book to Welcome to Temptation. In this story it is a few years later and Davy Dempsy has chased Clea to another Ohio town to get his money back... In doing so he meets up with a woman artist who is trying to hold her family together. This is a fun paced light hearted romance story that will make you chuckle. I love the description of Gwen's pointy teeth showing up all over the place. Also the closet scenes are a riot. Tilde in the end survives the asthma, bad sex as well as the forgery past to come out ahead.Crusie again provives a great listen and makes you laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, But I like Her Earlier Works!","review":"I read the first 50-60 pages and gave up. I am glad that I got this book from the library.I found it to be too convoluted, and could not find a character that I enjoyed enough to try and get through the rest of this book. I am still not clear on the cross dresser double personality thing.I love Jennifer Cruise, and have read all of her books, but I really like her earlier ones. It seems like the last couple I have read just don't quite measure up to those. She seems to be trying to top herself, and to my mind, getting so far out there that her books are no longer quite so enjoyable. I generally consider this genre to be \\"lighter\\" reading. Something to enjoy while I relax after work.In this book I could not even keep track of the characters. I just could not get into it. If you are a fan of Welcom to Temptation, Tell Me Lies, and Crazy for You, I do not think that you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money & Time","review":"This book is a tribute (ironic title) to all the people who enjoy really bad writing- silly plot, unbelievable sexual chemistry, and incredibly awful descriptions (ie., first the dog is picked up, then dropped, then on her lap....on & on) YUK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fun read","review":"I always enjoy Jennifer Cruisie, and when this one came to an end, I wished there was more (in a good way). Some of the characters were from a previous book, but handled in such a way that it doesn't matter if you've read (or remember) those characters. Very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art in rare form....","review":"Tilda, the daughter of a family of painters that owns a gallery carries the weight of a family secret she wishes to have disappear. Davy, a reformed con man trying to stay on the straight and narrow. Different reasons for their turn to crime end up in building a relationship from a kiss in a closet. Secrets and sex... restraint in feelings, but as they say.... The truth shall set you free. Once the cat is out of the bag.... there is no \\"faking it\\", it was a fun read!Plenty of characters made it hard to grasp the story at first, but once they all tied in together.... it became a joy of a story to read. Quirky, sexy, and smart is all I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't bring myself to finish it...","review":"This is the first Cruise book I ever picked up and I don't want to finish it. I'm 2/3 of the way done and just don' care what's going to happen. (maybe because I already have an idea)The whole plot seems farfetched and outrageous (meeting someone in a dark closet and making out with them?!?!?) and as someone else mentioned there are way too make characters which takes away from the main characters because you have to stop and wonder \\"who the heck is that..\\" And at the beginning, the dual-personality thing is very confusing; I had no idea who the heck Louise was. And the songs from the jukebox - are they actual songs or made up to fit into the storyline? Also, most of the characters are tennants of the Goodnights...why do they act like family and help out around the building??? Makes no sense to me...All in all, I don't think I'll pick up another one of her novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining!","review":"Unlike a lot of friends of this over-rated writer I was disappointed with this book! I thought the characters were plastic and boring and the plot wasn't even remotely plausable. I'm not wasting any more time and money on this so-so writer's books. It's back to the real romantic pros in the business like Stella Cameron, L.K. Hamilton, or Joana Ross...real romance writers...that's what I'm talkin'."},{"rating":"1","title":"I faked it","review":"My first Jennifer crusie book and I hated it. I was actually unable to read it through and started skimming halfway. The characters are intentionally quirky but uninteresting and otherwise the outcome of their lives is typical."},{"rating":"1","title":"My head was spinning!","review":"Usually, I get a laugh out of Cruise's writing, but this one...there were just too many things going on, I couldn't keep the character straight! I am glad I borrowed a copy from the library, cause I would have been more disappointed if I spend money on this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out loud funny","review":"Read this one in private as it is laugh out loud funny - also give yourself time to read the whole thing as I you will NOT want to put it down. Crusie is really a good writer if you like fun books and this is her best yet - ENJOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have throughly enjoyed all of Jennifer Crusie's previous books, but this time she seemed to be just going through the motions (perhaps the title is appropriate). The story was lackluster, the romance was pretty bland and references to characters from \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" had little context. I hope her next book gets her back on track - unfortunately I can't recommend this one. Check out Manhunting for a classic Crusie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drove an extra 20 minutes","review":"I recently drove acress the country and spludged on the unabridged version of this book on tape. I have loved Crusie for a while but Welcome to Temptation was always my favorite. Faking It far surpassed my expectations as hilarious and well developed. Crusie really knows how to make you not want a book to end. Far better than your avaergae romance and more realistic by the end you feel as if you've made a ton of new friends. I drove 20 minutes out of my way just to hear the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and romantic story about people finding themselves","review":"This book is wonderful. It is about the love and burden of families. It is about Tilda and Davy (who are amazing multidimensional characters), having to recognize who they really are in order to be free. The secondary characters became very important to me. I cared deeply about the Goodnights and their friends. Ms. Crusie always has a sexy, strong, funny voice and this book doesn't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"Great book for believers of all ages! It's a humorous story that kids will love and adults will as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a wonderful book to give as a gift to any spiritually minded person who might be getting ready for a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for High School Students.","review":"Mallory's Oracle is a pretty good mystery novel, however I would not recommend it to my High School students who would try to take Mallory as a role model. She is almost too perfect and inhuman. Mallory does not seem like the type of person to enjoy her life at all. She is also a computer wiz and I think it would discourage students to think they can get to the top by luck the way Mallory does. Everything seems to play into her hands and that is not the real world for most people, although it does seem to work for some. That doesn't stop Mallory's Oracle from being a good book because it is an intersting novel. Mallory just seems to have so much \\"good luck\\" that the reader knows what is going to happen at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh The Disappointment","review":"I read Judas Child, was gripped and promptly bought all the other COC books. What a let down this book was. The characters are one dimensional - even Mallory isn't fleshed out and try as I have I cannot picture her. The plot is ludicrously over convoluted and it isn't all tied up at the end - there are numerous holes. I'm dreading reading the rest in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get a good take on the main character..too cold","review":"I was trying to stay focused while I was only in the 2nd chapter. I stuck with it and finished the book; and I admit I was disappointed. Mallory just didn't seem too real to me. I tried to like her; I tried to understand how and why Jack or Riker, or even Charles liked her. I wouldn't recommend it. I have the 'Man Who Cast Two Shadows', so I am giving the author another chance. My hopes aren't too high, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there anything Mallory can't do?","review":"I have to be fair here, the story wasn't bad and I've read far worse. But I was half expecting Mallory to leap off a building and fly gracefully above New York, change into a cheetah in order to catch an escaping villain, or convert every criminal to a life on the straight and narrow simply by glaring at them through her gorgeous green eyes. She seems to be a highly unlikely hybrid of Jenny McCarthy, Margaret Thatcher, and Joan of Arc, all with the computer brains of Bill Gates. I have to say I liked Charles Butler, but even he failed to save this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new series for me!","review":"Because of this board, I 'found' Kathy Mallory. Decided to begin with the first in the series because I enjoy the continuity and rhythm of a series.The book is intriguing because it does not answer all my questions, but promises answers in subsequent stories. The mystery was intense and altogether very exciting. Characters and mystery were different. Have ordered the next in line. I think I am on to something here....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Not Get Into","review":"I tried ... really. I read about 100 pages and just could not get into this book at all. It was slow starting and seemed to be all over the place. I also tried reading another of this author's books and gave up after 35 pages. Needless to say, I won't read anything by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not make sense of this!","review":"I'm afraid I could not get beyond the Prologue. I read it and re-read it and still couldn't make sense of it! I found it so disturbing I wanted to make sense of it and it annoyed me. So I read parts of the book to try and pick up the plot thread from the Prologue and found it impossible. An infuriating book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a good book","review":"I love O'Connell's recent books very much and I figured that I should start from the beginning with the Mallory series. I should have listened to the reviews before ordering this book. Its horrible. Its packed full of cheesy one liners, hollywood heros and ridiculous illustrations of police procedure.I love female sleuths, who doesn't? But I cant finish a book when the female of the story is impracticaly smart, strong, cunning and overly beautiful. I'm not sure if anyone on earth like that exists but if so, I wouldn't want to read about it.Anyway, I could imagine this book being one of the cheesiest, early 90's police action movies turned book. I don't recommend it, I suggest listening to the negative reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bewildered","review":"I truly don't understand anyone's fascination with Kathy Mallory. What a shallow character! I plodded through this book seemingly endlessly because my book discussion group chose this as a group read. I did read \\"Judas Child\\" and liked it which was written by the same author, but \\"Mallory's Oracle\\" was definitely not the same caliber."},{"rating":"1","title":"I COULD NOT WARM UP TO THE COLD MALLORY","review":"I work in a mystery bookstore and my co-workers, all of whom are extremely well-read and informed on this genre, raved about this book. By Chapter 2, I was feeling tremendous guilt over how much I was hating this book. The NYPD is a topic very close to my heart and I still didn't care. Kathleen Mallory was so narrowly drawn...O'Connell gave her so few redeeeming qualities that I just didn't care. I simply didn't get it....why we should love her or care about her. Frankly I thought the Louis Markowitz character was much better drawn and he was killed off in the first chapter! I have purposefully avoided the rest of the Mallory series because I was so put off by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It changes your view of life forever...","review":"Mallory's Oracle doesn't only deal with murders, but also with perception of life and one's ideas of reality. It is a very morbid book, but not boring. It is different and fresh, but don't take it to bed, you won't be able to sleep..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cold-hearted b**** of a heroine","review":"Hard-boiled detectives are one thing, but this woman's over the top. This first novel introduces us to Kathy Mallory, but don't you call her Kathy! Her fellow workers don't much like her and I don't either. Charles likes her and he's a rather messed up guy himself. We first meet her when she beats up a kid, and though the kid's a punk himself, this just isn't the kind of behavior I'd expect from New York's finest.The story for what it is takes place in 11 rather long chapters and occupies itself with victims and suspects who are difficult to care for.I am planning on reading more in the series, but only because I'm hoping that the author allows Mallory to eventually mellow out and have some kind of honor and compassion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painful Read","review":"This book gave me a headache. It started off strong and quickly fell apart. Kathleen O Mallory is investigation the murder of her adopted father, Lewis Markowitzh. It appears he was murdered while on surveillance to catch a serial killer who is targeted rich elderly woman. After that I lost all interest in thisstory, the murders were shoved under the rug and jerked out at bad points in the plot. Kathleen overtakes Charles Butler house and turns into a private domain for her collection of evidence. She also befriends a senior citizen in the apartment complex that claims to be physic. At this point I no longer understood theplot or care what Kathleen did. I skimmed and then just skipped to the last chapter. I still don&#65533;t get who the killer is nor do I care."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the view books not finished","review":"This book was read by our book club. I could not finish it, about half way through. I love mysteries and never have found one I couldn't finish. This was really poorly written. No one in our book club liked it and all had trouble finishing. I certainly would not recommend this to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every book is moving","review":"there is something about carol o'connell and John Connolly novels that stay with me. i wanted to explain it but can't. Its like trying to explain what tony hillerman and j.d.doss writing does. there is something that goes deep. To say i love the characters they created isnt enough. I would like to know people like this. C. O'connells Kathy her adopted father..the side kick officer...the poker plying regulars. The whole series is great. every book has moments of emotion that cant be decribed with words like good or great or terrific. For me these are magic books that carry me. My husband says its because im scot-irish..could be. All i know is carols novels are bonny...they rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunh?","review":"\\"Mallory's Oracle\\" is a dense, wordy novel that covers a lot of characters and plot threads (insider trading, seances, street life, magic tricks, computers, police procedurals). So much so that I was unable to keep track of what was happening. Many of the characters (Coffey, Riker, the old ladies and the \\"bad guys\\") are not fully fleshed out. The other characters, with the exception of Charles, Markowitz, Helen and the Rabbi (and two of them are dead) are unsympathic and humorless. The author tried to pull all the plot elements together in the end, but it got very convoluted. O'Connell has a talent for writing, but reading this morass of a novel was not an enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews were wrong...","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. The idea of a street urchin taken in by a cop and his wife was an interesting premise...The story is confusing and implausible and the final resolution makes no sense whatsoever. The main character is so harsh and unfeeling that she is very hard to like or root for. There are too many red herrings, a muddled Wall Street scenario and ridiculous events (the drugging by the fortune teller had me laughing out loud!). The revelation chapter was so confusing and poorly written that the \\"action\\" scenes it was trying to portray left me totally disinterested. And I still don't know what role Edith Candle played! Highly disappointing and disjointed. If this was worth an $800,000 advance, give me a pad and paper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD PREMISE, BUT WAAAAAAY TOO WORDY!","review":"This is the first Carol O'Connell book I've read. The basic plot was a good one, but the author's writing style made it very tough to get through the book. It was almost like a high school term paper written with sentences far too long and extra words thrown in everywhere, in order to make a 6-page paper into a 10-page paper!I'm also a little tired of gorgeous female detectives ... how about a little realism? Also, this woman hasn't met a computer that she can't hack into! Come on, without this superhuman ability, the whole story falls apart.Finally, what was the deal with the abused dog??I'll try another Mallory story, but unless it feels more like enjoyment and less like a chore, it will be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was horrible!","review":"The plot was confused (and I couldn't find the point, even after many long hours spent trying), the characters were incredibly unsympathetic (I frankly would have cheered if they had all been run over by a wayward bus in the second chapter) and the writing was trying too hard-- the plot seemed unbelievable from about page 5 onward, and the author seems to want us to believe that Mallory is a Deeply Troubled but Perfect woman-- drop-dead-gorgeous, brilliant, good job, well-respected, etc., but Deeply Turmoiled Inside. We should care? This is one of those characters you just want to slap and then throw down a well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't grab me.","review":"I bought a later book in this seres (Crime School) so I decided to start from the beginning by reading the book that started it all.I had to \\"make myself\\" read this book. I have to agree with the other reveiwers that didn't like the main character. There is nothing to like about her. She's unaproachable and several times you are told she \\"smirks\\" or \\"smiles\\" but it isn't meant in a friendly manner. The other characters are just \\"ok\\" and the plot is a little on the boring side in that the action doesn't move quickly.This being the first book in the series, I'm not ready to give up on Mallory yet. I'll read the rest with that hopes that this first one is just the warm up and the characters will grow with each book. The only positive thing about being dissapointed in this is that there is a lot of room for improvement and I look forward to seeing in the books to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"You may not identify with Mallory, but she's still fascinating","review":"A large percentage of mystery readers seem to want to imagine themselves as the likeable protagonist. If this is you, skip Mallory (don't call her Kathy). Whoever says you need a hero(ine) you can identify with for a successful book, I suggest Hannibal is clear evidence to the contrary, as is Mallory.If you like detectives with recognizable, distinct traits, then this is for you. The book is not formulaic and it is very entertaining, intriguing, and simply a good read. By the end of the book I knew Mallory, and the reasons behind some of her behavior. Reading Stone Angel some weeks later, I felt I was meeting an old colleague - someone I knew well, but someone who would never be a close friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook!","review":"I love this cookbook.

It mainly covers research about certain types of men and some quizes for you to evaluate the man in your life. This may be useful to some, however I didn't find that it had any concrete suggestions or exercizes for then actually communicating with the type of man you are with.

There is nothing in this book that is so special that you wouldn't be able to find it quickly on the internet for free. I feel like I wasted 20 $. I can't believe it is selling for even higher. This review comming from a CA credentialed math teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Informative Book","review":"I loved this book. It is easy to read and is filled with tons of great information. A must for every woman. Tinny and Susannah cover everything you can possibly imagine from clothes, colors, shoes, handbags, hats, underwear, packing, pregnancy and your best pose for a photo. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of my money","review":"I found this book essentially useless to me. I found the vulgar words unnecessary in a book of this type. Too much time was also spent on colors that go together. I was very disappointed that I bought this book and wish I had read the reviews before I did so."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the foundations of how to re-define looks and style to achieve maximum results","review":"If the duo authors Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine look familiar on the jacket of What You Wear Can Change Your Life, that's because you've probably seen them on TV, hosting BBC series shows of surprise fashion makeovers for their chosen targets. Here's a follow-up to their prior two fashion guides, and a supplement to the idea of a fashion makeover which advocates that fashion choices CAN change one's life. Chapters cover all the foundations of how to re-define looks and style to achieve maximum results and get down to the basics of what to wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I bought this book wrapped in plastic, so I didn't get to look inside before buying. If I had been able to look inside, I would not have purchased the book. The title does make the book sound intriguing, but this is just not the case. The pictures were not very helpful at all. I have purchased other books about fashion that were much more beneficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be a thumbs down","review":"If I could I wouldn't give this any stars.

I now know better than to waste my money on their books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!","review":"The best part about this book is, EVERYTHING. I love how it tells you what kind of underwear you need to wear, and all the details we need to know to look our best. It's very easy to follow their guidelines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Informative!","review":"I purchased this book for a gift and ended up keeping it formyself! I thought it would be this boring but informative book onhow to dress appropriately for different occasions. Instead, I laughed throughout the entire book! This is British humour at it's best! In addition, the information was definitely not boring and not totally what I had expected. Neither Trinny nor Susannah have perfect bodies, so wommen, like myself, can actually related to this advice! They start from the basics (undies)and work from there. Worked for me! Sue"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"Having seen Trinny and Susannah on Oprah I decided to give this a try. It had the most positive Amazon reviews of all their books. The book does not even cover what the introduction says it covers. It is a series of photos of their own body flaws in 'before' and 'after' poses with tiny hints of marginally worthwhile information. If I believed that panty lines showing under a garment was the cause of war, famine, and global devastation I might care about their obsession over that \\"flaw\\". I'm reasonably certain that panty lines will not cause the end of civilization as we know it. I have a job, with a certain dress code, so I am evidently not the audience they are writing to. Even women who are addicted to spandex and lycra will find this book frustrating in the extreme. It took one short sitting to read through - every single word - realize it was a total waste of time and money and to chuck it into the recycle bin. I don't dislike anyone enough to 'pass it along'."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is simply horrid!!!!","review":"I have read many style books and this book is the most unhelpful guide I have ever read. You may find this book helpful if you have the same size and shape and Suzanne and Tiffany, no boobs verse big boobs. I fall into none of these categorizes and nor is any advise presented for my size, shape or color. The authors mention that the most important thing when wearing a scarf is how it is tied, however, they neglected to provide any detail descriptions on how to tie a scarf. I have had my colors evaluated on what would enhance my appearance (i.e. spring, summer, fall, winter). The authors, again, informs the reader on what colors look good on Suzanna and Tiffany. If you are not Caucasion, stay far away from this book.There is very little information provided in this book. The pages contain more pictures of Suzanne and Tiffany in various outfits, undergarments, and assessories than written advise.This is definitely a must have not book!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectations","review":"I am a huge fan of WNTW and I am really dissapointed in this book. Trinny and Susannah are the only models and the advice isn't very realistic. The only thing that makes this (maybe) worth the money is the color chapter which shows which colors go with which.I was slightly offended by the constant knocking of black and wearing black with color. Who doesn't? Maybe in England they don't.If you want help matching things (but not with black) buy this. If not, try Stacy London and Clinton Kelly's book or the Lucky fashion manual. Much more helpful tips and useful info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down, now I'm getting another one for my mother","review":"Admittedly, I hate the way they berate women on the show, though I find their advice is better and more personalized than Clinton and Stacy on the American version.The book, if you can overlook the annoying-ness of Trinny and Susannah hamming it up in yoga pants on nearly every page, is full of very helpful, practical advice. It includes the most helpful and nuanced guide to choosing flattering colors(much better than that \\"Cool or warm?\\" \\"You're an autumn!\\" crap), specific makeup recommendations including brands, organization tips for clothing and jewelery, shoes to flatter your legs and ankles, jewelery for different face and body types, and how to look great in vacation snapshots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest speakers","review":"Though these speakers were affordable, I was unable to turn the volume up on them.

There is also no power cable so it will take power from your MP3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I don't do normally do product reviews but I am so disappointed by this product I have to.I bought these to use with my laptop to play audio files in a language class. Unfortunately, the speakers on the laptop are louder. And the speakers on my EeePC 1000H are not the best. Thinking something was up I tried it on multiple products, including my main computer, MP3 player, stereo, and portable CD player with the same craptastic results. In fact, they are just barely louder than a crappy pair of 10 year old Sony headphones.As others have posted, please be warned, these speakers have horrible sound volume.Save your money or buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of four non-powered speakers I tried.","review":"Out of curiosity, I bought four sets of \\"passive\\" (non-powered) speakers:(1) these Philips(2) the Coby CS-P14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5QS)(3) the Coby CS-MP16 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P1VR42)(4) the Sony SRS-P11Q (http://www.amazon.com/Sony-SRS-P11Q-Passive-Speaker-System/dp/B00068E570/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1249963386&sr;=8-2).Of these four, these Philips had BY FAR the best sound. They alone sounded as if they had any bass at all, and were relatively balanced across the board, crisp compared to the others, without the excessive mid-range that characterizes the other three. They are also the most aesthetically pleasing of the four, I think. Take it from someone who has tried all four side-by-side: there is simply no contest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something","review":"These are horrible. I mean bad. I tried them with everything...mp3 player, computer, headphone output on home theater...the sound is so low its a joke. I wonder if these were defective. I can't imagine giving them a star..but in this case its the lowest rating possible. They actually sound better in their new home..the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Deal","review":"Not worth the money. They are alot bigger than I had expected, and the sound quality was not very good. No power drastically affected its ability to play loudly. I bought a set a coby speakers for 5 bucks, that get the jod done better than these. The size graetly affects the portablity of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP IS AS CHEAP DOES I GUESS!","review":"Terrible speakers for laptop connections, actually DIMINISHES the sound output, if you can believe that.

They must know that customers are just going to return them."},{"rating":"1","title":"these speakers suck. period.","review":"ok i ordered these speakers to use in a project and i seen the reviews saying that it was kinda quiet. that is the UNDERSTATMENT of the freakin century. these speakers are rated at 8 ohms at 2 X 1 watts... for anyone who doesnt understand what that means... it means they give off next to no sound at all. it seems like they put no thought into these speakers at all as far as sound quality and volume it say no batteries are required but for these type of portable speakers, they really would be necessary. overall i am not satisied at all and i would not recomend these i would get battery powered speakers or some sort of portable dock... dont get these because they are a waste of your money and i also forgot to mention that they are freakin HUGE!!!! they are like a softball or a grapefruit cut in half."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound really depends on room acoustics but....","review":"Pretty amazing little speakers. In my bedroom on my tv, they are perfect. Somehow, in the bathroom they are horrible and I can barely hear them. But at my office, where there are people all around me talking, I have to turn them down to keep from getting into trouble. It really depends on the room you are in (and I'm not sure what it is about the rooms that make them louder. you would think the tile in my bathroom would HELP but it doesnt), but they sound good for the most part and considering what they are the bass comes through nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"I seen other better non-powered speakers","review":"I received these as a present for my Zune HD. Since I did not spend money on it, I'm not complaining. But, the sound quality is horrible. Music sounds as if it's being played at a 64 kb/sec bitrate. My sister has a pair of non-powered Karmon ones that came with her HP desktop 10 years ago, and those sound so much better than these. It's not worth it for the price.

The first gives some general background information on things like tools and work area. After that, there are chapters devoted to diesel locomotives, steam locomotives, rolling stock and the layout itself. Directions are given for disassembly and (hopefully) reassembly. More important, tips are given for where problems usually occur. This can help.I still don't like the maintenance aspects of the hobby but it is a necessity.

This book is so much better than the movie, and the movie is awesome! What makes this book so good is that we get into the head of the characters. We get to know what they are thinking and feeling. This book also has \\"extra\\" scenes that add so much to this book. For example, in the movie, MJ doesn't get an acting job. Well, in the book you find out why she doesn't get it. I also liked how Peter wrote t his parents in his journals. The reader will also get to know Peter as a child, and find out what happened to Peter's parents.If you're a fan of Peter David, then you have to get this book. His style of writing lets the characters come to life and we care about all of them, even they bad guys.If you liked the movie, then you need to read this book.

I find it strange that the tamp isn't quite big enough for the fill basket, and the scoop doesn't fill the basket with enough grind, making a watery shot. So, I think KRUPS makes this tamp and scoop to accommodate several of their models, causing it to fit poorly on all of them.

We found the books so wonderful, we wanted so much to do all the wonderful things Trixie and her friends did. I started collecting the series when I was 11, I had asked my parents for Nancy Drew books for Christmas and I got Trixie Belden books instead, I quickly got over my initial disappointment and have been a fan ever since. Even though I haven't had much luck convincing my teenage daughter to read the series, I still have the every single book.

I would find it laughable if it weren't for the fact that Rolling slaughtered eight people, including an 8-year old child, then deceived those in whom he confided, Lewis and London, in order to bring his dream of being published to fruition.So if you support murder in general, wish to applaud Rolling for these killings in particular, or want to help him torment his victims' families, then by all means shell out your dough.

London did expose some of Rolling's character flaws (pretending to be a master of karate, his adolescent personality, etc.). Still, I felt rather dirty buying this book because it was written by someone who loves and is capitalizing on the actions of a loser who killed 5 young, innocent people for little more than the thrills it gave him.The quality of the writing is not good, and the draft looks more like a preliminary copy.

Even though they released singles between 1964-67, their early sound is rooted in the Beach Boys pre-1963 hot-rods and girls hits. (In fact, they even opened for the Beach Boys a couple of times on tour) But later on, their sound evolves into a more folk-rock \\"Byrds\\"-influenced jangle, and they have some very good songs on here, especially the excellent \\"Why Be Proud\\".

It also has a song from a new group So Plush \\"Damn\\" produced by Brandy-famed producer Rodney Jerkins featuring a rap from Ja Rule.

I find it hard to believe that all of the people who were mentioned in his book came to this site and re-wrote verbatim their own reviews, all giving 5 stars. More than likely, whoever has added this book copied all the reviews in the book and gave them all five stars. That to me is dishonest!

Personally, I don't think it's quite as appealing as the first book, though probably only a half-star inferior. Perhaps the novelty has worn off just a tad.The new characters are introduced, and as with the first book, there are some frightening pictures of orcs. There is also a most lovely portrait of Arwen. Gollum receives much more treatment in this book--for obvious reasons. Another highlight are the numerous quotations from the Tolkien stories, many of which just stay with those of us who have not read the original books.The photos are great (I was quite surprised by the Ent!), but at times, I got the impression the publishers were struggling a bit to fill pages.

It is deceptively simple the way a simple rock and roll riff is simple, yet pleasing to listen to. There is a level of jazz that, in its overly ambitious desire to stretch the bounds of conventional musical composition, breaks the rules so much so that it is just not enjoyable to hear. Kenny keeps to traditional progressions and transitions but he executes them with simple elegance. I would compare his music to watching a dance couple who are only executing basic waltz steps, but are doing them so exquisitely that it is a simple joy to watch them. Kenny won't overwhelm you with blazing speed or difficult tempos, but he will please you with a good, solid, simple sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ping, Pang and Pong staging - ever!","review":"I have been waiting for this particular production to go to DVD for 25 years!

The riffs are heavy, but bright and bouncy rather than mired in sludge, and the 'experimental' elements are always hitched to great hooks. 'Bar-X the Rocking M' has a killer trombone solo, 'Skin Horse' is both hilarious and oddly touching, and 'Black Bock' is probably the most surprising track in Melvins' catalogue.Less radio-friendly than 'Houdini' or 'Stoner Witch', but not nearly so weird as some other reviewers think. If you want Melvins at their most adventurous, try the excellent 'Honky' -- the next record they made after Atlantic dumped them for not selling as many records as Nirvana -- or the legendary 'Lysol' (also known just as 'Melvins' -- the one with the horserider on the front), the only full album featuring Joe Preston (Earth, Thrones). But there's no Melvins record that's not worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"This ain't your mama's Melvins","review":"The Melvins are one of the few bands to actually improve with the passage of time. With Stag, Buzzo and the boys alienated some of their die hard loyalists by opening up their sound from the slow, brutal, smart metal style they created into something much more grand and kaleidoscopic. This album features(at various points) sitar, coronet, ambient sound ditties, chipmunk styled vocals, and godforbid keyboards. They do all this without compromising any of their massive RAWK spirit. It is one of the most accesible Melvins records(there is something for everyone) and at the same time one of their oddest.Buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe atlantic just has bad taste","review":"i've never understood why some melvins fiends dont like this album. the melvins are obviously trying to expand and try out some new styles on this one, and i think it works perfectly well. it has none of the heaviness of gluey or bullhead and none of the twisted punk of stoner witch, but its still not going to appeal to anyone who still listens to the radio. yoko ono had it on her best of 1996 list, if thats an endorsement for you. definetly superior to honky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and tons of fun","review":"Great value for the money.

While the former is universally appealing, the latter is difficult to translate. Other Dr. Seuss translations have suffered from being too literal, and thus lacking the original musicality. (The Cat in the Hat is a case in point). This translation brings Dr. Seuss to life in Spanish with clever turns of phrase and appropriate (rhyming) use of idiom that still syncs up with the illustrations.

I think it's really wonderful in it's own right; very funny and entertaining. However, it doesn't have that deep emotional connection that I've come to expect from his other work. I'd love to hear him play these tracks live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, weighted box car for your train set","review":"I purchased this car in building my first higher quality train set (not a boxed set, in other words). It's obviously not the finest in quality out there, but I really appreciated the detail, the heavier weight, and the metal wheels. It really rolls smooth over the track, much better than the stuff that comes in the all-in-one sets. A good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb flashlight","review":"This is a top-notch flashlight for a great price. Many other high-output xenon flashlights can be much more expensive. The Brinkmann provides the kind of intensity I'd expect from a floodlight 10x the size. The only disappointment I have is that it uses the CR123 batteries that are often expensive in stores. Online though, you can find CR123 batteries at a much more affordable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and excessive","review":"I am currently using this book in my AP history class and would not recommend it for any high school student. The text is wordy and confusing and often misleads the reader. Another problem is the fact that there is no glossary of terms, self-test questions, or chapter summaries. It is very hard to slog through and even harder to study from. Unfortunately, the Board of Education in my town has made this the required textbook of AP History students. I would not recommend it to anyone attempting to have a clear understanding of US history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I used this book two years ago in my AP US History course. At times it was a bit challenging to understand, but I really enjoyed using it. Now, as a freshman in college, my US History class is going to use the 3rd edition of this book. I'm glad that I really used the book the first time around and attempted to learn from it. That prepared me for college in more classes than just history."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS MY HELL","review":"I am a AP US History student at Half Moon Bay High... this book is dense and lacking any creativity... I would like to burn every copy ever publishedTHANK YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book, Fast Shipping","review":"This product was required for my US History course. I have read a lot of books in my past years of study, but this has to be one of the worst. It is long and boring. It also includes very few optical differences that make learning easier by changing up the view of the content within each passage. Pictures dot pages here and there without much significance. Important terms are not even emboldened or italicized, making for a yawning reading.However, I must thank the seller for the quick delivery and excellent condition of the book. It was much like described and has held up well throughout the duration of study."},{"rating":"2","title":"comprehensive, well-organized resource","review":"I am using this book as a reference in my high school history class, and it is clearly a well-researched, well-written, and easy to use resource. It is obvious that many people think it is too wordy and difficult to understand, but it is a college text and should be treated like one. I would definitely recommend it to anyone preparing for a college American history class."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book, But Expensive and Difficult in High School","review":"I used the third edition of this book, it was only one volume covering from clonial age to the first election of Clinton. This was the book assigned to my high school and AP history class (my setup was weird 4 periods a week of standard High School history, and 2 a week of AP level history). This book prepared me really well for the AP US Exam, while I have not yet received my score, I am very confident I knew the material well. This book also really helped me for the SAT Subject Test: US History, on which I scored a 96th percentile 780. While this book is good for intense history courses, I believe it is too hard for a standard high school level US History course. This is because it covers too much material for that type of class. This book is very well written, and at times can often be interesting to read, what other text books can say that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read me a story","review":"This book is a joy to read because the text flows in such a way that one would think he was reading the History Channel. While that may seem terrible to some, the book draws not just on secondary sources with a \\"hindsight\\" attitude toward the subject matter, but rather engages the reader by reflecting on primary sources, on individual stories while still giving the bigger picture. The incorporation of culural history is one of the main reasons I enjoyed this text, but I also liked how modern finds about certain events (such as the spainish american war) were given alongside the popular thought of the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Biased...","review":"I've never read a more slanted view of American history. It makes absolutely no attempt to remain neutral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long","review":"Out of all 4 Little Touch books we have, this is the longest. The book is 21 pages long (most are about 18 pages), with a lot of stuff going on and plenty of things to push. Like a regular book, you have to read it inorder for it to make sense. The alphabet book and number book you can skip around, but each letter/letters has its own page with pictures next to it.The book is actually so much better, because it is easier to pick up where you left off with out hearing \\"Welcome to the Little Touch leap pad system....Press the Go circle to get started, with a lot of music, which makes a child interested in reading uninterested. I hate listening to the couple of music notes before turning the page, it is overstimulating.The voice on this book is also too monotone, which makes it seem even longer. Think of it as being read by Eeyore (long drawn out words that make you want to fall asleep). One bear in the bedroom is so much more animated when being read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"It is a great learning tool and fun for the grandkids to use in use in the LeapFrop Little Touch toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"great tv when it works","review":"I have had this TV for almost 3 years...I am on my 3rd repair, yes under warranty, but we purchased this tv for a great picture AND reliability. I am waiting on Panasonic to decide what to do as I am told that they will not replace the bulb more than twice. After that it is at \\"the discretion of the warranty department\\". Currently, the majority of my house is Panasonic- surround sound, multiple TV's, phones, etc etc, so I have been a believer in their products.This was a big disappointment in quality, but a great picture when the TV actually works. Buy the longest warranty you can!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PT-56LCZ70 is a dud","review":"I have the PT-56LCZ70, which is pretty much the same. Today, 7-13-11, it gave out on me. I bought it on 12-4-07. I paid $1000 for it. Never again Panasonic. Yeah, so the rep on the phone says the bulb is covered by warranty, but the service is not. I'm just going to buy another brand TV and forget Panasonic exists.Update,,,so Panasonic set me up with a service company. The service company made an appointment to come change the bulb. So I waited 2 weeks. The service company did not keep the appointment. I made another appointment for a week later. A guy came and changed the bulb. The TV now made a strange buzzing noise but it worked so I dealt. Fast forward another couple of weeks and my TV does not work again. WTF?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great picture, while it lasts!","review":"I had bought this TV just over 3 years ago. Picture quality was great, but the sound is a bit low, especially anything hooked up through the HDMI ports. Also, you need to be a USMC sharpshooter to hit the right spot for the remote to work.Problem is, our first service call was within a few months of purchase...no problem, it's under warranty still. Well, then there was another, still under warranty. Now, at year 3, the warranty is up and my 3rd service call technician just informed me that the OPT/TV unit has to be replaced, which would cost almost $2000 to fix! While I don't expect an item to last forever, for the amount of money this cost, I would expect more than 3 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This would not lay flat.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Designed. Well Made.","review":"This product thoroughly exceeded my expectations. Very well designed and constructed. There is nothing flimsy about this rack. It looks good and it performs better. We have our wood stored on this outside our back door. The area is not covered and we live in a very wet climate. The cover works exactly as advertised. Top wood stays dry for use while wood below has access to the air. Could not be happier with the purchase. May even get another one after we have another cord delivered later this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it but my 3 year old loves it","review":"I suppose this is a little scary but less so then Wonka or Oz and my daughter loves it.

After listening to this disc for the second time, I was singing along like I had had this disc for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay, but try the other option.","review":"I first stumbled across this book in the bookstore where I worked. Already being a fan of magnetic poetry, I planned to get it. Then later, in the children's section, I saw the book of magnetic poetry for kids. I got it instead. It costs more, but there is a bigger magnetic surface to work with. Both kits are worth the money spent on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this as a holiday gift for my granddaughter and when it arrived, I was so disappointed that I immediately bought something else for her. The quality and size did not match the cost of the item. The value was not there. The pieces were small and I could not see that she would enjoy playing with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who do you have time for?","review":"Dr. Swenson asks us if God were to ask us to do something, could we say yes? That was quite an eye opener for me! Who ever thought about being available for God? This book did change my life and made me refocus on my priorities. I think our society equates busyness with productivity. Not necessarily true. To the point, the author walks what he talks and that meant a lot to me. If you are not happy with your present lot - this book could be a great help!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Margin has it's cost","review":"Very informative and helpful. This led to in-depth conversations with my wife and provides for practical application to identifying and restoring the missing margin in our lives.

Anyone know how to improve this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What The World Needs Now is.....Margin!","review":"If Dr. Swenson knew me he'd have given me a copy of his book so I could be the prime example of the changes it would make in a life. I especially appreciated his explanation of the differences between life then and now--the world is not just different, it's grown exponentially. And our stresses have grown at the same rate. As Dr. Swenson points out, this is NOT the way God intended us to live. SLOW DOWN--find out how, and how to make your life more meaningful and more fulfilling.

Not everyone CAN give up their second job or work shorter hours. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intuitively accurate, refreshing, faithful","review":"I have read through the TNIV New Testament and am delighted with my new TNIV Thinline Bible. I find the translation in step with the state of the language we speak today and particularly clear in communicating what is intended when referring to males, females, or both. I'm conservative in my view of Scripture, believing that God has inspired it and preserved his Word as our authority for living. In that light, I have found the TNIV dependable and invigorating to read. The format of this edition is also quite nice. The Italian leather has a comfortable and durable feel, better than bonded leather (which always ends up cracking on me). And the typeset is very readable as well. I recommend this Bible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out: binding issues!","review":"I recently ordered this after looking at different TNIV options for some time. All seemed fine. The price was right, the cover seemed of high quality, the font was readable (even to my 50 year old eyes). Then I happened to stumble across a section of maybe 20 pages that were aligned perfectly, but completely loose! Not bound in any way. Very disappointing! This one went back, and now I'm hesitant to reorder, as it seems Zondervan has the monopoly on the TNIV printing.If you do buy this bible, be sure to flip through it from end-to-end to check for the same binding issue. I'm just glad I discovered the flaw while I could still return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meat butchers songs","review":"The orchestra is amazing but I squirmed as I listened to Meat butcher every song. He screamed his way through his ego infused performance and was most often off-key. I can't believe the rave reviews this received! He did not sing one line the way it was written and sounded like a deaf person might sound as his annunciation was brutal."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"First off I love live artist CD's.So when I saw this on Amazon a couple of weeks ago I had to have it.I also heard Meatloaf puts on a powerful live show so I figured this would be a great CD.Error,Error.In the original BOOH Meatloaf sings very load and powerful as anyone whom has heard it knows.This live version is about as soft and lame as listening to John Tesh.There is no power or passion in the Meats voice,it is the same monotone flat voice throughout.Don't make the same mistake I did,save your money.I should have stuck with the live CSN&Y I was going to buy in it's place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Different Enough","review":"Only two stars? Don't get me wrong. I love Meat Loaf, and I love Jim Steinman, and I really love Bat Out of Hell. But that's just what this is: Bat Out of Hell, again.The songs aren't spectacularly different enough to merit purchasing this CD if you already own the original album (and if I was asked to chose, I would easily chose the original as the superior).The DVD, on the other hand, is a masterpiece. Go out and buy it now, but don't waste your money on this repeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks the Big One","review":"If you love Meatloaf's original Bat Out of Hell ...DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!It sucks the big one. Meatloaf's voice has no power here.You will be sorely disappointed as was I.No Passion whatsoever!!I gave it one star as Amzon has no 0 box"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new twist on old favs","review":"Meatloaf backed by a Symphony Orchestra.

They all want to fight WWII all over again. That's why they loved Desert Storm 1. Now they are in Iraq and can't get out of it. The politicians and generals and people at the Pentagon ought to be made to read these books ever few years.A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"British mysteries","review":"I have been a long-time fan of the Inspector Morse series. I treat myself to a set of episodes every once in a while. John Thaw was a wonderful actor. He is gruff, but kind in his own way. Kevin Watley as his sergeant is an excellent actor too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Message","review":"As if children didn't have enough sources admonishing them to obey, here's another 'lesson' meant to be absorbed and added to the indoctrination which tells us to fear people acting on their own desires and ideas. As if people who were free would be chaotic, destructive, and loony.Teaching children to presume that every insignificant choice they or others might make is dangerous to the well-being of society is wrong-headed. It's precisely this brainwashing which delivers a society into wars which go unquestioned by the masses (busy getting liposuction, breast implants, taking steroids and anti-depressants, and watching Desperate Housewives or football).For a culture to change for the better, children need to question its admonitions, not have well-meaning adults allow them to be drilled in. Critical pedagogy is what is needed. You can read about that if you are interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatic impact on my life","review":"This book was published in a bright orange cover back when I was a kidling. I remember pouring over it's poetic rhyme and realizing many moral truths just by it's incidental teaching. What my mother bought as simply a \\"bedtime\\" book has, as an adult, shaped the way I think, and I find myself even saying to my husband, as he leaves the faucet running \\"what if everybody did?\\"As we are preparing for our first child, I rushed anxiously around my parents home for that original version, and although we found it, it was in too much distress to use for our child's moral compass building, so we have purchased a newer addition.This is a wonderful book, light and yet a positive reminder of what really would happen if everybody did what THEY wanted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I read a review of this book in Parents magazine I think and thought it would be a great learning tool for my son. The pictures are in black and white and some of the examples just don't make any sense. My son does seem to like the book, but I don't enjoy reading it to him at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Story With Poorly Drawn Black and White Pictures","review":"I was stunned. Ridiculous results such as getting fat and floating up into the sky if you eat too much fudge. How about mass suicide by jumping from high buildings if you climb too high? Top that off with the most pathetic black and white drawings ever. (Not that I wanted the suicides well drawn and in color!) I just can't imagine how this book could be any worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not realistic and pictures are not too engaging","review":"The cover and description of the book are somewhat deceiving. The pictures inside are black and white and quite plain and not engaging. I think it's kind of long and I lost interest after the 5th page. Every page is about, \\"if everybody did...\\" and it goes on and on about what would happen if everybody did this thing or that thing. I get it, it's supposed to spark conversation about the topic of \\"cause and effect\\" but the examples they show seem more comedic rather than realistic. There's nothing wrong with some humor in children's books, I know, but I just didn't find it engaging at all. The illustrations do not help either. Sorry. Don't mean to sound so rude but I really was looking forward to reading this book and was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Grandmother's Library Needs This One","review":"When I was little, back in the 1960s, I remember finding and reading this book at my favorite grandmother's house. She had a wonderful cozy, corner of her living room that held a comfy chair, her stereo, and a good-sized book shelf. When I was old enough to curl up with good books I enjoyed giggling over this one, along with many others.I was thrilled to see that it had been re-published and made available by BJU Press. I read it aloud to my four-year-old grandson, who is already reading on his own, and he thought it was great. We had a good time laughing over the drawings and talking about the actions and consequences. The second time we read it (on another day) we took turns reading it together.I recommend this book for any home library which children frequent. Whether it's read by the child or to the child, it's a book worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"the kids love it","review":"This book captivated my 4 & 2 yr old. The wording is very simple but there is so much to talk about on each page. They find parts funny and all the while there is an underlying message - i.e., What if everyone picked a flower bud? (Then it shows a drawing of the bottoms of plants only - all the flowers are missing.) It has about 10 analogies and then on the last page it shows how it could be done differently - i.e., You could smell the bud, and eat only one piece of fudge. (with pictures for each) Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Everybody Did","review":"Very good book to teach the lesson, \\"just because you can, doesn't mean you should.\\" I read this at the beginning of the year to my students.

The first one was all scratched up. Although they seem to show that there is a level surface, there is no level position so that is hard to use it as an eating table (my soda bottle kept sliding down to the end). In the instructions it appears that there is a level position and two downward positions. Instead there is one upward position at such an angle that it is impossible to use for any purpose, and two downward positions. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy his book instead","review":"I am a big fan of John Bingham, and credit his book \\"The Courage to Start\\" as a major inspiration to me to begin running and making it a part of my life. Even better (if you choose only one of his books) is \\"No Need for Speed\\" which covers many of the themes but is a more complete beginner's guide to running. John is a fine writer and motivator especially for those of us who are \\"at the back of the pack\\". That said, I found his training log disappointing. Essentially you have a some running tips from John and Jenny (which are very good, but all are found in his books) and the same single page (the weekly log) copied 52 times and spiral bound. If this is what you are looking for, it's fine. I prefer tracking my running and races on an Xcel spreadsheet. Even a regular notebook would do about the same. The bottom line for me is that if you don't own both of his books, either would be a better purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great training log","review":"About the only thing this one doesn't do is the exercise for you!

There have been numerous failed attempts by western photographers to capture this period of history. Shepard Sherbell's book is different. He obviously not only put his heart into every image, he made this work a part of his life, spending several years in Moscow and in different Soviet republics before, during and after the USSR fell apart. His photographs speak about the human spirit, the dignity of the people, their feelings and day to day worries. It is well balanced.But for someone unfamiliar with the subject the advise is - don't try to \\"consume\\" all the images at once. The material is too rich. One has to sink into the book little by little, explore it and revisit it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starkly Beautiful Images","review":"Having traveled in Russia during the Soviet era, I believe that Sherbell, in words and images, has captured the essence of the latter stages of the Empire. The picures and text show a deep understanding and appreciation of the problems of the Soviet system. More importantly, the beauty, humanity and resiience of the Russian people come shining through. It is a terrific photo book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing portrait of a vanished world","review":"Whether or not you ever visited the Soviet Union in its dying days, Shepard Sherbell's photographs will grab you. His images of that moribund nation reveal the darkest secrets of the U.S.S.R. Those of us who lived through those final moments will recognize the chilling faces of a great power in demise. The crumbling buildings, cracking monuments and crushed spirits of a once-mighty state are beautifully portrayed in this book. It's an eyewitness to a land of infinite impossibilities.Make no mistake: SOVIETS is not another collection of snapshots from Red Square and the Bolshoi Theater. Instead, its pages are populated with glimpses into the real life of that now-extinct country. Unless you'd lived there, this is a side of the Soviet Union you probably never saw.Brace yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncle Jacob says: \\"buy it!\\"","review":"It's like reading a script for a masterpiece movie.

It provides a shallow overview of Nkrumah's political career. There is very little information regarding Nkrumah's life, motivations or philosophy. There is very little analysis of the significant events of his career, such as the independence of Ghana or his removal from office.I felt that the book read like an extended encyclopedia article.

To me, it looked like nothing more than a page for page copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good device book for both process and design engineers","review":"This book explains well about several MOSFET models for SPICE simulations with informative historical review. MOSFET model parameters is now essential for semiconductor chip design as a communication tool between process/device engineers and circuit designers. In this book, starting from compact description of MOSFET physics, several well-known models are described seperately. So beginners can read only what they need. In addition, reading throughout introduction and final comments of each chapters give us information on progress of MOSFET models. If possible, I want to have an additional chapter which compares several models from the viewpoints of physical modeling and robustness of circuit simulation. Anyway, I recommend this book both to process and design engineers as well as modeling engineers for effective development of future semiconductor chips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hutzpah... Pah!!","review":"Pollack proves that the only thing necessary to be an artist in this society is the audacity to call oneself such. I've slogged through a couple of his self-indulgent works now, and from what I can see, he's an author because he says so. Unfortunately he's not alone; the people with egos big enough to believe they are something are granted celebrity or at least book contracts just because they have the hutzpah to tell the world what every person's mama made him or her believe for a while: I'm special. Most people grow up and realize that everyone is special but nobody's really THAT special. Pollack seems to still believe that he is not one of the very folk he attempts so weakly to satirize, a pompous bag of air who should be penalized for every tree that dies in the service of his vanity. He's an average writer with average opinions and really should take a breath and realize he's OK without being \\"special.\\" Then he should give the reading public a break and get a real job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes Nowhere, And Fast!","review":"About the funniest part is the pictures. Otherwise, if you've read one page of this book, you've read them all. Of course, it's McSweeney's, so everyone fawns over it like it's actually something, which isn't to say that McSweeney's isn't EVER something, but Pollack (isn't that a kind of fish?) isn't it. Spend your money on candy instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super satire","review":"Pollack's work lampoons the literati with a wit and skill that brings to mind The Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus. Congratulations Mr. Pollack. It's safe to assume Swift, Pope, and Dr. Arbuthnot would share a hearty laugh with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, Annoying after a while","review":"Pollack has an different style using a near solipsistic approach to everything. At first it is funny. His aping of classic texts gives the same feeling as getting an obscure joke on 'The Simpsons' - you feel happy about being so smart and everyone else is soooo bourgeois.... But after reading through five or ten of the shorts, it gets tiresome. Every piece seems to be the same story in a different setting. I would rather read some actual literature than this joke book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one-punchline book quickly wears thin","review":"After recently reading both Dave Eggars' \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" (which was wonderful) and his delightfully articulated rant against bad taste and bad art (directed at a poor writer for the Harvard Advocate), I was genuinely optimistic that Neal Pollack's book (published by Eggars's imprint, McSweeney's Books) would be a worthwhile follow-up read to \\"AHWOSG.\\" Alas, Pollack's book, while clever and dead-on accurate in its parody of first-person journalism, wears thin very quickly, and the joke becomes fast repetitive. Borrow this book from the library, but save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one joke non-literary work . . .","review":"Like a poorly written sitcom, Pollack has one joke: his exceptional being, together with hyperbole which supports his one joke. The writing is sophomoric at best, tedious at worst. I was appalled that a publisher would put out such drivel. I won't even give this away. This set has been placed--appropriately--in the proverbial circular file. Unless you enjoy his brand of humor (self-aggrandizement carried beyond the extreme), save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooo much better than Eggers.","review":"Neal Pollack is a genius with the pen. Nothing is too pure to molest, nothing is too sick to reveal. Mr. Pollack is a legend in his own time and is quite deserving of your attention and respect. You should do what you can to form a cult and sacrifice yourself immediately after his next tour. No, don't do that. You must stick around and buy multiple copies of every book he writes. When he dies, we must pick up the pen and create new works under his name for the masses. Special cloaks will have to be made. Incense will have to be purchased. Colorful translucent plastic sandals will be fashioned. We shall overcome. Dance my beautiful shadow, dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ????????","review":"This is what passes for humorous writing these days? Pollack has some cleverness--but not much else. He's a poseur, and his pose isn't even original. The only way to entertain yourself while reading this tedious and pretentious little book is to ask yourself, \\"Who is he trying to imitate in this piece?\\" Pollack is so unfunny that he makes Dave Barry look like S. J. Perelman. Pollack is is a run-of-the-mill McSweeney's narcissist. That he has fans--that people show up for his readings with intentions other than those of heckling him or shouting him down--is a distressing indication of how stupid the \\"hipster\\" reading public has become. The McSweeney's publishing operation is little more than a vanity-press outfit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Impressed","review":"This is not a good work. I gave it a shot because I love Dave Egger and most of the other McSweeney's stuff, but Pollack fails miserably. He is pretty imaginative and original, and a few spots of the book were funny. But overall I would say save your money; it's pretty awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for some safe family time","review":"I'd like to bash these Saved By The Bell Videos as brainless but the fact of the matter is these shows are a much better option for pre teen children than many other shows that are on television today.

This is a marvelous novel and I read it long time ago in Chinese version. The version had a lot of very good pictures, which helped to make the novel more interesting and attractive. And it looked like a novel. The English version I received looked like a computer programming guide rather than a novel.At the first glance, I thought I had received an MS computer book, which used to come with old computer a few years ago. The size of the book looks like that. The fonts used look like that as well. I was truly disappointed to see such a marvelous and interesting novel would have yet appeared in such a dull, uninteresting, and boring way. There was not even a picture on the cover!

For those just getting the surf bug and are looking for some excellent recordings from the early 60s, this is definitely a cd you should invest in. It can be difficult for a newcomer to know what to purchase since there is so much available out there. Well, personally I have yet to hear any surf music I think \\"sucks\\", so you can't really go wrong with any 60s surf bands, but the Tornadoes are certainly top drawer. This cd gives you some slow, haunting tunes(Beyond The Surf), some more up tempo stuff(Vaquero), some humor(The Gremmie), some cover tunes(Johnny B Goode). Even the few tracks with vocals are very good! The Phantom Surfer(a vocal tune) is an excellent, creepy little number.

Readers may not agree 100% with what is said and Sample will be fine with that so long as leaders have a solid rational philosophy that guides their thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for toady's business leaders","review":"This is one of the best books on leadership in recent days. The book is best suited for managers who need to make decisions that may impact an organization. It has a clear and easy to read format. Mr. Sample drew anecdotes from his own experience, and that makes the book more convincing. Ideas such as putting off those things that you can decide tomorrow are different and stimulating. There are chapters that are less directly related to the day-to-day business environment, but in general the book is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS BOOK!","review":"This book is one that I will use time and time again!

It would look really great on your coffee table, the color reproductions are excellent. However, selling the art of children with mental illness and trauma and other serious problems does bring up some questions about ethics. And why were not the therapists who gathered the work for these \\"editors\\" not given more credit for their contributions (they were only listed in the back, as if they were a sidebar when indeed their efforts made this book happen). It seems that only the authors came out ahead in this endeavor, both through publicity and royalties.I am wondering if these authors will next be capitalizing on the art of children who witnessed the WTC terrorist attacks. Seems like a logical follow-up to this book, although I hope they have the morals to handle the material in a less sensational, self-serving way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Active Nymphing","review":"The information was interesting, but too difficult to visualize.

But I have to say, _Flaming Iguanas_ is just outstanding. Some of it reads like free association straight from Lopez's brain, which I really got into, along with the wacky-but-usually-related-but-sometimes-not illustrations. The story is a winner, as our heroines trek around on their bikes, but it's the delving into Tomato's psyche that I enjoyed most. Well, that and the one-liners that made me laugh out loud.Overall, just a phenomenal book, and I highly recommend it to anyone, even though people who don't know the exhilaration of riding on two wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"a 90's book depicting a woman's sense of liberation","review":"\\"Flaming Iguanas\\" is one of those books that you can't put down.

Through all of the main character's (Tomato) adventures on her almost-dependable bike, the reader is allowed a vivid glimpse into the histerical mind of the narrator. Through Erika Lopez's vivid imagination and intricate use of words, the reader is also able to see the transformation that Tomato makes from the beginning of her cross country road trip, to the end. The novel has a slight hint of feminism, however it is not meant to be read solely by females. The novel is quite unique in its form and content and should be experienced by anyone who enjoys an interesting story plot. The novel was very well written and the author, Erika Lopez, should be applauded for her contribution to the literary world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turning the American Road Novel on Its Head","review":"An entertaining read - definitely a quick one. It attempts to turn the American road novel on it's head - by following two bisexual women as they cross the country on motorcycles, getting into crazy adventures, etc. It's also a \\"coming-of-age\\" story - as the narrative grows, so does the protagonist. It's reminiscent of On the Road as the story follows Tomato on her misadventures, with no purpose for hitting the road other than it's there to be hit, and life lessons are learned along the way. But the book breaks the road novel convention with illustrations (at times completely meaningless), and other stylistic leaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!!!","review":"I thought this book was awesome!!!

I strongly recommend both books, in spite of the somewhat inflated price for both. The material in the two books does not overlap very much, and both volumes are actually worth the money. If you are taking the California bar exam, you can buy the California Bar Exam Survival Kit, which appears to be virtually identical to the Bar Exam Survival Kit.Adachi reminds the student that discipline is essential, and starts getting the student mentally geared for the bar exam process. In addition, Adachi has a series of outlines of the subject matter that will be covered on the bar exam.

Perhaps this book would be useful in an arranged marriage where people meet shortly before the ceremony. But if you don't know, for example, what your fiance majored in in college, and what hobbies s/he enjoys, you should stop thinking about marriage and go out on a second date. I was hoping this book would provide insightful questions that would lead to deep conversation. But no. The exercises are the end of Getting the Love You Want by Hendrix are much more conducive to discussion than these questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all","review":"This book covers many basic questions, but there are also questions that people don't often think about.

In addition, the writers try to encomass every imagineable type of aircooled Volkswagen, making a total mess of the procedures as these vehicles are pretty varied in their detail design and function. The result is confusion and poor readability. The drawings are brilliant, however they do little less that convey an overall understanding of principle, and rarely show any detail procedures.

I may like a particular artist, but want to maximize my purchase by trying to buy one that has the most songs that I like. There is on Meat Loaf DVD from Melbourne in 2004 and 2007.

I'm about to marry the most beautiful and loving woman and I don't need sexual sin in my life EVER! A real man would strive to be sexually pure for God, his wife or future wife, as well as himself.

I very rarely ever do negative reviews, however, this book left me wanting; wanting the Cross of Christ to be far more central than it is.

Pat Carnes or Mark Laaser are the better choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and thoroughly helpful book","review":"I have struggled with sexual purity for many years, and this is the one book I would recommend to any Christian man desiring to attain sexual purity.

Let me warn you that it preaches biblical truths that you might find hard to swallow, but please don't stop reading it for that reason! A prominent pastor once said, \\"The truth will set you free, but first, it will hurt you.\\" Also, if you're a single man (like me), there's no reason to feel excluded whenever it mentions marriage, or \\"your wife.\\" The principles therein apply to single men just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good counsel, too-vivid illustrations","review":"I am someone who has recently come to believe there should not be even a hint of sexual sin, even lust, in the heart of a godly man (Ephesians 5:3). If you ever want to \\"get ahold of God,\\" you must mortify your flesh. Plain and simple.EMB offers only two excellent tips: bouncing the eyes, a couple good memory verses (Job 31:1; 1 Cor 6:18-20). The bad thing is, it mixes in vivid il*lust*rations. Any man struggling to find freedom from lust should look somewhere else, because Every Man's Battle will give him even more images to haunt his mind.Instead of this book, I heartily recommend Joshua Harris's \\"Not Even a Hint\\". I'm glad I read Harris first. I don't think I could've handled EMB without it. Check out the list of the endorsers for both books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Draws heavily on Scripture, not what I was looking for --","review":"I was looking for a book that would help me to understand and thus go beyond my fascination with sexual fantasy.

I note that the few pages reproduced on Amazon.com, being the early part of the book, are not that representative."},{"rating":"1","title":"More psychological than spiritual","review":"If you are looking for spiritual ways to fight sex addictions this book is not going to help you. It introduces merely psychological approach to the problem similar way as 'how to quit smoking fast' guide would do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Panacea For Sexual Immorality","review":"The authors of the book, \\"Every Man's Battle,\\" did a fairly good job in elaborating their 'tested and proven' ways of attaining victory on sexual immorality. As a young man, the book helped me to be meticulous towards my interaction with the sexually-charged society of 21st century. Even though I noticed, through out the book, some stupid ideas that lack incendiary veracity, I was able to filter the good stuff I can benefit from. For example: In some chapters, the book downplays the awesome power of God over impure desires of flesh. I have seen God giving victory in a matter of minutes over cigar, drug and pornography. And, I hope there are unprecedented number of godly people who can testify to this.Nevertheless, the book is ghost written. As a reader, I recommend that you read this book, either if you are male or female."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women need to read this book","review":"It's amazing how differently men and women are wired. Women have always been told that men say \\"I love you\\" to get sex, and women have sex to hear \\"I love you.\\" Still, probably not many of us women grasp the reality of the male sexuality. We still think sexual attraction is tied to emotional attraction. Not so!While none of the content of this book surprised me, it did give me a once for all (I hope) understanding of what men are really thinking when I think they are interested in me. I also appreciate the understanding I gained about men's struggles. I can be more sensitive now in how I dress and act, and can pray more effectively for men since I now know exactly what to pray about for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arterburn's on his third marriage...","review":"Sorry folks but I would rather get advice from someone who has not been divorced twice. Not that I am condemning any Christian who, for whatever reason finds him/herself in divorce, but it is telling when this author is giving us advice on purity in a book he wrote right before he divorced his second wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial and formulaic","review":"Thanks to the authors for their work in tackling this very important topic. However, their solutions are so simplistic and artifical, giving simple formulas that don't go anywhere near the real causes of lust, or true ways to combat the real problems. For instance: The major way a man should combat lust is to have regular intercourse with his wife. And if a man is single? The solution to lust that they offer for single men (I'm not making this up) is simply to have more nocturnal emissions. These kind of artifical solutions simply don't go anywhere near where the real battle needs to be fought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A logical Approach to Sexual Temptation","review":"This read gives men a tool to logically understand, and take control of their sexual temptation. It would be great if Churches could do more in this area to help out the many who are struggling. I believe that few come forward, because the subject is still given the cold shoulder. The book hit things head-on, and made no room for beating around the bush. If you are interested in living a life that brings purity to your mind, and pleases God then I recommend Every Man's Battle.We are under constant sexual temptation throughout our daily lives. One of the things that hurts the most is women are unaware of what men are going through, and the pain that follows."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for married men, but not single men","review":"I'm a single so this book wasn't exactly what I was looking for. However, I plan to hold on to this book because I think it gives practical advise for how a husband should act. The book gives useful information on how men can stop \\"acting like men.\\" It empowers us all to stop looking at women for sexual gratification and allows us to gain control of our sex drive. The idea behind the book is to make husbands devote all their sexual attention to their wives. If you want to be a good Christian husband then this book can help you do just that. But you have to be willing to make changes in your life if you want this to work for you.If you're a woman and thinking of buying this book you'll be in for an eye-opener. You will see just how hard it is for men to deal with lust. Some of the things in the book may even disgust you. But I urge you to be supportive of your husbands so that they can live in line with God's commands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed","review":"Hello, my name is Michael Campbell, and having used this book in a study group I agree that it is totally a mixed bag. I feel her review is right on, and dont really have that much to add to it. Luckily it was a quick read (each of the 6 sections takes only 20 or 30 minutes to read) and so I dont feel I wasted a lot of time on it. If you struggle with sexual purity then this is for you. If not invest your time in the Bible or another wonderful book Gods Politics by Wallis. God bless!Mike Campbell"},{"rating":"2","title":"Winning the Battle... Finally!","review":"This amazing book has a step by step battle plan like nothing you've ever read before. I've read many other books on this subject, but most of them deal with the reasons \\"why\\" sexual temptation is such a struggle. That is helpful to a certain extent, but this book is different. It is an ACTION book! It doesn't just talk about the \\"why,\\" it gives you the \\"HOW!\\" Imagine not being overwhelmed by a barrage of mental images. Imagine becoming the person on the inside that you've been trying to portray on the outside. Imagine having no regrets and a new relationship between you and God. Imagine actually WINNING the battle.

It is a vital yet missing part of everyday Christian conversations and media. I gleaned some important information from the book but as a single man I found the strategies of limited effect. I can't focus my sexual energies onto my non-existent wife or expect to have a godly 'nocturnal emission' every few days to 'release the pressure' as the book suggest. I am sure married men would get more out this book than I did but I still received some good information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource Sorely Needed in the Church Today","review":"Finally, some guys who are brave enough to stand up for the standard God has set for sexual purity. It is refreshing to see Arterburn and Stoeker's focus on Biblical standards that so many today, including Christians, seem to disregard (Eph.5:3)(see anonymous reviewer who gave book 2 stars). The majority of the book applies to all males, regardless of age or marital status; however, some sections seem to almost disregard single guys, or only mentions them in passing. I would recommend another book in the series, either \\"Every Young Man's Battle\\" or \\"Being God's Man as a Satisfied Single,\\" for a focus more on single guys. Overall, though I have still struggled, the book, along with reading the Bible, has strengthened me in my fight for sexual purity. I highly recommend this book for any guy struggling with any sexual impurity in his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too fluffy to be helpful","review":"For the hype surrounding this book, the actuality of its helpfulness is disappointing. out of its total contents, roughly the first 50% reads like a pep talk about why you shouldn't look at porn. Chances are, if you searched out a book to help with lust, you don't need to be convinced of your need for change.The remaining half of the book has some surface-deep tips that may be helpful for some men, but don't go deep enough to evoke any meaningful heart change or help for a true addict. My church did this in a men's group and i don't think one person i talked to actually got anything out of this that helped them stop.If you want deeper teaching that promotes real heart change, check out \\"The Mighty Man Manual\\" or for a more factual, scientific discussion about pornography use, I enjoyed \\"The Drug of the New Millennuim\\"Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"we're not all sex addicts","review":"I'll start by saying this book isn't entirely bad. Just mostly. One reviewer said, correctly I think, that it's a good thing that this book brings the Church to more frank and honest discussion of sexuality. That is a very good thing. We're so polite that we forfeit our ministry to huge numbers because the things they struggle with are not considered appropriate conversation.But not all men are sex addicts. This book advocates treating behaviors instead of the root problem.Men can be free from this and any other sinful temptation when they forgive themselves as God forgives them, truly live in light of grace, and allow the Spirit's work to be done in their lives.Stay away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book.","review":"Great Book and something every man should read.

I skimmed through it and could not help but shake my head at the nonsense printed in this rag. God gave us eyes to see, to marvel and to admire. he gave us a penis to enjoy, to find gratification and to be more in touch with our inner selves. I don't need some self appointed shrink telling me that looking at adult material or fantasizing or masturbating is wrong. This book will do more harm then good in the long run. Don't waist your time or money; instead buy a book which affirms your God given sexuality and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Josh Harris' book instead","review":"I read this a couple of years back and still remember how frustrated I got with it. While it did contain many helpful principles and thoughts, those seem to be outweighed by the needless descriptions (sometimes in uncomfortable detail) of the authors' own struggles in specific situations. It was those side stories and anecdotes that proved to be more hurtful than helpful sometimes.Men's brains don't need to be fed with any more ideas, thoughts, or tempting situations about lustfulness. They need to be renewed and redirected in those moments toward things that are more wholesome, helpful, and holy.Having recently read Josh Harris' book \\"Sex is Not the Problem (Lust Is),\\" I would have to commend it over \\"Battle\\" any day of the week. It contains the same good principles, but rises above the level and directs the reader to the true motivations and issues behind every young man's battle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abstract and Sweeping Stereotypes","review":"I could never really pin down what the authors mean by \\"lust.\\" And whatever they mean by lust, seems to be a universal case for men.

I liked the basis for the book, but I don't think that just by trying a little harder we can escape the sin of lust. It takes much more than we have to offer as a human.

When preparing for a rehearsal situation, it is relatively painless to take five minutes and number the measures myself. An inconvenience, to be sure, but spending $40 or more for an edition with measure numbers and rehearsal letters is the greater evil, as far as I'm concerned.

Standard written Arabic is thicket of grammar that makes German look like a walk in the park. Spoken Arabic is a simpler affair but dialects vary from country to country. So teachers of Arabic have to decide whether to start with grammar (A&S;'s approach) or with conversation (Al Kitab's).I am using this book at NYU. I, along with my classmates and professor, complain about it's over emphasis on grammar, its typos and questionable organization. The strict grammar rules lend themselves to simple presentation in tables, but the authors generally fail to use this approach. Also note that you will need to buy the CDs. They are appallingly expensive given the poor production quality.If your goal is to read classic Arabic literature A&S; is probably your best bet.

It isn't as thorough or precise as the Big Orange Book (aka Elementary Modern Standard Arabic) but the vocabulary it introduces is more relevant and useful for everyday life and the explanations of how the language works are not difficult to understand and build upon each other in a very logical way. The lessons themselves, built around the theme of Arab students studying in the US (and vice-versa) aren't enthralling, but there is a lot of vocabulary that the learner could put to use right away. This book is certainly the best bet for making progress in Arabic in a reasonable amount of time and it beats its better-known rival (the Maha and Khalid chronicles) in every possible way."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for learning","review":"used this in class, and liked it in comparison to other language books i have used. a lot depends on the teacher too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely underrated band and lead singer!!!","review":"I've been a Journey fan for many years and stumbled upon Tyketto through Steve Augeri (Tall Stories, Journey).

Tyketto is very underrated - I highly recommend their music and also suggest Danny Vaughn's solo \\"Vaughn\\" and project \\"From the Inside\\" albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fell through the cracks","review":"This album came out when there was a transition from the 80's to the Whiney Nineties. Don't Come Easy simply didn't fit either the metal cheese or grunge movement and didn't have enough hook for pop music. But this is a very solid album, the only time I saw their first video (Forever Young) it was on Much Music's, Power Hour, where it never should've been. The whole first halfis very enjoyable from the first rocker (Forever Young) through midtempo songs like (Wings) (Burning Down Inside) and (Seasons). (Standing Alone) is a slow and reflective song that anyone could use to go back in time. The last song (Sail Away) about 2 adventurous men is really upbeat and spontaineous. Dig it up from between the cracks and enjoy as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"what are you guys smokin'?","review":"this is metal? this cd makes bon jovi look like judas priest. there is no metal on this album. there is 20% rock on it. the rest is pop music. it's horrible. if you like metal or rock music don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst blades ever","review":"Had to put my old blades on streaked my windows.

The Glorious Burden was pretty good but not as good as previous efforts. Tim Ripper Ownens just cannot pull off powerful vocals the way Matt Barlow could and the music itself is weak especially the 3 rerecorded traks from something wicked. How anybody can say those 3 rerecorded tracks are more powerful that they originally where as a previous reviewer stated is beyond me. The new album is gonna be on my do not buy list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barlow!!! we need you!","review":"The remake is bad.....Owens sounds like hes trying to sing like Bruce Dickenson and it takes away the fury that Barlow had. Get Barlow back please!!!!! Oewns can sing, but I am tired of his weak effort. Iced Earth needs Barlow. I have listened to a long interview with Shaffer and he basically thinks that HE is all the band needs, he is grossly wrong. He even went as far as to make fun of bands like Manowar and Helloween. Bands that have been around much longer than him. Shame on him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Opening Assault for Something Wicked Part I","review":"This EP is great. I still like Tim's vocals and he does a good job making the Something Wicked Trilogy his own. The new song is great. But I didn't expect anything less from Schaffer and company. The original trilogy by Matthew Barlow was great but this new version fits with the concept album coming in the winter. It is a good opening shot from one of the only real metal bands in the US doing good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripper isn't the problem","review":"I thought the mixing was horrible. The guitars in the 1st two parts of the trilogy were ok. Get to the Coming Curse and it's almost inaudible due to the kick drums.

Everyone else buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Iced Earth EP","review":"This cd features the single \\"Ten Thousand Strong\\" and a remake of the classic Something Wicked Trilogy with Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens. I love the old version of the Trilogy but this one is just as good in a different way. It features better production, some new instrumentation, and Baritone Guitars. The trilogy introduces the storyline for the next two Iced Earth albums.The Track \\"Ten Thousand Strong\\" is new Solid Material from Iced Earth's new Album Framing Armaggedon Something Wicked Part 1. This cd is only a little bit over 20 minutes in length but I have enjoyed listening to it and would reccomend it to any Metal or IE fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3-year-old loves it!","review":"My 3-year-old daughter absolutely loves Arthur and loves this CD. Okay, so the songs don't necessarily use \\"traditional\\" lyrics. We don't mind! It's great! And by the way, some of the customer reviews mention that there is a different voice for Arthur. Not so. The credits clearly say Arthur's voice is played by Michael Yarmush who is the original Arthur. He's just a few years older now and his voice has matured a bit. He's still the same Arthur.Our whole family likes this CD. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, great music","review":"A fun and musical way to teach kids a little about others' holiday traditions.

I bought it hoping that my 2 1/2 year old would enjoy listening to Christmas songs sung by voices familiar to her. She doesn't like the CD either. Instead of presenting Christmas carolls sung by familar voices, this CD presents \\"mock\\" songs - where the Arthur characters change the words of old favorites in an attempt to be creative and funny. The attempt failed. Definitely listen to some of the selections before buying. If I had done that, I would not have bought this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, very bad cd","review":"We have a holiday cd collection comprising at minimum 25 cd's - traditional, silly, modern, etc. We have a few duds but this one is the worst of the worst. I expected to hear a few silly songs but also expected nice holiday music. This cd is awful! The \\"real\\" songs such as We Three Kings, etc., have all their lyrics changed & the new lyrics are (and we don't usually use this word)stupid! My boys are 7 & 3 and even they said \\"turn it off - it's annoying\\" about the time DW was singing (screeching) Silent Night. Do not buy this cd - it is very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"N-O, NO, No, no . . .","review":"What a disappointment this CD was. As a TRUE Arthur fan, along with my 6 and 2 year olds, I could not recommend this to anyone. I was expecting the wittiness and charm of the first CD--which we still love to listen to. It's annoying that familiar lyrics are changed on this CD--my kids can't understand why the words are different. Although we are huge fans of \\"Go to Sleep!\\" from the first CD, DW's version of Silent Night (which is yelled at the top of her lungs) is not cute--it's in the running for the worst song ever recorded. Plus, this NEW voice of Arthur sounds completely different than the Arthur of old. A few of the songs are fine, but I just can't let the whole thing play through without ripping my hair out--luckily, my kids feel the same, and disappear long before the CD is finished playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Not the Album \\"The Hands Of God Reached Out And Touched Me\\"","review":"This is NOT the original album.

This dude has the worst voice in music history."},{"rating":"1","title":"EBM should not put you to sleep!","review":"I do not like the direction this band has gone. If you like earlier beat driven VNV releases with smart lyrics such as Empires, Burning Empires and Praise the Fallen, you will probably be disappointed in this CD. I found it to be too slow, lack substance and flat out boring.Chrome is a decent song with some dance beats (the only one on the whole CD). Lightwave and Interceptor reminds me of Nitzer Ebb (not exactly innovative to be compared to releases that are 15 years old!) I found Entropy and Endless Skies slow and ponderous.If you want intelligent, dance oriented EBM with intriguing lyrics, I recommend checking out Assemblage 23 - Storm and Azoic - Illuminate."},{"rating":"1","title":"actually 2 1/2 stars to be exact","review":"only has a couple good songs. about 5 or 6 of the songs are just instrumental, which i hate for this type of music. they are usually boring and stupid.

I see the time has come for the almighty EBM pioneers Ronin and Mark to hit a dead end. Can't say I didn't see it coming seeing as how all this EBM crap can't last much longer than it already has. The only reason I even heard this album and know of their previous work is from the clubs, otherwise I fricken hate EBM with a passion. It's nothing more than rehashed techno with somber lyrics. All I can say is...it's about time the VNV fans complain about how they don't sound like the way they used to. NOW YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT US OLD SCHOOLERS HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT EVER SINCE THIS STYLE TOOK OVER..HYPOCRITES!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like where they are going with this one...","review":"Empires seems to have been the creative peak for VNV Nation. Futureperfect was not nearly as strong and less consistent, although it had many good tracks. Matter+Form throws any sense of consistency out the window and although there are some good tracks on here, not enough to keep this album afloat. Chrome and Homeward are good tracks that are more like what you might expect from VNV Nation, the rest go all over the place. Rock-style drums and pop-like rythyms seem to dominate the rest of the album and make for a less than enjoyable overall listening experience. It lacks a real direction and any coherence and is more of a thrown-together collection of tracks than an actual album. They may never make another Empires, but I certainly expect better than this from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The latest from VNV: Progressive Electronica","review":"This is the latest album release by the duo of VNV Nation. It is a solid album however it isn't in the same 'blockbuster' standing as the prior albums; 'Empires' and 'Futurepurfect' were. The evolution or de-evolution as some fans have stated in reviews is tending this album toward the dance anthem style that many electronica have gone making it DJ friendly. But the CD is still a pleasure to listen too.The picks of this album are 'Arena', 'Interceptor', 'Endless Skies' and 'Lightwave'. These songs are the most easy to follow and have dance themes that one can dance to at all times. Gone is the high pitched industrial sounds and the robotic vocals and replaced with serene melodies and vocals sung passionately and deeply felt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Every song on this CD is great. I originally purchased it just because I liked a couple of songs, but quickly realized the entire CD was full of great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"VNV Nation's weakest album","review":"Much as I love VNV Nation's other albums, this one just flopped. Although Chrome was fantastic, and Arena and Perpetual were good, the rest of the album sounds like the soundtrack to a coma/seisure depending on the track. It pales in comparison to the brilliance of Judgement or Empires."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome ring","review":"I LOVE this ring! It is stylish and doesn't leave a green ring around my finger. The only reason I gave it 4 out 5 stars is because it runs really small.

Simple and fun.","review":"Uniracers is, I think, one of the most underappreciated games for the SNES. The concept is simple and unique: platform racing with unicycles. The racing gets absurdly fast, and the button-mashing trick combos spice it up a lot.It is a very simple game. All the two-dozen-or-so racers are the same except for color, but detailed statistics are kept for every player and every track. For a solo player, it's just not going to hold interest very long (about 2 hours to clear the game, tops); as a beer-and-pretzels VS game, it's hard to beat on the SNES. One can organize tournaments, so up to 8 players can compete in rounds. It's simple enough that anyone can master it up in a couple minutes. While this makes single player mode boring (there's no challenge), it makes it awesome for VS play because even novice and expert gamers wind up equally matched very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia.","review":"My roommate and I were discussing old video games that we loved when we were kids, and his favorite was Unirally (Uniracers [this game]). I had never heard of it so he pulled up a YouTube video for game play and I was actually surprised at the quality of the graphics for such an old game. After doing a little more research we found that DMA had been sued by Pixar for stealing the unicycle design and because of the law suit only 300k were made. So naturally we wanted one.We got it played it for a a week straight and now it sits on the shelf with all of our other Nintendo games. It was pretty fun and I'm glad I bought it even if for no other reason beside being able to say I own it.

Does that sound bad or what? You compete in four circuits, each having five different races. The races are head to head races, time races, and trick competitions. Yes tricks, to go faster in this game, you must do a trick, like a backflip, front flip, rotating flip, or several combinations of tricks to earn points and to go faster. The game is very fast paced and it will raise your reflexes just playing it, or it will make you really dizzy because of the backgrounds to the race levels.

As much as this is the first and only 3D racing game for the SNES, there are no textures on the vehicles and walls. So it looks like your driving a box.

The Bible is more important than psychology and other fields of science.2. We are not on earth to please ourselves. Instead, focus on what God wants.3. If we are to follow God to the marketplace, the self-promotion methods of this world will not work for us. Having spent several years in sales, this chapter was my personal favorite.4.

I kept thinking it would get better later in the book, but it has been a disaster the whole way through. The title and subtitle are completely misleading as to the topic of the book. It would be better titled Elisabeth Elliots opinion on political issues. It does not deal directly with issues of faith, does not often make reference to the Bible, contradicts her stance on issues in her other works, and overall has a condescending tone and pessimisitic attitude. My beliefs are completely in line with conservative Southern Christian values, but this book is over the top harping on issues none of which refer to asking God why or trusting God. I am completely disappointed in Ms.Elliot.

If you ask me, they never really went away, with both Ultraphobic and Belly To Belly being great albums, but this is a return to their old Downboys sound, and what better way to do it than to re-record your biggest hits. It sure bits the hell out of a greatest hits album, because the updated songs really sound better than the original versions. And the new tracks are also pretty good, especially Bad Tattoo. The industrial mixes are... um.. how should I say this... well, they are just bonus tracks, so it's free music for you. I know all you hard core fans already have this, so I would recommend this to anyone who always wanted to pick up Cherry Pie but were afraid their friends would laugh at them.

In the grand scheme of things, it's my fault for not noticing anything on the packaging stating that these were \\"original recordings\\" so I left myself open for a \\"glory days\\" reprise of formerly good-sounding songs.

Cherry Pie and Down Boys are all at a slower, geriatric tempo and the new dude dumbs down Heaven to fit his vocal range, plus it's \\"unplugged\\". And the remix versions are just plain useless.

After obtaining a promise that she will not be abandoned, the old woman decides to return the favor and takes the girl home, threatening to make the girl her heir in place of the irresponsible, spoiled family.

Miami ama a los Van Van, no obstante la falsa progaganda al contrario. Como el propio Fornell reconocio en declaraciones para Granma Internacional (edicion del 22 de octubre, 1999), refiriendose a su concierto en esta ciudad: \\"El Nuevo Herald y El Miami Herald...publicaron que había más gente afuera que dentro. Eso es una ¡MENTIRA!, enfatizó. Nosotros les decimos a esos periodistas que adentro había más de 4 mil personas, y afuera quizá unas mil.\\" Y como Fornell y los Van Van son hombres de suma integridad que no se prestan para la propaganda politica, este testimonio pone en ridiculo a todos los que dicen que en Miami confundimos la magnesia con la gimnasia."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Freshness is Gone.","review":"I grew up hearing and dancing with the Van Van rhythm. When I was a student, old hits such as \\"El Mechon\\" made my forced labor in the cane fields a little more endurable. When we returned sweaty, hungry, and tired from Castro's fields, the foul plate of chicharos (pea soup) tasted a little better by listening to Van Van. The naivete of \\"Te digo ahorita\\" was extraordinary. That was 30 years ago. Today their creativity is like a shadow of a great past. Van Van's lyrics nowadays are just mumbo jumbo of the worst kind. Even Cubans cannot understand what Van Van is singing. Most people attribute that phenomenon to the bad recording quality of the CD, but the truth is that the grace and imagination of the Van Van orchestra is gone. Nostalgic rafter that I am, I went to one of their concerts and saw these middle age men acting like clowns on stage and singing melodies that are poor parodies of a sound that once was inspired. I felt pity for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musica Atea","review":"Que desperdicio de talento el de esos muchachos. Pensar que tocan musica que ofende a Nuestro Señor Jesucristo.

For example, the gist of the lyrics of \\"El Negro Esta Cocinando\\" translate as: \\"Don't interrupt this black man because he is cooking...he is softening the yucca and the meat is tenderizing....\\" Please, if I wanted to hear gibberish I would listen to American hard rock.

It's terrific in discussing graphics and technical points; none of which has anything to do with working with photographs that may have red eye, have faded, need touching up in a variety of ways or even more basic information, like how a \\"dummy\\" should take advantage of Photoshop's organizational features. It's not that this is a bad book--indeed, the reverse is true. It's just not much help for the group its supposedly targeted.barry anderson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, Dry, and still more Dry","review":"I'd rather eat the pages of this book for lunch and swallow them without a glass of water than read any further from this bone-dry book. I found the humor in the book more iritating than helpful, and the expanse of long drawn-out paragraphs with very few visual aids proved this to be the worst Photoshop book I've laid my hands on.I strongly reccomend the Photoshop WOW! series, as well as Down and Dirty Tricks.... great for beginners who would appreciate tons of full-color visual tutorials and examples. Glass of drinking water optional :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Photoshop 6 for Dummies Disappoints","review":"I found this Dummies book disappointing. It just rehashes the older Dummies book for Photoshop 5 with additional writing by Barbara Obermeier and now includes only Windoze screen shots. I used to use this book in the PS 5 incarnation for my PS classes. I really liked its sense of humor and how it was targeted in a no nonsense way for beginners.

The plate is made of ABS plastic.In the Atrio series, spout, shower arm, diverter trim, and levers are all beautilful satin nickel, but there are several parts on the thermostatic trim that are made of plastic, in particular, the main plate. And the plastic parts do not exactly match the satin nickel color.Needless to say I am a disappointed customer who paid a premium for Grohe as well as for the satin nickel look. I discovered this after contractor installed the thermostatic valve. So I called Grohe to see if I can get compatible metalic trim, and was told that the same components in the series are designed with plastic, and there is no metal option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long reference list only deals with left hand","review":"This book is for someone who knows how to play and wants to have a structural and fast approach to playing popular music.

A line provided by one of the many stereotyped, cliché ridden & driven, stiffly wooden caricatured roles (e.g. Cuba kind of reminded me of Woody of Toy Story fame) of probably any movie this past year. You could even hear actors pause between lines as they tried to remember what to say next. In fact, overall the acting just as bad. Take the gunslinger pose that Woody (Oh, sorry - Cuba) strutted as he mows down a barn full of sitting cows (e.g. police), it was hysterical. No offense meant to the police, it's typical tiresome Hollywood.The line! Ready? Here it is, \\"YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH HERE.\\" Help!

Unlike many who write about postmodernism in the church, Kallenberg truly understands it. He does not describe it in sweeping generalizations and half-truths. Rather he explains it clearly and (most importantly) accurately. If you have no idea what postmodernism is, or are confused by books that you have read, then this book is for you. If you are a postmodernist, and are tired of books on postmodern evangelism that try to convert the unbeliever to modernism before converting them to Christianity, then this book is for you.Especially excellent are his thoughts on Kuhn's paradigm shift, and evangelism as learning a new conceptual language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I always give high ratings that challenge my beliefs. The book advocates bringing people into the community and then teaching them doctrinal beliefs. Getting a point-in-time decision is not as important as incorporating the non-believers into the church and slowly teaching them to live as a Christian and learn our language. A Faithful life is more important than a point-in-time questionable decision. Correct doctrine is important, but teachng them the whole truth as they grow in a Christian community is the better way to go.

And even if it is true, that's only because Italians don't use cookbooks!.If you leaf through the book, it's full of recipes with poor instructions for things like \\"Eggs in Aspic.\\" I think it's one big $50 (....), and Americans fell for it wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"AUTHENTIC RECIPES?","review":"AUTHENTIC RECIPES?Not even Julia Child uses so much MILK and BUTTER in her recipes....I doubt very much that this is the TRUE translation of the book my mother used constantly when I was growing up in Italy (in Italian).....It was her KITCHEN BIBLE.Nobody in the family would have eaten most of these concoctions....."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"This book also offers a lot but for a home cook who likes to dabble it is a bit overwhelming...there are lots of recipes...it would suit the cook who was more aspiring. I am someone who likes to see lots of pics and less text. If they included more pics and made the book a two or three in a set then that would be more appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and redundant","review":"This is a great snapshot of what Italian housewives were cooking in the 1950s. It's great as a period piece but it's a huge albatross of a book with thin pages and a gazillion recipes with no context or nuance. If you are already a good Italian cook, this book will seem overly simple and redundant. If you are new to Italian cooking, you are likely to be either bored or confused. Search for books by Ada Boni, if you're looking for a vintage classic.The 1960s modern look is kind of fun but leafing through the book, the feeling is the opposite of inspiration.I am very upset that I have this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"something to think about....","review":"I am happy to comment on this book. The book was wonderful. My daughter was really happy to receive this as a present from me but also very disapointed as to when she opened up the book. It was all wet from the delivery. My package was thrown in the snow, and so the book got wet. It was like it was already used. I would not order books again in the winter time, as there was not any thought put into where my gifts were placed once they were delivered. It was a lovely gift, but the delivery service ruined my gift to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a useful book.","review":"I ordered this from Amazon and have sent it back. It has many detailed recipes but they don't seem to be curated. For example, there is a recipe for \\"boiled rice\\" and many variations on ways to prepare rice. I think I can do better on the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not like","review":"Even with all the italian background i have and the language, I was lost in most of these.

I think you could spend a life time trying the different recipes.Before owning this book, I never realized how few ingredients Italian cooking had in it.

Some ingredients are hard to find but it does not matter because the recipe will turn those hard to find and expensive ingridients into a terrible meal. I would never, never recomment this to any of my family or friends. I was very dissapontied by this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extensive, but...","review":"The authors/editors converted the typical metric system to cups, teaspoons, etc. without any regard to the recipe. It seriously changed the recipes. I've been reading people's reviews and many have encountered the same problem. It's unacceptable. From that point I give the book a star.The good part is that is extensive, and gives good pointers. So I give the book two stars. Buyer be aware!I am going to try a few more recipes. I hope it's not a waste of ingredients and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complement for the good cook","review":"This is a translation of a classic cookbook, first published in Italy in 1950. It is absolutely comprehensive, and is the Italians' Fannie Farmer Cookbook--all basic, well-tested recipes, from soup to nuts. Don't expect to be led by the hand on this one. The instructions assume that you are not a novice in the kitchen, and that you know certain basic techniques, such as slowly pouring the corn meal while making the polenta, etc.I would not have this as my only Italian cookbook, and I am a fairly ambitious cook. Other books that I find indispensable are Marcella Hazan's Classic Italian cooking, and its sequel, More CIC. Also excellent is Lynn Kasper's The Splendid Table.The Silver Spoon is a good rounding out to your other basic Italian cookbooks, and makes a terrific gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unmissable Addition to the Kitchen","review":"Well may be not EVERY recipe in it, but it is certainly worth cooking your way through and is without much doubt my best christmas present this year.It covers everything, yes everything, and bar the odd (and hilarious) period item like pineapple mousse to have with ham and set russian salad which reveal it's half-century age, this is about as comprehensive a kitchen tool for Italian cookery that anyone could hope for.I've already done a kitsch chicken in salsa rossa and a braised beef in barolo. It pulls together all the sorts of things you find in writers like Marcella Hazan into a home-kitchen friendly compendium. It also reveals the food culture differences between US and Italy - the rabbit chapter is one of the biggest meat sections - and pleasingly assumes that you will make everything from scratch.It's just a great book. Nothing more, nothing less"},{"rating":"1","title":"not authentic; not surprised","review":"if you have a general all-purpose cookbook, you have this cookbook and should look elsewhere to expand your library. this is nothing more than an all-purpose cookbook that was originally published for an italian market. it has 'starter recipes' for cooks who want know for example what marinara or ragu is but not how to make exceptional versions of these recipes. while billing itself as 'authentic' and 'italian', its contents are made up of nearly fifty percent basic french cooking and the remaining fifty is more a combination of mediterranean countries' cooking than solely italian fare.if you want authentic and italian, it would serve your interests better to invest in books by Marcella Hazan, Pino Luongo, 'Culinaria Italy', Mario Batali, or Lidia Bastianich than to waste your time and money on Phaidon's hyped offering (even though some of the above chefs contributed blurbs to it). it's all a matter of where your cooking's passions and priorities lie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection - a few quibbles","review":"This is a mammoth collection and many recipes sound terrific. A few problems, though.What REGION claims the recipe? Italians are tied to their family regions. This information belongs in the recipes.AMERICAN VERSION OF ITALIAN INGREDIENTS. What type chilies or lettuce, for example, would make the recipes as close to authentic as possible?PICTURES. There are beautiful pictures of prepared recipes. There are no captions for the pictures, and sometimes, the reader can't guess which recipe on the facing page is pictured.I'm enjoying using and reading this book, but I wish the publishers had done a little more editing for the U. S. market."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are not an experienced cook............","review":"If you are not an experienced cook this is not the cookbook for you. If this is your thirtieth cookbook or you collect cookbooks go for it, if you a gourmet cook go for it, if you want to learn to cook Italian and you are new to cooking forget this book and go for another cookbook with more detailed cooking instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check details","review":"I was dissapointed when the book arrived and I found that the recipes were all in American weights and measures, then I found out that the book is available in metric - I would have preferred to have the metric version, however I didn't have an option to choose when I ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this cookbook","review":"I was very excited when this book came out since I love almost everything I have ever eaten in Italy. Finally - the book that real Italians use to make all those delicious foods! Well, I found out the hard way that real Italians do not use this cookbook... it was an over-hyped book. I have made several recipes from it and none of them have been good. I am ready to sell it, but it weighs several pounds and would cost more to ship than I'd get for it. I think it's off to the used book store for a credit for me. Don't make the mistake I did and spend a lot of money on this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old fashioned, no frills recipes.","review":"This is a massive cookbook! It doesn't have a lot of pictures, and it doesn't go into detail and describe every single recipe that it has in there. I like that it gets straight to the point, and that many recipes come together with 5-10 very common household ingredients. It is laid out very easily, and the index in the back is great as well. The only drawback for me, is that if you are like me, there will be way too many \\"variety meat\\" recipes in there. I don't mind getting out of my comfort zone, but I probably won't be cooking brains, hearts, or sweetbreads for guests anytime soon. I do appreciate the utilization of cheap and easily accessible cuts of meat. A good variety of all courses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book / good price","review":"A very nice cook book that I'll enjoy for many years. Very nicely organized text and illustrations. Just look up an ingredient such as asparagus and you'll recieve 10 differtent recipes for asparagus all done the Italian way. The book came in excellent condition and was delivered in a timely fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of work for mediocre results","review":"I was pretty excited to get this book. It's beautiful and I love Italian cooking. Sadly, after making at least 15 different recipes and finding them all to be time-consuming, complicated, expensive disappointments, I have decided that this is one of the worst cookbooks I have ever owned. I traded it to a used book store for $5 in credit and was happy with the deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful and fun cookbook!","review":"I received \\"The Silver Spoon\\" as a Christmas present. What a great book! I think that the recipes are clear and easy to follow. Also, as a busy mother of a toddler, I appreciate that many of the recipes don't require a lot of time or a huge list of ingredients.I have made two dishes so far...penne alla arrabiata and semifreddo a lampone. I had no problems with either recipe, and the results were fantastic. The semifreddo recipe did yield a bit more than I expected, but that's not a problem...it just gives me some to share.Some might think that these are not the \\"fanciest\\" of recipes, but I do think they are representative of what the average Italian person might be cooking in their home. I have visited Italy, and these recipes sound like accurate representations of what foods I've encountered there. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who would like a really functional cookbook...this is a book you'll have in your kitchen rather than on the coffee table."},{"rating":"2","title":"If its Italian and it tastes good then the recipe is in this book.","review":"An abundance of recipes for everything from basic pizza dough to zabaglione souffle presented in a straight forward easy to follow format. This book is suitable for the novice or the gourmet. If you enjoy Italian food this is the only cookbook you'll ever need.Pair this with the Betty Crocker Cookbook and your kitchen library is complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'must' for any serious about Italian cooking","review":"The Silver Spoon has been to Italy what \\"The Joy of Cooking\\" has been to America for years: a mainstay for home cooks. Its appearance in English for the first time profiles the classic dishes which make Italian home cooks so famous - and The Silver Spoon is a 'must' for any serious about Italian cooking. It's been Italy's best-selling cookbook for over fifty years, with over 1,200 pages packed with color-coded pages of references and recipes. Add pepperings of color photos of completed dishes and you have a highly recommended pick for the holiday season; even for that experienced Italian cook who 'has everything'. If they don't have The Silver Spoon already - and if they only speak English they are unlikely to have gleaned a copy from Italy itself - then they don't have everything. Ditto for libraries strong in cookbook references: The Silver Spoon simply can't be missed and should be considered a standard acquisition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought this book, thinking it would be a great reference book of italian dishes.It is not. It is more like Betty Crocker for italians. No disrespect to Betty Crocker.... that is a lifelong favorite cookbook, but not at all what I was looking for in an italian cookbook.Many classic italian dishes were left out of this book so it is a failure as a reference \\"go to\\" cookbook. The regional cuisines were largely unrepresented. The instructions are inexact and weak. There are very few pictures, so you cannot see what the dish should look like. And it is phenomenally heavy despite the shortage of staple recipes.There are much better books.Hugely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For The Timid...","review":"I gave this cookbook only four stars because of some of the mistakes or mistranslations of ingredients. For everything else, five stars. Remember that in the Italian culture the children are no strangers to the kitchen while growing up. This book is better served to cooks with some experience. I purchased this book a couple of months ago, so I haven't had a lot of time to really get the full impact yet. The dishes I have done have come out very well, and are enjoyed by everyone. This is a fun cookbook to browse through to get ideas for future meals or just to read. If you have trouble with the recipes the book is heavy enough to use for a workout. The book got to me very quickly, and arrived in very good condition. This is not a lot of money for a book of this quality. Thank you Amazon for the great service."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This book is packed with so many simple and wonderful recipes I can't wait to try them all!

It is definitely NOT a cookbook! It better serves as a kitchen doorstop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cookbook I've owned","review":"I own many cookbook and actually can cook fairly well. I've tried 10 recipes so far and each one is crap. I think something went wrong when translating the Italian on measurements, cook times, and cook heats. This may be the best Italian cook book out there, but only in Italian. Avoid the frustration and lost $s, and get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I waited 2 months for this book to arrive. My initial reaction was one of disappointment. Nothing about this book caught my interest. I love Italian food and love to cook it. I decided I would probably keep it because of it's glowing reviews and I got it at a good price including free shipping. I kept going back to the book but could not get interested in it. It seemed simplistic and boring. It really did seem like the Italian version of Joy of Cooking. Seemed like a basic cookbook for the novice cook. I ended up returning the book at a local store. The store manager was shocked that I was returning it; told me it was the first book to come back. I have a slew of Italian cookbooks that I like better. Lydia Bastianich, Hazan Italian books to mention a couple. I will be curious to read other reviews on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silver Spoon New Edition","review":"Unfortunately Amazon has decided to lump reviews of the original edition under the new edition.

This goes back WAY before you and I were born. The Silver Spoon was the purest way to appropriately bring kings and queens their dinner. A castle without a silver spoon was deemed unsuitable.Now, moving forward 200 years or so (probably more) we have entered the modern times. People today don't quite have the consideration for table manners that the kings and queens of the past did. We're more \\"on the go\\" and \\"rush rush rush\\". But no matter how fast this world will become, we all have to slow down and eat. We have to eat appropriately. The Silver Spoon is the answer. It's the one silverware meant to hang around for centuries.I don't need the Silver Spoon for hardly anything. Cereal maybe, and that's it. But this noble spoon should be treated as a worthy addition to your silverware collection. A must buy, says I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry every time I use it.","review":"I have only used this massive collection of recipes a couple of times and each time I've wasted ingredients and time. For example, I attempted to make Caciotta Ravioli with tomato and basil. The recipe instructions start with the dough, which is supposed to be made from 3 1/2 cups of flour and 1/4 cup of oil.

This book really opened my eyes to two worlds that I, as a boring, straight, Presbyterian girl, had always been fascinated by: Judaism and Lesbianism. Newman structures her book so that each of the stories represents one candle on the Hannakah menorah, revealing each woman's fears and issues as they come to terms with their sexuality, religious, and personal issues such as sexual abuse. There are reflections on the Holocaust and discrimination against Jews and homosexuals. While Newman helped me to reflect on my own sexuality, and to discover my own love for other women-without erotic details-you don't need to be bi, lesbian, or Jewish to take something away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best children's book ever","review":"I just read the other reviews of this book and feel compelled to add that it had a similarly profound effect on my life. It is only published every 20 years--1947, 1967, 1987 and hopefully again in 2007. It is the best children's book ever--an unrivalled compilation of timeless--and non-commercial--poems and rhymes. Only Shel Silverstein has come close to achieving the same greatness.

Never again throughout the remaining tracks was that certain dissonant sound to be captured again. Whether it was a fast track like \\"Requiem\\" or a slow one like \\"Solstice\\", I never felt as if the music was going anywhere - it just kind of goes on and on but never satisfies.Perhaps it is my own fault for expecting the cd to be dark and mysterious based on one track.

I will need to test it on the other filter which I have cleaned before to see if it was just this filter. Not sure if it is the same exact formula as the white bottle and it very well could be, but I will update this when I clean the older filter again which i just cleaned with the white recharge kit so it won't be for a while. Since i don't see any other alternatives I imagine this is the only option for regular (non synthetic) k&n filter cleaner, if you can get your hands on the white bottle cleaner that works great and I can vouch for that.

From what I've gathered, it's like the Moulin Rouge of literature: either you got the inside joke and loved it, or you didn't and hated it. I fall into the latter. For someone weened on modern books and other reading materials, this is going to seem like a waste of tree pulp. Extrememly predictable, unrealistic (even for a sci-fi story), and chocked full of story info with little relevance to the actual story, it's a wonder the editor didn't laugh at Austin and threw him out of his office. Someone who lived in the early half of the 20th Century, it may bring back memories of the good old days. At best for me, it's a guilty pleasure book, though admittedly, it's a quick read.

This is the story of both men, their careers and their lives together and apart.Steve probably had more potential, but for many reasons he never quite reached the heights. This book succeeds where Steve's playing career didn't. Trout pushes himself to reflect on many moments and to reveal his thoughts then and now.It is a happy story, although sometimes it shouldn't be. To understand that, you have to understand Trout. Steve Trout is a positive man. He is genuine, honest and fun-loving and so is his book.This is a book for generations of baseball fans. It is a book for fathers and sons.

Cardboard movement, reading lines from cue cards, bad timing, and fake emotions. The only thing positive to say, shots are well lit and in focus.Canada's take on guns. From a Canadian perspective, the idea is right, the sentiment right. The execution is just painful. Oddly, nobody even has a Canadian accent. Why everyone sounds like they are from the midwest is incomprehensible. Oddly I watched this DVD while I was in Toronto. Hearing Canadians all day long, the accent was just too shocking.The story is convoluted. But predictible. It just drags on for way way too long; 2 hours and 56 minutes.

It is a very good DVD except for the following aspects which I did not like: The sound is so low, that I had to buy extra loudspeakers, especially when you play along. Another DVD I bought had louder sound, probably because the micro was better placed. The second thing I did not like was: Many exercises are too fast to follow, and the notation is not shown during the playing. The DVD of Amir Naoum is easier to follow for beginners, although this one has a more professional/academic touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncle Jimmy at his best","review":"Rifle is the best live album I've heard from Foetus.

Seriously Dave, how old are you now?\\"Kick the Chair\\" and \\"Die Dead Enough\\" are fair. \\"Something That I am Not\\", although not a typical Megadeth song, is surprisingly decent.But in the end, I can't recommend this album.

This cd rocked me from beginning to end and should make any TRUE Megadeth fan happy. Certainly this disc isn't \\"Rust In Peace\\" but, that doesn't mean it's crap. You must remember for starters that a few of the main chemicals are not here that were on RIP, the great Marty Friedman, David Ellefson, and Nick Menza. That was a killer lineup back in the day. Also remember that RIP was released about 15 years ago. Throughout the course of 15 years I would sure hope they wouldn't be making the same cd over and over again. There's a big word that bands do and it's called MATURE. Now you have Dave and Chris Poland (another great guitar player) and 2 people I never heard of. This is still heavy rockin' Megadeth material here and whoever says it isn't, better clean that mainstream crap music they listen to out of their ears.

The System Has Failed","review":"I'm gonna be truely honest. I love old Megadeth. Yes, OLD megadeth. like all of 80s' to mid 90s'. They were just heavy and I'm really into it. They went softer. They're not like Blink 182 or anything.. but, ya know. I wouldn't say that this is a bad album, but it isn't the greatest either. I love 2 songs. (\\"Die Dead Enough\\" and the religious \\"Shadow of Deth\\"). I think those are enough to buy it. Just make sure you sorta get a preview of the songs before you decide to buy it so you wont waste money and if you're like me and like old megadeth, then you might as well leave it alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comeback My Arse","review":"I can't believe all the good reception this album has been getting.

Don't get this, get Peace Sells and definitly Rust In Peace instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave has finally won. FINALLY.","review":"As any true Megadeth fan knows, Dave Mustaine's bitterness towards Metallica's ungodly fame and success has burned long and deep since his expulsion from the band. Despite the fact that Megadeth's technical ability blows Metallica away, Metallica always garnered more mass appeal.Well Dave Mustaine, rest easy - you have won. The System Has Failed is a fantastic album, drawing on influences from all past Megadeth styles. It's awesome. Can you even compare this album to Metallica's latest album, that incomprehensible piece of garbage, St. Anger? Absolutely not. That album sucked - The System Has Failed is infinitely better, and it's actually metal. God only knows what the hell St. Anger is.Good job, Dave. Your true fans had faith in you all along."},{"rating":"2","title":"RYAN DAVIS, YOU ARE A RETARD","review":"you must be pretty freaking retarded to think the kid who wrote about bizkit being better then deth was serious, it was an obvious joke, you god damn retard! any way, to the album.the system has failed was very good, and it holds up very well when compared to megadeths classic albums. i dare to say that this is up their w/ peace sells and rust in peace, basically, dave has done no wrong (exept for risk) when releasing new albums, their as heavy and kick @$$ as the last one, unlike his rival james hetfeild, who has pumped out crap since 1988, (yes, justice was basically a \\"pre-black album\\"). mr. mustaine is the american metal legend, keep up the great work dave, loved \\"the system has failed\\" and hope your feeling better from that injury. anyway, this review is for the real \\"fans\\" and not that ryan davis retard."},{"rating":"2","title":"review from a first time megadeth listener...","review":"I am 37 years old and I am sad to say I never gave megadeth a chance back in the day. I think I did'nt care for Dave's vocals the few times I heard him back in the day, I was also heavily into Metallica up until the black album. My brother in law turned me on to this disc the day it came out, and I thought it was great on the first listen. Dave's vocals sound good and the writing is awesome. I never knew dave wrote such political stuff \\"I LOVE IT!!!\\" I have since bought Rust in Peace, and Countdown to Extinction Which are also great discs. It is sort of good that I just discovered Megadeth, with all the crap music coming out right now it is giving a bunch of new stuff(to me) to listen to. I also love the album cover, Bush sucks and under his reign the system has really failed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Review is Short and To The Point","review":"I've read a lot of long drawn out reviews here. If you want the short, accurate review here it is :The System Has Failed, Megadeth has not.There's absolutely no doubt that this album is great. The playing is tremendous, the lyrics are inspired, and to those that are saying Dave should go back to drugs to write good material, SHAME ON YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Metal","review":"This album starts off great, but unfortunately gets weaker after the triumphant \\"Tears in a Vial\\". The highlights for me are \\"Die Dead Enough\\", \\"Kick the Chair\\", \\"The Scorpion\\", and the above-mentioned \\"Tears\\". These songs alone are worth the price of the album and rank right up there with my favorite Megadeth albums (Rust in Peace, Countdown to Extinction, So Far, So Good...). \\"Shadow\\" is a good instrumental ruined by a corny voice-over. The last song's lyrics are made up of dialogue from the movie \\"Excalibur\\" (stupid). Again, though, worth the price for fans and newcomers. Keep it comin', Dave!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth Delivers!","review":"This album is one of the really good ones. I think it's as good if not better than 'Rust in Peace'.

Wish elfson had been there also.System has failed is their best release since Youthanasia.This album is filled with brilliant songs, great lyics mindblowing solos e.g Kick The Chair, great vocals brilliant drumming and great riffs.

CTE was good but kinda too slow and kinda pop. Everything after CTE was either not enough defining as anything but trying to continue from CTE with more songs, which got old like less than halfway through Youthanasia, or they were just altogether bad. This one is different, every song is left reverberating through your head even after it's over, the album never gets boring. I don't think this one would have sounded good faster, it's good at the speed it is, and a good buy even if you're not a Megadeth superfan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old Megadeth","review":"These samples are enough for me to know that I'm going to buy this album right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave is back!","review":"Simply put, this is the best that Megadeth has sounded since 1994's remarkable \\"Youthanasia.\\" Even though I enjoy their late nineties output, it never measured up to what came before. Not so with this outing. Dave and the boys crank up the volume and the solid melodic content at the same time. There are traces of Rust In Peace and Countdown To Extinction in almost every track yet the band does not repeat itself. The twelve tracks included here are outstanding in their own right and bring plenty of originality to the table. It's also refreshing to see how well Dave reconnects with Chris Poland from the \\"Peace Sells\\" era. This album will be in my CD player for a long, long time. Welcome back Dave!"},{"rating":"2","title":"megastaine fan","review":"This is the heavy metal record us Megadeth fans have been waiting for a long time! Dave Mustaine has shown us again the true \\"state of the art\\" of speed metal. Sure, I love Metallica, but I realize that Dave was a big part of how Metallica was formed. Metallica ruled for a long time in the 80's and \\"granted\\" in the 90's. But with Metallica's latest offering, the \\"Metallica\\" we once knew is changing too much! Megadeth is \\"keeping it real\\" as far as how real heavy metal music from bands from the 80's should be done, while still keeping in touch with today's generation of metal fans without \\"selling out\\" or \\"changing\\" to compromise to today's style of \\"heavy metal.\\" I won't bother going in detail of the songs on the new Megadeth albun,... \\"The System Has Failed\\", but I will say this... If you remember the way you felt when you heard the \\"classic\\" Megadeth albums in the past, well you won't be disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring songs filled witih filler solos doesnt make a good LP","review":"I was not expecting Rust in Piece part 2, or Peace Sells part 2.All us Megadeth fans just want some high quality music.

I saw this album while shopping and being the MD fan that I am, had to pick it up. what a mistake. I mean, RIP, countdown, youthanasia, even cryptic writings were all good albums. This album is terrible. No Ellefson, no Friedman, after that, it all went downhill. One song is a spoken word of Psalms 23. Dont get me wrong, I got love for the Lord, but come on, that track sucks. and what's the point of bringing back Vic Rattlehead. leave that stuff in the 80's foo. I wouldnt recommend this album to a deth fan or someone new to the group. anyone looking to understand MD should listen to any of their albums in the 90's to see the true power and inspiration behind this band. Megadeth- R.(ust) I.(n) P.(eace)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From Relevant, But Too Dumb to Notice","review":"Good Lord. Megadeth is over. Done. Finished. And it's a cryin' shame. If you liked anything beyond Countdown, you might like the pathetic crap Dave has dumped on the music world over the last few years. If, however, you think early Megadeth kicked major ass, steer clear from this latest hunk of crap. This latest album is like Megadeth's last four outings - total, unadulterated, thin, ill-considered, over-produced, desperate, radio-friendly muzak. It's embarrassing really, coming from such an awesome musician as Mustaine. If Friedman wants to keep any credibility, he'll stay FAR AWAY from Dave as he attempts to sing himself out of another record contract.Finally, I must comment on the cover and the political aspect of this album. Clever, Dave. Very clever. Why, I almost didn't notice Bush & Cheney caricatured on the album cover. How very sly of you, you rascal!Pathetic. Long live Rust in Peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MEGADETH REVIEW LONG OVERDUE!!!","review":"I have been meaning to write this review ever since this C.D. came out but other things happen. Anyway, being a Deth fan ever since KIMB I would say that this is definitely Dave's best C.D. since RIP. You noticed I say Dave's best C.D. because I know that this C.D. originally was suppose to be a solo project under just his name. Being as he owed one more Megadeth C.D. then he had to wait. Anyway, back to the C.D. Having seen this tour I can say that KICK THE CHAIR is one of the heaviest songs to come out of Dave in a long time & it was refreshing to see Dave stick to what he knows best, the truth. The truth about his beliefs in politics, the truth about his religion & espescially the truth about how it was BACK IN THE DAY. I applaud Dave for this & knowing Dave's talent & his sincerity in everything he does so well I can feel good in knowing I can go purchase any C.D. he ever puts out without ever having to hear anything from it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth is Back!","review":"Well, Megadeth is back for a while, but this is the last official Megadeth album, Dave's going solo after this. This is a good album. It doesn't really bring back Megadeth's thrash because \\"World Needs A Hero\\" did that (a very good album by the way). I don't think this is Megadeths best in a decade. Megadeth almost had every album be awesome but they slowely went down during Criptic. This album really delivers good songs but don't think that they are all thrash. There are all good songs except \\"I Know Jack,\\" even though they might not be very hard. And if you are against political songs, you might want to stay away, this is very left wing material here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth's \\"Tattoo You\\"","review":"This will probably go down as one of Megadeth's five best albums. It's everything a Megadeth fan craves, especially after Dave and Co. experimented with their distinctive sound for several records. This is mostly back-to-basics thrash by any definition.Megadeth's career arc reminds me a lot of the Rolling Stones: A legendary early batch of albums, then several years of allowing certain musical trends to influence their songs. The Stones finally went back to their roots with \\"Tattoo You\\" and basically said, \\"This is who we really are.\\" \\"The System Has Failed\\" is that kind of record. Rock solid, honest, and thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mustaine Still Has It - 4.5","review":"I haven't bought a Megadeth release since Rust in Peace. I'm no big partisan of the band and am not part of the Metallica torpedo brigade either - they lost me around the same time. But this is fantastic! Great production. Great musicianship. Dave's voice doesn't sound half bad. Standard tuning, great guitar solos and no annoying metalcore vocals (aka 'shouting')- come on, what more could you ask for in the year 2004!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad their back.","review":"In 2002, when the announcement came that Megadeth was no more, I thought that was the end of a great band. Now in their return, I am happy to report that Dave is still making music the way he wants to. The timeliness of their songs and commentary of events make Megadeth a subtle way to inform people of things going on around them that they need to be aware of. I hope this is the first of many new albums coming our way in the future. Thanks for coming back Dave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another false 2nd coming","review":"As with the album before this Mustaine claimed a 2nd coming of his earlier thrash sound, and just like with \\"The World Needs a Hero\\" he failed to deliver. I really wanted to give this three stars but I had to give it only two. There were a couple songs I really liked (Blackmail the Universe, The Scorpion) but I can't really make a convincing case for much else. \\"Die Dead Enough\\" has one of Mustaines worst choruses yet. \\"Shadow of Deth\\" starts with an awkwardly loud voice reciting a bible passage, and eventually a marginally acceptable instrumental part enters. \\"Kick the Chair\\" is a horrible recycling of riffs from \\"Take No Prisoners\\" along with an annoying chorus. \\"Back In the Day\\" and \\"My Kingdom\\" are bad nostalgic attempts of Dave trying to assert his validity as a metal musician. The upside is that Megadeth has a back catalog of amazing albums you can pillage before you get hard up enough to pick from this carcass."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fastest speed metal band of all time?","review":"Far from it. Their career officially ended for me in 1990 with the release of RIP. All these comparisons to RIP to the new album are completely false. There are no RIP style riffs. MAYBE CTE style riffs.As far as metal goes, this is for the fans of iron maiden and ozzy osbourne. This is not for speed freaks who want to be confused and intrgued by their music. The curent metal scene is much different and there is no room for this style of metal. There are plenty of other bands out there are doing much more interesting stuff like pelican, burnt by the sun, the postman syndrome, the esoteric, etc etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is bad, limp bizkit blows megadeth away!","review":"who is this new punk band megadeth? they are just posuers! this is really bad! limp bizkit is a million times heavier then this. fred durst could sing a million times better. limp bizkit are the inventors of metal and not these fools! i don't see why so many like this band? they should get into bizkit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of Megadeth","review":"Over all this album is good but not great.It has that slower sound to it.But as comebacks come this one was pretty good.My favorite tracks are Blackmail the Universe and Kick the chair.Pretty much all the songs are decent.There are 2 songs that are short which is I know Jack which is pretty much an intro and Shadow of Deth which is kind of wierd but the solo on it is kick ass. I really miss Marty Friedmen but its still cool to see poland back in the lead guitar position. The drummings has a nice sound too. The biggest problem with the album is the bass playing. If they got ellefson back then they would be perfect. Now all Dave has to do is move foward in music and come out with a kick ass thrash metal classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Uninspired riffing (a bad habit that started with TWNAH), abhorrent and overly melodramatic lyrics (Back in the Day, a corny tribute to metal), and cheesy 80s-style production. Blech.Don't let that great cover artwork fool you: this is NOT the angry, politically-charged Megadeth that made (mostly) decent music from 86 to 97. This is ineptitude.Dave, get Junior, Nick, and Marty back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deth is back","review":"This is possibly \\"Dangerous Dave's \\",finest hour,like Tony Iommi ,he seems to have a never ending \\"riff well\\" to draw from.The last really accomplished \\"Metallinoise\\" album was \\"Master of Puppets\\", their last outing was a farce.Dave delivers in spades!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great return of Dave Mustaine","review":"Megadeth or not, this album is great. Dave Mustaine with a new lineup brings about some killer riffs and the best solos i've heard in ages. Easily one of the better albums to come out in years. Definitely way better than St.Anger. How can you have a rock album with no solos? Dave's vocals also surprised me as they sound as great as ever. Sure, Ellefson would have been nice to hear on this album, it's really Dave's show anyways, he knew what he was doing when picking the lineup. I love Kick the Chair and Back in The Day on this album most of all. There isnt a song i dont like, except the beginning to Shadow of Deth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Has Failed","review":"This cd just doesn't do it for me. For me, Cryptic Writings was the best Megadeth album. All others since then have paled in comparison. The Systom Has Failed is no exception.Although Dave has always been one of those people who are pissed at the world, his humor has also been a big part of the magic of Megadeth.(\\"Hello me, meet the REAL me!\\") TSHF is lacking that component.I miss Marty. When he left, Megadeth had a musical vascetomy.I can only hope he finds his way back, where he belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hallelujah! Thank you Jesus!","review":"Like many, I was grief-stricken when I heard that Dave lost his ability to play, and that the band would be breaking up. But, in a totally righteous twist of fate, he has made a full recovery, and given us a brand spanking new album. And boy is it good!This whole album is just solid heavy metal. Great playing from everyone, and Vinnie Colauita even plays the drums. If you like metal, buy this. It whips \\"St. Anger\\" like the donkey that ate too many carrots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands Down....","review":".....The best music Dave has ever put out.....period.I'd say I love this band but the lineup has changed so many times I can't keep track, I'll just say megadeth is in the top 5 metal bands of allllll tymeeeeee.....lol....I've followed them through the \\"Risk\\" and \\"Cryptic\\" days and thought they were not being tru to themselves and this disc, (The System), just proves me right. This type of offering is what we all want from MegaDave and it's what he does best....Not givin' a crap what everybody thinks, just play what You want, from the heart...If you're a real metal fan this is \\"MUST HAVE\\" for the collection.Party On WayneYou too Garth...Ran-out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I used to like Megadeth, but this new ablum is as lame as the last two. The thing that really bothers me is I almost like it but the guitars are buried by the bass and drums and while the riffs are good they seem to lack the agression that made megadeth big in the first place. Maybe the \\" dave mustain album\\" will be good and he is just putting his filler material on this one. I have all of the megadeth albums right up to and including risk, but I think I will stop there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Sauce","review":"It has been so long since Megadeth has put out a solid album, and have put out only 3 that can be considered good: RIP, CTO, and Youthanasia.This one is like Megadeth circa peace sells, and that is not a compliment. At least Dave had an excuse back then for putting out poor records.For the record: Ratt, Poison, Bon Jovi, and Cinderella are NOT metal. They are pop.Nu metal sucks, with very few exceptions.Green day is not punk. They are an unintelligent, untalented Bad Religion cover band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Megadeth has failed!!!!","review":"This is the worst album that I ever heard of Megadeth, even worst than Risk!!! Where is the Megadeth of Peace sells? of Countdown to extinction? of Rust in peace?...they have tried to get back to their metal roots but it seems that they have failed on that. If they have a massive failure in getting back to their roots \\"successfully\\" or in making at least a mediocre but heavy album, then is much better to get back to the commercial stuff that we have heard in the previous 2 or 3 albums, which we are actually getting used to it.I have bought it and I will keep it *only* because I am a Megadeth Die Hard fan, but, believe me, I will hate to store it with the rest of my Megadeth collection, because the only place where this piece of junk belongs is inside a thrash can (or maybe in Amazon marketplace at less than $0.50)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another failure","review":"Sigh.. when will they give it up or should I say when will Dave Mustaine realize that he no longer is writing material that is representative of what Megadeth stands for. If you buy a record with the name 'Megadeth' on it you want it to sound like it too! You don't want to hear Judas Priest! Fix the music and fix a better vocalist, 'cos face it Mustaine can't sing any longer, or give it up already!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly bad. Awesome cover!","review":"I couldn't believe how truly tenth rate the songs were. You call these memorable melodies/riffs? Original? It seems Dave's 'friends' are mental as well. If I were any of these people I'd ring up the authorities to complain about the lead in the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring,.,,","review":"4 and a half star average customer rating are you freakin kidding me? Megadeth has got to be one of the softest and the weakest thrash metal bands that exists at the moment bar none. The only reason why Megadeth became popular is because Dave Mustaine used to be in Metallica. This album is in reality a real snoozefest in comparrison to hundreds of other metal bands out there that are blessing the scene today! Definitly avoid this album espicially if your looking for heavy thrash metal, if your looking for heavy thrash metal I suggest Kreator, Testament, Sodom, Destruction, Metal Church,Overkill, and Voivod. Leave this band be unless your looking for really soft metal solos that almost sounds like rock solos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Megadeth has lost its 5 magics","review":"We all heard Cryptic and was disappointed then came Risk and most of us gave up but then with TWNAH came a glimpse of hope for the scattered droogies that was still hanging 'round; a reminesence of the past magic delivered by the riffmeister. Slowly the wound was healed and a new hope of great days was upon us. Then all of a sudden a bomb exploded from nowhere, megadeth was forever changed into a combination of Iron Maiden, Def lepard and Judas Priest. The system had failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knocks numetal on it's ass!","review":"The solos are sweet, Megadeth has Chris Poland in the band again, this album is really heavy, the songs of politcal turmoil are awesome, the riff in track 3 is cool, the vocals have emotions and angst, plus the song writing is great. Those are some of the many reasons to buy this album. There are many more, to many to list actually. so enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth in spades!","review":"Not much to review here, folks. If you are an old school thrash and roll Megadeth fan, this album stands up to most all of the great ones, and is the best since '92. It is too bad that Mr. Mustaine says this is the swansong; quite a shame, because short of Anthrax, no one else plays this style of music anymore. Pretty much a kick ass release, beginning to end. Thanks Dave!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but very good","review":"The System Has Failed, to me, brings Megadeth back to it's So Far, So Good... So What! days. There are some real stand out metal tracks and then a few tracks that are just sort of there and have no appealing qualities. The album is worth buying alone for the song \\"Scorpion\\". After a few listens from start to finish the rest will grow on you but like I said there are only a few really great songs on the disc. Give it 4 stars for being a true metal album and a great come-back effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good comeback disc.","review":"I have heard alot of mixed reviews about this one. I personaly think it's pretty good the lyrics are outstanding the music is good but I was kind of looking for a heavier sound like Peace Sell's but it's kind of where he left off sound wise. I hear alot of pepole compairing this to the \\"NEW METAL\\" why bother the new music sucks the stations only play what the record companies pay them to, if you were a Megadeth fan before then you will like this. This CD is so much better than \\"ST. SELLOUT \\" it has guitar solos remember what they were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Metal","review":"Bottom line: If you are new to Megadeth, like I am, buy this album. This is some of the finest metal I have heard since Metallica and Black Sabbath! The tracks are easy to get into, so you should be thrashing your head soon enough. Anyways, buy this cd. It is dirt cheep, and it is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aahh, Yes... Megadeth!","review":"This is a great album. A must have for Megadeth fans, and Metal fans in general. One of Megadeth's best. In addition to this title, pick up Youthanasia, also one of Megadeth's best. I own seven Megadeth albums, and can say that I am not disappointed with any of them. If you are into Heavy Metal, your collection is not complete without some Megadeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess Again","review":"You know what? I just saw these guys in concert a few days ago, and I have to say they tear it up! Yeah, with a god d*#ned explanation point. This album is great, and of all the bands I've seen over the past 15 years, these guys, (and this album) are some of the strongest lasting stuff I've heard and seen. Yeah whatever on the judgemental B.S., and the typical 'Not good enough' or 'I compare to that' - Who cares. If you didn't like the album, well, maybe you're not cut-out for this type of music. It's as good as it ever was, and if you really listen and study, it's still progressive. If I can come home with the bruises I'm bearing from this music, there's gotta be something right about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cannondp","review":"This latest effort of Mustaine's deserves six stars.

Henry Johnson is a great musician. I purchased this track for the \\"Romancing Me\\" song. The rest of the CD is very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a 2 DVD Disc set and not an import CD","review":"Horslips was an excellent Celtic Rock band before Celtic Rock was fashionable. Unfortunately for someone thinking about taking a listen to hear this amazing band, the listing on Amazon lists this as an import CD; however, from the Horslips website I was aware the set included a film about the band during their 10 year career and a second disc including live material. Unfortunately, the disc is not in a format for US region DVD players and I needed to watch the DVD's on a computer. The film was excellent and included not only background on the band but the political and social environment in Ireland during the bands career as well as interviews from people outside the band including Bono and The Edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy from MovieMars!!!","review":"I specifically asked MovieMars BEFORE I bought this CD from them, if it was the digipak that contains 2 the bonus songs. They replied and confirmed that it was indeed the digipak. Once I received the CD, it dissappointing to find that I had been lied to by MovieMars, it was not the digipak and did NOT contain the 2 bonus songs. So I had been swindled by them paying top dollar for the digipak and getting lied to. The regular CD is good however, I am just upset that crooks have taken advantage of me, lied to me, in affect stealling extra money from me for the digipak, which I really wanted. I contacted their customer service and was given an automated run around via email."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Parents view point","review":"This whole series was a refreshing insight to Harry Potter like stories.

I always read the books that my children are given to make sure the content is applicable to their age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweetypie","review":"I loved the book. It has a lot of twists and turns, along with some drama. Teenagers will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a third grader's opinion","review":"Charlie Bone and the Hidden KingIn the first four books a lot of things happened to Charlie.If I told you every thing I'd run out of paper so I will onlytalk about this one. In this exiting installment Charlie finds new friendsbut Manfred has a new power... burning hands. As the excitement continuesOlivia's new endowment causes more good than bad but is closer to being revealed.A enchanter took Charlie's mom and the shadow escapes. What happens next? you will find out in the book.I liked this book because the text was so detailed andsuspenseful. It met all of my expectations and I cant wait to read the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud cheers!","review":"I have been waiting and waiting for this book! I was so excited to get it and just read it all in one sitting and cheered loudly at the end. Justice and right prevails at last. I loved it and I hope you will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good book","review":"Not sure if this is the last book in the series or not. It ends abruptly. However, it was a good book to read, so 4 stars. I had Artemis Fowl, and 2 Charlie Bone books at the same time. I read all, but my kids dropped Charlie in favor of Artemis. Hence the 4 stars.As usual, the series becomes somewhat predictable - evil always bullies, good never seems strong enough to resist, some unknown char has to help them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMENAL!!!!!AMAZING!!!!!","review":"The Book sounds as if it is similar to Harry Potter, but it is actually different. Instead of everyone being wizards, each person has their own interesting/unusual power. Another thing that is different about the book is the adventures they go on are so interesting, that it is hard not to get dragged into the story and forget that it is not real. Don't get me wrong I love Harry Potter and I think it is amazing too, but I am just trying to prove the fact that this book did not copy Harry Potter. It is also different from Harry Potter because Charlie Bone's friends contribute almost as much to the adventures as he does. Plus they are not all endowed, some of them are just really smart and that is why they go to Bloors Academy. Even if you don't like the first book, DON'T stop because as the books go on they get better. It is definitely a must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"Once again Jenny Nimmo has produced a fun and easy to read story enjoyable by the whole family. This is a continuation of the Charlie Bone Series which provides more insight into the Red King's history and Charlie Bone, his family, and his friends. I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlie Bone and the hidden king","review":"I enjoyed this book more than the other ones in the series. i'm an avid reader and find them all easy but this one was more intense. What happens is that charlie is warned by the flames on New Years Eve that he and his friends are in danger, and they doon discover all their pets are missing. Charlie must find out about the shadow blocking him from the painting of the king, solve the mystery and help Olivia hide her newfound powers. Quite an intertainng read, it lasted me about 3 hours, so i hope there is more to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, but...","review":"First of all, like another review mentioned, even though the product description clearly says \\"yellow\\", it is indeed white. It's still really cute, though. It works well for grating cheese, which is it's purpose, so that's good. However, after the first use, the grater doesn't fit as tightly as I'd personally care for, so I have to hold it down while using it. It's not a big deal, but it is worth noting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but more difficult to use than it should be","review":"Maybe it's just mine, but I can't get the grater off. I almost had to return it because it was stuck on so tight. I eventually had to take a pair of scissors and rip the grater off, leaving a big dent in the metal and marks in the clear bowl cover. If that's how I have to get it off every time I use it, it's not worth the money to me. Cheese goes flying trying to pry the grater off to top things off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Doll!","review":"I got this Arwen doll last year and it's great! Arwen is very poseable and her outfit is beautifully detailed. She wears a plain purple dress under a detailed purple robe with a siver print that looks like vines & leaves.(The robe is the part of the outfit visible in the picture.) Arwen also has a dark pink belt with Elvish disigns on it. She has purple cloth slippers on her feet and on her head she wears a tiara, which is nicely detailed like in the movie. Her hair is black and has three small braids in it. The face on the doll has a pretty good likeness to Liv Tyler (the actress who played Arwen) but it doesn't look exactly like her. Overall, this is a great doll and you should definetly buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heard the author on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory...","review":"...this is one of the best books I've read this year. Gulbransen was on C2C back on Aug.1 and I ordered the book two weeks ago when I got paid. This is a very important book and very ahead of its time. I can't believe in the middle of the war on terror people don't look at what's happening on our border. None of the presidential candidates discuss the issue at all.This book does an excellent job of laying out what is happening down in Mexico and how terrorists can cross into the US anytime they want. I thought we had borders for a reason!I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T waste your money; No evidence to support his claims!","review":"Do not waste your money on this \\"book.\\" The author claims the USA is being infiltrated by Chinese military, but he offers NO EVIDENCE OR PROOF for these claims.

DO NOT buy this book, it is utter nonsense, without evidence to support the claims of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drivin' N Cryin' - 'The Essential Live' (Platinum Entertainment) 4 1/2 stars","review":"Recorded live at a couple of shows the band played in Chattanooga, TN and Mason, GA in July, 1999. I got to catch the band play a club myself a few years prior to this tour. Basically just good down-to-earth rock & roll. Tunes here I could barely get enough of were the powerful \\"To Build A Fire\\", the familiar sounding \\"Honeysuckle Blue\\", the catchy \\"Dirty Angels\\", the freakin' AWESOME \\"For You\\", the one track (they're most known for) \\"Fly Me Couragous\\" and \\"Hey Son, Where You Going?\\". Personnel: Kevn Kinney-guitar & vocals, David Franklin-guitar, Tim Nielson-bass & vocals, Joey Huffman- keyboards & piano and Jeff Sullivan-drums. Remember when I saw these guys, I happen to come across one of Kevn Kinney's guitar picks - it read \\"Start Your Own Band\\". Might do a lot for fans of The db's, Black Crowes, BoDeans and possibly Wilco.

There are only a few HD channels available in our area. We have digital cable and the tv comes in terrible. Our regular tv is much better. Every little pixel shows, it always looks distorted and the screen views are not impressive. We have had sharp and our cable company out to look at it, and unless you have HD on every single channel, digital cable will just not do. The picture is fuzzy and if you watch fast moving sports like we do, the tv will give you a major headache. Its going back. Don't bother waste the money for the name and the integrated tuner does not make one bit of difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Very disappointed in the performance of these blades - no matter what I did they just left streaks on the windshield. These are the worst blades I have ever attempted to use. Certainly not worth what I paid for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Mounting hardware","review":"Despite Trico charts this blade is the correct size for later model Camrys on the passenger side. Combining the 19 inch blade with the 26 inch on the drivers side will result in the blades making hard contact at the bottom of their sweep risking damage to both the blade and the wiper motor. Also beware of the plastic mounting hardware which can easily be cracked when trying to remove ice and snow buildup."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!!!","review":"These wipers are worthless!! In fact they might end up costing you a ton of money when you have to replace your windshield. I bought a pair that came apart completely, leaving bare metal on my windshield.....

Having defeated Wither in the first novel, Wendy and the other characters are trying to move on with their lives, but as in all good scary tales, the monster isn't really dead. Wither takes possession of the body of Gina Thorne and slowly begins to plot her revenge against Wendy.I really enjoyed \\"Wither\\" but was a little disappointed with \\"Wither's Rain.\\" The ending was very anti-climactic and a tinge contrived. In addition, it left the door wide open for Passarella's next novel in the series, Wither's Legacy. I will read it to find out what happens to Wendy. She is an extremely likeable character and I would love to see Passarella have her finally overcome the entity called Wither and move on to some other Wiccan flavored mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Storm is Brewing!!!","review":"Wither's Rain is a veritable storm of events and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. All of our favorite characters like Wendy Ward and Elizabeth Wither are back and some new faces as well. John Passarella does not disappoint his fans and even if you have not read Wither (Although I can't imagine why you wouldn't have!) this is a wonderful blend of mystery, horror, romance, and drama. Gather up your umbrella and galoshes, because Wither's Rain is fixin' to pour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary Equivalent of 'Showgirls:' Trashy Fun","review":"The return of Wither and Wendy was a lot of fun to read, but will never be held up as an example of fine writing. There's lots of magic, sex, and violence, and even a thin plot to hold it all together. This is a book that you'll enjoy, but will make you feel kind of embarassed afterwards because you know that what you've read is really bad.I hate to admit it, but I'm going to read the 3rd in the trilogy. I just won't tell any of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"wither's rain","review":"The book was finished in one night, it was really good.

If you are a fan of the original song, then forget this cd. I supose it has some interesting dance beats on it, but very little resemblance to the original other than the title, which was one of the greatest of the old Disco classics.When oh WHEN will Pattie Brooks original albums \\"Love Shook\\" and \\"After Dark\\" be released on cd?

On the up side, you can set a weather alert to wake you up prior to the normal alarm time if the temperature drops below freezing in the event of a storm. The only issue I have with this model is that even with the blue backlight, the unit is hard to read. It would have been better if the display gave more of a contrast so it was more visible."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIP Lenny Mayes","review":"i always dug the Dramatics.\\"Be my Girl\\" the great cut that Michael Henderson did for them is timeles.

It was extremely helpful. I actually experienced 80% of everything I read in a two week period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both humorous and informative","review":"Indeed a very helpful and informative book for understanding Indonesian people and culture. Haveing spent almost two years living and working in Indonesia I found myself referring to this book often. I found myself explaining to my fellow expatriates why certain things happened the way they do in this country often referring to things I read. From conducting business to accomplishing everyday tasks, this book offers excellent example and explantions. Definately a book for expatraites living in Indonesia, business travellers, but also beneficial to the traveller wanting to ascertain a deeper, more sincere understanding of Indonesian people and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ther band II BIG","review":"The band II BIG continues to record some of the best rock music.I own all of their cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devotion with a thoughtful bend","review":"This is an excellent short devotion book. It covers our important faith issues with grace and thoughtfulness. The writer definitely speaks to both our hearts and our minds. The pieces are short but to the point, leaving you with some key insights and prayers to ask for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stayed up all night!!!","review":"I loved this book so much that I stayed up all night just to finish. This is the third book I have read by Miriam Minger and I will say Im truly a fan. I have enjoyed every book I have read and this one was great. I loved the hero and the heroine. And I can't wait to read the next book in this series. Well worth keeping and rereading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book","review":"Miriam Minger drew me into her book and never let go. Wild and headstrong, Triona O'Toole led her guardian, 'Black' O'Byrne on the most frustrating journey of his life. She thwarted him at every turn on his quest to find her a suitable husband to relieve him of his deathbed promise to care for her.Both got more than they bargained for. It was a pleasure to follow Triona and Ronan on the path that led them from being adversaries to embracing their destiny.I can't say enough good things about the wonderful writing style of Miriam Minger. Her books are all a 'must read' for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good change of hero and heroine","review":"It was a good read. It kept me interested in the beginning, but started to become predictable towards the end. You were still able to connect with and understand what the charcters were going through. It just kinda lost its fizz after awhile like soda when you leave it out. I wish the outcome was different in the end. It left me wondering WHAT? No way! After all that... it ends like this?This book had potential to be better, I wish it were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving this author","review":"I can not believe the bargain we get with Miriam's books!! This was another great story with wonderful characters.I do wish both the characters had talked through their issues instead of each assuming what the other was thinking or feeling or what their attentions were but I understand that's just how it is sometimes. Triona was especially annoying at times but she was a beloved daughter for all her her life who was used to getting her way so I could see why she fought sometimes. Ronan was a little rough around the edges but really enjoyed their story!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. Being free usually means I keep my expectations lower than normal. But, this book was funny and touching and a fun read. I quickly got caught up in Ronan and Triona's story. I do plan on reading other stories by this author.Why only four stars? My largest complaint with the book is Triona and her tantrums. At first they were understandable, even humorous, but by the middle of the book they were getting old, by the end of the book I was trying to figure out why Ronan loved her so much. The way she lost her temper over nothing, jumped to the wrong conclusion again and again and had little to no regard for anyone else but herself got VERY old. While that is a major complaint (when a character doesn't grow, just continues to exhibit childishness throughout a book), I really did enjoy the story and so this complaint only warranted losing one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd creeps in like a crimson fog.","review":"This elloquent work of subtlety belongs in the lineage with Jeff Buckley's 'Grace' and Sigur Ros's () album.Imaad's quiet, contemplative voice remains clear and cool over the stark string arrangements. The lack of percussion on most of this album leaves a lot of room for ambience as well. The use of droning guitars, harmonium, and hints of middle-eastern modes moves the songs toward a crescendo, giving the songs a breathing quality not usually found in indie rock records.The lyrics are at times vague, and envoke a darkness that is not easy to pinpoint, like Elliott Smith.All of these elements contribute to the record's strongest quality; atmosphere. BUY THIS CD if you like to put on records and zone out for an hour.Imaad also has a myspace if you'd like to check out one of his songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop with the Buckley.","review":"It boggles my mind when I see review's that say this guy sound's like Jeff Buckley I'm a huge fan of Imaad and a so/so fan of Jeff, just because Wasif has an emotive voice does not mean you should catergorize it as Buckley like as for people who do sound similiar try Thom Yorke or Matt Bellamy(of Muse)pre Black Holes. Also try listening to a wider spectrum of music as well maybe that will help you realize who sound's like who and who doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"mal","review":"este disco tiene letras muy malas, lo unico que lo salva es la produccion de musica, confio en que en un futuro haga mejores canciones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thalia, Amilia","review":"This album was a dissapointment.

She could do something a lot better...

This cd really worth the price but Thalia's..."},{"rating":"1","title":"arrazTRANDO","review":"Such a waste. Why does it seem that artist focus their energy on one single hit song, then blow off the rest of the albulm? This is exactly the case with Arrazando. Perhaps the lazy Thalia knew that one hit song would cause fans to buy the entire cd. She could not even come up with a decent picture for the cover. (Get your hand out of your mouth!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buen CD","review":"este cd es bueno pero yo espero que contendria mas canciones con ritmos latinos como \\"siempre hay carino,\\" y \\"Rosalinda en vez de pop de america. puedo escuchar esos ritmos con personas como nsync, y britney spears (en cambio thalia puede cantar mejor de britney)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Spanish CD Yet!","review":"This is the best CD in Spanish I have ever listened to. It has all kinds of beats and music that you can't go wrong. This CD is not only pop, it's rap, dance, R&B, ballad, salsa, and more. Arrasando is a complete CD which includes music from all places. The Lyrics are the best and the voice that goes with the Lyrics is just the best. I truly reccomend this CD, you won't be sorry! Once you buy it you won't stop listening to it! I can't wait until her English Album comes out! Buy It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EL MEJOR","review":"Primero que nada quiero desearle a Thalia muchisimo exito en su carrera y en su resiente matrimonio con el senor Tommy Motola. Esta vez que si arrasaste no solo con el disco \\"Arrasando\\" si no que con el novio tambien. Felizidades de todo corazon. Esta bez si que Thalia arraso con este disco es una maravilla de preyecto en verdad. Yo e admirado a thalia desde mucho y abia escuchado cada uno de sus proyectos que por sierto siempre se sale son la suya nos pone a mover a todos el esqueleto. Pero este nuevo proyecto es divino verdaderamente divino. Todas las cancios son exelentes con un poco de salsa,pop,balada, y no podia faltar el rey de todos, el ritmo latino!. La verdad esta muy despanpanante su cd. y la portada que no se diga es genial.Sige manteniendo tu ritmo latino y no te olvides de nosotros tu familia que somos todos tus fans y el pueblo Mexicano. Te amo y felizidades de nuevo por tu proyecto que esta arrasando con todo y con todos. Sige arrasando.... Te amo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decepcionante y Pobre CD","review":"Definitivamente un CD que no es el mejor de Thalia, una mezcla de ritmos que no van para nada con su personalidad, ademas de que su actitud con la prensa ayudo a que la comercializacion de este CD no fuera lo que se esperaba. Una Thalia donde no supera en nada a su anterior trabajo de AMOR A LA MEXICANA, incluye en este albums ritmos de rap donde dificilmente llega a ser creible que se ella quien lo interpreta...ademas su pose y tanta sangroneria esta por cansar a su publico que ya se siente una diosa y su falta de presentaciones en vivo esta deteriorando su imagen. Un album que definitivamente no arraso ni cuajo en el mercado, falto el toque que Thalia ha hecho en sus albums anteriores que era ser ella misma para pasar a hacer una cantante en busca de identidad que no tiene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrasando...mmmm....","review":"Here is my review for Arrasando. As you know I'm a big Thalia fan and I've reviewed like five of her albums.

I hope her next album is just as awesome as this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THALIA WAS,IS,AND WILL KEEP BEING THE BEST.","review":"OK.I DON'T REALLY CARE IF YOU LIKE THIS REVIEW OR NOT.I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I LOVED THALIA'S FIRST SONGS.I ADORED EN EXTASIS.I WARSHIPPED AMOR A LA MEXICANA.NOW THAT ARRASANDO IS OUT I DON'T HAVE WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT.IT IS JUST LIKE THALIA.PERFECT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Una verdara porqueria!","review":"Sin duda la mejor etapa de Thalia musicalmente hablando fue de 1988 a 1993. El trabajo de Emilio Estefan en el album es gris, aburrido y convencional al igual que en \\"Amor a la Mexicana\\". Si realmente quieren escuchar buenas grabaciones de Thalia, traten de conseguir sus primeros discos: Thalia (lanzado en 1990 y sin duda su mejor trabajo jamás editado), Mundo de cristal (1991), o Love (1992) y eviten comprar este disco poco original y bastante aburrido ¿Algun comentario?... acepto mails."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE IS ONLY 0NE GOOD SONG","review":"In my opinion the only god song I found is Regresa a mi other than that the CD is nothing that I had expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bella!","review":"Arrasando es la primer album que he comprado de Thalia y no es la musica a que me estoy acostumbrado sino a mi me encanta, asi Thalia tiene una voz muy linda, un estilo muy rico y sobretodo ella es muy hermosa pero eso ya todos saben. El decir mas acerca de Arrasando, las canciones son muy bailables, asi mas o menos es musica de las discotecas y cada cancion va seguirte queriendo escucharla mas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the Best","review":"Thalia is just simply the best. She is beautiful and can really sing. There are singers who cann't sing at all and are only liked for their image. I think that her crossover will be a big hit. I think American singers better watch out. She is true latin singer. Jeniffer Lopez,Christia, and Mark Anthony are all Americans. I cann't wait to hear her sing in English."},{"rating":"1","title":"Begining of the end for Thalia","review":"While Thalia was never a trend setter, I think it's fair to say that early in her career she more or less did her own thing and that's really what worked for her as evidenced by the success of her previous album. Where as it's predecessor managed to effortlessly encompass everything that makes the latin pop genre such a blast to listen to, \\"Arrasando\\" finds Thalia adapting to a much heavier dance influenced sound that was so prominent during this time. While the idea of that sounds exciting the delivery and execution are terribly weak. The biggest problem with \\"Arrasando\\" is that it's so slickly produced that it leaves Thalia zero room to play up the flamboyant dance diva role that these songs call for and leaves her sounding very tight and confined.A very weak point in Thalia's career. \\"Arrasando\\" not only put a hamper on the momentum she'd worked so hard to build up, it also exposed her naivety as an artist.Listen to: \\"Entre el mar y una estrella\\", \\"Reencarnación\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"THALIA RULZ!","review":"THALIA IS AND WILL REMAIN THE BEST SINGER IN THE WHOLE WORLD!

I have \\"Pa'otro lado\\" and loved it, it still mesmerises me; nearly every track on it is a winner, or at least catchy. I only wish I could say the same about \\"De vuelta al barrio\\". I think it should've been entitled \\"Devuelveme al basurero\\".The tracks on this CD lack the punchy beat of the first one. There is a smothering uniformity across the songs and they lack the distinctiveness that marked songs such as \\"Limon con sal\\" and \\"Me enamore\\" on the first CD. There is a \\"sameness\\" about this CD that is disappointing.I have trouble even listening to this CD, it is dull. Chichi, me encanto tu primer compacto.
