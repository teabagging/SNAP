Its one of those books that inspires and changes your entire perspective on life. Ged, whose humble beginnings as a goatherder fail to deter his destiny as a Wizard, unleases a terrible evil while training to be a Wizard on the island of Roke. What follows is a journey that changes Ged's life forever. Chased and persued within an inch of his life, Ged soon becomes a hunter, learning about wisdom, power and ultimately himself along the way. There is magic in the pages of this book, and it definitely does not deserve to be dissmissed as a childrens book, although the kids will enjoy it immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple and Uninteresting","review":"This book was so unstimulating that i read in in one day just to be rid of it. The characters remain undeveloped as the very modest storyline unfolds itself. For readers of younger ages (10-12) this book would be very interesting because it poses no intellectual difficulties. It passes over months of the characters life with barely a word. It left me with a feeling of com,plete and utter lack of connection with the main character. The fact that someone would even compare this book to Tolkien let alone praising it over him is rediculous. I would actually reread sewctions of the book figuring i must have left out an entire chapter since seemingly important sections of a characters life were just passed by. I would not recommend this book to anyone over the age of 13 unless you have an afternoon to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I started this novel with a great deal of anticipation; I had read reviews, and seen this book on many fan lists, so I bought it.Usually, when I start the first book in a fantasy series, I spend many sleepless nights pouring through each sequel until I have finished the series. This is the first time I had no interest in finding out what happened in the subsequent books.The stories and characters were horribly underdeveloped. Neither were built up enough for me to even care about what happened to them. The entire approach to wizardry felt overly simplistic for the fantastic events that were supposedly happening.I haven't been this disappointed with anything since I saw Dungeons and Dragons (what a pile that thing was)."},{"rating":"1","title":"pah! this is nothing compared to tolkien","review":"this book has such a lack of imagery and a weak predictible plot that it dosen't compare to tolkien's masterpiece. it's storyline is long and drawnout for a simple plot as a wizard who chased his shadow. all i can say is if you want something to read this is it but if you want a good fantasy worth your time try tolkien, terry goodkind, or brian jaques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"I really wasn't impressed with this novel. I found it lacking not only in action but also in depth, plot and meaning. I guess I'm just missing something, but to me it seemed like nothing happened, like I wasted a few good hours of my life that I could have spent drooling in front of the TV. I don't know why i kept reading through the third book, probably my misinterpreted view that there is to be a point to novels. Three books of short, shallow sentances that move the plot along at a snail's crawl. She introduces characters and then just forgets about them(Tombs of Atuan?) What was the second book for anyway? To prove he could hunt treasure and lure small girls from their homes? But I digress, the first book is a bore of epic proportions(despite being 150 pages) that track the misdemeanors of an ignoble youth who (SURPRISE!) eventually becomes the Archmage.

Ranking amongst the best fantasy novels I have read.When I discovered Leguin continued the saga, I couldn't wait to get hold of the other three.What a disappointment it was. It looks like a completely different author. The first was a writer, a storyteller and a good one at that. The second one was a disgruntled feminist with the delusion she has writing abilities.The second three books differ from the first three as a cheap cowboy novel differs from Tolkien.By all means, do read the first three books. They are well worth it. But forget the last three.

Nothing could be further from the truth. This book was full of sullen, unsympathetic characters and the silliest dragons in the history of fantasy literature- dragons that you can defeat merely by calling their name. Moreover the book is obsessively concerned with the balance of magic- an interesting concept, but one which the author handles badly. The magic of Tolkien's Middle-earth is inherent in the characters- it's not what they do, but what they are. Compared to this the conflicting petty spells and name-calling in Earthsea are pretty disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book left me bored...","review":"I read this book for a scifi/fantasy lit class I was taking at the time. The teacher started off with this book because it was one of the first real popular fantasy books that was non-tolkien. I have varying tastes, but all I really desire in a fantasy book is enough detail to make the world feel real, characters that I can care about, and a unique story. This book seemed to be lacking all of those things. I guess it was just to simple for me, and too short to really get invested in the story. I believe it was written in the late 60s and you can really tell, it shows it's age compared to more modern fantasy. I haven't read any of LeGuin's other stuff, but one thing I do know, is that I just did not like this book at all. Also, stay away from the movie version, after watching that I suddenly didn't think the book was so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLEEPER!","review":"I don't know about anyone else who read this book but I was having trouble staying awake reading it.

But I didn't read all of it, I only got about 3/4 of the way through, and it bored me so much that I quit reading it. I don't usually do that. I was 13, but maybe that's too young. I don't think so, I've read books like Jane Eyre, and Pride and Prejudice and some other harder books, and really liked them.

We started it, and it was terrible! Every single person in our class thought so. We wrote a petition to our teacher saying we shouldn't read it, and so later she told us that, if every single person came in the next day with a paragraph persuading her to let us not read it, she would make us read something else. The next day, twenty-four long paragraphs flooded to her desk, telling about how boring, far-fetched, confusing, and badly written it was. So we didn't have to read it.

So please, don't bother with this book if you want something that will keep you even remotely interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Are The Negative Stars When You Need Them?","review":"I give this book five stars. No, wait, I mean negative five. I cried when I read this book. Seriously, I ran and sobbed in the closet for about half an hour; that's how much I hated it.There are much, much better fantasy stories out there. I'm very strict with myself about the integrity of my reading- that is, I don't allow myself to skip anything or skim over boring parts. Unfortunately, I realized after I was finished with AWoE, the whole novel was one enormous boring part and I should have flipped through the pages and called it a day.The author has somehow managed to turn an archetypal journey into an over-reaching, unsubtle literary disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This book is terrible for a child or for an adult.

At the time I first read it, I definitely didn't understand it and found it slow and unpictoresque. Now some 15 years later, I find it a great work on human nature and the \\"stuff\\" of which human relationships are made of. Indeed, when you think of somebody, you think about a name and a mental picture of what the persons represents for you; so, the idea of imbuing the name with the essence is in my opinion a nice one.

It is a wonderfully paced beginning to what proves to be a fantastic tale of Ged of Earthsea. It combines all the good stuff you would want in a fantasy; dragons, magic and dark shadows with the clean, rich and guiding (not pushing like some other series) writing that Leguin seems to be so good with. Just Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Easily the best of this series of books.

I didn't even know there was a fourth book! I'm so pleased I was wrong - this trilogy meant a lot to me, and to discover that it's available in hardcover, aimed at school libraries! It's so well written, and an excellent recommendation for readers of Harry Potter who are looking for more fantasy, or a more mature fantasy.

It's also notable for the great charcter actor J.T. Walsh's last movie, but it was a good swan song performance. Some of the action pieces bogged down the film, although F.Gary Grey's direction hightened the suspense of what exactly would come next. Kudos for the trailer people for missleading us in a way, so the end wasn't totally predictable from the two minute trailer, though it probably hurt the film's B.O.

It was the first time that I watched the movie with the intent of evaluating the accuracy of the movie's portrayal of actual negotiations. I was surprised how accurate the negotiation processes were portrayed in the movie...it matched many of the conflict communication theories I studied.On the entertainment side, getting Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson together in the movie surely didn't hurt. Good cast, decent story line, well put together and enjoyable to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT MOVIE!","review":"An OUTSTANDING film, The Negotiator, brings to the screen the story of a police negotiator who is set up for a murder he did not commit. Things get a little more complicated when he finds himself at the wrong end of a hostage situation as the hostage taker...Samuel Jackson, Kevin Spacey, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it is an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!In short, The Negotiator is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coin With One Side","review":"This movie has a great combination of action, mystery, and special knowledge.

Worth seeing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey turn two distinct yet strong performances. Jackson is always great to watch for his intensity, and this role suits that to a tee. Spacey continues to impress with a solid and believable performance. This film and its settings/supporting cast are *slightly* dated by today's standards, but the two main actors and the good story more than make up for it. Highly worthwile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling performance and an unforgetable stroy!","review":"A great team work by Jackson and Spacey. You never know what is going to be next, who is good guy and who is bad. A lots of suprise and shock. On the other hand, too violant for young viewers, definitely not a family movie. But if you are an adult, watch it alone at mid night, you won't sleep again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 5 point bonus for this one!","review":"I really like this movie because it do not behave the way you expect. The story twists and turns and you never know what comes next. Most movies today are fairly linear and you can guess what will happen pretty soon. Now so with this. And you can see it many times over. You always pick up something new that you missed. Both Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey perform great but it's the rest of the cast the brings it up a notch in my book. Great acting. Just buy it, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Movie","review":"I saw it on TV and had to buy for DVD. This movie is a classic, true edge of your seat thriller with outstanding preformances from Samuel L. Jackson (Die Hard 3, Rules Of Engagement) and Kevin Spacey (Outbreak, American Beauty). The concept is amazing i aplluad wh ever came up with the idea. Script was well written and the characters are believable. It passes just over 2 hours but well worth the sit. Buy it if u don't already own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good acting and good story!","review":"If you are looking for a movie where the story doesn't depends on the action, you have found it! The story of \\"The Negotiator\\" is very good (but sometimes a bit complicated). It's also pretty realistic though it has a few unbelievable things.The performances of Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey are also very good. The only dissapointing thing was the action. Because the gunfights were the same as we have seen in other action movies and doesn't add some new things wich normaly makes action movies so interesting.That makes this movie not very good as an action movie, but just a good thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a bad a** Movie.","review":"This movie is packed with action and suspence.

I like many of the movies Spacek and Jackson have done before. This movie combines ideas of what SWAT and negotiators do for a living. The plot does not seem feasible but I enjoy how quick and intense they kept the movie. I have been to Chicago and thought the movie gave a flavor of police work in the city. It is a \\"guy\\" movie, full of shooting, dying, and beatings.

Danny has lost confidence in everyone in his own department, so he requests hostage negotiator Chris Sabian to help negotiate, and help prove his innocence. As the situation gets to a critical level, pieces of the puzzle start to fall into place. This is a very intense emotional suspense movie. Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey turn in phenomenal performances. This thrill a minute film is a definite must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was the bomb!","review":"This movie created a sense of nervous engery which I would consider a \\"good thing\\".

It sort of put me in the perspective of what a negotiator would do at his/her profession or someone who has strong demands to harm or control a situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It !","review":"This movie is was a Thriller all the way, from the begining to the end.

The hero doesn't blast bad guys into oblivion every five seconds. That is what makes this movie so great. This is a movie that relies on wit and intelligence rather than explosions and gunfire. It doesn't insult the audiences IQ.The great Samuel L. Jackson stars as a hostage negotiator who is framed for stealing money and murdering his partner. The equally great Kevin Spacey plays the hostage negotiator Jackson calls in to talk to after he takes hostages and tries to prove his innocence. The scenes between Jackson and Spacey are very intense as one tries to outwit the other. The late J.T. Walsh is at his creepy best as the crooked I.A.D. officer. If your looking for a smart and entertaining thriller, look not further."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Negotiator [The rules of engagment]","review":"In this action-packed thriller Samuel L. Jackson is framed for the murder of his friend. He being a negotiator himself thought this could never happen. He lost his badge, but didn't loose the trust of his wife. He finds out that his friend was getting close to a secret that only a few cops knew. After giving up his badge, he takes four people hostage. (This is where it gets good). To the shagrin of his fellow officers, he doesn't give up. He requests that his name be cleared and charges dropped. The main man he holds is the man in charge of this 'secret'. No I won't ruin the ending for you.

I am a teenager in high school, not an overprotective parent, and the profanity was so frequent that it lowered the entertainment level dramatically. It got to the point of extreme annoyance. Samuel L. Jackson was miscast. He isn't a bad guy with his reputation. Nothing ever seemed to develop. All it showed was the criminal in a building with hostages chit-chatting with the police, while the lives of the people involved in this took a dramatic turn. THAT IS JUST AMAZING. The folks who wrote the script sure have an imaginative mind to think this up(sarcasm). There have been billions, it seems, of movies about the same topic. This is just one of the many. Not to mention, it is way too long and drawn out.

On the other side, she has 10 minutes of affirmations, then it just stops. So for a person, who's feeling helpless in the hospital -- it doesn't work. You don't want to hear her same instructions over and over again. The 10 minutes of imagery is good enough, and so are the affirmations when you turn it over.

Boulez, a French composer and conductor, interprets Varese, a French-born composer whose work begins just after Debussy's death, as a colorist in the manner of the older composer. This makes historical sense. The vulgar and exaggerated displays of noise in most earlier recordings can make Varese seem hysterical. But Boulez allows us to view these works as the post-Debussy coloristic masterpieces they are, crafted with great care as to nuance and balance of sound. Boulez gives us a vision of Varese reborn without all the excessive clanging and banging and sirening that usually overshadow his most inventive, influential, and (please notice) subtle music. This is a welcome CD issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds magnificent","review":"I have Boulez's earlier Sony recording of the Varese but I haven't listened to it in a while so I can't compare it to this. I bought this mainly to hear what the Chicago Symphony sounds like these days (as it turns out, this was recorded in 1995 (Ameriques, Ionisation) and 1996 (Arcana, Deserts), so it isn't as current as I'd hoped). To me, what Varese is all about is the magnificent sounds that an orchestra can make and this recording delivers the goods. I guess the critics don't like this performance that much, but I don't sense a lack of excitement without other records I've heard over the years fresh in my mind, and I find the recording so luminous, dynamic, and crystal clear that I can't help recommending it without reserverations. After all, Varese IS about SOUNDS and this recording has them in spades."},{"rating":"2","title":"TECHNICAL RIFFS A-PLENTY HERE!","review":"This is the 2nd Immolation album I purchased. At first, I didnt like this one all that much, I dont know what is was... but it's grown on me in the last 5 months (I got in back in early Feb. 2006). I've always liked the 1st track, \\"Nailed to Gold\\" & the title track \\"Here in After,\\" but now some of the others are getting good all the sudden. While it didnt immediately catch me like their masterpeice of a debut \\"Dawn of Possession\\" did, its a good album & you can hear that signature Immolation style really starting to come into its own. Be sure to get this when you can though... I dont know if its out of print like their 1st album is, but it was hard to find. If you like Immolation's brand of DM, I also recommend \\"Failures for Gods,\\" \\"Close to a World Below,\\" \\"Unholy Cult,\\" & of course the brilliant debut \\"Dawn of Possession.\\" Get any of them, & Im sure some of the others are good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"here in after","review":"This is a taste of the early immolation.ROSS sounds great plus original drummer here.Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, but the production is kind of weak","review":"This album was recorded after a hiatus of about 5 years. Immolation had a lot of time to grow in that period, and you can really hear the development of new ideas, especially the dissonant riffs, but its pretty clear that they weren't entirely comfortable with this new style yet. The production is pretty shoddy, and really lacks the low end and punch of their debut, but does capture the feeling of hallowness and despair that they tried to create. Weird timing signatures pop up everywhere, as the death vocals shake your fillings loose. Its a good album, but I'd reccommend their first album or their new masterpiece, Unholy Cult, over this. Still, if you want innovative death metal, this is not a bad place to look."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad","review":"Her first album was beyond brilliant. The second showed great depth.

With each CD Audra releases, she definitely shows the reason why her musicianship has won her various Tony Awards for her performances onstage.

I've been waiting for some time for Audra to put out a new CD, and I'm not disappointed. You won't be either. Each song has been well chosen and she performs them all with gusto and passion. We are so fortunate that we have Audra around to illustrate the true meaning of a performer/artist. She's top notch.\\"Lose That Long Face\\" is my favorite on this CD. If anything comes close to Judy Garland's unbridled power, the last 1/3 of this song is it. Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Songs by Audra McDonald","review":"This is a fantastic album.

Some of my favorite are \\"Ain't it the truth?\\" \\"Bambalele\\" \\"Beat my dog\\" \\"See what I wanna see\\" and \\"I double dare you.\\" I urge you to buy and listen to every one of Audra's recordings because a talent like this is RARE!

She is AMAZING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ear candy!","review":"Audra, Audra, Audra - the young lady from Fresno (Saroyan country) - what a wonder you are.I must agree with my friend Kwame, this is simply her best album thus far. The material here (for the most part) is inspired. I adore the jazz flavor and big band arrangements - that wonderful sound of brass. From the very first selection - \\"Ain't It De Truth\\" - I knew I was in for a real treat, a feast for the ear. The tracks which follow - \\"Tess's Torch Song,\\" \\"I Must Have That Man,\\" \\"I Wish I Were In Love Again\\" and, especially, \\"See What I Wanna See\\" - don't disappoint.

Sad, because though it might not have been noticed in cinemas, Grey Owl is a well-made, well-told interesting story that is acted to perfection by Pierce Brosnan. This is one of those smaller films that really stays with you.Grey Owl is based on an real-life story of a native guide in the Canadian wilderness. An early conservationist, he struggled to get the public's attention to the loss of many of Canada's wild animals such as the beaver. But Grey Owl had a secret that, when discovered, threatens to derail his crusade to save the native Canadians and the wilderness.This movie is about all that and much more. Grey Owl is fascinating, complex person, and Brosnan's acting brings him to life incredibly well.

The descriptions can be a bit esoteric at times. It's fairly short. It is not exactly a page turner, the some parts can seem repetitive if you are reading big chunks without listening to the music as well. However, I think it is one of the best books on Indian music I've found in English. If you are looking for a good guide to assist in listening to and understanding great classical Indian music, this book serves that purpose very well. If you are looking for a book that includes contemptorary Indian musicians and has pictures of George Harrison, there are other books out there that can offer that kind of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with XP - Not able to Play Game","review":"My daughter plays this game on an archaic computer (windows 98).

In particular, the chapter on gay male sexuality was appalling. Filled with stereotypes and ignorance and treating bathroom sex as typical of how gay men relate sexually, I will never forget it. In his latest edition there is almost no improvement in his treatment of male-male sexuality. To him, gay men are still denizens of bathrooms and bathhouses. He does not seem to conceive of the idea that two men could manifest physical love to each other. From a mechanical standpoint he is also laughingly and hopelessly mis-informed. Why did the publisher revive this homophobic work?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars. Still reads like he wrote it 30 years ago","review":"While Reuben has toned down his patently anti-gay bias, his \\"I'm just telling it like it is\\" attitude is still just thinly veiled and self-congratulatory ignorance. You have to wonder if he's ever met any gay people in his life. He certainly hasn't met any happy ones. That may be his experience, but he's doing a disservice to us all--gay and straight--by generalizing his experience to all gay people. If you're gay, look up this book by Peter Shalit, M.D. instead: \\"Living Well: The Gay Man's Essential Health Guide\\". It's everything that Reuben's book should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"He hasn't changed","review":"This book, when it first appeared, became one of the most damaging and injurious books of the 20th century. Reuben's ignorant, false lies about gays and lesbians were read or heard about just about everyone, and caused a lot of pain. Pain to me, who beleived what he said, pain to my mother, who beleived it. How sad his book became a cultural phenomenon.I really don't have much of an opinion about his other topics, but he seems very narrow minded and judgmental and self important. There are undoubtedly some good things in this book, but you can find the same information elsewhere.In this new edition he has toned things down a bit, but this is, after all 2002.I do not recommend this book to anyone for any reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilariously mis-informed for the new set, tragic for the old","review":"When I first found this book in the first edition form in college, I instantly took it home so my gay friends and I (also gay) could have a good laugh at what this guy thought about us and how we lived. We honestly thought that the gays he supposedley interviewed thought it was a great prank, not knowing it would become a best seller and become the 'bible' of sorts to straight people who learned about a taboo topic from this book (anyone remember the Wonder Years episode about this book?). After the laughter died down we realized that it was media like this that made our parents fear and loathe our kind, because it was the only voice talking, and is still talking through shows like Will and Grace and Queer as Folk that don't go a long way to disprove what he writes in this book. The best thing we can do is try to fight this ignorance and if we get asked to contribute to a book, be sure to take it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"I shouldn't have asked","review":"This book is so misinformed.

It is almost acceptable to hold such views and ill-concieved thoughts 30 years ago... but in 1999??? And not only is the chapter on \\"Male Homosexuality\\" so stragne.. the rest of the booklet is also so unbalanced, confused and missing any accurate basis for informing readers for a heathly sex knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"An odious book","review":"It may be 1999, but you'd never know it from this horrible book, supposedly \\"updated.\\" In this new edition, Reuben STILL paints a picture of gay people as promiscuous and incapable of forming lasting relationships. Sure, some are--but then, so are some straight people. To portray all gay people this way is as wrong and hateful as depicting all black people as murderers. The book does, though, go some way to explaining where homophobia and homohatred come from."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't even give it the one star","review":"My own opinion is that the book was meant to scare people away from ever having sex. It gives a first impression of being open-minded, but really, its message is to never have sex, because bad things might happen to you. Some of it seemed to be very close to urban myth territory. What I remember the most, though, were the fright stories about back-alley abortionists and women who died trying to abort an unwanted pregnancy. I don't remember much about the author's ideas about homosexuality, but for the most part I wouldn't take anything he had to say about sex seriously. Reading it again, it just seems to be a modern version of the moral hygiene pamphlets from the early part of the 20th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snotty stuffy tonalities which turn me off","review":"I rented a copy of this book from my local library. I was not happy with what I found. Throughout this book the author uses a know it all \\"snotty nosed\\" tone to everything he says. It's really irritating. One particularly good example of the bad nature of this book is on the back dust jacket that comes with the hard cover eddition. It says \\"how a man can actually grow a new foreskin and why he shouldn't.\\" Then in the relevant section in the book he goes on to state that circumcision is merely an option open to parents. This is an abusive and absurd view. If you want to know anything about how to be sexually turn off and repulsed and angred, and how to get a sick feeling in your stomach, go ahead and get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the open-minded.","review":"A better title would be \\"Everything you always wanted to know about David Reuben's hangups\\".

I decline to spend good money on the updated version because updated crap is still crap. It was a best-seller then because Dr. Reuben hit on a winning formula. Tittilating information (in the 60's, sex was just starting to be openly discussed), a chatty, non-clinical format that relaxed the nervous reader(most of us in those days)and a medical degree to give it respectability, Great except for one thing, Dr.Reuben knew nothing of his topics. He had no psychiatric training(California law allowed any MD to hang a psychiatrist shingle) My favorite idiocy was the notion that syphillis and gonorrhea could be eliminated by giving everyone mandatory injections of penicillin. Brushing aside the civil liberties issue, I can't think of a better way to develop a nice vicious drug-resistant strain of these diseases. The book is enjoyable only as a reminder of how gullible we were 30 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing","review":"I remember reading the original version of this book as a teenager some 30 years ago and thinking I was well-informed on the topic of sexuality. Was I ever wrong! When I read parts of this updated version, I was shocked. It seems the good doctor is uncomfortable with anyone outside of heterosexual married couples. Anyone practicing any form of sexual expression he doesn't quite understand is either lonely, maladjusted, or a sociopath. <sigh>Among his claims: People into SM are out to recruit you, gays are all promiscous, and that menopausal women become \\"masculinized.\\" Frankly, I became so disgusted after reading half of the book, I didn't read any further. Dr. Reuben's prejudices are obvious and it is a shame they clouded what might have been a good reference book.There are many other good books about sexuality on the marketplace that are worth your money. Sad to say, this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously Misleading","review":"I first read this book in the early 1970s and it influenced me in that it delayed my gender transition and eventual sex change surgery by 20 years.

It's scary to think how close I came to having an unwanted baby because of the birth control method mentioned in the original: shaken coca cola.

It omits essential points of the plot and abridges several of the more important moments-- such as when Julia and Winston fall in love (a mere 1/4 page of the script). More importantly, because theater cannot \\"enter the internal thoughts\\" of characters as easily as books can (and this play has no monologs or soliloquies of that sort), the responsibility to imagine Winston's feelings lie wholly with the audience. George Orwell makes Room 101 real and terrifying; the play makes it a mockery. I would highly reccomend against this dramatization. I gave it 2 stars and not 1 because as a completely original play, it's OK. But, audiences will expect something of the caliber of Orwell's book, and this will leave them disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The unheard Xclusive...","review":"With funky production and fresh vocals, Her Sanity was set to go far and stand out in the age of girl and boy groups. However, they lacked the promotion to do so. Their biggest hit \\"Xclusive\\" featuring The LOX was a major force on many underground mixtapes in the summer of 2002, but it still wasn't enough to move them up. Sadly, these young ladies talents will go widely unnoticed. With tracks like \\"Suga Rain\\", \\"Yes, No, Maybe\\", and the flowing \\"Can I Be Sure\\", these New Orleans can definately set the mood for any occasion. At 44 minutes in length, the album is a little TOO short - something which either hurt or strengthened the power of their debut. It's all a matter of opinion.

I wore it on a recent trip to the Arctic, and I could not complain, but the sizes do tend to run small (a Helly Hansen thing I think), so keep that in mind when purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfortable long underwear","review":"These long underwear are form fitting, warm and lightweight. Fits well under all garments, even dress pants. I recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"The stitching was defective and left a small area unseamed. Decided to keep them because they are out of stock and for the amount I paid, they aren't bad after a bit of patching up. They do come up to my belly button (I'm 5'2\\"), so the woman modeling them in the picture must be much taller. They also get quite baggy after wearing but return to shape after washing. They do run big but not as bad as most other brands I have tried. I have an x-small, and I weigh 110 lb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed.","review":"After listened to the samples of the songs I was not that excited about the music. I still purchase this CD anyway based on Amazon reviewers that gave rave remarks. I thought maybe there was much more to this music than the samples would allow me to hear, so I purchased it and was very disappointed. Every song sounds the same, showing no creativity.I should have just listened to the samples to make my decission and never made the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTMENT!!","review":"I purchased this CD for my girlfriend who loves neo-soul and we both disliked this CD. The songs are flat and not well delivered. I went on the advice of positive reviews which was a mistake because I should have also read the negative reviews before making my purchase. I would recommend Ledisi-Lost & Found, she has a song entitled \\"In the Morning\\" a real chart making hit for neo-soul. All tracks on that CD are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the first","review":"I listened to \\"Piece of Mind\\" religiously for almost two years. It never left my disc changer. \\"Concious\\" has two or three notable songs. But it does not have the consistency of \\"Piece of Mind.\\" She seems to be aiming for commercial success. She does not take as many risks with this one and there is too much filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT UP TO PAR","review":"CONSCIOUS by Julie Dexter was a very big dissappointment. It was my first CD by this artist and might just be the last. This is one of the CD's you buy and listen to it and then set it aside for your next yard sale. There is just nothing special here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful and Relaxing","review":"I first heard this CD at a novelty store in DC and liked it. It was recommended by the owner of the shop and I couldn't refuse it. This is the first time I am listening to her sing since I bought it. While I am doing my homework, I find her voice very soothing to my body, mind, and soul. I feel collective and confident that I will get a good grade on the paper I'm doing. Julie Dexter being popular in the UK market, also has a fan base in the US. Artists that appreciate neo-soul should get this CD. It is really great to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knuck For Young Buck","review":"this cd is wack and there a bunch of 14 and 15 year olds who try to imitate lil jon's style and the crunk style and is really annoying as hell and its too commercial and retarded, so knuck for young buck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in Quality","review":"I first received a Cross pen for Christmas about six years ago, and it was one of the best presents I have ever received. I loved it so much I've tried to hunt down a similar version, which led me to this item.Cross is no longer the icon it once was. Starting from the casing of this pen - it is cheap, almost plastic-like as opposed to the delightful housing of my original Cross pen, that has just the right amount of heft to it. The finish in real life is sadly no where close to as classy as the one pictured. It is a travesty that it is marked at $40, as it is not even worth the $25 I paid for it at Amazon. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in the difference in quality between my old and new cross pens."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nixon Skits","review":"My favorite skits here are when Akyroyd is playing Nixon. You gotta be old, I guess, to appreciate it. There's a skit I particularly remember where Nixon goes \\"let's talk in incomplete sentences\\". I'm looking for that skit, and it's not the one on the Dick Cavett show which has a similar, but different, skit. If anyone knows what show/season that skit is on please let me know!Add to that Mr. Murray, and Samurai Stockbroker, and you have a must purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"for Lucas","review":"present for my son ... came in time, great condition, but I DON'T LIKE SNL ... my son does"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It For the Complete Shows!","review":"I think the best thing about this complete second season of SNL is that it's the first time I'll be seeing the entire shows since they aired back in the 1970s.Yes, it's hit and miss (as SNL has always been) but it's so much fun seeing the show evolve and turn into the classic we all so fondly remember. This is the season where Bill Murray first appeared and he can actually see him getting his footing and running like a champ. I think the shower sketch with his cheating wife was the breakout moment for him.As a kid, I felt like I was watching special when these shows first aired. All of these years later, I know they were special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent view into the past","review":"The second season DVD set is fantastic.

This was my era...I've been a serious fan of the original \\"Not Ready for Prime Time Players\\" and in my opinion, their creativity & humor was one of a kind. The first 5 years are the best, by far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Cocker and John Belushi!!!!","review":"Enjoy........The song by Joe Cocker and \\"duet\\" with John Belushi is worth the price of the entire set, even at $50. The presidential debates between Ford (Chevy Chase) and Carter (Dan Aykroyd) are such a treasure, not to mention such crazy spoofs of Dragnet and Drag Racing with Eric Idle. Great comedy and memories.Box: O.K, but I would prefer thin polypropylene cases.Discs: Single sided, excellent!Extras: The \\"book\\" enclosed could be included with the extras on disc to save weight and space. In fact, more pictures of behind the scenes could be included. Even better if they have behind the scenes practice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! PLEASE KEEP 'EM COMIN'!","review":"The Gary Weis films of Taylor Mead and Sissy Spacek are worth the price alone. You walk away from this set with a warm sense of nostalgia in your guts, feeling like television was once either brave, stupid or indifferent. Any way you slice it, we win. It's a time capsule that pays off in spades. Where else in this day and age can you get Idi Amin humor? I hope they keep 'em comin' and perhaps a bit quicker. I'm just hoping that Generalissimo Francisco Franco will still be dead when the next set is released. Plus, this is the season that said a much needed farewell to the ill advised Muppet rubbbish. Good stuff, indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hasnt aged well","review":"i bought season 1-3 of SNL. although we used to think it was funny back then, it hasnt aged wellthe jokes are very old. we are all very disappointed in that fact. it started to get funny mid 2nd season.shame. not recommended, at least not for that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I guess it might have been funny then, but now it's lame so its not the product, but the reviewer I guess. I dont know what it is, but the SNL cast on it are obviously nervous, new, and not comfortable. It is very odd to see them this way versus my memory where they were comfortable, add-libbing, and natural."},{"rating":"1","title":"the memories seemed funnier!","review":"Sure, I was a teenager when this season was first broadcast, so I have to rack it up to changing tastes. This season (haven't gotten the others yet) was really disappointing. There were some laughs here and there, but otherwise no funnier than a bland episode of the current season. It's neat to see things I haven't seen since the 70's (and actually remember them!) still, this season leaves you wanting something funnier. Other reviews say this was the weakest of the first five seasons (once the first season found its footing)so I'll try another year or two. You may want to start with one of the other years first - I've read the third or fourth are the best. One great thing here is the audition by Andy Kaufman. The lowest points are always the Gary Weiss movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saturday Night Live Hits Its Stride","review":"Kinks in the first season were worked out and Saturday Night Live hits its stride in the 2nd season. A wonderful show that hums from beginning to end with very few dry spots and nothing even close to bad. This was probably the greatest season of the show. All stars were deserving of stardom and praise. Gilda Radner perfects Emily Litella and her Barbwa Wawa and other characters. Jane Curtain becomes the Weekend Update anchor and Bill Murray comes on board. Garrett Morris uses his singing voice and comedy to good effect and John Belushi is more than funny. Chevy Chase leaves, sadly but we don't miss it as much as we could have because the show is so good. The Coneheads debut in this season. Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The founding fathers of awesome sketch comedy!","review":"Bill Murray, along with other Greats make you feel good, and laugh hard as hell!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"Great value good finish and runs true and smooth.

This does not seem to make a performance difference yet, but I think it will in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come apart and no wrench to put it back together","review":"The back of this cone center is a threaded disk with two holes for a two pin spanner wrench. So far, I haven't found a wrench to fit, which is too bad, because the back comes loose frequently. With no wrench, I end up trying to tighten it up with my fingertips pressed against the plate.I don't trust this center not to come apart in the middle of a project and kill me, so I end up not using it. If I could find a wrench to fit, I'd try a little thread lock on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No issues with this-- very high quality unit.","review":"If you turn a lot of small items and want access to the end of a workpiece where it meets the live center-- you need a taper like this.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I find it incredibly annoying, and while it IS well-designed for toddlers I am with him all day and therefore I also have to watch it! He had already learned his phonics and letters from Leapfrog's Letter Factory and They Might Be Giant's \\"Here Come The ABC's,\\" (much less annoying for me) but he loves this because of the mini quizzes throughout.

It teaches manners (\\"please and thank you\\" kind of stuff), but the \\"baby\\" puppet does \\"dare\\" to say \\"no\\" at times and needs a little (fun and gentle) encouragement to cooperate. If you are the type to be easily offended by a child telling an adult \\"no\\" now and then, this might not be for you. (It could get your kid in trouble with you if he/she repeats some of \\"Giggles'\\" dialogue). I'm a little worried that some poor little kids might even end up getting smacked around when they repeat in a \\"Giggles the puppet\\" voice, \\"What part of no don't you understand?\\". This series was designed by people trained in child development, who probably didn't take into account that there are still plenty of hitters out there, who would... er... um...\\"discipline\\" before they even stopped to think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This DVD was painfully bad.

What an amazong man and an amazong Poet! The empathy with which he writes for all life is amazing. His lines are well-crafted and at times starkly beautiful, like the glittering of glass shards after a terrible accident. He speaks to the wonder and terror and pain of life with such brilliance!

A disjointed, unscientific exposition which simply does not work. One would do well to read the earlier, far superior work by Marc Davenport, 'Visitors from Time'. At least he used facets from actual documented sightings to make his case. It is also better written than this confusing mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected","review":"I found the idea compeling but very loose is structure.

But the book goes needlessly into many of the MS SQL Server 2000 features that have absolutely nothing to do with Backup/Recovery at all. For example, what does Profiler have to do with backup/recovery? Or step by step configuration of SQL Server? If you start at page 305 and stop at page 510, you have read all there is to know about backups and restores. Beyond page 510 are some interesting special purpose topics like Replication and Log shipping etc, which can come in handy for a high availability OLTP systems. However, first four chapters are unnecessary details about NT security and SQL Server 2000 Architecture. Wait for a more focused book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most of the book are fillers","review":"Most of the contents of this books are fillers. It is obvious the publisher (Osborne) demanded the author to write a 500 page book in order to justify the exorbitant cost of this book.The real information on backup and recovery does not start until page 331!!!!! The author is a good writer and obviously had lot of IT experience. He does his best to make the book as informative as possible. But it is apparent that backup and recovery information is not worth 500 pages of text.I think the book could have been salvaged quite well if the last chapter on case studies of backup and recovery scenario was better written, but this is where the author REALLY bombed. His recovery steps can all be summarized as recovering the full, then incremental, then transaction logs. Anyone who knows ANYTHING about SQL recovery knows THAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any young child having difficulty with divorce.","review":"The story of Tom quickly became my 4 year old son's favorite bed-time story.

It also does not give any false hopes about the parents getting back together. The illustrations are beautiful. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone.........","review":"Divine Regale trys to pull off a progressive sound, but they just overdid it. I bet these guys spent six months overdubbing in the studio, and most of it would probably be vocals. At times it sounds like the London Boys Choir or something along those lines.

I'd suggest you do the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my, this is quite horrible","review":"I would expect such ridiculousness from someone who is in Slipknot but I'm disappointed in Tripp Eisen for contributing to this monstrosity.

Alot of Slipknot fans like it, so right off the bat you can tell not much good is gonna come out of it. The guitar is alright. Tripp Eisen is a reasonably good guitarist, and has some cool riffs here and there, but the rhythm section is very weak, and Wednesday 13s vocals are just bad. The lyrics are also very bad..pretty much just cheesy B horror movie garbage. This is an album that all of the maggots and mall goths are probably going to buy and love, but for anyone whos into real metal...or..music, for that matter, not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter garbage.","review":"Ok, they have some musical talent with Joey and Tripp. But my main major problem with this group is the vocalist, wensday or whatever his name is.

And another thing, who could understand what the heck the lead singer was saying?

I know, because I love death metal.(Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under, Nile, Decapitated, Skinless, Dying Fetus etc.) Secondly, I also love punk rock, as you can tell by my name. Now, Alot of people say this album has punk elements to it which it does, but gee, uh, did'nt a really great legendary punk band already do this about 27 or so years ago? Thats right the Misfits. I know theres obvioulsy many differences between the 2 bands, but the overall meaning of the music is the same.This album is ok, but its been done before... many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homosexual Barbie Dolls","review":"Throw Joey Jordison (the best damn drummer there is) and Tripp Eisen (from Static-X)into a blender and what do you get? A side project that brings nothing but embarrasingly bad lyrics, and typical everything else. There look may appeal to some but its nothing youve never seen before. The vocalists voice sounds raspy and feminine, and is reminiscent of Marilyn Manson. Their lyrics cover the same area of old horror movies and murder, which was already perfected by Rob Zombie. I really expected alot from such talented musicians like Joey and Tripp, but this cd is a steaming pile of [you know what]. The only song I half-enjoyed was \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". If you enjoy violent glam-rock give this cd a try but their music is so shallow and unoriginal. A big disappointment.Instead try such excellent artists as: Tool,Nirvana,Deftones,NIN, Slipknot, Mudvayne, Slayer, Pantera, Manson."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I myself is a Slipknot Fan, love their work.

If you like the misfits, and 80's metal, this cd might be for you. Although the band rarely strays from power chords, this band is doing something that most mainstream bands aren't.....soloing! They aren't the most complex-steve vai-malmsteen type of guitar solos, but it's better than anything mainstream pop culture has produced in years. Don't take this cd too seriously, it's supposed to be a departure from all the depressed-daddy molested me so i'm going to write a whiny song about it-korn-hiphop-crap metal. Definitly give it a chance if you want some fun horror-metal/punk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best New Album","review":"Murderdolls may be the best new band of 2002(along with Stone Sour).

Definately pick this CD up if you're a fan of Mudvayne, Slipknot or SOAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beneath The Valley Of The Murderdolls","review":"I heard of the murderdolls back when they were known as the Rejects. I waited for this album for nearly a year now and it was worth the wait. The whole album has great guitar riffs and good lyrics (especially Dawn Of The Dead and Dead In Hollywood). In a few songs they sound a little like slipknot, (People Hate Me), and in others they sound like Marilyn Manson, (Slit My Wrist), but either way they are very creative on this album.Other good standout tracks are Die My Bride, Let's Go To War, She Was A Teenage Zombie, and Mother..., I Dont Care. Joey Jordison and Tripp Eisen did a good job on this album. If you like Marilyn Manson or Slipknot, or if you just like rock and metal, this album is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS SKID ROW With Make Up And Acid","review":"This Band Is Great. They Have This Driving Rock And Roll Sound That You Just Get Hooked On. They Sound Like A Cross Of Skid Row And The Misfits With A Few Metallisounds In It Too.

Jordison Sounds Like Sebastian Bach And Well You Will Need To Hear It For Futher Info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Awesome Album","review":"I've become addicted to 'Dead in Hollywood'.

To everyone who says 'oh, since they aren't slipknot or static-x I think I'll give them 2 stars', they are not supposed to be slipknot or static-x! Please take note of the different band name!

Murderdolls are not posers and they play absolutely fantastic music. The music is absolutely incredible and their drummer is fantastic, as well as Joey Jordison (Slipknot's drummer) on the guitar, who plays ABSOLUTELY fantastic! He's as good a guitarist as he is a drummer! And the vocals by Wedneday 13 are very interesting in the sound as well as being extremely entertaining.What was that you said? These lyrics are depressing?Absolutely NOT! These lyrics are well written(really!) (ok maybe not that good) and the surprising things is that they are absolutely hilarious at times!

Yeah I'm an old fart(36 to be exact), but this CD is some serious stuff. It's fun, it's loud, it's fast & it's great. My 12 year old son's even impressed. *snicker* The highest compliment I think I could pay this band is this... I downloaded a bunch of MP3s to hear them. After they blew me away, I bought the CD & recommend it to anyone that can deal with the expletives... which I found funny as hell. Some truly great stuff here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft and a good value","review":"I like this sheet so far. It fits my crib mattress well and is soft.

There is a section on Bluegrass, Celtic, and Swing, but each is too short to do much justice to or teach much about each topic. After viewing it, this one felt too much like an overview and not really much use as an instructional video. It felt like each section was just getting interesting and I was about to learn something and then it was on to the next section! I was expecting more content and depth than this on a DVD.If I had to do it over, I wouldn't have purchased this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The other review is NOT for this video!","review":"The video the other person reviewed is the Hugga Bunch MOVIE.

For almost $20 each you would expect subject driven content rather than a generic script with a few minor changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another possible rip-off","review":"A possible rip-off, although this time it's a CD and not a memoir. This import CD has a great title and great packaging. You want it to add something to Bukowskiana. Opening the vinyl packaging fills one with anticipation. It looks good, but alas, what you get is a silly documentary of Buk's life narrated by someone sounding very much like a posh twit. The sound bites of Bukowski are poorly recorded, virtually inaudible and laughingly inserted in all the wrong places. The liner notes on the back of the CD contain misinformation about a quote attributed to Jean-Paul Sartre. It is common knowledge to all Buk fans that there is no record of any such quote anywhere.What were the producers thinking? A much better CD is the easily available \\"HOSTAGE\\". This is an unedited recording of a Bukowski reading without any silly commentary or ludicrous 'background' music. Hostage is raw and pure Bukowski. \\"Neither Bought For Gold, Nor To The Devil Sold is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Insight!","review":"I had taken several classes in psychology in college and really thought that I had a grasp of what it was like to live with schizophrenia. Not so! This book takes you into the world and mind of a person with this disorder.

If you are at all interested in this topic, I really feel it is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eden Xpress","review":"It was a total accident that I read this book. I was staying with my aunt and uncle in Ohio during the summer, both of them were thrift store hounds and would buy hundreds of penny books at a time at the closeout thrift stores. One day as we're heading home, my uncle hands me a book. I look up at him and say, \\"Who's Mark Vonnegut?\\" he smacks himself on the head and that was pretty much the end of that. Later in the week they took my to their cabin in the mountains. Since I am not the outdoorsey type I read the entire book there out of boredom. But I was amazed, it was a wonderful book. Living in a hippie comune, battling mental illness, it was a genuinely well written book.

My mother was diagnosed as a schizophrenic when I was 2, which prompted my interest in the subject. She has since recovered (mostly) in spite of the medical community and their trial and error approach to the illness. I was taken by Mark's ability to communicate what being a schizophrenic was like and his ability to cope with the illness. Twenty years later I have been curious to re-read this book and see if it is as moving an experience now as it was to me then. Unfortunately, it is out of print and I am hopefully awaiting my copy from amazon.com!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-gripping account of a young man's battle with madness","review":"I have read and re-read this book at least a dozen times over the years.

Does anyone know how to reach him? Please let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A disturbing and moving social commentary.","review":"One of the most moving books I've ever read. A must for any ex-hippie, hippie wanna-be, or anyone interested in American society of the 1960's and 1970's. Mark Vonnegut (yes, he is Kurt's son) describes growing up in 1960's counterculture, and what that culture can do to a confused young man. This book will make you think twice about yourself and your world."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book played some pivotal role in saving my life","review":"No kidding--in my early 20s madness courted, descended and moved in lock stock and kitchen sink for several difficult but very interesting and ultimately valuable years. I shoplifted this book out of a fine bookstore on the main street in Annapolis, MD (a stone throw from the handsome 18th century state capital building), and saw hope for a path out.Many other factors came into play, including of course the fact that health insurance used to actually pay for mental health treatment as decided upon by the patient/doctor. team. There was also plenty of other money and general resources including a stubbornly loving family and ultimately a real human being who also happened to be a shrink (a very rare cooincidence).Vonnegut took a similar ride and if you are too, or a loved one, friend or acquaintance may be, try to get 'em a copy of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraordinary Journey","review":"Mark Vonnegut, son of Kurt, has written a fascinating autobiography.

Her misadventures in Paris, prove challenging to those around her,and amusing to the reader. It's am amusing collage of seemimgly misplaced dialogue and eccentric characters, yet is easy to read and laugh with.(Note: Queneau is, I think, an underappreciated genius. You can find out more about him by looking up the book \\"The OULIPO COMPENDIUM\\" here at Amazon, which contains his extraordinary \\"One-hundred-trillion sonnets.\\" \\"Oulipans: rats who build the labyrinth from which they plan to escape\\" -- Raymond Queneau).Zazie is less of a labyrinth and more of a amusement park, a good introduction to this imaginative writer.

The photos are good and I like the overall quality of the book, but the subtitle is misleading, as it is an artist showcase more than it is an \\"A-Z guide\\". When I got to the \\"Workshop\\" section at the back, I thought I finally got to the meat of the book, but it wasn't much better. For example, there are sidebar lists of Studio Essentials for the workshops, which list items such as \\"a retro Genie telephone\\" and \\"music, music, music.\\" Cute, but not terribly helpful.Quoting the book:\\"Where do ideas come from?

The book is beautiful, and there are some new ideas to get your creative juices flowing.

It gives virtually no creative guide to anyone that I can imagine, no hint of the process that leads to any of the finished work, and some of the work is plainly terrible. An awful lot of what passes as mixed media or altered art these days is just crap that someone throws together, distresses a little and puts some stupid inspirational word to ('dream', 'friends', 'voyage' - you *know* the rubbish I mean), and I am afraid that a lot of the work in this book falls into that category. I bought the book, I read it, then re-read it, hoping to see something jewel-like that I'd missed the first time - I think I even shook the book in case something might fall out. Alas."},{"rating":"2","title":"swell!","review":"Lynne continues to be an inspiration of epic proportions. She somehow manages to take ordinary, every-day items and turn them into intricate, layered, and stunning works of art. This book is heavy on the eye candy, with plenty of other talented artists thrown into the mix. For the beginner or experienced collage/book artist, this book is sure to provide endless inspiration.

The good things about this CD is that this is also about as \\"evil\\"-sounding as black metal (and therefore any other kind of music) gets, and it is rather unique in that regard. The downside, however, is that the music music is very monotonous and most of the songs aren't even worth listening to.

This and the book, Drawing on the Left Side of the Brain, influenced my thinking on consciousness, on the logical vs. the holistic in our thinking. It is a thought provoking book, non-religious, which leans towards the nature, Zen, in finding innner peace, in finding the whole from the fragments. It is a good commentary on the way our society has come to focus on the logical, measurable, rather than the higher pursuits of thinking and the peaceful/free things of life, such as the cover illustrates.I enjoyed the book, it helped me think more deeply about our present society and it inadequacies, and at the same time to place higher value on develpoing the mind in the intuitive and holistic.

LONE STAR is as repeatedly watchable as, say, THE GODFATHER, and has one of the best last lines since CASABLANCA--\\"Forget the Alamo...\\" BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price for an excellent movie!","review":"LoneStar is a movie that is representative of a novel that one finds hard to put down. Each scene is well-crafted and substantative, all of which leadsto an un-imagined ending. It is John Sayles BEST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Texas Greek tragedy...sort of.","review":"Not only does this film unfold with the richness and complexity of a very well written short story (think William Trevor in a border town), no one here seems to have mentioned that it also contains echoes of Greek tragedy (or even the biblical sins of the fathers being visited upon the children). It is so subtle and its many little subplots reflect back on each other in such surprising ways -- okay, I'll admit it: I never thought Sayles was capable of such greatness. This screenplay ranks up there with Chinatown and Sunset Boulevard. It's that great. Oh -- and once again, it is a little film graced with a terrific, throwaway cameo from the always-wonderful Frances McDormand. But it needs to be said: Chris Cooper is the calm, sure anchor of this film, playing a man who has had wisdom and insight thrust upon him perforce by things over which he had no control. A masterful performance from a great, heretofore underrated (but now Oscar-winning) actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"tremendous story line","review":"this is a great movie. If your like me and require more than special effects in a movie, you should like this one. This is a very character driven movie, not fast paced. the characters are three diminsional, and the flashbacks to the previous generation make the movie. Never really liking Kris Kristopherson, he really does a tremendous job in is role, as do the rest of the cast; including Chris Cooper and Francis McDormand. Well I might have over did it with this talk of characters...the plot is a mystery in which the sheriff is investigating a thirty year old death. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sayles' finest hour (or two)","review":"If I could have only ten DVDs on a desert island, this would make the cut. If you can only see one film by John Sayles, choose Lone Star. How come? Characterizations, acting, settings, cinematography, music, and above all, the writing. This film satisfies on every level, illustrating a complicated place (the U.S./ Mexican borderland) in contemporary American life in short, deft strokes. There is brutality, cynicism, and despair, along with history, hope, and even a little hilarity. All that plus, in a barroom scene, Lucinda Williams can be heard on the jukebox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well researched and authoritative","review":"This book was not only the only source of this kind of information I have seen, but the author has personal experience in the field, having given instruction in the tweety bird himself. If you are interested in the history of Cessna and its relationship with the military from the start, here is your source. You will also find out what these planes fly like, what characteristics make them ideally suitable for the tasks they have been assigned, and what characteristics they have that can bite you.The book is made particularly entertaining by the inclusion of a number of 'war stories', many of which are quite amusing.All in all the book was most informative, while being an enjoyable read.Thanks to Walt Shiel for giving us the benefit of his experience and knowledge, combined with his own writing style to make an emminently readable book. History class was never like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cessna Warbirds","review":"What a GREAT book! The details in each chapter make for captivating reading. I've used my copy so much that the two corners are curling up! Thanks for including some \\"War Story\\" accounts from those of us who flew them in Harm's Way. The 0-2 will always have a soft spot in my heart. Walt, you done good. Check 6 and fly safe. \\"Nail 66\\" - Doc Lambert"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Biosilk is amazing. The conditioner is not.It drys out your hair, does not make it soft at all. And makes my hair feel unclean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!!","review":"I can not quite put my finger on why but I hated this product. It gives minimal coverage. The color was not right for my skin tone so I took it back to Sephora and exchanged for the next lighter color. That color did not suit me either. I don't think it gave me the glowing, dewy look that I hoped for in a foundation. I recently got a makeover from Laura Mercier and I love their foundation as well as concealer. If you really want to add a glowing look to your skin I would recommend adding Artificial Light by Smashbox Cosmetics to any foundation that you purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"I have ordered many times from Amazon, and this is the first time I was not happy. When we received the product and took the top off, the pump part had been opened, and most of the makeup was inside the lid, losing more than 1/2 of the product. We love the product, but the shipping/handling was very bad, we were very unhappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watered Down Foundation","review":"The product \\"Stila Illuminating Liquid Foundation\\" is incredibly watered down. Feels like you're putting paint on your face, as you actually feel it dripping down your skin as you apply. At the same time, it feels heavy and sticky once applied. That being said, I was quite surprised to see how flawless my skin looked after using it. But if you're looking for something that will wear all day, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT VIKING DEATH METAL!","review":"Amon Amarth rules!!! The brutallity,technicality,and lyrical genious is almost unparralleled..buy all of their albums you'll love em!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Not being much the death metal fanatic, my loves are power metal and black metal, I did not believe I would enjoy this cd. After one listen to \\"The Dragon's Flight Across the Water\\" I was hooked. This album is very intense, very heavy, and the musicianship is stunning. Opeth drummer Martin Lopez keeps the beat going, very heavy I might add, and the guitar work is brilliant. A very good buy for the metal lover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I heard from a number of people that Amon Amarth were an excellent death metal band, so with that in mind, I though I'd try OSFTGH. What I hear, and it certainly seems I'm missing out on something, is sloppy musicianship and poor songwriting. Just because you have mead dripping from your beard, and you scream out lyrics that contain, no mercy, vengeance and \\"it's your time to die\\" does not mean you can create \\"authentic\\" Viking/metal. These idiots could definitely take lessons from: Enslaved, Manegarm, Falkenbach to name a few. Don't fall for the hype!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SECOND TO NONE","review":"Pagans, don't you just love them? Some bands claim to be of the pagan religion but are just fakes who want to have an original image. AMON AMARTH is a band consisting of real pagans so you know that what they sing is directly related to their beliefs. With that out of the way, I'd just like to say that this album features my favorite lineup. It's not the same as on SORROW... which was a really good release. I find that this lineup has a better chemistry together. If you aren't of the same opinion as me, just listen to FRIENDS OF THE SUNCROSS and it will change. Long live the mighty AMON AMARTH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was never a fan of death metal before...","review":"...but Amon Amarth has made me a believer. I would give this 10 stars if I could. I heard some songs from their new CD on the metal channel, and it looks like that one is going to be just as good. Beats the leaping dog crap out of anything else I have heard before. Skilled and talented beyond the capacity of human comprehension--you can't go wrong if you buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY TO GRASP!","review":"I often see beautiful decorating books but as soon as i put it down I realize I did not absorb anything No so with this book!One page has tie backs One page has cornices.

What I got instead was a bunch of sketches. To me, \\"decorating ideas\\" implies that I'll see how to put it all together, such as how a window treatment works into a room or goes with furnishings I have. There isn't anything on how to choose, how to put it all together. Just sketches of individual ideas.

It has plenty of choices on styles of drapes and looks. The thing that I was REALLY disappointed with was it was NOT new and I ordered a NEW book from Amazon. It had a long pen mark on the front cover. The pages had been previously bent. It smelled old and the page color was diminished.

While I was looking through the various books for window treatments on Amazon.com, I noted several times that he had commented on a customers' book review stating that their thoughts were a \\"joke\\", etc. I would think that a professional designer and author would have much better and more constructive things to be doing with his time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I honestly don't understand what other reviewers find appealing about this trite, forced, thoroughly pedestrian romantic comedy. I suppose it could be said that the concept of 3 possible love scenarios being played against one another is unique enough, but the execution is annoyingly mediocre. The writing is dull and predictable and the characters are like cardboard cutouts. I agree with the only other reviewer who was unimpressed with the film when he described it as a boring \\"soap opera\\" - it has an air of television melodrama that I found uninspiring and completely forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Dick Tracy Serials","review":"One of the most popular serial heros. Testimony to this is the fact of four serials. The only others were Flash Gordon (4) and Zorro. The action was good and it was very popular.

The Cliffhangers are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"CALLING ALL CARS","review":"IF YOU ARE A SERIAL FAN... THEN THIS IS A GREAT DVD FOR YOU.

Such poor customer service, they did not even have the courtesy to respond to my e-mails. I would not recommend this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film/awful transfer","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite films for a number of reasons. However, this DVD is a worthless piece of junk. It is full screen and muddy in appearance. The widescreen VHS must be better than this. The Sting deserves a better fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full screen??? Are you kidding?","review":"An excellent film. Shame we are not able to view all of it. Where is the widescreen? I will not purchase it and I hope others are wise enough and don't purchase the DVD as well. I will simply wait. The awards, accolades and performances have all been spoken for and are well deserved. Rent a tape to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quintessential American Movie","review":"This is one of the most entertaining movies to come out of the \\"Golden Age\\" of American cinema, if not one of the greatest. Thoughtful, quick witted, and authentic, this unpretentious caper is one of the few films that can be watched time after time without becoming tiresome. Beyond the effortless charisma of stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford, there are delightful supporting performances by the likes of Ray Walston, Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan, and, of course, Robert Shaw (ya falla?). The Chicago of 1936 presented is both mythic and realistic, with detail down to blue plates for the blue plate specials, and authentic green glassware. This film will be a delight for both young and old. My main issue with the DVD release is that it is full frame only. I think a film with this much critical and financial success deserves a widescreen release. How about it, Universal?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"Wait for the widescreen edition, which, as Christian Pelchat pointed out, is not far away since this year marks the movie's 30th anniversary. It is shocking to see movies released in full-screen when they were originally shot with widescreen film, and furthermore, when all TVs will be widescreen within the next 5-7 years. Most people don't understand that you are losing up to 50% of the picture when you watch a full-screen movie, which is a tragedy.To Universal Studios: Shame on you for releasing a full-screen version only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad disc??? be careful!","review":"This disc would not play on my brand new HD-DVD player! and there are no problems playing other discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not widescreen?!?!?","review":"This is one of the greatest, classic movies of all time.

There are so many little plots and schemes in this movie about a huge scheme in organized crime that you'll always want to watch it again and again. This action packed, fun-filled movie starring such actors as Paul Newman is fun to watch for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't help but love redford and newman","review":"This has long been a favorite movie of mine, so I was excited about its dvd release. Unfortunately, the disc contains no special materials and is presented in a pan-and-scan format. The film has been decently restored,it always had a grainly look to it, and it still does. Wonderful performances all around, particularly by Newman and Shaw, who have a brilliant face-off while playing poker on the train. Scott Joplin score keeps it moving. This film is as fun as the other great con-man movie of the '70's, Paper Moon, and probably a better film overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, Bad Transfer","review":"This a classic, great Hollywood film. It is unfortunate that the transfer is horrendous. Bad audio and literally, a dirty video transfer. In fact, it looks like a VHS tape.

I enjoyed Butch Cassidy until the end when they end up dead in Bolivia. The beauty of this movie is they both walk away alive at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated and Quite Bland","review":"THE STING is a highly overrated film in my opinion. Highly overrated. The overall production lacks a certain cinematic quality. Visually, it looks like meager made-for-television movie. It also looks like a vehicle to bring Robert Redford into the film-going public's eye. The plot is minimal and the pay-off, once viewed, is quite lacking drama or suspense. I am amazed at how little screen time Paul Newman has. He seems like a guest star in this film, yet he creates a very convincing character and gives an excellent performance. The same cannot be said of Redford who's performance is totally uninspired and unconvincing. Robert Shaw does the best he can with perfunctory lines he is given. One wonders what all the fuss was about. I disliked this film when I saw it on its initial release and now I understand why."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is only about the 100th Anniversary Edition","review":"This is not about the movie. It was GREAT. This is about the \\"book\\" packaging.The Book is done well, the pictures and information excellent. Then they glued the plastic disc holders on each end.

I felt as if I was watching a well-used videotape.It's unfortunate that the quality is so poor, as this is fun movie to watch, if only for the colorful recreation of 1930's Chicago.I have purchased many older movies on DVD, and have often been amazed by the image quality (the cult-classic Two-Lane Blacktop comes to mind). In some instances, it was like seeing the movie for the first time.

Film is an art and the director had very specific ideas and thoughts they wanted portrayed by their format and what a shame to ruin someone's artistic idea and hard work.

There is just so much going on around the scene that you loose the fine details that Director George Roy Hill injects into every shot.The second disc contains bonus features that are absolutely wonderful. There is a featurette that includes interviews from several of the cast (in later years) which brings the full charm of this classic movie to light. I already knew I loved the story, but to listen to the cast talk about it, it becomes very clear that this was quite possibly - the perfect script ever written.I am quite happy with this product and if you are a Sting fan - it should be in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Upgrade","review":"I must say this is one of my favorite movies. Great plot, great acting. I purchased the HD DVD version about three weeks ago and I am very pleased with the image quality using a LG 1080p HD set and a Toshiba HD DVD player also at 1080p. The sharpness and color of the images are amazing. Worth the upgrade for this old classic movie with Redford and Newman."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Waste in this movie","review":"THE STING gives us another example of the excitement Paul Newman and Robert Redford can generate when they work together. George Roy Hill who directed them in BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID duplicates his earlier feat with this highly acclaimed movie.The story is about two confidence men who seek revenge and profit from the wily gangster who is responsible for the death of one of their buddies. Robert Shaw is superb as the East Coast mobster who is the target of the big con game being pulled off by Newman, Redford and their pals. The plot has enough twists to keep the viewer interested right up to the surprise ending.THE STING won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director (George Roy Hill), Original Story and Screenplay, Art Director, Adapted Scoring, Editing and Costume Design (Edith Head). Nominations were received for Best actor (Robert Redford), Cinematography and Sound.The Oscar for Best Actor in 1973 went to Jack Lemmon for his performance in SAVE THE TIGER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the \\"whole\\" movie","review":"I'll chip in with another 1 star review of a 5 star movie. There is no excuse for releasing a classic movie such as this on a horrible pan and scan full screen DVD. Don't buy this until Universal releases the whole movie on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie set during the time Ragtime was king","review":"This is a fantastic movie. It is about two con-men (Robert Redford and Paul Newman) who set out to avenge the death of a friend by a ruthless mobster. They set up a bogus horse race gambling facility and con this mobster in betting on bogus horse races. I have one problem, with all of the people in on this scam, I don't think their take was very high. Unless, they recieved a percentage based on their involvement.This was a great movie that really captured early 20th century America. A big part of this movie was The Music of Scott Joplin. The sting revitlized his music. People think that \\"The Entertainer\\" was Scott Joplin's biggest hit. In reality his biggest hit was \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\". In Scott Joplin's time ragtime was considered \\"The Devil's music\\". The Sting gave Scott Joplin ,and his music, the dignity and respect it richly deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWESOME MOVIE, Cruddy DVD","review":"Come one, A movie of this fame HAS to be seen in WIDESCREEN.I bought the DVD, and then found out it was Pan and Scan. What crud. I sent it back, and got my money back. Hey Hollywood, Make a lot of money and put it out in a Special Edition, Widescreen version. Then we'll buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a gift...","review":"I purchased this as a 'just because' gift for a co-worker who said it was one of her favorite movies but she could never find it to buy.

GREAT, old-school movie that the whole family can watch and enjoy. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan & Scan DVD","review":"George Roy Hill took full advantage of the entire screen when shooting The Sting. This Pan & Scan edit is noticably detrimental to the overall presentation. Not only is the panning blatantly evident, there are scenes where critical action is taking place offscreen and totally missed. This movie is hurt by the Pan & Scan process more than most movies.A widescreen version exists on VHS; I would recommend sticking with that until a widescreen DVD is issued."},{"rating":"1","title":"YEP - SAME AS THE OTHER \\"REVIEWS\\"","review":"They have the gall to issue a \\"new\\" edition and STILL NO WIDESCREEN?!

With the extras that DVD can afford, there's really no excuse. This film won an Oscar for Editing (and most of the others, too). How can its Editing be appreciated in a choppy pan 'n scan? Let's rally for a REAL version."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could they do this to such a great movie?","review":"This is not a review of the film \\"The Sting\\" by any means. This film is, in my opinion, one of the best ever, certainly one of the best of its time. I am disappointed in the dvd transfer...the video is okay, not great, but why a full-screen presentation? If they were going to present the film in full-screen, it should have been a choice along with widescreen, not forced upon the viewers. I bought this dvd because I love the movie so much, but now I can't stand the dvd. Hopefully they'll release a proper dvd for this film someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Explain?","review":"This is a great movie, probably the all-time best of its genre. The 1 star is not for the content of the movie but for its adaptation to dvd. Now, several reviewers have argued that the film was originally shot in a 1.33 ratio instead of 1.85, which, if true, would make it superfluous to release a widescreen version. However, other reviewers have pointed out that a 1.85 ratio widescreen version existed at one time on vhs. Not being terribly familiar with film, I would ask those who say that it was originally shot in 1.33 how it was made into a 1.85 version...where would the footage that occupied the additional space have come from?"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Star Movie on 1 Star DVD","review":"One star for the DVD and five stars for the movie.C'mon Universal just release the 30th anniversary widescreen early already! (You ARE working on this right??)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Widescreen?","review":"I love the film, but why is this not available in Widescreen on DVD? There's been a Widescreen VHS, and I've seen it in Widescreen on Turner Classic Movies. I know it was shot in Widescreen, so how about it, Universal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie,","review":"I've seen this movie several times since it's release in the 70's but the Blu-Ray version is the best I've seen since it was released.

At the time, it took some time to figure out who was behind this great score. I'm happy to finally have a good copy of it on cd. The rest of the tracks are equally impressive. Hope to hear more of his work in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Theraputic","review":"American River has a sound that is so relaxing that it is almost hypnotic. It just puts you into a trance that is incredible, you can feel the instruments. My personal favorite is the track entitled 'move'. It's definantly worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, inspring, and heartfelt","review":"Inspiring words from well known country artists and heartfelt music played by a talented group of musicians add character and emotions to Jonathan's \\"American River.\\"His talent for combining classic music pieces have made me a firm believer in doing good things for yourselves: whenever I need some time for myself to gather my thoughts or unwind, I listen to the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was expecting more of a \\"how to.\\" This DVD is not for you if you are looking at learning how to scratch, mix or DJ. This DVD is more a history of DJing. It does go into minor detail of what the DJs interviewed did to become popular. Although they don't teach you how to do juggle or battle, it was pretty cool to watch the DJs do their thing.The main (and only) thing I found useful on this dvd was this bit of advice: Get a feel for the crowd. If every body is dancing to a song of a certain speed, don't change the type of song being played (i.e. If everyone is dancing to a Lil Jon track, don't make the next song be Weezer - My Name is Jonas, it'll kill the mood). Keeping people happy is the main lesson to be learned. Now that I've told you that, you don't have to watch this DVD.Final note - my negative reaction to this DVD was mainly because I was expecting a tutorial on how to DJ, and I got a lesson in who influenced today's DJs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Series......returning March 17th on The CW.","review":"I must concur with all the other reviews......there aren't enough superlatives to praise this show! I was devastated when The CW suddenly ended the series and at the time, thought they had nixed it, but thankfully, this was not the case and is back for it's season premiere on March 17th 2009. All the characters on this show meld superbly with one another, with lots of twists and turns! It really has it all, from the ridiculous to the sublime & I cannot praise the series enough, so go out and purchase this season on Amazon, it really is money well spent, with hours and hours of outstanding entertainment, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show on TV","review":"Finally a show I can enjoy.

Lets face it, network programing in the last decade has been terrible! And when ever a truly GOOD show stumbles on, it is often axed before it finds an audience or it finds the audience but the networks are ticked that they are spending so much money on quality they kill it despite popularity & replace it with some cheap & obvious crap reality show. ( Firefly, Wonderfalls, etc - sound familiar?)Reaper was actually recommended to me thru Netflix and is the funniest paranormal show since Buffy, the characters are engaging and off the wall. The storylines might be considered 'Buffy-lite', but the casting is so perfect, who cares? Ray Wise is clearly having the time of his life playing the devil and the laughs flow with ease.The ony thing that hurts about 'Reaper' is that the moment we love it, ABC will put an Ax in it.Enjoy it while you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fun show, but....","review":"The show was entertaining. The problem was that the second episode on the first disc was so corrupted that it wouldn't really play. I tried it on three different players. In the end, I managed to barely watch it on one player, however, I may as well not even watched for all the skipping I had to do throughout the episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shows on TV","review":"Reaper is absolutely one of the best shows on TV. The WB made the perfect choice of Ray Wise to play the role of the Devil. Similarly, the network did a terrific job of presenting us, the audience, with a witty sidekick in Sock, played by Tyler Labine. Lastly, is it me or is Sam's girlfriend, Andi (Missy Peregrym), a prettier version of Hillary Swank?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, wish it had more closure","review":"Really well done show, especially if you enjoy darker comedies.

I can't see how people label this album as boring..almost any album sounds boring after the first listen, but it's a really great feeling when albums like this one \\"grow\\" on you after a few listens.

They play very few chords and the music is not very brutal and the vocals/lyrics are nothing threatening at all. This could best be described as stoner death metal due to their songs about grass and the overall laid back feel of this whole CD. I dont listen to this anymore unless I want to chill back and relax. I am more into the extreme forms of death metal.... Oh yeah Maximum Violence and True Carnage are much more brutal than this, this album was a mistake, should have never happened. Well, thats all I gotta say."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOt bad","review":"THis is a very accessible album by SFU, I think albums like total carnage is garbage, carnage made me laugh to death because of how stupid barnes sounded with that stupid screeching of his. Warpath is an album I actually like by SFU because it has its highlights as well as you can actually understand barnes for once. True its not death Metal but it is good metal none the less. There is nothing wrong with toned down metal as long as its true metal and this album still is true metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off metal","review":"Okay, first off, I'm not going to simply say \\"This album sucks\\" or \\"This album rules\\", because in some ways it is good but in others bad. For the good, it is heavy, headbangable, and Chris Barnes has developed a (somewhat) less monotone growl. However, if you listen, 90 percent of the riffs are near direct rip-offs of Obituary riffs, possibly due to Allen West being in the band. Even if the guitars were original, they are still boring, as most songs consist of 3 or 4 downtuned power chords, and are simple enough to learn after hearing the song 1 time. Also, there are few time changes, or other twists and turns to make the songs interesting; most songs simply have the same rythm and riffs for most of the song. When listening to it for the first time, I had to change each song after 2 minutes because it just got so damn boring. The only good songs are \\"War is Coming\\", and \\"Revenge of the Zombie\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"Watching grass grow. Watching Paint dry. Listening to Warpath. I would rather do the first two things. A complete lack of originality. Is it just me, or does the opening riff to \\"Nonexistance\\" sound almost exactly like Obituary's \\"By the Light\\"? I think Allen West better quit ripping off riffs from Obituary for sfu. Waste of time? Yes! You can do a heck of a lot better with bands that are original and actually have there own sound!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible attempt at death metal","review":"Oh man. Haunted was bad. This is just complete garbage. How can Barnes go from a great band like Cannibal Corpse to a band with such a complete lack of skill? There is no originality here, every song uses the same THREE power chords, which, oddly, are the exact same three chords used in almost every Obituary song. Now that I think about it, every song on this album and Haunted sounds like an Obituary song. The drumming is boring. Bass is non-existent. Same verse/chorus song structure in every song. No interesting time changes. No breakdowns or memorable solos. I can't understand why so many people think this band is so great. This is the Korn/Limp Bizkit fans death metal. If you want TRUE, original death metal, with members that can actually PLAY their instruments, check out Cannibal Corpse, Cryptopsy, Suffocation, Incantation, Morbid Angel, Angelcorpse, actually, check out ANY band other than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The young Jazz Organist JOEY DEFRANCESCO produced fireworks like yet a MASTER of the Jazz Organ VOL. 2","review":"This album was recorded at the legendary VAN GELDER STUDIO, NJ on October 5, 1990 and the musicians are:Houston Person : tenor saxophoneRandy Johnston: guitarJoey DeFrancesco: HAMMOND ORGANWinard Harpe : drumsSammy Figueroa: congas and percussionPhilip Harper: trumpetThis is one of the best Jazz Organ album in all the history of the Organ Jazz.Listen to the ballads \\" as the time goes by\\", \\"Blue Gardenia\\" or my favorite bonus track \\" Deed I Do\\" and you will shoot right to seventh heaven very soon !!!

Picking this great pocket edition up at my local bookstore, I had no way of realizing what kind of effect it would have on me.This book is full of some of Ginsberg's most classic works.

I will write this off as a rushed draft run and hopefully if they stay together, they will take their time and put out some quality work. Gilby would do better to go off with the female singer since he is doing side work with her, sounds like he is the only one who has his head screwed on straight as Tommy is flying high as usual in one of his \\"spiritual journeys\\" thru the nose candy parade which has clouded his judgement for many years.

In watching the show I was undecided who should win, but Lukas Rossi sings well on every song and actually sounds better on the album than he did on the show, with greater range than I expected. Too bad it doesn't seem to be getting much promotion - at my nearest record store it's shelved under Soundtracks rather than with regular albums - WTF? Hopefully this album will get some play and better promotion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What It Should Of Been","review":"This will be the first and last CD for this band. It sounds like they were just doing their \\"job\\" when this was created. With the history of the members of this band they should be able to get into a room and jam for hours and create something special however it did not happen.Instead you get a CD that now has Rossi as the stand out of the group. There were a few clues this would be the case as the members were not the most creative stand out members of their old bands in thier own right.I bought it with high hopes but as a musician I think I just expected much more from members of bands that will go on as legends in the industry.Headspin is the best song on this CD. It is the only one with emotion and it was created by Rossi. He will do better in his next band. I think Gilby, Tommy, and Jason took this project for granted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediorce at best","review":"A great drummer, an excellent guitar player, and a terrific bassist combined with the hottest producer around would lead me to expect something something really great.Unfortunately the material lacks originality and the vocalist is as limited as I feared he would be when they selected him.Butch Walker seems to have squeezed all the fire out this record and Lukas lacks range and sounds thin and weak at times.

Instead of sounding like they were concentrating on quality, it sounds as if they were just trying to get the recording/producing part done and overwith so as if they didn't have to concentrate on it. and the worst part: Lukas Rossi, who dosen't even help by contributing some whiny emo on \\"Headspin\\", should have been replaced.Sorry, Supernova, but this just dosen't work for any of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Did You Expect?","review":"I watched Rockstar from the beginning and was very disappointed when they picked Lukas. I think the band members caved to audience pressure. To be honest he doesn't fit the band and his vocal talent doesn't fit the music. It could have been so much better you would have thought from people who were in such highly successful groups. But apart from those groups doesn't mean you can pull it all together and make a great album as evidenced here. Check out The Panic Channel and Army of Anyone for great music of supergroups of sorts that just blows this album to shreads.

It's amazing how age can effect someone's talent because everyone in this band has lost what little they had over the years.

Robinson Crusoe, Treasure Island, Gulivers Travels etc. The same cannot be said of this Victor Hugo classic. I managed to read three or four chapters before finally giving up on it. It runs into interminable descriptive dissertations about the city of Paris at the time of the story setting and Quasimodo is hardly mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toppik","review":"Excellent concealer, I' ve been using it for more than 4 years, no one had noticed toppik neither my thinning areas.

The proof of that is the money I wasted on this product. Reviewers advised me to order a shade lighter than my hair, so I ordered light blonde. Unfortunately, light blonde is the exact same color as my scalp, so the powder did absolutely nothing for me other than rain all over the counter, and my shirt, and make me sneeze!

The next day it still looked good. Family members noticed the improvement immediately, but didn't know exactly what I had done until I told them. My grown daughter also used it on a wide hair part, and it made it look much better as well. I won't use this every day (because I'm not that vain), but for the days I want to disguise the inevitable balding, I'll pull it out and use it.

I just colors your scalp.2)How long I've used product: Once. That's all it took to figure out item #1. I don't believe the reviews that claim they've been using it for years.3)Items that didn't meet my expectations: I realize now why in promo videos they have someone else applying the product. It's impossible to do yourself. How can you feel confident you've covered the bald spot behind your head evenly? Maybe if you have a friend sprinkle this on you every morning and confirm it's been applied correctly you would feel confident. What's worse?

However, the process takes too long so I wanted something in the meantime that I could use to help me regain my confidence. I found it in Toppik. So easy to use and the results are immediate. I even went out in windy weather and wasn't afraid that my thin spots would show. Whether or not the Minoxidil works, I know I can use this product for as long as I want and no one, not even my husband, notices!

As a huge Yankee fan and someone who has read many baseball books, this book is great. One gets a real sense of the times, along with Gehrig the person, and the beauty of the sport of baseball. As a student of the important philosophy Aesthetic Realism (www.aestheticrealism.org) founded by Eli Siegel, poet and critic, I've learned what makes a thing beautiful from a work of art to a great leaping catch in baseball. Mr. Siegel stated, \\"All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves.\\" Certain sentences and descriptions in this book I found beautiful -- they have a relation of energy, zip and also exactitude. These are opposites that the game of baseball has too. I have recommended this book to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Baseball Biography","review":"This book is a great baseball biography on one of the most iconic Yankee Heroes: The Iron Horse, Lou Gehrig. I appreciated the way the author elaborated on his humble character and the hope he represented to America during the Great Depression. Apparently, he was much more than a baseball player. He was a great human being as well.I highly recommend this book to all Yankee and baseball fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near-Perfect Baseball Biography","review":"The best thing I can say about this book is that it reads like a novel. Lou Gehrigs's life reads like Roy Hobbs' life in \\"The Natural,\\" by Bernard Malamud (not the movie!). Both men are gifted and decent players, whose lives and careers are cut short by disease. I'm a long-time fan of both Gehrig and baseball, and was captivated by Eig's writing, and the details he put down about baseball back then, as well as Gehrig's life.Superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommend","review":"fast read, interesting for both a sports fan or not. the game today needs more lou gerhig's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read about a Yankee legend","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Luckiest Man. The 4 Stars rating is due to being \\"The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig\\" I was slightly very little about the legacy and continuation of the respect that MLB and the Yankee faithful have for Gehrig.The entire book is riddled with even the tiniest details about Gehrigs childhood and his upbringing, and even teachs a fair bit about ALS. 5 of 5 stars for the first 7/8ths of the book by far...just left me wishing for more about his legacy after his passing.Excellent read if you want to learn about the Murderers Row Yankees and one of the Greatest Yankees of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many people's quotes.","review":"From the Gary Cooper movie, I thought this would be a great book. I was disappointed. My biggest beef was how anyone who Eng found that ever crossed the shadow of Lou Gehrig was quoted. It was almost as silly as \\"Bill Smith was a peanut vendor at Yankee Stadium and Gehrig once spoke to him....\\" It got ridiculous. Please don't quote other people. Write me a narrative. I threw the book away since it had no resale value and read Ray Robinson's book instead. Totally better. A joy. My favorite baseball author is Roger Kahn. Can't touch him. Of course I'm a Dodger fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, but buy a hardcopy.","review":"I gave the book a 2-star review because there are no other reviews that low, so this one might be read. Actually, the book itself is masterfully written. I was 4 months old when Lou Gehrig died. I love biographies and baseball books and this is one of the best of both.My problem with the Kindle edition is that it costs more than the printed editions and contains no photographs at all. I wouldn't mind that if I were told that some of the money would go into ALS research (none does).Moreover, the one graphic, a single sheet of Gehrig's baseball lifetime stats is in a type font so tiny that it can't even be read when enlarged.Still, I read the whole book so it would be dishonest to return it for a refund. And I feel no shame in writing that Chapter 23 made me cry.But if you really love baseball, get a printed copy. (I can't do that. We are retired and living in Dominica. The wretched Kindle is our only book option other than the equally inadequate Nook.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent biography!","review":"I'll be totally honest, this book made me cry... twice. I've read towering biographies before that were informative and enlightening, but read like phonebooks (see \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" by Edmund Morris). \\"Luckiest Man\\" reads more like a novel, a story about a shy guy who deeply loves his family and tries to always do the right thing. About how this guy did everything he could for his mother and did everything he could to succeed in baseball. You're there with him emotionally just as he finally begins to embrace his fame and enjoy his celebrity, as he breaks out of his shell of shyness and finds true love. And you're there when he gets thrown the biggest curveball of his life, blames himself for his mysterious decline, and hopelessly believes that there may be a cure. This book is as informative as it is heart-breaking. I HIGHLY recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lou Gehrig; The stuff of legends","review":"Lou Gehrig is the best 1st baseman who ever lived. He was the ultimate RBI machine. But he also was a human being. A human being with flaws and weaknesses. And that is why I admire him so much. Johanthan Eig draws a mooving picture of the Iron Horse, his childhood, his dependent relation with an overwhelming mother, the first steps with the Yankees, the misunderstanding with the Babe, and the terrible blow life throwed at him.Finally, Gehrig's story is one of a boy, growing up to become a man, who painfully and slowly tries to espace his mother influence and control over him. Luckily for him, his baseball immense talent helped him sever or soften the unhealthy tie his mother kept over him.Even if his \\"Luckiest Man on earth\\" speech is an historical masterpiece from a Great Man and the stuff of legends, you'll be also moove by what he did of his few remaining days.Luckiest Man is probably the best baseball bio there is."},{"rating":"2","title":"When It Was Still A Game","review":"Jonathan Eig's biography of Lou Gehrig is a superb account of one of baseball's greatest... in the days when the sport truly was a game. \\"The Pride of the Yankees,\\" a 1942 film starring Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright, is inspiring and entertaining; but, with the limitations of the motion picture industry, the emphasis was uplifting, even though it, as in real life, ended with the tragic illness which struck 'The Iron Horse,' and which still today bears his name. And, for a two-hour movie, this approach was appropriate. Mr. Eig's book takes the reader beyond these limitations, and we learn in great detail the extraordinary pain and suffering--physically and emotionally--inflicted upon Mr. Gehrig and his wife during the last months in the life of the \\"Luckiest Man.\\" The book, which bears this title, is highly recommended, not just for baseball fans, but for anyone who appreciates a well-researched biography of a great man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book in All Aspects","review":"This book is a very good read for baseball fans. As a fan of the history of baseball, I enjoyed this book for several reasons.First of all, Lou Gehrig was a great person and great baseball player. This book covered his life adequately. The end of Lou's career, as it is not a secret, was very sad. The way he hung on and lived everyday of his life to the fullest was inspiring.Second, Eig gives great insight into the daily and yearly responsibilities of a major league baseball player in the late 1920's and 1930's. That was unexpected on my end, but very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful surprise","review":"I purchased this album on a blind recommendation, having never heard or seen the band. My first listen didn't yield an enthusiastic response, and I tossed the CD aside as just \\"another indie band\\".However, having now matured a year, I can listen to this album again more critically and find fragments of sounds mind blowing, and all woven together to form a cohesive, touching album.

One instance might be here in this movie.This film also had some fascinating and dramatic flying scenes, things I have never seen before on film. Apparently, they had these 1930s air races in which planes few around pylons, almost like a horse race on land. This is the only film I've seen that pictured.Another thing I enjoyed was Rock Hudson's dramatic story at the end of the movie which, at first, seemed ridiculously melodramatic but was said so well that I found in very compelling, and it tied the whole story together.****possible spoilers**** I also appreciated Malone doing the right thing at the end, telling off Hudson for coming on to her, since she was a married woman. This is one of the few films - including those in the 1950s - in which adultery is NOT treated mater-of-factly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Douglas Sirk","review":"Thsi film could be a companion piece to \\" Written on the Wind\\" Both have Hudson and Stack in the leads.This film however is a little darker in composition.

I have seen many bands, working at a national venue you see the good along with the bad. I really liked seeing Ballyoo! For someone that can not always remember the number of shows I have worked to say this band is good is monumental.It carries over to their albums as well. Live music is always the best, but I can say that Ballyoo! takes their power and intensity to new levels on this album. From Cerveza (which is my favorite mood changing song)to Cali-girl the music is tight and never gets old.A good solid sound that makes for hours of listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Wedge","review":"Great product.

Nonetheless, the story falls flat and I found it just barely compelling enough to finish; the plot moves slowly, punctuated by one clumsily executed plot twist after another, the descriptions of action are confusing, and the characters mere outlines devoid of development. I hoped this book would be as good as a 1950's nautical adventure i highly recommend, The Wreck of the Mary Deare, but unfortunately Java Head is just disappointment. For other SE Asia World War II fiction, Clavell's King Rat is also a good place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alistair MacLean - South By Java Head","review":"My least favourite book from MacLean's early period (HMS Ulysses through to Last Frontier.) The plot lags through the middle section of the book, and then finishes too fast.

Worth owning, but not quite reaching the originality of writing as the first two Ray Alder albums.\\"Pleasant Shade of Gray\\" is a return to perfection. 5 Stars all the way.

I'm not sure why this is classified as progressive metal, because while it certainly is progressive, it is definitely not metal. There are very few crunchy riffs and two melodic, but ultimately boring solos. This is better described as progressive/ambient. What I love about progressive metal is that you can get all pumped up and still think at the same time. This definitely makes you think, but it is about as exciting as watching paint dry. If I wanted to think and be bored I could read one of my high-school textbooks. If ambient stuff is your thing (and you like those weird Pink Floyd songs like the ones from \\"The Wall\\") you should pick this up. But if you are looking for adreniline-pumping progressive metal, look elsewhere, like Andromeda or Savatage."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars if I could","review":"This is total garbage. Perhaps the 5 star reviews of this release are by people who never appreciated what this band could have been. It's hard to believe that this is the same band that put out Awaken the Guardian over a decade ago. While they used to sound like thunder, they're nothing more than a light spring rain now. In undertaking their path towards a more technical and progressive approach to songwriting, they've also embraced the realms of boring and depressing music. Gone is the passion that once was a great band known as Fates Warning. What stands in it's place is a boringly technical and depressingly boring shell of a band. Jim Matheos should be ashamed of using the same name. He should have let Fates Warning die 14 years ago, and gone on with another moniker that would not have damaged the legacy that the great Fates Warning of old built."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT what I expected - Looks were deceiving.","review":"The hinges were all really hard to open and it seemed as if they were almost going to break.

Plus, you can't choose your color, so you get what they sent you. I was disappointed. I bought a couple of them and it seemed like a good deal at the time.

I was hoping for explanations of food science (e.g. it is difficult for meat to brown in an acidic environment) and techniques such as reducing and deglazing.

I couldn't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting. I'm really disappointed, because I was looking forward to a new series by her. Joseph and Matthew lost their parents to murder and Joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion. Maybe Ms. Perry tried to tell too many stories within one story.

I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series. It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel: despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"R.I.P.","review":"I trudged through this dull disappointment in disbelief - is this the same Anne Perry whose William Monk and Thomas Pitt novels delivered finely-drawn characters, incisive social commentary and intricate plots?Here, the characters are cyphers; where personalities exist, they're delivered through overwrought histrionics or dull platitudes. None of Perry's fascinating insight into Victorian mores, gender roles and class issues survives the leap forward into 1914 - in this novel the lower classes are distinguished mostly by their use of \\"Oi\\" in referring to themselves, and - in the case of the initially intriguing police inspector dispatched to Cambridge University - witless incomprehension regarding the lofty sphere of British acedemia.Perry must have been having a bad day when she wrote this - I couldn't help wondering whether she'd pulled this manuscript out from a pile of early attempts at fiction, perhaps to satisfy a contractual obligation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled Nonsense","review":"What a huge disappointment!

The suspense is supposed to involve a momentous document which can affect the fate of nations about to embark on World War I. A preposterous document of that nature does finally emerge after 300+ pages on which several uninteresting characters engage in a few murders and suicides.

Many questions were raised and never answered: Who were the two mysterious plotters?What happened to the original document (or the copy if the one hidden was not the original)? What was Sebastians connection with the two plotters? How did the brilliant Irish rebel leader figure into this mix? And on and on.

After I renewed it from the Library for the second time (14 days) and found myself still not finished, I concluded, it was not keeping my interest and was very slow moving. I went to the last few pages, and felt I got most of the story. Only then,do you find out where the documents are and the whole event is very simple. Regarding the world events surrounding WWI, better to go to a history book or true historic novel. If it sequals well, there may be hope. But I would not recommend the book. Better to spend an hour watching a murder story on Law and Order for a fun evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disappointment!","review":"I had been saving this book for an after-holiday bad-weather reading treat. Big disappointment. After following the Pitts and Monk and Hester through all their wonderful adventures, I found this book to be a big letdown. It was so boring I couldn't even stay with it--didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. It's hard for me to believe that Anne Perry could write such a dull book, bust apparently she has. Every highly moral idea a character has is stated multiple times, barmaids speak like poets, and pages go by without anything happening except the reader being talked to death. I doubt that I'll bother with the next title in the series.

She lost something in translation to the 20th century. The ambigious, wandering philosophical comments may have had a purpose; but she forgot what they were.The plot was capable of much more complexity, even if only in the hands of the principals. The ending was an anticlimax, leaving me glad the book was done. The mysterious characters who appeared twice in the book were unexplained. Why did she waste time with them? Much hand-wringing throughout the book. And the purpose?It's good to have libraries where one may read before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks","review":"I have always enjoyed Anne Perry's books, the Monk series better than the Pitt series. This was despite the sameness in format. I mean that I was thoroughly tired of every story involving a snooty rich family that made the police use the servants' entrance. Did the police of Victorian England simply not investigate crime among the other/lower classes? Or does Anne Perry not know about how \\"the other half\\" lived? I was completely sick of self-important aristocrats.So I was glad to see that she was beginning a new series. Finally, I thought,a change. Nope, sorry. The same old upper-crust bores.

You won't be missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this entire WWI series from Anne Perry to be very disappointing. The WWI setting was interesting but done much better in many other novels. The plot was somewhat incredible and the actions of characters at times outrageous.

Neither my wife nor I liked the idea at first, but Jenkins will lead you by the hand to arrive at the only tenable position for you, your family, and the world. And all I wanted was a good toilet.

The only good that's come of it is that I've found myself drawn back to the glories of The Master...Claude Debussy. 5 stars for inspiration...an overly generous 2 starts for execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, elegant, intellectual, gorgeous","review":"This record knocks me out.

Additional kudos for the return of wonderfully meaningful/meaningless liner notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible.","review":"I have a limited exposure to the works of Claude Debussy however I know the Art of Noise and this Album is more than likely one of their best works. Debussy is conscidered one of the greatest composers who ever lived and this disc paints a spectacular portrait of what Debussy was about and his genius. This disc also shows off the Art of Noise's amazing sagacious compositing talent. Trully their Everest of compostions. I highly recommend this to anyone that has any interest in Debussy or The Art of Noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate, but not essential AON record","review":"One wonders why they really did it. Not a bad AON album overall, but why should every 80s band attempt to make a comeback through rap? True, did not work for Debbie Harry - why should it for AON? If the guys who made In No Sense? Nonsense and In Visisble Silence get rappish, I guess folks like McCoy Tyner and Path Metheney should follow - will be some jazz.If not a diehard AON fan, try to get this one one sale or in a second-hand (\\"pre-owned\\"?) CD store."},{"rating":"1","title":"In heaven's name why?","review":"\\"The Seduction of Claude Debussy\\" owes more to the work of Malcolm McLaren, in particular \\"Fans\\", than to anything the band did previously. I thought \\"Opera House\\" went out of fashion in the Eighties. \\"Into Battle\\", the band's debut, sounds less dated than \\"The Seduction of Claude Debussy\\" which should be clogging cutout bins in short-order. A soapbox aside to any Eighties band contemplating a comeback: leave rap out of the equation. It didn't work for Blondie, it doesn't work here, it can't work period."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Hopes.....","review":"Huge fan of the Art of Noise first album \\"Who's Afraid...?\\", the \\"original\\" lineup and all that. Not at all happy with what came next( the novelty covers and duets with Maxx Headroom, Tom Jones, Duane Eddy, et al) after Morley and Horn left. I had very high hopes for this highly hyped \\"reunion\\" cd, but I'm just not feeling it. The idea is very lazy creatively , rather Malcolm McLaren-ish ( it reminds me of his \\"Fans\\" album from the mid-eighties )and the execution is not up to par with their work together on \\"Who's Afraid...?\\" Had this album been approached in a more staightforward way, like the William Orbit collection Pieces in a Modern Style, or even like some of Wendy Carlos' work as an interpreter of classical music using synthetic devices, it might be more inspiring or engaging. But as it is, this is for me a big letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful instrumental work","review":"Art of Noise really turned me on with this album.

Beautiful, haunting, dynamic and driving. Everything the Art of Noise was known for back in the original highs.The voice over (whether or not the CD needs him) is the perfect pitch and volume ... if you let his voice flow through your head instead of trying to catch his words, he almost caresses your auditory nerves, preparing you for the next assault the Art is setting up.Remniscient of both the old Noise and Enigma, this is exactly what I had hoped to find - that while the old Art is no longer together, the Noise which drives the soul has not been silenced."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Art, and it's Noise. So why not?","review":"This album is a treat. It's a fattening treat. It's a truffle. Trevor Horn + Anne Dudley + Debussy = CONFECTION. Reminds me a lot of Saint Etienne at their most filmic, although I could do without John Hurt's narration, which kind of interrupts the flow for me. The rap contributions are welcome - Art of Noise have always included an element of hip-hop in their music, and Rakim's raps are a welcome updated sound for a 1999 AON album. If you're expecting an album of funky electronica, you aren't going to find \\"Kiss\\" or \\"Paranormia\\" (sic). There's some uptempo stuff on the album, but it ain't what this disc's about (although if you hurry, you can get a limited edition with a second CD of remixes). Perfect music to gather wool to, or to go to sleep to, or to, uh...well...no disrespect to Barry White albums or anything, but..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it ice cream yet?","review":"To take up the metaphor suggested below... I wanted chocolate ice cream. I really did. But what Art Of Noise gave me tasted like cocoa, sugar, milk, and eggs enthusiastically but inexpertly thrown together. Chocolate ice cream it is not. For some, the simple novelty of combining disparate elements will suffice. A more discriminating consumer will require a recipe prepared with more expertise. AON have taken a very bold step, though, which will doubtless lead to some wonderful future recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two guys I converted to The Art of Noise","review":"I bought \\"The Seduction of Claude Debussy\\" just before heading off on a two day car trip with some friends.

They didn't say a word during the whole time the cd was on. Noting their silence and thinking they hated it, I apologized for playing it. Thats when they suprised me.

I've played with other brands for quite a while, like tiffen, hoya/kenko, and the really cheap zeikos, and this was my first B+W product. It is well made with high class material. Your hand will tell the difference immediately.Secondly, the MRC really works. It looks like the glass is not there at all (of course there is still reflection if you look from a lower angle). Once again, I believe the product is #010M, not #010. Amazon has the wrong info.Cons:The water/dust resistive coating is not quite as advertised. It catches dust as easily as other brands (and my glasses). I heard that even keys could not scratch this coating, but I don't want to try this myself, even though I believe good glass must be harder than keys (Mohs scale 7 vs 4).It is also a little pricey... well, at least for me.

Why spend $1500 on a Canon L series lens and then put a cheapo filter on it? You paid big bucks for a lens so you could have the best image quality available, didn't you? So then why put a cheap $10 piece of glass over it to distort or cloud your images? This filter is rock solid. The weight and feel are heavy duty and the threads are precision. And if your lens is a Canon L series lens than you know the weather sealing on it doesn't include the front element unless you have a filter on it. And it's also a good insurance policy to protect the front element from accidental scratches. But those aren't the reasons I bought this filter. I bought it because I was tired of UV haze washing out my photos anytime I was down at the lake or out on the coast. This filter clears up the images beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are no better filters","review":"I've been using this filter for nearly three years on my Nikon D70, and it has been fantastic.

I was NOT disappointed this time! Essentially, the filter is 'invisible' in practice, with nearly zero internal reflections and no ghosting under any conditions. The brass mounting ring fastens to the lens firmly and smoothly, without binding or 'stiction', and offers excellent protection against moisture, dust, and any reasonable impacts. The Nikon lens cap fastens securely to the filters front threads.In my opinion, there is simply no better 'UV' or Haze protection filter for your precious lenses than B&W...not; from any other manufacturer, and not at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air bubbles","review":"I thought this would be a nice product based on the good reviews, I'm traveling in Italy right now and I found there r 3 or 4 small air bubbles on the surface of this filter after one month of use.

It would just move from one section to another like it wouldn't let the dust go. And dust kills a good photo!

Something about the blandness of the financial world goes badly with conventional, creaky thriller plots maybe. This is less financial than FREE TO TRADE and a lot better than the dreadful efforts of Mr Frey, but it still badly lacks an edge, or a sense of attack. It laps up the world of high finance with breathless enthusiasm (all those HUGE sums of money being moved around - how thrilling! Or is it?). The result is pretty flat and dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmm Mmm Good","review":"If you like cherries and chocolate, you will like these.

They are kind of rich tasting if you eat too many at a time.Four pounds of these fit perfectly in a 1 gal ziploc bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"I love this product. It's the perfect proportions of cherries to chocolate. I keep a small container of these at work and it's perfect because when I get a chocolate craving, I can eat just a few and then I'm good. The only thing that would make me love this product more is if it was less expensive so I could buy them regularly instead of being a splurge item or if they were organic (and that would make it more than worth the money)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"Excellent quality cherries and great taste, simply a healthful treat.

Stay with the plain Traverse Bay dried cherries."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are so good","review":"I have to hide these from everyone they are so good...especially me! True they are expensive but so good I may be addicted forever. I made trail mix from some of these with the raw unsalted sunflower seeds from Bob's red mill I purchased here and the Nutiva raw cashews I also Purchased here, all I can say is it was heavenly. I like to snack on them when I am doing my school work it helps me concentrate better."},{"rating":"1","title":"too sweet, too dry, not good quality","review":"I bought these cherries in hope of making small bags for Christmas stockings. They are horrid! The thick \\"chocolate\\" coating has unnecessary ingredients in it,and artificial vanilla, so it doesn't really taste like a chocolate coating, but a cheap imitation, and are much too sweet as well (usually extra sugar is used to make up for the lack of good chocolate). I can barely taste the dried cherry inside, and they leave an after taste. This product on Amazon is cheaper, as the cost is twice as much on the company website. But even at the reduced price, I would not buy these again. Amazon says they are kosher in the description, and the plain dried cherries are, but not the chocolate covered cherry product.I have had chocolate covered dried cherries by other brand companies from Michigan that are much better. I will stick with those."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"The chocolate on these cherries was stiff and somewhat stale, and there wasn't enough of the chocolate to complement the tartness of the cherries.

Ever since I bought the first eRa CD, I realized that I was in front of work of genius. Even when we try to compare with Enigma, eRa has its own signature, \\"The Mass\\" is a total reinvention of eRa 2, with the same choral arrangements but more powerful. It's very hard to describe the sound for you'll probably have to experience it for yourself. I didn't buy it from Amazon but from a retail store. And I must say: \\"It's kind of music that makes me remember that there is still beauty in this world\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty disappointed","review":"Pretty disappointed.

That album is pure joy, and besides listening to it a lot myself, I've also given it as a gift.Therefore, after such a long time, I was thrilled that Era just came out with another album. It wasn't a question of if I was going to buy it, but rather when.This album is good, but it seems to lack the magic of their previous albums (especially their second). Some of the music seems almost recycled, and, in contrast to Era 2, there is a lot more solo singing in English. This in itself isn't bad, but it seems to draw the focus away from the chants and lush orchestrations. On listening to this album a couple times now, I almost get the feeling that a lot of the orchestral pieces on this album could be movie background music, which isn't bad, but I did expect something more inspiring and alive from Era."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU'RE TEARING ME APART, MILES!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I recently received 146 copies of this movie as part of a legal settlement.

I've given two: at each of my grandson's baby dedications. It has a place to write a special message to commemorate the date and occasion for giving, and I think it is a book that will truly grow up with the child and be a treasured keepsake. The illustrations are beautifully rendered in soft watercolors and has that old time look of little boys in days gone by. The values reinforced here (whether you are Christian or not) are what we all desire for our little men to learn so that they will grow up to be men of character. FIVE STARS!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Illustrations are heartwarming","review":"This book is a real find. The illustrations are so boyish yet sweet. The print, at 4 lines and rhyming, will keep their attention. With 3 boys, we can relate to it and will enjoy it for years to come. Geared to younger boys, probably younger than 8.

Shoot the author for publishing this book and charging people for it.","review":"Do NOT waste your money. This book is written like a novel, but it is very, very dry and repetitive. I found nothing in this book that I don't already know, not that I'm a know it all. All the examples are human scenarios, nothing related to dogs and there's nothing in this book that actually says, \\"ok, this is how you can train your dog.\\" No specifics or useful tools to help you, the dog owner, help your dog. Bad, bad book, if there was a negative rating, I'd rate this book a \\"-2 stars\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dopey, Misleading Book Relying on Discredited Theories","review":"Although behaviorism has largely fallen out of favor because of the very limited picture it presents of the psyche, nonetheless people like Pryor persist with the idea that operant conditioning is the solution to all of our problems. This book has very few insights about dogs (indeed, her advice is sometimes dangerously misleading because she doesn't pay attention to the way dogs are hard-wired to behave). And the advice she gives about modifying human behavior are often unintentionally hilarious. (For instance, she recounts that in order to give herself incentive to get out of bed for an early class, she would feed herself small squares of chocolate.) There is much more to the mental life of dogs than this book would suggest. For a book that does them justice, try the Monks of New Skete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Shoot Yourself - You'll Want to After Reading this Book!","review":"This book is great if you want to train animals. It cannot do anything - ANYTHING - other than that. Behaviorism is lifeless and stifling, and causes just as many problems as it \\"solves.\\" Pryor, a Skinner disciple, agrees with his philosophy that we have nothing to do with our actions. She states that our own creativity is actually a factor of reinforcement by others or the environment. That's not really creativity, if you think about it. This book disgusted me, especially when Pryor started her lifeless rampage that we are \\"evolved social animals,\\" which may explain why she equates human behavior with animal behavior. She even goes so far to say that sex is a \\"mutual exchange of positive reinforcers.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't shoot the dog","review":"Don't Shoot The Dog makes you think that this book is based on dogs...but in fact it is based on human relationships and Dolphin training as well. It's the best book I have ever read on positive reinforcement training. Maybe not the easiest read but so educational. As a dog trainer I apply this to my own training and even human relationships.There is no force used in this method of training and can be used on almost anything and anyone. From kids to birds.This is a must read for anyone serious about training their dogs and having better relationships with the people around them. To understand training this is the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"great primer on operant conditioning","review":"This book explains the philosophy behind operant conditioning, as well as giving basic tips on how to work WITH your dog (or other trainee--this method can be used on cats, people, fish...).I'm grateful to the people who directed me toward positive training. Visit Karen Pryor's website or clickersolutions.com to learn more about clicker training and positive pet interactions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Foundation and Approach, but clicker gadget an unnecessary add-on","review":"I've been a professional dog trainer and instructor for 30 years. Pryor does an excellent job setting forth the research and reasoning behind reinforcement training and behavior shaping; she's articulate and clear and fun to read.My issue is with the clicker gadget itself. ***If a handler has developed the eye and timing that enables him/her to implement these techniques successfully, an appropriately chosen verbal cue meets the need quite effectively.*** There is no need for the clicker gadget. It's just another bit of litter cluttering up the handler's hands. In my training hall experience, novice handlers too often conclude that clicker training is an 'easy gimmick' method for dog training. They screw around confusing the dog and losing his attention all together by using the clicker inappropriately, while failing to acquire the basic leash-handling and body language techniques that would have better served them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've just read most of the new version.","review":"All of the reader reviews currently on the page deal with the first edition. I just received the new edition.First, for those who are looking for a cook book to solve specific problems, this may not be it -- as a response to people who felt mislead by the title.This ISN'T a dog training book, what it is, is a manual and a philosophy for solving the problems in your life caused by other's behavior, whether it is your husband, your children, your pets, or your co-workers.The new edition brings in our new research and our ideas. Anecodotes are more relative and talk about people we all know and have met through the click-l list and other internet interactions.This is definately the definitive book on behavior modification, and it is infinitely readable.<CLICK> Good job Karen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful help on all levels","review":"I recently completed an internship at Wolf Park, a wolf research facility in Indiana. While we spent a great time learning about how to help these animals as an endangerd species we also had to somewhat get \\"inside thier heads\\". Don't Shoot the Dog was recomended reading at the park and gave us wonderful insight into the animal mind. After my internship I came back home and applied the techniques to my ferrets and my dog! The results were amazing. I think anyone who has any intrest in making a conection with thier pet will find this book more help than one can imagine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Shoot The Dog","review":"I think the meat of this book could have been captured in one really good paragraph. If you want to train dolphins, whales, birds, or even chickens, this book is for you. But, if you want to teach a dog to come, sit, lie down or stay, there has to be a better choice. This is not a \\"how to\\" book in terms of specific, practical, dog training techniques, but rather a philosophy of training in general. I found the title misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Psycho-babble","review":"This book purports to solve virtually every relationship problem from bosses to chickens to tennis games to teen-agers and even a little bit about dogs ! In reality it gives an endless stream of very generalized anecdotes about how wonderfull the book is and lots of psychological jargon with frequent deviations into the history of pyschological technique. There is very little practical, step by step instruction on how to train a dog to do specific things ! (After all it is supposed to be about training dogs! ) It refers to techniques like clicker-training and gives yet more anecdotes about how wonderfoll it is but gives no detaile on how to train a dog with it.This book is a perfect axample of the inherent problem in buying a book on-line. You cannot browse through it (like you do in a book store) to get a feel for how well it is written. ----- The book shows up at your door and you really have no idea what you have bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"Not a good choice for someone looking for a good all around dog training book. Very few practical examples, hard to get into, too much is irrelevant to dogs. This book will be very little help for a novice dog owner looking to deal with your typical adolescent puppy problems. For those looking to have a better understanding and relationship with their dog, I would recommend \\"Culture Clash\\" by Jean Donaldson."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic intro book","review":"I owe a great deal to the man who gave me this book several years ago, it was a wonderful way to be introduced to the world of positive reinforcement and different types of training tools. This isn't a \\"training bible\\", and shouldn't be read as such; but Karen offers fabulous insight into the world of training that can be useful to anyone. I know that it opened my eyes, and as I am now a professional horse trainer I have been able to further expand on and apply the techniques in this book. A great buy and a worthy read, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for dog trainers","review":"This book was so much more fun than I expected. Karen Pryor does a great job of generalizing animal training to include food for thought regarding training of the human animal as well. Her comitment to postive training methods is defended with logical thought. It was a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the concept, hated the author.","review":"Positive reinforcement is a wonderful thing, but it seems like the author got bored of writing after awhile and just started to ramble. Great concept, but I couldn't even finish the book because I couldn't take the rambling any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected at all.","review":"I am sure that many will find this book very good and very useful. I was looking for more of a practical guide rather than an investigation of the psychological underpinnings of conditioned training. If you are looking for a practical guide to training, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but not simplistic","review":"This is an overview of Skinnerian behavior mod written in practical terms for everyday life. I found it when searching for resources before getting a new puppy. The book will not only help you train your dog, it will help you understand human and animal psychology - without putting you to sleep with psych class mumbo-jumbo. Kind of an odd book written by an interesting woman. Odd meaning it doesn't really fit a given category of books - many folks will never come across it. That's a pity. There's a lot of useful stuff packed in those few pages. I've kept this book at my bedside to read over and over again. It makes me think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed how I see my dog!","review":"I will never get mad at my dog again when he doesn't follow a command after reading this book. I've read 'The Culture Clash' and found that one more useful for step by step stuff. But this one was more enlightening to me about the theory behind positive training, which after failing with Cesar Milan's dominance techniques I was desperate.What an amazing read, and I can't tell you how it changed my relationship with my dog, he is happier and so am I! I dip in and out of it often to find inspiration for training...though I didn't necessarily find the part dealing with people a huge break through, but liked how her technique can be expanded to other areas in life. Buy it and you will forever have a new relationship with your dog!We are all much happier now--"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, shipped quick!","review":"This book has taught me so much about behavior and dealing with people and training dogs.

Karen Pryor presents applied behavioral analysis in clear, easy to understand language. Her writing style is easy to follow and you will learn more about behavioral science than you ever thought possible. This book is an excellent text that can be used to teach a college level class or as a relaxing read to learn how you can become a better person. As strange as it sounds, you will be prepared to train and teach your dog, your boss, co-worker, spouse or improve your own habits! I've used this book in college classes and I buy a revised edition each time one is issued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written...and out of date","review":"The writing in this book just drags on and on. Whenever she makes a point she feels the need to talk about the exact same thing for far too long. She really isn't talking about anything revolutionary in here. If you have even the most basic knowledge about training this book will be useless to you...also, she talks about how she had her cat put to sleep because she couldn't get it to stop peeing on the stove (instead of leaving the cat outside or giving it to someone who knew how to train it she put it to sleep. She also complains about how her mother bothered her with all her complaining while living in a nursing home...zero compassion). Karen Pryor also doesn't seem to express any sort of skepticism about her own work; which is a bad sign in any science. Save yourself the money, boredom, and time of reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book! Good tips!","review":"Great tips for the average reader. Just be sure to read it cover to cover and not take notes out of context. Easy read and very good tips that can help with kids, spouses, in laws, and pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"training is not a bad word","review":"Don't be mislead by the use of the word \\"training\\". Training is simply another word for the learning process. This book gives excellent examples of how to apply training principles, whether you are trying to help your child learn or encourage your husband to pick up his socks. Pryor's training techniques rely on positive reinforcement. This is basically the idea of letting your child, spouse, or pet know that you like what they did! If you have some basic knowledge of training principle's the value of this book will be in applying those principles. If you arn't familiar with these principles then you will learn them from this book, but it may take some experimentation to really get them down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treat Your Kids As Well As You Treat Your Dog!","review":"It's not necessary to spank your kids or swat your dog. You can raise disciplined children and well-behaved pets without violence, and have everyone happy with the results and the process.

The tendency is to use prong, choke collar, even a shock collar. How much better to use positive reinforcement, consistency, and patience, patience, patience!

GREAT BOOK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishing for more concrete dog training ideas","review":"I bought Ms. Pryor's book on the recommendation of a friend who has been reading Ms. Pryor's work. I was looking to get ideas from Ms. Pryor on how to address common problems with dogs--such as walking freely at my side,and to stop barking at the sound of doorbells. Among her books, I chose this one because it had the word \\"dog,\\" in it and I was expecting most of the book to provide examples and experiences with dogs but that was not the case. I was aware that Ms. Pryor had trained dolphins, nevertheless, I thought her focus would be on dogs. The book offers a variety of behavioral training approaches but most are explained in the context of dolphins she trained, human behaviors we try to change in our relationships and in some rare instances, dog behavior. To put it bluntly, I've been disappointed with the book. I'm in the last chapter and am straining to get it finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book","review":"This book was so boring, it came highly recommended but did not help at all.

It's clear, concise, and gives good foundation information without talking down to you. I'm a huge fan of Karen Pryor after reading this book.

Never there has been a movie that has been shown for four years and yet, it's ongoing. Despite that the setting is at the romantic backdrop of Hungary and it may give audience an impression that they are watching a Merchant Ivory Production, it is not. Suffice to say that there's a triangular relationship, a melancholy tune that this movie is named by, Holocaust terror in World War 2, human's propensity to self-gain at expense of others, eternal love that triumphs all. This is a movie that's best to be seen not knowing the plot and you shall it more rewarding towards the end. An unmissable experience and highly recommended.

He wants to attach profundity and portentousness to everything in sight. Baseball, Nuclear War, J Edgar Hoover, Peter Bruegel, Frank Sinatra... everything becomes a part of this giant, humorously ritualized mythos, which would be fine, but unfortunately fiction needs to have more to it than the atmosphere of a catholic mass in old latin to really function (or at least is does for me). Delillo wants so desperately to be taken seriously, but his vague invocations make it obvious that he doesn't really even know what exactly he wants to be serious about. It seems like he wants to be a prophet of dread, anxiety, paranoia, really of modernity itself. Maybe instead of trying to be an important writer he should just try to be a good fiction writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A publishing scam from an American genius?","review":"Well this has to be a classic, but describing it as a new 2001 novella by Delillo is a sure way to rile Delillo fans like me, who almost ordered it on reflex. It turns out to be the first part of Underworld. While Underworld is, in my view, one of the great books of this decade, the publisher should at least warn potential buyers that they may already own this book. On the other hand for those who find it hard to stick through an 800 page book, this sample delicacy might be a good introduction to the art of Delillo. As for me I prefer the original Underworld, or Body Artist, a completely mesmerizing novella about the same size as Pafko."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pafko at the Wall","review":"Canonization of a modern classic, or contract fulfillment?

Its a classic like they should be. A clear nod to the times it was filmed in but with so many basics that we still look for in a good entertaining film these days, it still works just as well as I m sure it originally did it '46.The DVD is a great print too.

Amazed they didn't cut that). That kind of connection mated with this kind of script creates fireworks. Not quite as great as the Falcon or Indemnity, this is nonetheless easily one of the top ten films noir.Beautifully shot, with a fabulous Steiner score, and Chandler dialogue shaped for the screen by Faulkner (!!??!! How often do you see names like that together in Hollyweird?), Sleep is a true classic in every way.It may be a tad too long, but not by much.Bogie was rarely better, and the jokes about his height seem to make him work even harder to be the tough guy that he truly was.

That's the theory. The reality, however, is rather different. The plot is so complicated as to be meaningless. If the people who make the film have no idea who shot whom, what is the audience suppose to make of it. The plot is the hook from which you hang the story. If you can't follow the plot, you can't follow the story. Call me old-fashioned if you want, but I watch films to follow a story. No story: No movie. There is much to commend this film: The dialogue is as sharp as a knife and Bogie and Bacall deliver it with their typical panache. The cinematography is striking. Never has a film looked so noir. However, a story is required, and story is what The Big Sleep lacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly named- this was a BIG sleep","review":"This movie was appropriately named, as I kept falling asleep. My sister had to keep waking me up. It made NO sense whatsoever ( I was never ACTUALLY asleep, my sister kept pinching me, so I didn't miss anything). Usually I like to give a breif summary of the plot- the only problem is, there was no plot, so that's hard to do. It was very, very, very boring. I don't see why these other people who have reviewed it like it so much, but I know a lot of people who feel the same way I do. And I have no idea why this was called the big sleep, truthfully, even my sister, who liked the movie (for whatever reason) was stumped.

The Big Sleep is a proliferation of plot such as would befit the Baroque to Bogie noir. It is a one of a kind, in combining sophistication in acting, scripting and plotting with brutish 50's noir stylings and then to top off the Bogie Hoagie, a sincere romantic sentimentality. Don't believe the (negative) hype.

What was AIGA's purpose here? I thought it was to showcase the award winning work within not just Jennifer Sterling's work. I left this book on the shelf at my local bookstore.There are plenty of books on the market sold as objects. I don't see the purpose of disrespecting other peoples work to create an object in what is supposed to be a showcase to honour what they have done.I like Jennifer Sterling design work but if she wants to sample other peoples work she should record a hip hop album next time. And why did AIGA approve this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"And they call themselves designers?","review":"I've never had such a violent reaction to a book before. They call this a book yet it bears little resemblance to me. They show samples of great design by showing several photos all cropped differently. Not one showing the full page.

The sad part is this design comes at a price, and that price is the content it's trying to display is completely truncated, and ineffectual. As far as inspiration books go, this is definitely one of the worst books I've purchased. You can tell that there are some real gems located within, but the sad part is you only see the top corner, or little snippets. Maybe next time AIGA should focus on letting us see why the winners are in the book, instead of trying to make an artsty statement in and of itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"art not design","review":"This book is a good example of where art and design go their separate ways. It's a beautiful book, clearly put together by a very creative individual. But it's \\"designed\\" very poorly, it doesn't serve it's function. It's hard to read, you can't see the pieces it's supposed to highlight, and the binding breaks very easily because of the chosen materials. Again, they look great, but they don't do their job.

It looked like they started out taking the time to put the extras together the right way and then ran out of time and slapped the rest together.

Zim, the overly determined and somewhat crazy invader who just wants to prove himself worthy in a world where he is isolated, can be compared to many of us who are just trying to make our mark on the world. Gir, the lovable and fun-loving little robot, is like the child that lives within each of us.

So yeah i got annoyed after the first episode.So if you like ninja turtle son crack go ahead and buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would love it if it would play...bad discs","review":"The show is great and highly reccomended. However, save yourself some headaches and buy another version. These discs seem to be hit or miss. Our had two DVD's in the set and the first one, with most of the episodes, doesn't play at all and is a complete mess. Luckily we could watch most of the two episodes on the second disc. Unfortunately since we didn't watch them within 30 days of ordering them they can't be returned or replaced. If you do decide to buy, make sure you open them immediately and have the time and money ready to exchange them until they send you DVD's that can actually play and aren't smudged and scratched up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gir is my hero...","review":"...and Zim is awesome too. I was less excited about getting this DVD when I kept reading here that it is only 9 episodes. But I bought it last night anyway, and hit myself on the head. DUH! Each episode is made of two 15 minute parts, i.e. The Nightmare Begins, Parts 1 and 2 are one episode, Bestest Friend (a personal fave) and NanoZim are another episode. There are also \\"Animatics\\" for each episode, which just seem to be rough black and white sketches, animated. It's still pretty neat. and the Irken subtitles are a plus as well. Not to mention Jhonen being on every commmentary. And funny too! But for me personally, this show is all about Gir. He is just so darn cute and lovable, and utterly quotable! Buy this DVD right now so you too can start spouting conundrums, just like Happy Noodle Boy! Whoo hoo!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can Grrrr Please Fix the DVD","review":"Invader Zim is demented -- it is quite wonderful. Read the other reviews for the content.However, my review comments on the DVD itself - for this volume and each of the other Zim volumes. There appears to be something faulty about Invader Zim DVDs such that they do not appear to work properly in some standard DVD players. I have all three volumes.

It has all of the straight-forward rock music that makes the No Fun EP great. It also has the elements that made Pack Up the Cats and Here comes the zoo awesome. It is the perfect balance of heavy rock songs and slow, more melodious songs. The songs on this album amost blend together perfectly. Anyone who likes this band, or has ever been a fan of rock music, should pick this album up soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A faithful fan must admit a failure","review":"I have been a Local H fan since the release of As Good As Dead, when I was but 13 years old. Their first three albums are always in constant rotation in my collection. They produce the perfect music for me in almost any situation of my life. However, this album has none of the qualities of Local H that I enjoy. I purchased this album, and tried my best to listen to it as much as the other albums, but I find myself drawn back to the earlier work. If this is your first Local H album, I highly suggest you purchase HamFisted, As Good As Dead, or Pack up the Cats ... all of which have songs that make life worth living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Hard Rock","review":"I adore this album. It may be the only CD I ever bought on whim, knowing very little about the band. I will never regret it. It reminds me a little bit of Nirvana, a little bit of Queens of the Stone Age, a lot of grungy sound but every now and then hits a weird psychedelic groove.I got their new album hoping for something on par with this record and I was disappointed. Then again, I would have been shocked if they had matched this album. P.J. Soles is an all-time favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever Happened to Real Rock?...It's Right Here","review":"\\"Whatever Happened to P.J. Soles\\" is a great example of a rock band that knows exactly what they're doing. They don't take themselves seriously, and at the same time can rock your face off easily. Songs like \\"Everyone Alive\\", \\"How's the Weather Down There\\", and \\"California Songs\\" bring the rock nice and raw. While this CD features a lot of garage band like rock, it also has a more indie side to it. Songs like \\"Hey, Rita\\" and \\"Mellowed\\" show a different side of Local H.Overall, \\"Whatever Happened to P.J. Soles\\" is a rockin' CD that has something every rock fan will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the same H","review":"About a decade after their raw and enraged debut, Ham-Fisted, Local H is still at it, in true rock and roll professional form, with one of the best records of the year. While 2002's \\"Here Comes the Zoo\\", the first record on the new label with new drummer Brian St. Clair, was 10 underwhelming songs, this one's got some real keepers. \\"How's the Weather Down There?\\", \\"Everyone Alive\\", and the band's first hit in what seems like forever, \\"California Songs\\", are all among the band's best work. \\"PJ Soles\\" is also great. This record tends to peter out a bit at the end, like most of The H's work, but it's so strong for the first 10 tracks, a little inconsistency can be forgiven.Great to have you back, guys. Can't wait till New Year's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I am a big fan of Buffy, so, when I found out Joss had released a comic which would reflect his vision of season 8, I was eager to purchase it. Well.... I can honestly say I didn't like it. I love the Buff-meister and all, but this seemed really silly and not quite up to par. I think the art also lends itself to the unreality. Every character looks like they are 13. Buffy should at least be in her mid twenties.The plot is pretty simple stuff. Buffy is the leader of a teen group of slayers who fight vampires in the future. Dawn is attending Berkeley and has a really BIG problem. Willow wasn't in this issue. Xander is Buffy's manager. Not a heck of a lot happens.I would pick up a few issues if I could get it in the bargain bin of my local comic shop. But I wouldn't rush out to pay full price. There are better comics out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding thinking","review":"The only beef I have with this book is the lack of data.

I needed it quickly so I emailed the seller to request expedited shipment (as well as paid the higher shipping cost). I had a response nearly immediately even though it was the weekend. I would definitely purchase from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent concept, great songs","review":"Spock's Beard has some great songs on this album. The story itself isn't really original, however they put great music to it. Uplifting music like Open the Floodgates and rocking songs like The Devil's got my Throat fill the album. A strong, very strong Kansas feel can be heard with the keyboard. In fact, when I first heard Spock's Beard I thought it might have been Kansas. This album has some classics on it, which makes it a must have. They do revisit many themes in the second disk, but they are themes that should be revisited!If you can find the special edition release, you can get the third disk with tracks from the making of Snow and a sharply turned up rendition of Yes's classic South Side of the Sky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top-heavy","review":"When I first bought this album I was pretty excited. Judging by the last album V, the new one should be great. It wasn't.What I get from the album is that Neil Morse had this big idea for the double disc concept album, and didn't let anyone else in the band do any song writing. I have no problem with Neil Morse's song writing, he does a great job as the main writer/singer for the transatlantic albums, and most of the older SB albums (especially V). The thing in these examples is that the whole band balances itself out, and Snow is totally top heavy. What happens is the album ends up being 75% ballads, and in between the rest of the band comes up with straight out prog jams that are a little out of place. The idea is actaully pretty cool; a remake of the old rock opera/concept album for the modern times with a balls to the wall spirituality theme, its the execution that is lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindblowing!","review":"Is There anything better than this? I mean once \\"carrie\\" starts on disc 2 the rest of the story is a high, truly a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless music for the prog-rock soul.","review":"I have listened to this CD probably over one hundred times. It took about two listens before it happened. I was completely blown away by this effort. Especially with the first disc. There is not one track on this that I can say is questionable. It moves me in ways that music should. When you make it to \\"Wind at my back\\", you'll understand.This is a CONCEPT album and tells a story. The story-line is cool, but it is the music and amazing vocals that keep this release in my top-ten of alltime.All in all, when an album that I listen to, on a fairly regular rotation, still can raise the hairs on my arms...thank you Neal Morse and crew. This is one release that I STRONGLY recommend. You will be moved and blessed with the power of INCREDIBLE music over and over and over..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing music","review":"I found out about Spock's Beard 2 months ago. I now own all of their albums. They embody the best of progressive rock and modern rock. Their music sounds like a mixture of Yes, Genesis and Kansas with a hint of Incubus. I say this not to suggest that Spock's Beard seeks to emulate these bands. They don't. I mention it to give potential fans an idea of what they're in for. Spock's Beard is full of talent, and nothing embodies this like \\"Snow\\". Neal Morse's writing and vocals are heart-felt and poetic. The musicianship is without compare. In times like these, few bands would ever attempt a concept album. Fewer still could make a great one. Spock's Beard has done so. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this CD","review":"I am a big fan of Dream Theather, Pink Floyd, Yes, and Rush. I had never heard Spock's beard until I bought Snow. I heard a lot of good things about this band. I expected virtuoso musicians, epic instumentals, and hard-driving riffs. Yuck, what is this?I would be embarassed to play this in front of mixed company. I don't get it at all. I bought this on Mike Portnoy's recommendation. Thanks a lot Mike, I want my 20 bucks back. This is not prog-metal. This is 80s pop music. Way to many ballads. I will give their older stuff a try, but I am not holding my breath.

It is about a \\"gifted\\" albino's difficult journey through life, and the struggles he encounters along the way. This could have been a brilliant CD if it was\\"shortened\\" to one rather than two CD's.......By the time the listener gets through the end of CD one, you feel like the story (and music) has already been told. Snow contains the usual consistent melodic themes that Neal Morse is known for, and the quality mucianship of the Beard..It is just TOO DAMN long, and CD 2 suffers as a result, with what appears to be \\"filler\\"....Another issue I have is the limited playing (solos) of guitarist Alan Morse.

I can't compare it to their other CD's, but, I thought it was awesome on it's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neal Morse Unchained","review":"There are really two ways to review this work. One is on its value. Neal writes a few good tunes and then fill the record with story (or filler). The second is to think about this record compared to the current releases out there. In this way we are talking album of the year! Thus four stars. Its sad that such an uneven record will still be the best album this year. Neal's ego seems a bit out of control here and he needs to relax and just deliver the goods. The lacking of quality instrumentals here is another issue. V definately provided some great sections and this is almost wholly lacking here. Oh well hopefully VII will be a return to form and put spock back on the map."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets get real","review":"First off, I really like this band. I really like Neal Morse. The thing that bugs me is that so many people call this release their best effort. I think that is a joke. Although I have not heard a lot of the post-Neal Beard and I have not heard the Darkness, this ranks as next to worst of what I have heard. Snow was my first Spock's purchase. I was a little disappointed at the time. It's not 'all that'. I bought it because so many rated it high. I'm glad I kept trying. I find \\"V\\" to be the finest overall. I think \\"Day for Night\\" and \\"The Light\\" follow close behind. I am often disillusioned because there is not enough frank reviews on Amazon. Most folks who take the time to review a record do so because they are big fans therefore, most reviews are biased on the positive side. This is a Spock's Beard fan telling it more the way it is - or trying to balance the scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spock Reaches Its Apex","review":"I liked the first two Spock's Beard albums, but then I got tired of them.Neal Morse's voice was just too overpowering. Yes, it is emotive and amazing and musical and strong, but in large doses it is just too larger-than-life.All of Spock seemed to sound the same: larger than life voice, larger than life ego, larger than life pretensions.I even sold V, because (though technically great) it was just more of the same.So I found Snow a big and welcome surprise. First, it has more variety. Yes there is the usual relentless, shocking opening-attack; but also many more quiet times, that aren't just Angst Before the Storm.Second--and this is the most important thing--Nick D'Virgilio sings about half the time: a welcome break from Morse. D'Virgilio's voice is softer and sweeter than Morse's, but just as tuneful and far less intimidating.Finally, some Spock that is actually intimate, instead of just formidable.A really tremendous album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect...a great start to a promising career!","review":"I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Dupree and buying this book from her.

He takes these boys and makes men out of them and then cowboys. This is an interesting film and goes against John Wayne's somewhat stereotypical and programmer type films he was making near the end of his career. Wayne plays this rancher convincingly. The premise of the story is intriguing and its outcome takes several twists before its conclusion. The intervention of Bruce Dern as a very evil villain on cattle drive and his demise is shocking. These boys learn about being men but perhaps learn a cruel lesson along the way. John William's rousing score is a highlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Duke at his best","review":"There's nothing like a good western, a John Wayne film, watching kids rise to the occasion, or hoping for the right outcome in the never-ending battle of good vs evil.

If you want to see 5 star Wayne, watch THE SEARCHERS, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON, RED RIVER, THE SHOOTIST, and STAGECOACH. All are Wayne at his best and more Oscar worthy than his admittedly fine performance in TRUE GRIT.

When John becomes a little to round in the midsection, short tempered, and a scowl that puts you right into the action of the screen is where John Wayne's is best remembered.This is a touching movie that entails the ruggedness of the west, how boys want to grow up too fast and become men, and how men can become role models to young boys powerfully influencing them for the rest of their lives. I have followed the Duke's career for many years and I believe this is truly his best work. It is a movie that can be watched over and over. Iti s easy to relate to the characters in this movie and it is one of the few movies where the 'old man' dies.

It is considered one of the Duke's best (maybe even THE best) by many people, yet many critics gave rather discouraging reviews of the film (see Amazon's Editorial review, for example).This is an entertaining story about an old man who cannot hire enough men for his cattle drive, and who is forced to take along a group of boys instead. This film finds Wayne in a somewhat different role, for although he plays a cattleman (not unusual for the Duke), he also has a soft, paternal side not often seen in his films. This movie also differs in that Wayne does not emerge triumphant at the end of the film.This is a great Western for any die-hard Western fan. Not only fans of Westerns will enjoy this movie, however. A great many people who do not like either the Duke or the Western genre thoroughly enjoy this movie, and perhaps that is what gives it such a lasting appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Duke's flavor of the west lives on.","review":"This remastered version of the classic movie provides a trip down memory lane.

What I'd like to point out is that this 1998 DVD release of the film (violet cover with the title smack in the middle - should be avoided. DO NOT buy this version! The image quality is atrocious. The film looks dirty, blurry, and drab in a way that is not what the filmmakers had in mind. The Deluxe Edition from 2007The Cowboys (Deluxe Edition)is much better looking and, of course, the Blu-ray versionThe Cowboys [Blu-ray] beats them all.

Unjustly maligned at the time of its release because of its theme, \\"boys become men though a violent rite of passage\\" (echoes of Vietnam & Iraq) now can be placed alongside Wayne's other great films like \\"The Searchers\\" & \\"The Shootist\\". I am not normally a fan of Westerns or of the Duke because of his conservative politics but I have to admit this is one gem in Duke's crown. Roscoe Lee Browne, Bruce Dern (at his most villainous) and Colleen Dewhurst in a brief, but amusing turn as a madam are excellent. Mark Rydell shines in his first directorial effort at a Western. The visuals and sound in HD or Blu-ray (I have both but am ordering HD) is superb. Well I have the HD DVD version and the visuals are superb, do recommend you get this version since it is way cheaper than the Blu-Ray which is from the same master. One of the Duke's last great Westerns (along with \\"The Shootist\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cowboys","review":"The CowboysThe Cowboys is an interesting action movie.

It is the Red color the team was using a few years ago. It is more of a maroon red than the forty niner red. It is the color they changed to a few years ago during the time when the owners were destroying the team. Fortunately the red color was brought back a couple years ago. This flag must be left over from a few years ago. It is going back. I want no part of the losing era colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS FLAG!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this flag from \\"The Fan Nut\\" and it wasn't even the right flag it doesn't look like the pic so DON\\"T BUY IT if you are wanting it to look like this one! I contacted the seller and he said that the one he sent me was different because his supplier must have changed the design and didn't let them know so the one he sent me is all they have. The quality of the flag is very poor. It looks very CHEAP and very old. The one they send you is a bright red, white, and gold it looks like their old school colors. I'm all for throw backs but I don't like this one like I said before it looks Cheap! If it was up to me I wouldn't have gave them any stars but that wasn't even a option so that is why they got 1star.

Everyone in this film is brilliant, Deborah Kerr, Cary Grant, Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons. While touring a mansion Mitchum's character meets up with Kerr's and sparks fly. Watch how the always suave and debonair Cary Grant catches on to their attraction and how hard he tried to save their marriage. Jean Simmons is hilarious as Kerr's ditzy best friend. A bit soap-opera-ish at times but worth the effort of watching the story unfold. It also beats anything that is out there among the current crop of movies. They sure don't make 'em like this anymore, nor is there anyone this talented in showbiz anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie, Good DVD copy, but NOT Closed-Captioned","review":"The movie is delightful, the DVD copy is very satisfactory. Its letterbox format is perfect for this movie, much better than an ananorphic format would have been.My only complaint is that although the DVD is advertised as \\"Closed-Captioned\\" - it has the \\"CC\\" logo on the case - the DVD has NO captioning. This is quite disappointing for those who need captions.Still, this DVD is the best way to see \\"The Grass Is Greener\\" outside of a movie theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing wrong with movie, but DVD fails.","review":"This has always been a favorite film of mine.

This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!! No subtitles in any language, no line 21 captioning.Nor does it have anything else. \\"Interactive Menus\\" means scene selections. This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.Since I bought it online, I can't return it and neither Lion's Gate nor Artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people I bought it from."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it!","review":"I bought this film, because1. I like Stanley Donen (Singin' in the rain etc.)2. I especially love Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr3. I think Jean Simmons is a pretty fine actressBUTI must say that this film wasn't worth seeing it. The story was about nothing, there wasn't any interesting plot.I admit there was one or two funny scene (for example when the two couple telephoned to each other or the pistol duel) but the rest there were long and boring without any humour.If you like interesting films: buy All about Eve, or if you like Cary Grant or Deborah Kerr as I do: buy anything else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforgettable (Unfortunately)","review":"This movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made.

Fatalistic and hopeful, dirty yet crisp, noisy and smooth. As others have pointed out, there's a great interplay of guitars on this album that hold a lot more menace than most records can muster these days, the vocals somehow manage to be one-note yet never repetitive, and the rhythm section is damn tight. Highly recommended rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much different from their debut, but that's a good thing","review":"A few people have asked me what Hot Snakes sound like, so I replied \\"A mix of RFTC/Drive Like Jehu and the more straight ahead rock of Sonic Youth.\\"Everything you loved (or hated) from \\"Automatic Midnight\\" is here: John's excellent guitar work, Rick's original voice, and the great artwork. Althought their debut was full of great lyrics, they deal with different and better lyrical subjects this time around. Also, the production quality is much better this time around.If you're new to the Hot Snakes, I'd suggest buying both albums at once. This is without a doubt, a great follw up album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not Duran Duran","review":"Of all the screaming \\"guy rock\\" on the radio these days, there's not one who wouldn't be standing in a skinny tie and Flock Of Seagulls haircut, playing a Casio keyboard and looking bored in that all too familiar European manner, if this were say, 1981 (see: Stone Temple Pilots, Creed, other screamers, et al.) But Rick Froberg and Co. rest assured don't go with the flow. Simply put: They rock the house with the brute force...a force appropriate to their themes of alienation and frustration.In my opinion, the album is too short and too restrained for what these guys are capable of doing--Hot Snakes delivers black themes without the loose ends of the similar Drive Like Jehu, and does it well, but many of those loose ends help to underscore the raw power of these artists. Whatever the case, I'm buying the next one the second it becomes available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product but could get it cheaper at the seller's web.","review":"Excellent product.

The series is generally very reliable, but it started to dive and reached bottom with that book. The Jupiter Myth is inevitably an improvement -- but not much. It's set in Londinium, but the plot is a retread of 'Time to Depart'. Somehow it grates. On the one hand, we expect Londinium to be pretty rural and basic. But on the other hand we have this crime syndicate operating, invisibly? This simply doesn't work. Helena is nagging Falco, which doesn't really work either.So it's hard to recommend this one.

I expected illustrations to guide me through the stickier spots in my work. This book does not have that. The pictures are cute (in a vampirey, gothic way) but they do not add much to the explanations.The index is really not usefully at all to someone who is clueless in grammar. Terms such as Past Perfect Progressive Tense and Subjective Complements mean nothing to me. After reading these sections - they still mean nothing to me. It would have been nice to see index entries such as: Who's vs. Whose or Past vs. Passed. These are not listed.

Most of them are okay-- they've taught me a thing or two about punctuation, syntax, and so on--but the grammar book that stand outs the most is The Deluxe Transitive Vampire. What makes it exceptionally informative and even fun to read is that the author does not attempt to teach you the rules of grammar with boring and windy explanations. Instead, she teaches them with numerous examples of grammatically correct sentences to tell you how they should be written and grammatically incorrect sentences to tell you how they should not be written. This is the most effective approach to teaching grammar. Students will quickly and effortlessly acquire a deeper understanding of grammar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I would rather have a good, basic grammar book. This book mostly shows how clever the author is instead of providing a clear explanation of the subject matter.

Those examples just distracted me from the business that I was about - learning grammar."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think everyone should own a copy!","review":"This is my very favorite grammar reference book of all time. With Karen Gordon at the chalkboard, learning grammar does not have to be boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"My, what big words you use, Grammar!","review":"OK, let's face it: grammar is basically a fairly dull subject, and Ms. Gordon seeks to overcome this by using sentences that refer to Creatures of the Night and other Edward-Goreylike thingies. This makes her book more readable than other grammar books, but it's still not exactly thigh-slapping humor.If you want to get junior-high or high-school students to sit down and study grammar, this book is most likely your best bet. It will probably hold their interest, and they'll probably learn something. On that basis, I recommend it ... but don't expect a lot more.PS: My comments are based on reading the original 1984 edition. I don't imagine it's changed much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"Though the silly humor and snide asides are apparently intended to illustrate various grammar rules, for me they were just confusing. I found myself having to read sentences over and over, breaking out the jokes to find the rules. The book covers only the most basic principles of the English language -- another disappointment for someone who went to school to learn the basics, but might want more from a book like this. Even the clip-art was badly placed and only added to the general feeling that the book was tossed together quickly, cheaply, and without the focus necessary to be informative.

I haven't played a game for so long like I play Half-Life, Counter-Strike and etc. And about the Steam feature, its the best too. I know it is a bit big, but its espeacilly for playing on internet. And if you want to play on internet, you HAVE to have a broadband connection, so the updates don't takes so much time. And about downloading the 723mb pack, no need too, because Steam converts yours game instalation of Half-Life and all mods to work with Steam. And about this pack, yes, its better to buy the Half-Life only CD, but then you will need to download Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, Opposing Force, and no Blueshift will be there. So, you choose what you want"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a scam","review":"Don't get me wrong, I loved Half-Life and the expansion packs (not the best FPS ever, Deus Ex beats it, but thats another argument). The thing about this pack is that its not worth it. Opposing Forces comes with Blue Shift, Counter-Strike and Team Fortress Classic were released as free mods if you purchase Half-Life. Anyways, the point is you get all these games just by buying Half-Life and Blue Shift, which is about $5 cheaper than the pack. Not much, I know, but don't think you're getting a great deal and then learn this after you buy it. And if you buy the normal games you get a better, more indepth manual (the one for Half-Life has a bit of back story, like a letter from Freeman's professor, never seen the real Blue Shift Manual, so I cannot comment on that). So definitely buy Half-Life and Blue Shift, not this pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Game","review":"I can not figure out why people think this game is so great. I played the original halflife years ago and I thought it was ok, just ok. It has cheezy monsters, the graphics are outdated, game play is mediocre in my opinion. The controls do not work as smoothly as most games. I started playing opposing forces and I just can not get into it. A lot of the puzzles are illogical. With all the other games out today, I feel I wasted my money on this, even though there are five games included. So if you want an outdated mediocre game get this. I have played return to castle wolfenstein about 50 times, I am playing right now as matter of a fact and I still like playing it better than anything in halflife platinum. Maybe the halflife online games are good, I don't know I don't play games online.

Especially since you can get all those except Half-Life and Blue Shift for free via Steam. All you need to do is buy a half-life cd key and download Steam. Steam then gives you the options of downloading, for free, Counter-Strike, Opposing Force, Team Fortress Classic, plus Day of Defeat, Ricochet, and Death Match Classic. Besides these, there are a lot of third party mods that you can download and put on to steam. Natural Selection has a lot of players and it is third party right now.Also, it doesnt look like it is any different than the first platinum pack, which was 29 dollars when I bought it a year and a half ago.I gave it five stars because it is a fun game, just don't buy this pack. Buy Half-Life by its self. Save yourself some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite game ever.","review":"Love playing this game still after all these years.

There are no big men in Key Largo -- just big mouths and big guns. Each is used to intimidate hotel owner Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall), her invalid father-in-law (Lionel Barrymore) and ex-GI Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) despite their individual pride. The little man behind all the mayhem is a belligerent Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) -- notorious criminal trying to make a comeback. McCloud has seen enough senseless killing in the war to tame him but in order to come out of this ordeal alive he must muster up enough courage and tactical ingenuity to defeat Rocco and his henchmen -- that is if the storm doesn't wipe them all out first.Movie quote: \\"You don't like it, do you Rocco, the storm?

You can see their special chemistry emerging right on film.

It's hook filled goth/metal hybrid that never ceases to captivate. I always thought that the label goth with all its associated baggage never did justice to the Fields sound. It was much more nuanced and textured than the cliche cheese of goth. I also think that metal isn't quite the right word to describe this music. Metal as a genre carries alot of baggage as well. So what to call this type of music. I don't know because its not really a type of music at all. It's its own animal.You should take a chance on this record. It is one of those records that you might just love, and they don't come around too often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Um Yeah","review":"I could go on and on about how this is the best Goth/Metal hybrid you've never heard.

Lucky me, huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Houston, we have a problem...","review":"Just a warning... if you like Fields Of The Nephilim, just know that this sounds nothing like that band. This is more in line with Napalm Death. The distorted guttural vocals are total incomprehensible and the music lacks any kind of subtlety whatsoever. If you like Napalm Death or that type of stuff, you may well like this. I did not. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"For fans of Metal and Goth......","review":"The work of the former frontman of the Fields of the Nephilim, Carl McCoy, this album abandons the softer, quieter sounds of the Fields and assaults with an almost Black Metalish approach.

I've been ttc for a long time now. I've gotten all of my fertility testing done and nothing is wrong with me (or my husband). There's no reason we shouldn't be getting pregnant, but have been trying for several years now. We have gotten a couple of treatments done w/ injectibles, etc. One day I woke up and thought, why are we doing this, there is nothing wrong with us?! This book has helped me to realize and confirm that I don't need to go to a fertility clinic to get pregnant. I'm taking steps to better my health, nutrition, and other aspects as outlined in this book. I am hopeful that I'll become pregnant without medical help. Thanks, Julia.

Thank you for the inspiration Julia and God Bless You."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving, if somewhat inspiring.","review":"Although I found parts of Indichova's story inspiring, overall I found this book more annoying than enlightening. Women who are struggling to conceive their first child should be warned before reading this book. Indichova's struggle is about secondary infertility. As someone who is still hoping for one child, I found it difficult to read page after page of Indichova's angst about trying for her second child. It made me feel that she didn't really appreciate the gift and miracle she already had with her first healthy child. I know secondary infertility is a serious problem for many women and I respect that it is, but for women who have not been able to have any children, this book can be an odd and unsettling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read. A wonderful story of alternatives!","review":"I bought this for my sister-in-law, but since I'm a pregnancy/birth junkie I read it before sending it to her. I think it's a wonderful reminder that western docs do not know everything there is to know about fertility and infertility, but they tend to act like they do and present no alternatives.My sister-in-law just had her first baby a few months ago after 10 years of trying. The few years of Western fertility treatment did not work and she hadn't yet gotten around to the acupuncture I was urging her to get. It happened naturally after they came out to visit my hubby and daughter and me."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am,like most of the readers of the book been trying to conceive for sometime and when I saw the title and read the reviews I thought I'll give this book a try. I don't begrudge the author for wanting another baby even if she already has one and in the early parts of the book it seems OK but when she got into the yoga and the positions that she assumed and most everything else that followed it was just too much for me. I am happy for her for having conceived her second child but the idea or the assumption that if you will yourself to conceive and have some sort of positive imagery and unity with the Universe is more than I can bear. She did have a miraculous birth considering her FSH level but it was the Creator who did that for her and not an act she willed herself to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Inconceivable is unbelievable.

The quote about not being \\"so quick to put your eggs in a petri dish\\"? Quick? She must be crazy. Who does this without careful consideration?Throughout the whole book she runs from the dreaded IVF. Well, hooray for her if she can get a baby from herbs and relaxation. But, for most of us, that is just not our reality.Especially for people with anatomical abnormalities that no amount of herbage or mediation will fix.Thanks, Julia, for making me feel even *more* broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"How are you CHILDLESS???","review":"This book is a flop, the woman has had a child.

Please God, I am on my knees begging for you to answer this yearning desire, this pleading prayer for a child! Father, are you listening?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this one....","review":"The author already has a healthy child. All she does in the book is whine and moan about how she needs another child. As a woman who cannot even give birth to one child, I found this insulting. I also couldn't believe that she spent all her time and money going to hocus-pocus quacks. Sorry, but eating strange fruits, drinking shots of wheatgrass and doing yoga doesn't necessarily give you a baby. This author is not a doctor, so I wouldn't feel comfortable following her advice. Ugh, what a waste of time this book was for me. That's four hours of my life that I'll never get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Helped me Heal Severe Digestive Problems","review":"I came upon Julia's book when I was dealing with severe digestive problems while trying to conceive. While traditional doctors were pushing me to use injectable drugs, Julia helped me realize that I need to regain my health before trying to conceive. I followed her juicing instructions and got myself a juicer. The green juices did what two former surgeries had failed to do. Cutting diary, coffee and white flour helped me to lose weight and become more energetic. I also joined a yoga class and my body feels more ready for a pregnancy. I feel stronger. I used to be very angry at my body for not being able to conceive. Julia's work has made that anger go away. Now I feel great about myself. I also try to do imagery exercises.Julia's book was truly an inspiration to me. I don't want to use injectable drugs.

I had minor struggles with my 1st child at 35 and was able to concieve within a yr with assistance with Clomid. We have been trying now for almost a yr and 1/2. Now at almost 38 I've been told that I have almost NO chance of conceiving without a donor egg. My FSH has been as low as 11 and as high as 42. I was released from my fertility specialist care. It was like a door was slammed in our faces. Not sure if this idea will work but what could you loose? I think it sounds a little hokey but even my MD husband thinks it's worth a shot. Eating better, taking care of yourself, doing Yoga, and getting off the pitty pot?(not sure about the colon cleanse by the way) Even if it doesnt work for me it's great to know there is someone out there that beat the odds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a wonderful book that seamlessly combines an inspiring personal story with detailed, practical advice on conceiving and living a healthier life in general. I am ordering my third copy because I have given this book away twice! Through the author's experience, the reader learns about diet, exercise, stress, health supplements, and medical treatments, and how all of these relate to fertility as well as overall quality of life. Great for older women trying to conceive, but I am young and read this book while I was trying to conceive (with no infertility problems) and found it entertaining and helpful. A sensitive, useful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I found this book VERY disappointing...I don't understand why it got so many hypes?? The author already had a daughter. When her daughter was 2 years ago, she started trying for 2nd one, and freaked out when not being able to get pregnant right away after three months trying..Then she ran around to do yoga, take wheatgrass shots etc... WTF???! I wish it was that easy for me. Many women including me have been trying for years and don't have any kids...She already had a biological kid, she's NEVER had a miscarriage, she's NEVER tried/failed IUI/IVF... HOW CAN SHE name this book \\" Inconceivable\\"???!!!!!!!!!! I felt it was a joke after finish reading the book. If you like story telling, you might enjoy reading how she met her husband, how she got married, her family history and other irrelevant stories... I didn't find any useful information that I didn't already knew... she didn't provide a clear answer either... save yourself $$ and buy other better and more helpful books. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.....","review":"This book is terrible. While she discusses some excellent topics like diet, relaxation and taking control of your own health, it's at a 50,000 foot level, there is no real factual information whatsoever.

Save your money ladies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thirty-something","review":"I wanted someone to connect with, someone who's been where I have, I suppose. While I felt for her and her husband, it's just her situation which didn't match with mine. I thought I would be reading about someone who went through IUIs, IUIs with meds and IVF cycles.The author is much older than me and has a specific situation with FSH levels. For most of us women in our thirties that's a non issue.The healthy diet and nutritional information sparked my interest however I still believe everything in moderation is key.If you're on a journey where male infertility is an issue or your on the IVF path, this is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but was not as good as I had hoped","review":"I have been struggling to conceive for over two years. I ordered this book thinking that there was some mystery cure that she had found on her path for a baby. The beginning was great and I could relate to her struggles to have a baby. For those of us who struggle just to have one miracle she was complaining about her situation when she already had one child very easily. She didn't start having children until her late thirties/ early forties. If you want to read her suggestions about fertility check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helped me beat myself up more","review":"First, let me say that I'm glad that the author had a success story.But, let's face it. The reality is that not all of us will be so lucky. It is almost unfair to suggest that by doing all the things that she did, we can have a baby too. It's not that simple. My husband and I have been trying for **nine** years. No live births yet. I read the book and just started beating myself up for working full-time, for not doing yoga, for not taking herbs, not relaxing enough, whatever. I am sorry to say that regretted this purchase and am giving my copy away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and vivid, personal, and to the point.","review":"This is the book that youth groups should mass order. Peretti recounts his own childhood growing up as a victim of both cystic hygroma (causing stunted growth and a speech impediment, among other problems) and bullying. He shares with painful detail how constant bullying effected his self-image (\\"I thought I was a monster\\") and how the school system typically does little or nothing to protect the weak. Even further, he illustrates his view of the world as governed by a higher system of rules, explaining why \\"Might makes right\\" is both a dangerous and a flawed philosophy. Peretti even confesses his own faults as an occasional bully, his failures to stick up for those weaker than himself.

After his entire family is wiped out, the duke sets out to seek revenge and find his only surviving niese (Natalie Wood) who was captured by the hostile Indians.

The naked depiction of obssesive racism is as relevant today as ever, and the end of the movie makes perfect sense, since it obviously takes a powerful emotional attachment to drive a man to such dreadful extremes.

Wayne, Ford and Jeffrey Hunter were at there best during the making of this film. My father would often tell me that Jeffrey Hunter had been one of his playmates growing up. I find this all the more interesting after seeing what an excellent actor Hunter was. The blu-ray edition of this film is exquisite!

I'm just here to say that the Blu-Ray transfer is amazing. For a movie made over 50 years ago, it has and will probably never look better. And for $8, it is a steal. It's great for showing off what Blu-Ray can really do for an older film.

A rather unbelievable film, I can think of many other westerns, new and old that fit the western bill better. I would recommend \\"The Wild Bunch\\", \\"Unforgiven\\",even Wayne's \\"rio bravo\\" are superior to this junk. Oh yes, an Italian named Sergio Leone made better westerns than mr. Ford and Mr. Wayne.Takes all the western stereotypes and mixes in bad acting, what a sorry stew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"John Ford, the Mediocrity","review":"\\"The Searchers,\\" for some unforeseen and godforsaken reason, is constantly extolled as the foremost example of John Ford's cinematic genius. I saw the film, and I searched and I searched, until I could find no genius at all. Only a conventional, hackneyed Western [pleonasm?], based on actual historical events, melodramatically told - even obscuring or distorting the actual events - just so John Ford could tell his rather silly story of how poor Ethan was left out of the Family Reunion (the completely symbolic closing door in the final shot). Many filmmakers have revered this film. But then, most filmmakers were never noted for their taste (even Kurosawa admired Ford). If this were a nickelodeon, I'd advise you to save your nickels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Searching for what all the fuss is about","review":"Almost everybody, it seems, thinks this is a masterpiece. Quite frankly, I cannot see why. I won't bother with how Native Americans are stereotyped, although, from today's understanding, the movie really gives you a hard time sitting through their comic strip-like portrayal. My main critique is that the characters development is weak. Secondary characters are stereotyped to such a degree that makes the movie almost unbearable. At the end Wayne's sudden decision not to kill the girl doesn't really surprises anybody, after all this is Hollywood. But why has he changed his mind? We do not know. What has he learned? The way that he stagers of into the sunset in the movie's final scene suggests that he hasn't learned much. He leaves because he is still uncap able of being \\"social\\". Maybe this movie \\"stood tall\\" in the 1950s, as one reviewer suggested, but it's definitely not a must see classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave up when..","review":"the indians show up and the one who is apparently to grab the little girl is obviously a white guy with utterly lame 'indian' makeup on.

My opinion of that remains unchanged, however, I didn't see much different between the standard DVD version and the blu ray version of this movie. My TV, TV cables, and blu ray player are all top of the line and I have watched other blu ray discs on it and have been wowed by the detail and clarity. This movie didn't really offer much more then the standard DVD version. It's only priced a few more dollars above the standard DVD so its not that much of a risk and if you want the newest version of this movie, you will have it, but if you want to save a few bucks and get the same quality picture just go with the Standard DVD version. I don't think this is anyone's fault, I just think that the movie technology of the 1950's doesn't convert well to Blu ray, but thats just one guys opinion. Either way the movie is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awsome Gift","review":"It has been at least 25 years since I saw this movie,this is a Christmas gift for my son in law he loves this movie and now he will not have to rent it anymore"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I comment on the Amazon review?","review":"Mr. Shannon: You are the one engaging in revisionism history!

I always liked Wayne but having seen this movie I see that while he's still a good guy and I like him, the cowboy mentality as exhibited by Bush is bankrupt.

It does not surpass John Wayne's film, the Alamo, in any way, shape or form. I personally think the Searchers is an overrated film in the same way the film High Noon is. It's almost as if people in our society have no original opinions of their own. Classic films in our society should be weighted by their emotional impact, and not by what a critic may say. And that is the case with both the Searchers and High Noon. Films that I consider to be epics are: the Alamo, Braveheart, the Kingdom of Heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Ford--too many moral tags","review":"Best western!! I think not.

From a purely entertainment point of view, the movie works very well. John Wayne is excellent as the tough, driven uncle of Natalie Wood, who goes on a 5 year quest to find her after her family is murdered and she is kidnapped by Indians. Two things about this film standout for me. One thing is the relentless pursuit by Wayne and the way one man, for whatever his motives, refuses to give up or move on without getting what he is after. The other standout is the photography. This must be one of the most beautifully filmed movies of all time. The colour and scenery are breathtaking. Some of the dialogue and acting (especially Jeffrey Hunter) are stilted and unbelievable, but they do not interfere in the enjoyment of the movie. Anyone in \\"search\\" of a great, classic Western should be sure to view this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Excellent extras","review":"This is such a wonderful film with a well done Blu-Ray transfer.

Even when you take one of evangelical Christianity's best known worship leaders into a recording studio, it still sounds like he's in a church full of worshippers. Hiding Place, his first studio album (as far as I know) has Don still doing little monologues in the middle of songs and saying the words to the next line of lyrics before singing them. In other words, he's doing exactly what he does in concert. It's kinda amusing to hear.But what about the material? I own (and reviewed on Amazon) his last three projects and each had at least one song that absolutely moved me into a place of tearful worship. I'm still hoping that happens with Hiding Place. So far, nothing's done that and I must admit, this album has a lot of unmemorable, slow to mid-tempo songs that lack in energy.

As a racquetball player, for the brace to become effective (immobilize the aggravated tendon on the innerside of the elbow) I had to tighten the strap significantly. Since there is no elasticity in the strap, after a half hour my arm was sore from the tightness of the strap. Recommed staying away from this type of brace. If you are playing sports, such as tennis or racquetball, where you are constantly gripping a racquet and need an effective elbow brace, recommend you get Futuro Elbow Support With Pressure Pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't go wrong with Teema","review":"I love Teema.

Dick Summers, an experienced mountain man, agrees to lead the group to Oregon. This takes place in the early days of the Oregon Trail when men were still working out the exact route they would take. There are six Big Sky novels of which The Way West is the second. I am currently reading the third book in the series, Fair Land, Fair Land. It is every bit as good as the first two.

I guess when I think \\"The West\\" I think \\"The Old West,\\" as in, prior to 1900.

I liked all the characters. They seemed believable and as far as the foul language goes, just visit any shopping center or public place and you'll hear much worse. Sorry if it offends you, but that's how society speaks; it's realistic. I would not have minded if it were twice as long as it is. My only problem is the attitude of the characters related to the Vietnam era and their reactions to the war. I am a Nam vet myself and I have none of those negative attitudes.

In fairness the tedium may be outweighed by the tenacity of Topor in finishing this exercise in excellent writing. However, he does so at the expense of the reader.

To me, it was like watching a great soloist play a great concerto with a so-so orchestra. With the exception of Greenstreet and Lorre, the acting was pretty poor, especially Mary Astor's nauseating interpretation of Ms. O'Shaughnessy. Maybe they just look bad in comparison to Bogart, or their performances are just a tad unworthy to do justice to the amazingly intricate screenplay and the highly original cinematography - but this certainly didn't pose a problem in Casablanca.

Being new too Bogart's movies I have to say I thought he was only an actor who mumbled his lines.

That was the case with this 1941 classic. John Huston's driectorial debut is a masterpiece of film noir, featuring a great performance by Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade. Actually, the entire cast is fantastic from top to bottom, with standout performances from Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. The story is a classic tale of greed, murder, and manipulation with some surprising plot twists (surprising if you haven't seen it already). THE MALTESE FALCON is one of those movies that you can watch over and over and find something new each time. The picture and sound quality are actually quite good for a film from 1941 as any flaws are minor and inconsequential. The DVD also features the original theatrical trailer, plus a special feature on trailers from Humphrey Bogart movies. This truly is a must-have!

The dialogue pops without being edgy. The music soundtrack is spectacular. We listened through our 5.1 surround set up and were amazed at the clarity of the film score, especially in monologues, where the lower end of the orchestra usually sounds ominous in an indistinct way.

The 1-star is for the blu-ray version. If you already own the regular DVD, do not waste your money replacing it with the blu-ray version. It is 16/9 compressed image, so essentially it looks like full screen format and I do not notice any significant improvement in the picture quality over that of my regular DVD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticking with my VHS copy for now","review":"I would love to own a restored version of the Maltese Falcon on DVD, if it existed. I'll just stick with my 10 year old VHS tape for now. The film needs to be restored. Take a look at the way the second scene with Spade and Mrs. Archer ends. The film always seems broken at this spot, even when it runs on the movie channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much to wade through to get to the film","review":"This is a great movie! Leave it to Turner to fill 1/4 of the tape with stuff to fast forward through to get to the film. They treat a series of trailers like that's why I bought the tape.My advice: buy DVD that you can program to get you straight to the film. My advice to Turner (and the Star Wars folks, who also do the same thing): put the extra stuff at the end of the tape for those who want it. Most people want to see the film, not the hype or history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad compression","review":"Anamorphic compression is a technique used to compress 16/9 or wider screen movies before recording them onto Blu-rays or DVDs. It isn't needed for standard 4/3 movies like the Maltese Falcon. Yet the studio decided to project this 4/3 movie's image on a wide screen 16/9 frame and then compress it. This means you have to set you TV to 16/9 to watch this 4/3 movie, resulting in wide blank bands on the left and right. This means that 20-percent of the horizontal resolution capability of this Blu-ray disk is blank space, thrown away and wasted. Why the studio would do this to the greatest detective movie ever filmed makes no sense.Having said that, the movie does look better than DVD, though not as much better as it could, and the sound is much better. I enjoyed it, but still can't forgive the studio for cheating me by wasting much of the Blu-ray's capability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Overhyped Film Noir","review":"I've seen this movie several times over the years and it has not gotten better with age. In fact, I really do not understand how it has acquired such iconic stature. The plot is serpentine but somehow not very involving, the acting is way overdone (except for Astor, who is just downright bad), the characters are without exception slimy or at least not very admirable, and the whole thing creaky. To its credit, it is not long and the direction is pretty taut but I certainly think that I have watched it for the last time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maltese Falcon Retrospective","review":"The remastered print of the original John Huston classic made the viewing a treat for the seasoned viewer of this Dashiel Hammett classic. The additional material, such as the Warren Williams and Betty Davis versions of the story, were of particular interest for those who consider the Bogart version a cinematic gem. They provided Huston with a blueprint of what to avoid in the third rendering of the novel. The 3 disc special edition is a must for anyone who cherishes this genre and the historical evolution of literature on the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Dashiell Hammet","review":"One of the best movies ever made, and one I never tire of watching.

Granted, one is assured of good acting with Bogart, Astor, Grreenstreet, Lorre, and Bond in the lineup. Likewise, Director Huston was never known for gaffes or poor quality. The casting is good. So, where's my problem? In a film dealing with dishonesty, there's not a single character that one can trust.This leads to a highly confusing tale that requires several viewings to set the audience straight. That's a definite no-no to me. Having seen this tale at least 6 times over my lifetime, I still couldn't begin to explain it to a non viewer with any sense of acumen. I'd rather try explaining baseball to a foreign novice. No, I think that this picture will continue on a downward spiral, based only on 70 year old reviews. Ted Williams is dead.

It is the story of the curiously naive railwayman/kid Milos Hrma who overcomes his sexual impotence by succesfully consummating intercourse with an older woman. This intimate and seminal life event of Milos is beatifully and sensitively detailed amid occasional description of WWII, an event that was looming over Milos and his surroundings. This novella is a joy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why don't more Americans read Hrabal?","review":"A classic work, true to Hrabal's technique of penetrating deep into the psyche of a \\"little person,\\" who is seemingly unimportant, but reflects a whole society. The ending of the book is different than the movie, with an amazing, and complex moment of acceptance and accusation both, as Czech and German lay dying together. Hrabal's symbolism compresses surreal poetry and social codes together, and like \\"Too Loud a Solitude\\" this slender book can say a lot more than many bigger ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I can not tell you how awesome this book is.

I love James' Hetfield's powerful voice backed up with the immotion filled music of the orchestra. I have all of Metallica CDs, and I don't think that this one is worse then the others. Yes it is different, but it still carries that anger of \\"Kill them all\\" and the feeling of the \\"Black albom\\". I love and adore Metallica, and I have nothing but praise for this album. I think it was an awsome idea to have an orchestra, because through it the mosic has more feeling and emotion, and Metallica will never lose their hardness, so don't worry about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!","review":"I'm 31 and I've been a Metallica fan since Kill Em All. Ever since Metallica released \\" Load \\" many fans called them sell-outs. Like me, Metallica grew up and today they are artistically mature and a tighter band. In they're boldest move yet Metallica colaborated with San Francisco symphony and produced an awesome collection of past and present hits in S&M. Composer Micheal Kamen perfectly blended classical instrustments with the raw heaviness of Metallica. The symphony performed flawlessly in such heavy hits as Battery, For Whom The Bell Tolls, and the Call of the Ktulu. My personal favorite was \\" One \\" as the string and horn section played with same raw fury that Metallica is famous for. Metallica survived the great metal die-off of the early 1990s because they evolved musically and took risks. S&M is the lastest risk and Metallica produced a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a perfect mix of culture","review":"Being a huge Metallica has influenced me in my review, but if you hate their music you are not going to buy it anyhow. Let me start by focalizing on Metallica: S&M has excellent collection of songs. One might say it is a *best of* colaberation. And eventhough S&M is live, Metallica performed magnificently on it. Every fan of theirs should own it just because of that. Now don't be intimidated by the orchestra. They don't ruin, overwhelm or drown-out Metallica's music. The two styles of music blend well together. It is like they were meant to be together. Have you ever listened to a song and think there was a little something extra that could be added to make it perfect? Well now you have heard perfection. Some songs may not be to the liking of all, but I beleive every Metallica fan will love this. Finally, if you have any doughts, ask your friend (he has a copy of S&M) to play *For Whom The Bell Tolls* for you. It will get you pumped up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"An awesome album from a great band. Who would have thought that they would do something like this? It turned out real well."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW. They have done it again!","review":"I believe that this is a very interesting album of metallicas'. who would ever think that metallica would play with a symphony. I think is a great album. Buy it. It's not like new metallica.............its old metallica, with an awsome twist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compilation album","review":"I think S&M is a good live album. The album contained some of the best of Metallica: \\"Battery\\", \\"One\\", my personal favorite \\"Master of Puppets\\". But there are no songs from Kill 'Em All, which disappointed me. \\"The Four Horsemen\\" is I think one of the best Metallica songs, or even a concert favorite, \\"Seek and Destroy\\". \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" are good but overplayed. I think on some songs the symphony ruined, like the Lovecraftian \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\". But for the most part S&M will satisfy most Metallica fans, just because well it's Metallica playing live. Metallica sounds better than ever before with James's singing and Kirk's awesome riffs. It sounds like Metallica is still going strong and will continue to do so for many years. Peace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They'll Be Cool Enough To Be on PBS!","review":"Well fellow metalheads, this is the end. The band formerly known as Metallica is struggling so much right now to find a way to write decent songs. So they've bombarded us with this one and disc one of Garage. Both of which have nothing new on it, and nothing that truly sounds like Metallica as WE know it. Not as MTV, the popular tennie-bopper or middle-age establishment now knows Metallica, but as WE, METALHEADS know it So in desperation they pull this stunt with the San Francisco Symphony. It was bad enough to be there live and sit through it. Plus to add insult to more injury, the symphony is nothing more but a very big and live synthizer to put the \\"alternative\\" twist to Metallica's new binge of anything but metal. Geez, how much longer before my grandma thinks Metallica is cool?"},{"rating":"1","title":"GIVE ME A BREAK!!!","review":"This album is truly embarrassing and shows the greed of this band.This is a failed experiment which should have never of taken place.How could one mix metal with orchestra music?It just doesnt work.Thats like mixing hip hop with classical music.Its just ridiculous when you really think about it.All the songs on this album are worst than the original.The songs are too mellow and lack passion.Just another ploy by lars to get your money.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage - Zero stars - Had to give it one star to post a review.","review":"Anybody who has been a fan since Kill 'em All or Ride the Lightning will be disgusted to hear what has happened to Metallica.

I then scrolled through the 175 other reviews and found only about 5 that didn't like it. I figured the problem is that the real Metallica(old) fans don't bother to buy Metallica's CD's any more, so it's not possible to give a bad review. Everyone knows Metallica sold out after \\"Justice\\" due to Bob Rock and this album is just another way to rake in cash without writing any new material. The orchestra sounds awful, and is often too soft to be even heard. By setting a keyboard to \\"orchestra\\" mode, and inserting notes into some of Metallicas songs, you could have duplicated this album. Nothing new, nothing special...just tryin to be trendy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD yet","review":"great CD i think that was a great idea and a better performance by metallica i think the whole CD rocks i really liked it"},{"rating":"2","title":"San Fransisco Symphony completes already complete songs!","review":"Wow! What an awesome CD. When I first bought it, it was the only cd I listened to for two months. When I started listening to the normal Metallica songs, w/o San Fransisco Symphony, the songs sounded ALMOST, but not quite, incomplete! Although several classics were missing, like Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Ride the Lightning, and Fade to Black (to name a few). Other than that, it's amazing. The stuff that is there is incredible! I think I'm going to buy the DVD next! And you should buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"S&M ROCKS!!!","review":"Whoever said that putting a hard rock band and an orchestra together wouldn't work is [wrong]!

And putting Michael Kamen and the SF Orchestra in there was the one ingredient that made S&M; great!! I admit, I don't care too much for classical music, but this CD is probably the best CD I've ever listened to! If Metallica is getting old, they sure ... didn't show it, and the SF Orchestra mixed in very well with the group! I cannot say enough good things about this totally [great] collaboration. The only thing about S&M; that could be different is...\\"The Unforgiven\\" is not on it...however...the songs that ARE on S&M; are great songs.

I don't think so.","review":"I expected so much more, as everyone I talked to liked this CD. ... there are two songs that I like. Devil's Dance for one, as it opens it sounds a bit fierce, nice to lose yourself into - heavy on drums and thumping guitar. The backup of the orchestra is awesome, just turn it up. Vocals are hot and seductive - James,I feel you too and I'm not afraid! The next song I like is No Leaf Clover since I've never heard it before there wasn't a memory to compare it to therefore no way to corrupt it with the orchestra. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best CD ever.","review":"This CD shows how incredibly awesome Metallica truely is.

They never stop doing new and brilliant things with music. This CD sounded great and was filled with great songs.

But overall its great to hear on a good system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud and Symphonic","review":"This cd has Metallica playing their songs at full blast, with the orchestra backing them up. The orchestra doesn't play the exact same thing that Metallica do, they simply fill in the holes and gives it a more rich sound. It greatly enhances the songs from Load & also makes Nothing Else Matters sound better. Songs like Battery and Ktulu don't sound too well with the orchestra, however. I'd recommend this album to fans of Load & the Black Album, and to some extent the hardcore Metallica fan. If you only like the older stuff, or are a more of a Rage or KoRn fan, you probably won't like it too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"best /\\\\/\\\\etallic/-\\\\ box set ever!","review":"THIS BOX SET IS AWESOME.

It's got all (or most of) of Metallica's best songs, like \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\", The Call of Ktulu (one of my all time favorite instrumentals), The Memory Remains, the only song that it didnt include, that I think they should've was \\"Ride the Lightning\\", but other than that, I think anyone who's curious about this CD should try it - you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"New twist on an old favorite","review":"I've been a big fan of Metallica for quite some time, and I find it interesting that they have been trying to re-invent themselves lately. This is no exception. Based on responses that I've heard from other fans on the \\"Load\\" albums, if you liked those, you'll like this one. But, I'd recommend listening to it more than once. It takes some getting used to before the music stops sounding a little strange.The bottom line is that this is a fantastic record... Incredible sound, and just like all Metallica albums, sounds best at high volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock!","review":"First of all, the guy who pretended to be Cliff Burton : That is one of the lowest things you could ever do. Now on to the review of this great CD. The only problem I see in it is that it's missing atleast one of the Unforgivens. I think Unforgiven (the first one) would have gone GREAT with the symphony and Unforgiven II would have been just as good. This CD however is GREAT! It has most of their best songs and the two new ones are great two. I like how they steered away from that new Garage Inc. stuff even though I think that there are a few good songs on that CD. Overall this CD is awesome. If you don't like this CD then you must have some sort of problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost","review":"In many respects this is exactly what you want it to be. It starts with the symphony and the metal band slowly kicks in with rising intensity until metal band and symphony are one thick slab of epic sound. And then, well, um...James Hetfield starts to sing. Ooh, ouch. Not good. Not only is off tune, he can't decide whether to snarl or sing really bad opera. To make things worse, he relies on the the crowd to sing certain lyrics, which you can only sort of hear. I'm sure this was a good idea at the live show, but on the recording it just piles onto the sad state of the vocal tracks.Oh and then there's Lars Ulrich's drumming. I'm sure he tells all his friends \\"those symphony weenies just could keep up with me\\". Um, I doubt it Lars. It was Lars that was too inconsistent. Listen carefully, slight changes in Lars rhythm all over the place put the whole thing just a bit out of sync.Too bad, this was a great Spinal Tap inspired concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did they do it AGAIN!","review":"How did they do it AGAIN! this is probably their best album EVER! They brang back the older ones, and made them even better (Fuel, devils dance, enter sandman, etc.) and came out with no leaf clover, a personal favorite. this album has all the excitment and attitude as all the rest, but put's a new spin on things with the San Francisco orchastra. I would DEFINENTLY buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Concert Set","review":"The CD collection at my house numbers in the hundreds, and this is certainly one of the best out of the bunch.

Excelent Album!","review":"After 15 years of success in the music buisiness, Metallica joined with The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra to record \\"S&M\\" a two disc, live album with their greatest hits. Two hours of Metallica would have beem excellent in itself, but the two groups made rwo very different musical field collide. The music on this disc is truly unmatched by other discs.

This created one of the best live albums ever recorded!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Metallica Fans!","review":"To truly appreciate the power of this album you must hear it. It is filled with the best Metallica songs including two new ones. The San Fransico Symphony deserves a great big round of applause for their fine work. A lot of these songs were pushed to their full potential with the symphony which in the end made this an awesome CD. Michael Kamen is a genious. He was the driving force behind this great accomplishment. This CD proves only one thing; Metallica will continue to produce great hard rocking music to all of their loyal fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really good, but you might like it","review":"There are two major problems with this album:1.James vocals/singing have been shot to hell over the years. Do not judge his singing from \\"Ride the Lightning\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"...And Justice For All\\" based on this album.

I love almost all of their other albums, But this one is most definatly the best. I dont care if some people say that Metallica became 'sellouts' because they played with a symphony. All I know is that when yur are so enthralled with a song that you actualy stop breathing, the music has to be good. And it is definately that good. I have listened to it nearly every day for about a year, and i'm still not tired of this cd. Oh yeah, and just thought I'd mention one last think. I hated all metal util I heard this cd!

In the end, they still just screech into the mic with brainwashing sounds. They're the same corporate sell-outs as usual. Sorry to let you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashed material YET AGAIN","review":"For the second time, Metallica fails to create good new material knowing all the Metallica fools will lap up this rehash of overused old, bad material.

However having really tried to listen to it and like it I simply can't stand it. It is tuneless, unmelodic and daft. They seem to have forgotten that first and foremost it is important to right a good song which is interesting and enjoyable to listen to, rather than trying (unsuccessfully) to create weird/scary sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"it had to happen","review":"Is this the band that does \\"Nights in White Satin\\" ?

I'm reminded of an interview the great Cliff Burton gave in '86 shortly before his death when he made the comment to the effect of 'why should we do something big and fancy? we're just up there doing what we do'. Well, you cant get much more of a bigger scale than this. Another problem is James Hetfield's futile attempts to be a good vocalist. The band was infinitely better when he just screamed as loud as he could. It went much better with the music. I'm sure Cliff Burton is rolling over in his grave, and Metallica is no longer a great metal band in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought It Couldent get any worse.","review":"Just when I thought Metallica couldent get any worse....They did. This record is an insult and a slap in theface to true metal fans.They Destroy many Metallica Classics on this CD sacred songs Like Master of Puppets,Battery,and for Whom the Bell Tolls are Butchered on this record.If I could give this CD ZERO stars...I would do so.When it comes to this Live double CD I have three words of advice....DONT BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world is this?","review":"I must admit I was open to the idea of Metallica with a symphony. The symphony could boost their power and bring metal into a whole a new world. Then I heard the album. Metallica, as talented as they are, lack the discipline to stay on beat with an orchestra. With the band trying desperately to stay on beat, the orchestra keeps on going, kinda. This has to be Kamen's worest work ever. The orchestra was just annoying. It added no power and just made a mockery of both cultures, the symphony and metal. Cliff Burton has to have turned over in his grave at this one, that is if he didn't already turn from reload. If you want classical Metallica, I urge you to check out Apocalyptica."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was recorded at my school!","review":"It is true, someone may have noted this before, but the berkeley community thearter is on Berkeley High's campus.

They put Steely Dan to shame ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money!","review":"This Cd is too much money for 2 discs of Orchestra Songs.If Metllica really wanted their music more available to fans,they should have left Napster lone.The only people who buy this album are 40 year old people who think that Metallica is still the hottest thing out.All of Metallica's songs sound the same I can barley tell a difference.I you want a good CD (That all the songs don't sound the same)Buy Jay-Z,Sisqo, BigPun,or N.W.A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Original at All","review":"I don't think the orchestra was given a fair piece of center stage. If you want the brute force of metal and an orchestra, you could do better.

It is truely the most powerful music that I have ever heard! Metallica's trademark pulsating guitar and drums accompanied by the orchestra - it was just awesome!I am an older Metallica fan (I was one of the \\"big hair girls\\" of the 80's\\"). I have a few of their previous albums. Lately, my tastes have mellowed out somewhat however,I have a feeling that I will like this CD the best. Metallica is always suprising you with something new - I also loved the acoustic stuff on their last album.PS: This would be a great workout CD for lifting weights or exercising - it's very motivating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh boy!

I mean Metallica is my favorite band,but I listened to this, and i couldnt believe it was finally over. I will NEVER listen to it again. During the complete process of listening, i was thinking like WOW HOW COOL it would ACTUALLY be if the horrible sound of that stuff in the background would like DISAPPEAR :-) !!! but if you want a cd with with some major clashing music this is perfect for you, and I seriously hope they're new one, St. Anger DOES NOT HAVE little extra background remixes, if ya know whati mean :-)If so,imean if this is in the future the new metallica, im divorcing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING...","review":"I'm a Metallica fan (read: until \\"AND JUSTICE FOR ALL..)

I never heard the album again.."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF!?!?!","review":"OK...ok.....I love Metallica but this is total garbage. Glad these days with St. Anger at least they are back in their right minds (that's a joke). Lets forget this trash not thrash ever happened. Pathetic pusstallica. With Metallica written on this its like a dung log covered in chocolate.....it's still a dung log. I'm amazed at how many 90's metallica fanboy idiots defend this garbage. Most people that defend their 90's garbage don't even know the first 4 albums or like them which speaks for itself. I mean the singing even sucks...but is has since Black I guess.

This is a definite keeper. I have owned this album for over six years now and it is still up there as one of my all-time favourites, especially in regards to metallica! it really is incredible! It sounds much better with the orchestra because they add an element that can't be compared to anything else. I like all of the songs better with the SFO. Wonderfully produced, sounds great and hard to beat! One of the most solid and respected albums in my collection. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So cool...","review":"I don't actually have this album, nor have I even listened to any of it, but I was hanging out in Berkeley at the park across from Berkeley High when they were there playing a concert which included the symphony orchestra and which I believe is also where they recorded most of the music for this album. It sounded so cool, I wish I had gone with the kids that snuck in to the show via the school's roof..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Don't Like This Album You Don't Have An Open Mind About Either Metal Or Classical Music","review":"This was one of the first albums I ever bought. I still listen to it all the time, but I have moved on to bigger and better things.Good Points: I love how the orchestra weaves in and out of the pounding drums, wailing guitars, and harsh vocals.Bad Points: I has too much post Black Album material. We could do without Devil's Dance, Bleeding Me, Until It Sleeps, and Outlaw Torn. We could do alot better with Seek & Destroy, Ride The Lightning, Fade To Black, Creeping Death, Fight Fire With Fire, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Disposible Heros, Eye of the Beholder, and Dyers Eve.The people that think this is basically a greatest hits album are wrong. Its missing the GREATEST part. The songs are good, but it isn't the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal up your Cello!","review":"Whenever an artist does a collaboration with an orchestra there will always be a few people that will hate it. Many Metallica fans have been lost over the years because the band have gone \\"commercial\\"but they have also gained new fans because of this. To listen to this album makes me wish I could have seen the concert but I have spoken to people who don't like it and they say this by listening to it through a small stereo! My only criticism is that sections where the bassier instruments could have been used to effect weren't and made me think it could have been done better all round. Do yourself a favour take this album to the friend's house who has the big Hifi so at least you get an idea of the sound at the concert in the end you'll either love it or hate it. Don't sweep this album under the rug as it is a good idea for a concert... and is absolutely NOTHING like a tribute album played on four Cellos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaker-blower!","review":"This is the first Metallica-CD I've bought ever, and I am amazed. I have never liked Metallica before, so I guess that a symphony orchestra was indeed needed if I was to even look their way. *Thanks to the small poster on the broken parking machine in Stockholm*. This is among the most powerful CD:s I've got. Michael Kamen has done a great work! Very, very, VERY good. i would like to rate this 6 stars! So if you like rock-music with a hundred-piece symphony orchestra behind it, you'll love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, new, and amazing","review":"As a long term fan of Metallica this album was an interesting way to revisit all of the songs that have been screaming out of my stereo over the past 20yrs. The best album they've put out since And Justice for All..."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG!!","review":"I'll admit I'm a johnny-come-lately Metallica fan. This is the album that got me hooked on the band. I can only describe the sound here as \\"BIG.\\" You might think adding a classical orchestra would soften the edge of Metallica's music, but it only fills up the sound. This fullness gives these versions an edge over the originals. Also improved are James' and Kirk's guitar chops. Listen to the guitar solo finale of \\"One\\" here and then listen to the original version. You'll see what I mean. Particularly of note on this album are \\"The Call of the Ktulu\\" (It blends orchestra and band better than any other track), the new \\"No Leaf Clover,\\" \\"One\\" (a true epic in every sense), and \\"Battery\\" (note especially the beginning--going from straight classical strings to the hardest metal on the album)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica Rocks...literally","review":"I had never really liked Metallica before I was introduced into Napster. Now, I own several of their cds and can testify that this collection is a great one. Metallica's \\"greatest hits\\" are well represented on this cd and I feel that the Band/Orchestra collaboration is one that is original and enjoyable. A very good cd indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It couldve been alot better.","review":"There are only a few songs on here that sounded good with the symphony they are-\\"Bleeding Me\\"-\\"Hero of the Day\\"-\\"-Human\\"-\\"No Leaf Clover\\" and -\\"Nothing Else Matters\\".The rest of the songs the Symphony flat out Ruins.What songs are they playing.They dont go with the songs at all.If you Want to here Metallica Live get the \\"Binge and Purge Box Set\\".Although ill give them credit for trying it.It was a really Cool idea....but Michael Kamen was the wrong man for the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best but good","review":"Just as in my title this not one of their best CD's and only one of the two I don't give five stars to(Kill Em'All). The reason is I already own most of the songs except for two new tracks Minus Human and the hit No Leaf Clover. Another reason is some of the songs sound distorted due to symphony and Metallica is not playing as hard as they can. Without the symphony the CD would have been much better but what are ya gonna do. Just a nice experimentation. The song that sounds real good with symphony is Nothing Else Matters. Other than that the CD is very good and I recommend this album but don't make this your first Metallica buy. Buy the black album or Master of Puppets and all the others before you buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess it's NOT the thought that counts","review":"I always thought it would be great to have Metallica Songs played by an orchestra, so I was very excited when I heard of this attempt. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work. First of all, it's live, and that's never a good thing. Second, Hetfield's voice drowns out the music most of the time. Finally, the bass and drums are all but non-existant. They're there; they're just so insignificant that the whole sound is altered. I still think this can be done right, but it's highly unlikely they would do it again. I guess it's my loss. Perhaps, 1 star would have been more appropriate?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica:S&M","review":"I am a huge Metallica fan, and I love all their songs. When they made the CD, I thought it might be pretty dumb, but once I got it, I have to say that most of the songs that they did are a lot better than before. The symphony adds a bit of class to the classic hard rock songs that were already great. To be able to mix songs like Fuel and Enter Sandman with symphony so smoothly and expertly was great. I think that if you like Metallica, rock, or classical, you should buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica does it again","review":"with the new S&M cd, metallica has again raised the bar in music.The mixture of symphony and the epic songs of metallica mesh terrifically. Note for note, the two extremely different groups come together in musical harmony. This is a definite buy for all metallica fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting...","review":"I bought this CD a few days ago, and I still feel like I am listening to a new CD every time I listen to it. The inclusion of the SF Symphony adds a lot to all of Metallica's songs. The sheer amount of detail that is in each song means that you can listen to a song over and over again and every time you hear new things. Excellent CD, especially if you know all the great old songs, like Puppetz, Ktulu, Bellz and One. The song No Leaf Clover is an excellent new song, very well done and suited to the classical side of things too. If you are a Metallica fan then you probably already have it. If you are not a Metallica fan, maybe because you think they are crazy head bangers or something, listen to this CD and you just might change your mind about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort, but some songs can't be \\"symphonized\\".","review":"Some of Metallica's songs suit very well in an orchestral arrangement: Nothing Else Matters (obviously), The Unforgiven, and most instrumental ones. I really missed Orion and To Live is To Die. But some songs just get a cacophonic sound, battery and One!!, come on!! you can't make a symphonic version of those...Anyways, most of the selected songs were pretty much ok with this new sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"LISTEN TO THERION'S \\"VOVIN\\", \\"THELI\\" OR \\"DEGGIAL\\"","review":"Please listen to therion, rage, or nightwish, or hammerfall or some others. Without the orchestra this qould have been an excellent album, but the orchestra is totally out of place, of course it has its good moments, but i think there some points in the songs when they should have been in complete silence.This is not original, many metal bands have done this before and better.Someone should teach James to sing \\"NOTHING ELSE MATTERS\\" his voice sound terrible on this song.After all i agree, metellica is not playin metal anymore, and these days are never coming back, now they are just an american elite band and not what they used to be....LONG LIVE TRUE METAL AND NOT THIS.....LONG LIVE NAPSTER, LONG LIVE NAPSTER, LONG LIVE NAPSTER.VOVIN IS A GREAT ALBUM FROM A BAND (THERION) WHOSE WORKS WITH OCHESTRATION ARE GREAT AND NO LIKE THIS METALLICA ALBUM.

What a bunch of BS people who need a \\"clean\\" version just shouldnt buy this. It completely demerits the band the album and especially the creativity that went into this album. Youre practically better off listening to another band play these songs as this was not the way Metallica wanted it to be. I would give the normal version 5 stars but because of ridiculas censor ship i gave this one star. You have MR. Dee Snyder of \\"Twisted Sister\\" to thank for the oppressive and irrational branding of albums for expliced lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, you can make you assumption after listening...","review":"After the mediocre Black Album, the not so good Load, and the horrible Reload, you can assume what would come in this album.As a Metallica fan ... Sounds like a cover 90's mediocre alternative band covering Metallica.The 90's songs don't sound too bad with the orchestra added, in fact they sound better. But the 80's speed and thrash metal songs were KILLED.The one and only highlight was \\"No Leaf Clover\\", a very well done and interesting song.\\"The Call of Ktulu\\" sounds great too since we don't have to listen to James voice, which is not the greatest since AJFA.The kill of the album is \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" they destroyed that song.Save your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"metallica's killing heavy metal","review":"metallica blows they should be shot for releasing such a terrible album classical music does not mesh well with heavy metal look at led zeppelin they were terrible they didn't do true heavy metal and now we see metallica moving in the same direction pretty soon we're going to see the death of metal"},{"rating":"1","title":"This record SUCKS","review":"I can't believe all the 5 start ratings for this hunk (...). Metallica hooked me back in the Lightning days, and I was a fan until the Black album. I can not believe the sell-outs they turned into. When you start making music just to sell records, it means you sold out. It's as simple as that. These guys are ridiculous. Has any one of you actually listened to the old Master of Puppets? That used to be the baddest song ever done, but this (...) orchestra is awful. It sounds like elevator music. Plus, James Hetfield has decided to TRY to sing now, whereas in the past, he just yelled on key. Much better back then.I feel sorry for all you poor shmucks.

Back in the day,they had a f*** you attitude,heavy guitars,hardly any air play except on college radio,the metalheads liked them (not the preps). 1991 it kinda started to fall,they were becoming more popular,you saw preps at thier concerts,the band started smiling in thier videos. 1996 was the beginning of the end. ....But I didn't lose hope I thought maybe someday they would go back to thier roots a little and do something cool like KILL EM ALL,RIDE,MASTER,or JUSTICE....but no...they're totally content on being popular.

At least those guys can play on the same level with classical musicians. Hammett couldn't play with a symphony well if his life depended on it...and it shows here. His horrible sound and note selection rings out like a bad yodeler. Once again, we hear Hetfield \\"singing\\" in his worst register yet. What happened to this band? The worst thing is that they butchered some of their better, older songs.

Let's see, how can they make money without composing anything new, putting out another crappy live album, or let alone a greatest hits album? I got it! Let's play the same crap, but add an orchestra to it. The lame brains will buy the same songs again, put some $$$ in their pockets and not even Napster could even come up with a scam like this. They suck as artists, composers and players. They have nothing new to offer and are re-hashing the old stuff. Next album will be with the Boston Pops maybe? How about a rag-time band, a calliope, or 2,000 kazoos? Hell, they'd probably sound better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good, but there's another option","review":"Very enjoyable for Metallica fans, but it's not breaking any boundries. The only reason I bought it is because tickets for the concert at Madison Square Garden were sold out when I tried to buy them ten minutes after they went on sale, but alas... Anyway, this functions as a Greatest Hits CD as well as a novelty, but there is something I have to recommend. Apocalyptica Plays Metallica by Four Cellos is a very innovative way of listening to Metallica, and it's very underrated. Pick it up instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for fans of \\"new\\" Metallica","review":"This one is for fans of Metallica's Load/Reload-era stuff. If you're looking for thrash, you'll have to look somewhere else. The songs that sound best with the symphony are the ballad-ish ones: Ktulu, Outlaw Torn, Bleeding Me, etc. Possibly the coolest version of NEM yet. The orchestra adds some heaviness to Thing That Should Not Be and Sad but True, and provides good intro work in several places (Battery, -Human). Some of the faster songs (Fuel, parts of Master of Puppets, etc.) seem kinda forced though, like it's just Metallica playing with an orchestral sound track behind them, and nothing's really being added to the experience. Not their best (hardest), but definately worth having if you like \\"new\\" Metallica."},{"rating":"2","title":"May be a lot of noise, but it's all good noise, great cd","review":"These guys can rock. Their guitars are awesome and they have awesome songwriting and beats, The parental advisory turned me off at first, but they're really not that bad.

As a \\"best of\\" it's pretty damn good too. The band are in fine form, and the orchestra adds a wonderful layer, without every overpowering. However, the orchestra are treated with respect, and often get to strut their stuff.This album is the one I keep going back to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes an already epic band seem even more epic!","review":"This cd is amazing. Metallica is one of the best heavy metal bands around, but this time they decided to try something different, do a live concert cd and dvd of them playing their songs with the San Francisco Orchestra, and the result was it was freaking awesome. The mix of hard rock and classical music has always sounded amazing to me, they're should be more bands like this. If you haven't heard this yet, which I don't see how that's possible, but if you haven't, prepare to be amazed. Also, check out the dvd, it's equally as great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful CD!","review":"A great blend of sounds, combining two different styles of music. Even if your not a Metallica fan, this Cd has something new to offer. The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra gives power, depth, to each song, bringing details to it's fullest. I consider this a softer side of Metallica, which I'm sure will reach a bigger audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"SELL OUT, NOT!!!!!","review":"First of all, let me say that i'm a big metallica fan ever since I listenend to this album.

To my dissapointment i really do not understand what is so good about them, they are ok musicians (nothing too special) but i found this and the black album quite monotonous and at times boring. It seems that the theory that chart topping material bites is true in this case as it is for other acts such as the backstreet boys and the like."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Effort From Metallica","review":"I first listened to this album with some expectation of it being good. I was let down. Metallica's songs don't mesh very well with the orchestration, probably because the songs weren't composed with an orchestra in mind. Maybe if Metallica wrote some songs and arranged them musically with James, Lars, Kirk, Jason, and Michael Kamen (who conducted the orchestra here), we would get some songs that actually fit with orchestration. With the exception of \\"No Leaf Clover,\\" the orchestrations sound arbitrary.The idea of a rock band playing with an orchestra isn't terribly original, and I admire Metallica's effort to create something different from today's mainstreme music, but this \\"S & M\\" just doesn't succeed musically."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't work.","review":"I love Metallica and have since Kill 'em All. So I figured anything they put out would be worth listening to. Well, I was wrong. The concept of a Metal band and an Symphony Orchestra is an intriguing idea, but it just doesn't work here. Although I think it could work with Metallica, their song choices with the symphony could have been better. I mean, c'mon M of P or Battery with violins? WHO thought THAT was a good idea?Metallica's music, by it's very nature, has a lot of energy, but the Orchestra seems to steal this energy.That's my opinion, take it or leave it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, plain and simple","review":"This has got to be their worst effort to date. This CD is nothing like their Binge and Purge album, even their new songs lack the Metallica feel they seem to be losing more and more every album. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell!","review":"I think the idea of metallica recording with an orchestra is very cool. But when they don't include FADE TO BLACK, which in my opinion would work better with an orchestra then any of there other songs, it causes me to say what the hell. And on another note, James actually trys to sing. Personally I like the old screaming metallica vocals on songs like Master Of Puppets. I think metallica should leave the Orchestras for more melodic metal bands like Iron Maiden, Hammerfall, Edguy, and Rhapsody; they can actually do it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey guys.....they have talent but....","review":"Stop and think before you read this......about the stuff your listening to, and about it. I mean they may rock and roll your head off, but look at the message they're sending off. I mean give one listen to devil's dance and that makes you feel all weird inside. And they may make a lot of 'good noise' but still think before you do things and listen to music like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special, standard chart topping material","review":"Apart from a few songs the symphony really doesn't add anything special sounding to the compositions, rather the two worlds of music collide head on creating one ugly jumbled pile of noise. It doesn't really matter anyway tho because no matter what they release people will buy (why i don't know), already number 1 in the charts (with other supertalented artists such as shania twain and celine dion, yeh!).For real technical and brilliant metal fused with classical music that actually allows for both forms of music to fuse together and create terrific and beautiful music, listen to Rhapsody and Therion instead, or aren't they mainstream enough?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a huge disappointment","review":"I'm sorry, but the s & m sucks. It is \\"old MetallicA\\" songs in a sort of \\"new MetallicA\\" sound.

This turns my gut, and not in a good way. It'll sell millions. Hooray. I can't stand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome idea...poor implementation","review":"Being both a classical music and Metallica fan, I was very excited about this CD's potential. Unfortunately I was completely disappointed: Metallica chose the wrong man for this job.I'm sure that Mr. Kamen meant well, but one has to wonder if he got his musical education from a Music Theory for Dummies book. The colors and textures of his accompaniment sound wrong for the subject matter and are generally forced and contrived...almost as if he were trying to fit as much into the background as possible.In Mr. Kamen's own words (from the liner notes), Metallica's \\"songs ... were already complete!\\" He should have left them that way.The really sad part about the whole thing is this would be an awesome live CD set if it weren't for the orchestral accompaniment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must , if your intestines are seriously constipated","review":"I bought this record because of a *feral* advice from a friend of mine, that now I realize needs badly some rest, some clean air and healthy food. This record is a miracle. At least, I deem a prodigiuos event to compress such a huge amount of tediousness on a so small plastic surface. A lot of wasted energy and a pompous monument to entropy in its most menacing and distressing notion. Buy it anyway, beacuse those poor boys needs badly both your money and a small sign of benevolence in order to be happy and keep on living.

But, after actually listening to it, it seems as though Metallica actually improved some of their songs. \\"One\\" and \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" accompanied by this orchestra were even better than the original versions.However, some of the songs that were selected weren't, in my opinion, the right songs. Case in point: \\"Bleeding Me\\" over \\"Damage Inc.\\" or \\"Ride the Lightning?\\" What? No offense, but \\"Bleeding Me\\" sucked. What about \\"Devil's Dance\\" over \\"Fade to Black\\"? That too was a poor choice. Not saying \\"Devil's Dance\\" is not a good song, I just feel like it is innappropraite for this album. Also, \\"Outlaw Torn\\" and \\"Until it Sleeps\\"?

It starts sounding baaaad. Low crunchy guitars do not compliment violins, cellos, flutes, ect. The orchistra instruments must screach and wail to compete with Metallica's crash-bang-grunt playing style. I promise you, you will be SICK TO YOUR STOMACH about 3-4 songs in.

I am a big fan of metallica and have all their albums, but this one is a BIG disappointment. Why? Well let me tell you. The orchestra which supposed to be making stuff nicer etc. are F^&%# it up. The overall impression is chaos. Lots of times you hear shrieking violins and tooting trumpets when you least expect it and want to hear it. Even the unbreakable \\"One\\" was ruined.

Yes, I'm sure anything sounds great when you have a orchestra of highly skilled REAL musicians backing you. I wasn't fooled by this effort by Metallica to get my money. This band hasn't evolved the right way. They've turned into a group of pansies. I wish I could use a more vulgar term for them. And, oh yeah, don't download this music illegally or Lars will sue you.

I think based on all the reviews it's quite obvious....","review":"I am 33 years old and have listened to Metallica ever since I saw them in the battle of the bands in LA at the PVA (Pomona Valley Auditorium) in around 1982-83 (I think?) I have every single album they have ever produced. BUT this album is my FAVORITE! That's right. MY FAVORITE! (Right next to Ride the Lightning and the Black Album) There is a reason for this. The absolute skill of Hetfield, the way he is able to weave the music of the Orchestra together with the pounding of Metallica. I get chills just thinking about it..... BUY THIS ALBUM!Oh and don't listen to people who say that Metallica has sold out.... Metallica just grown up. People who say that Metallica has sold out are just afraid of growing up..... :-P The sign of a mature group is the ability to branch out and still sound F**KING FANTASTIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Metallica's best albums ever!","review":"Metallica has done it again! Another great album to make any fan coming back for more in the months to come. Joining Metallica is the San Francisco orchestra that not only makes the sound unique, but the composing but Micheal Kamen is exceptional. This album is live from California and you will notice that the fans get into the music from beginning to end. By far, one of my favorites from Metallica. Great work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but not the best out of symphony/rock crossovers","review":"First off, let me tell you that I am a metal head in the purist sense of the word. Metallica have not released a metal album since their self-titled, which isn't bad, I'd just like to state that. This album is ok, the reason I say it's only ok is because most song on this album loose their original feel with the way James sings and with the orchestra added. It gives the old songs a different feel. My favorite on the track is 'Battery'. Now, if you want to check out some Real symphonic metal, go listen to Therion's previous release, Vovin. Symphonic metal with full opera vocals. Those boys know how to do it right, and have been doing it years before Metallica even thought about it. There are also quite a few black metal bands that do the symphonic metal thing, but chances are, if you're a fan of 'new' Metallica, you're not going to like black metal (the most extreme music on the planet)."},{"rating":"2","title":"S&M not a sellout","review":"This new works by Metallica is amazing. The group joined with an orchastra and created a powerfuly emotional 2 cd set that will blow you away. Although this CD was beautiful and in some ways more mellow than your average metallica tracks, it is obvios who this group is. The CD's let you know that Metallica has not dissapeared and is definatly NOT a sell-out. I was swept away by the power of this hevey metal set with an orchastra. Definatly a must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money ..","review":"... and don't waste your time.Metallica are lost. They don't have new ideas to offer and this is a MISTAKE.

The idea of symphony and metal is pretty good, but it is not adequately represented in either of these two CDs. Hearing my favorite songs mangled by Hetfield's quickly turning geriatric voice far from impresses me, and it seems that the classical side of the music is just an accompaniment. If the classical part of the music were just taken out, then there would be little difference. The long and short of it: unless you want to hear Hetfield moan like an 80 year old into the mic, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now it's a sell out!","review":"I quess people don't remember this band in the 80's. They were thrash metal with 8 minute songs. Then the 90's came and they shortened their songs to get some airplay. That was fine, the music was good and they still rocked. Then they cut their hair in the mid 90's and people said they were selling out, I thought they had alot of balls to do that. But now they have gone as far as playing with an orchestra, this is a sell out and their is no doubt about it. When I listen to this it only makes me laugh. I think I will put on my Backstreet Boys CD(kidding), at least they were selling out from the beginning. Pick up their earlier stuff and just forget about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute crap","review":"the sound quality in this is attrocious.

I bought S&M because I wanted to expand my Metallica collection, but was I surprised at how terrific this CD is. The arrangements are excellent. It's not like some rock/symphony albums, where the orchestra simply sits in the background and tries to whine along above the electric guitars. This is a real blending of sound, almost like the songs were written to be played this way. The CD presents a continuous flow of aural gymnastics, much more like one long \\"rockera\\" than like a dozen separate songs. I put this thing in the car CD player at the beginning of my morning commute, and it's like I get a mental massage all the way to work.

Where some of the Metallica songs started to get bland or the same, the orchestra just creates such a particular sound that it sounds sooooo much better. It has all of the greats from some of the older stuff as well as some new songs. The only drawback I did notice was on the back of the cd. It lists the songs with only part of their name, this was a little misleading when purchasing from a store. Other than that, this cd is a must-have for anyone that has ever heard any Metallica. Even if you havent, this cd is for anyone with a need for metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking risks - again!","review":"I suppose it was a logical things for Metallica to do, given that they've been trying unusual things and taking risks since \\"Load\\" - basically doing anything but the usual things expected from a testosterone heavy metal band.This is a great album - not because it tries to get metal-heads to \\"listen to some real music\\" or foist some kind of metal-cred on the symphony guys, but because this lot obviously rehearsed and worked out some damn good arrangements that (shock!horror! ) actually enhance the power and weight of some of Metallica's best songs.Very interesting, very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE METALLICA THRILL","review":"THIS IS THE FINEST LIVE PERFORMANCE FROM METALLCA TO ME.

BUT, they excluded the one song that SHOULD have made it on the list Michael Kamen compiled for the album. How did \\"The Unforgiven\\" not make it onto that list? Was it that Kamen couldn't get it to sound right, or did it just slip his mind.But before I go, I'll tell you what's right with this album. The sound quality of both Metallica & the Orchestra are phenomenal! The way the 2 sounds blend together are, well, fanastic! \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" does do Cliff Burton justice. However, they could have left \\"Enter Sandman\\" off of the final product. Still, \\"The Unforgiven\\" would have made this all the more worthwile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I really REALLY love this cd.

I love how they re-did the songs (expect for enter sandman, they should just not mess with a good thing on that one, but hey, it's still a good cd even if i like the orriginal recording of that song better). Every Metallica fan is going to dislike one song on this album becuase they dont like how they re-did it. The cd is a little lighter (not by a whole lot, but u know they pull back a little so u can hear the symphony sometimes) but it is still very thudding when played loudly in my car. It is wonderful driving muzic, musical and yet loud, my favoirite kind of driving music.

All the songs sound great here and the fact that they used a syphany is just awesome, I dont care what people say that isnt selling out, thats just plain brilliant!

I know there's a lot of people out there who love this album(my friend for instance,but he's just weird)and maybe someday if i listen to it enough i will aswell.but i doubt it.If you dont have any metallica albums,i suggest you buy,self titled,or master of puppets.but stay well clear of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"METAL with CLASSICAL? WHAT THE HELL?","review":"I have been a Metallica Fan from the beginning. I stuck with them through thier genre changes. From 'Fast Thrash', to 'Slow Metal', to 'Hard Metal', Metallica have remained the MASTERS! So when a band as high up as Metallica are, why mix your hard, head banging, riffs, with poncy slow violins and chellos. The legendary loud sounds of 'Enter Sandman' and others are drowned by the slow harmony of the orchastra. It doesn't sound good. It's softened the hard element which we all no and love of Metallica. Advice boys.....Don't ever do it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"In this \\"effort\\" they have moved far from their primal metal roots and tried to become something they're not--symphonic. While Metallica is an awesome band, this just isn't Metallica. Metallica died after the black album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unholy alliance gone horribly wrong","review":"While isolated pockets of resistance whine about the downfall of Metallica, I feel a need to chastise the SF Symphony for letting these amped-up headbangers share their stage. Whoever conceived the idea of rudely jamming two diametrically opposite musical groups together must be laughing pretty hard by now. Shame, SHAME on the SF Symphony for thinking they could get away with this. Stick to your classical roots, please. Even converting Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for violin, viola & orchestra into a duel between electric guitars would have been better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just when you thought Metallica could sink no lower.","review":"To have their early stuff butchered in this fashion makes me want to vomit.

With the orchestra, some songs are ruined, and some songs are improved. The orchestra doesn't really do much for \\"Battery\\", \\"Fuel\\", or the fast part of \\"One\\". On the other hand, the orchestra sounds excellent on songs like \\"The Call Of Ktulu\\", \\"The Memory Remains\\", \\"No Leaf Clover\\", and \\"Hero Of The Day\\". It makes those songs sound a lot darker. I didn't like the Load or Re-Load cds, but the songs from those cds that are displayed here are improved from the studio versions. Bottom line: This is probably the best live recording they've done thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"SYMPHONIC GARBAGE","review":"First of all, it's clear we are dealing here with extremely gifted musicians. METALLICA needs no introduction at all and Michael Kamen is an expert in music: he has done soundtracks, rock albuns, all the stuff. So, why is this S&M so horrible ? My best explanation is this: I felt like I was listening to a Metallica album in my CD player in my room and, all of a sudden, somedoby started to listen to classic music in the room next door. What I mean is that the arragmetns are disconnected, it seems the band is pklaying one song and the orchestra another. There's no chemistry between them, the resulting music in annoying and boring. To listen how orchestra and rock can merge, listen to Scorpions' \\"MOMENT OF GLORY\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selloutica","review":"This band just makes me want to puke my guts out.They are such back stabbing, hypocritical sellouts,it makes me sick.This latest \\"album\\" is another flacid attempt to makemoney. Clearly, this band has no creative integrityleft. Furthermore, they have not had an original ideain years. They are creatively stagnant.Cliff Burton must be spinning in his grave. He must bejust as sickened as I am. Metallisellout are theyworst musical \\"traitors\\" in history. I hate them now.This band died with Cliff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible rip off and poorly executed to boot","review":"This is a joke right? I mean not only do they try to take credit for doing some thing new(which is a complete lie) but they did it poorly. They have no idea how to make classical and metal combine. This band is a joke and James vocals are way too loud considering he cant sing at all anyway. If you want good classical/metal please go buy Therion or newer Rage. These bands know what they are doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't do it for me","review":"I gotta say this cd just doesn't do it for me. I know this differs from the majority but man I would much rather listen to any of metallica's other work. The orchestra thing I thought was a cool idea but with the exception of maybe 3 songs it wasn't needed and was a disapointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Met + San Francisco Orchestra = Pretty interesting show","review":"This is definitely a different approach by Metallica and any metal band for that matter. I absolutely love Metallica and yes I do own this title however if you really knew Metallica and loved their heavy stuff, this won't do it for you. While I only give it 2 stars, I really think that its a descent live show. I wish they would have had more than just 2 new tunes to offer up here. Pretty cool hearing some of the older Met tunes with the symphony behind them. Its not a terrible album and it may grow on me, but it does seem kind of gimmicky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica can go BLOW their own trumpets!!","review":"So many others worked hard to create a subtle blend of hard metal riffs and smooth classical sounds over the years. \\"Ride the Lightning\\" demonstrates that Metallica too had been inspired and mixed classical guitar to COMPLIMENT songs like \\"Fade to Black.\\" Now, they have pathetically used every single orchestral sound they could get and have successfully OVERWHELMED and drowned out their songs. Truly a sickening and twisted sound that will make you cover your ears! What's worse is that they are so full of themselves that they now try to force people to belive that they are the originators of this concept.Furthermore, it seems metallica has sold out in more than one way. Has anyone noticed how \\"girly\\" and weak James' voice sounds on this CD? Hmmnnnn... I wonder..."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZING...","review":"Metallica has merits. They achieved an outstanding position in rock, one achieved by mega stars like Stones, Madonna and Michael Jackson. THat position is being capable of releasing garbage after garbage and still sell millions, thanks to their fans loyalty (or blindness, call it what you want.) Congratulations, Hetfield and Ulrich. Thanks God Newsted left this false metal band forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain stupid","review":"I suppose if you \\"love everything Metallica does\\" you'd buy it if they had a bunch of zoo animals on stage braying while they ruin their classics. A symphony is simply too complicated and delicate for metal, period. The album starts off in an interesting way, but as soon as the distortion kicks in all you hear of the symphony is an occasional wail of violins in the quieter patches. I've wanted a good Metallica live set for years, but this is a joke. I agree with the other reviewer, at this rate we'll have Kenny G replacing the lead guitar on Master of Puppets. By all means, spend your money replacing those worn out tapes and scratched up cd's of the classic Metallica stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"hYPED","review":"I am very disappointed in this CD. It contains stuff which I personaly heard to too many times performed live. Same old and not very exciting stuff. The even had the nerve to put Devils Dance on it and the memory remains. Why did they even think of those? I really hate those tracks. Reload is the only album I don't have. The singing is not very strong either. James leaves the burden of singing to the audience. (geez!) The should have used tracks which are better suited for an orchestra. The band is playing their same old while the orchestra is constantly trying to show their presence which I don't feel is adding value to it all. Why did they even allow audience to the set? Which leads to the question why didn't tape it in the studio. I suspect the guys where a bit too lazy for that. If they did there wasn't a excuse left for producing a overbloated album."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all don't have to like it...","review":"Although it's been done before, there is no problem with it being done again. If the idea keeps being repeated, it must be working, and in this album, it does.BEAUTIFUL is a word that almost does it justice. The music is so big, and the juxtapostion of soft and hard is interesting and at times breathtaking.But like I say, So What? Who cares if it's been done before.My favorites are The Memory Remains, Call of the Ktulu, No Leaf Clover, Nothing Else MattersBuy the CD, you have nothing to lose except a bit of money but you have the opportunity to gain 2 CDs of quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"All about the Lyrics","review":"If you were to walk into ANY mall in Southern California and started to play ANY Metallica song, I promise you that atleast half of the people will start to song along. So what do I have to say about Metallica? Well Just that, They are the best band EVER! (everyone knows that they could beat the livng hell out of the beatles!) And this is their best Album (and if you don't like the Symphony in the mix, then all oyu have to do is buy the DVD vision and it allows you to take out the music from either the Band or the symphony.) They have most of their best songs on the album plus two new ones (Minus Human and No Leaf clover, both really good songs) And in my opinon the symphony expands a fills in Metallica's songs with sounds you never hear in Rock.It's a must have Album.."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Metallica is simply amazing. They have conquered thrash metal, are slowly gaining ground in alternative metal, if there is such a thing, and now have totally conquered orchestral metal. Now I know that orchestral metal sounds like an oxymoron, but after hearing S&M, I know that it exists. This cd is breathtaking. Plain and simple. Metallica takes the listener on a journey through, to quote Jason from the video/dvd, melancholy dementia. Never has a harpsichord sounded so heavy. Buy these cd's, and prepare to be blown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica Rocks Rocks Again","review":"What can i say about Metallica they are the best heavy metal group on earth.

A must by for everyone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This album is even better than I expected. This record contains many great songs I already love plus some new cuts that are quickly growing on me. The orchestra adds a new, haunting sound to already excellent songs.Altough they are amazing throughout the entire album the orhestra's talent really stands out in Call of the Ktulu from the Ride the Lightning album. The two new tracks, No Leaf Clover and Human, will satisfy any Metalica fan's hungar. Simply, Michael Kamen and the boys from Metallica made an amazing record, and that's that.

If you love musicals then see this, but even if musicals aren't your thing, see it anyway! Best bits are when Milly's (Jane Powell) teaching the boys to 'court' and dance, and the barn raising dance.

With today's technology, you would think that someone might have struck an anamorphic edition that would expand beyond the realm of 4x3 TV. The color was washed out, there was no dynamics in the sound, and the print looked almost as if no one bothered to look at the negative before it was transferred. I could feel the dirt falling off of the disc. (My old laserdisc edition looked better than this copy). In short, \\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\\"is a great musical that deserves a restoration before the transfer.

The singing and dancing are super.But.This particular print or transfer is sub-par. Most of the time it looks faded and washed out but then it will suddenly display a full rich deep image.

The screenplay manages to be historically accurate and politically correct! This is easily Stanley Donen's masterpiece as sole director. It stands up so well.

But well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this single","review":"I love the band and saw this single on sale for just over a dollar, so I decided to take a chance. The a-side is the exact same, minute-long track featured on the debut album. The title of the b-side implies that it might be a demo or early version of \\"Let's Get Sandy.\\" In fact, it's just the male members of the band doing an improvised rap over a rudimentary hip-hop beat. It's the kind of goof that never should have been released, even as the b-side to an obscure single. No reason to pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken Hope's \\"Loathing\\" is a triumph for brutality","review":"Make no mistake about it, this album contains some of the heaviest riffs and complex song-writing ever recorded. If you've pre-judged Broken Hope by their rather juvenile \\"Swamped in Gore\\" and \\"Bowels of \\"Repugnance,\\" think again, because this album delivers the goods in spades. Following up their powerful \\"Repulsive Conception,\\" the lead section of Brian Griffin and Jeremy Wagner stir up the pit with wicked songs like \\"Siamese Screams\\" and \\"Skin is In.\\" This CD sports ball-smashing production, gut-wrenchinly low vocals, and Wagner's disturbing, yet thought-provoking lyrics touching on subjects ranging from maniacal delusions of Godliness (I Am God) to incestuous necrophiles (Reunited). This CD might serve as a slower, equally-brutal companion piece to Cannibal Corpse's \\"Tomb of the Mutilated.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"makes you think harder","review":"broken hope helps you to concentrate. you have to to hear what they are saying. the guitar is supersonic and the drumming sounds like a jackhammer."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow, boring, and pointless...","review":"...this music drags along aimlessly without any point, and is no more \\"brutal\\" than any other death cd out there.

After this, you could go onto another book written by Watts called \\"The Way of Zen\\". This book was pretty easy to understand and doesn't go into anything that is too confusing. It's a quick read though, so I don't think I'd recommend buying the $30 version. I picked mine up at a used book store for much less than half that. Not one of my favorites of books that Watts has wrote, but he wasn't as wise as he was in his later years. Overall pretty good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great book.","review":"Ever since Under the Tuscan Sun came out, anyone who has ever bought a house in another country decides to write a book!This one was not interesting, was very vague and seemed to be written my a mopey divorcee to add a few bucks to her coffers.She didn't really describe anyone in Finistere in a manner that would encourage me to travel there.

He loves Santanas music and I thought he might like to try his colonge as well.The ingredients seemed right on the money for his taste. He is in love!

Will purchase again.Also 10% goes toward his childrens charity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little sweet at first...","review":"For the price, I like this cologne. The closest comparison I can think of Thalium. A little too sweet smelling at first but after a few minutes it smells pretty good.

Thanks to the greatsmelling stranger, and to Amazon for the great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sweet, not masculine","review":"Being a huge fan of Carlos Santana, I had to try the cologne. The fragrance is much too sweet and blossom like. This is not a light cologne, so the strong statement is not a good one for me. It has a nice hint of musk and if the sweet smell was backed way off, I think it would be very nice. Sorry Carlos, I wish I could support you on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful family movie","review":"I saw this movie in the theatre and I simply loved it. The movie is very much family oriented and discusses some very real happenings in the life of a teenager especially in America. The teenager, young boy gets mixed up with the wrong company and starts copying their behavior. The young man starts drinking, disprespecting his mother and abusing the internet. His girlfriend and mother help him get on the right track by cultivating his interest in robotics. The director does a great job of capturing these moments on screen. The movie may not be your big budget hollywood movie, but it captures most of the intricicacies, emotions and troubles that teenagers go through. This movie is a must watch, I have already ordered my copy on Amazon, waiting for it to be delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pursuit Of The Mountain Man","review":"Good and enjoyable reading. I like the Smoke series and this another one. When a German Count wants sport he decides to track down and kill Smoke Jensen. If you have read others of these books you will know that when you start trouble with Smoke you really have trouble. Moves along and characters are well done. I enjoy not only the stories but the thought that right wins out in the end. I think this writer says a lot that us older folks and even younger people should think about and then learn that if you are right stand up for yourself. Smoke is a man, that fights for what he beleives in. In todays world we have forgotten what our ancestors fought and died for. This makes me think and what more could you ask of any author?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAP Has Become Old","review":"BAP is a German band singing in Kölsch which is the dialect spoken in Cologne (yes, where your eau de cologne was invented).'Aff Un Zo' might be better than its highly disappointing predecessor... but it remains clear that BAP's best times are past times.The album has nothing particular to show. OK, there is hearworthy uncomplicated rock'n'roll on 'Eddie's Radio Show' and 'Die Moritat Vun Jan Un Griet', and simple BAP pop on 'Souvenirs' - but originality is only heard on 'Mau Mau' with its cruchy guitar.The instrumentation of 'Istanbul' is really beautiful but lead singer and band boss Wolfgang Niedecken sounds old, and even though the album's title song is quite OK, it gives the impression of grandparent party. 'Noh Zahle Mohle' is directly bad.All in all there's little to recommend about 'Aff Un Zo', from some (irjenden) rock'n'roll band which surely has put its best days behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference work","review":"This little book is an outstanding reference book for anyone interested in identifying the various stone points found through out PE NYS and northeastern North America. Very well illustrated. Excellent descriptions. People wanting to ID NYS points will be hard pressed to find a more compact resorse. The book is small enough to be taken and used afield by those fortunate enough to have such need. Unfortunatly the quality of production does not match the quality of content. From the first opening the spine broke loose and loose pages began to fall out. The inferior production quality is the only thing preventing me from giving this wonderful little book a solid 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell apart!","review":"i want to preface this review as nothing negative about Ritchie's work. he is recognized as an essential author to anybody who studies or works in archaeology in new york state. the negative review has to do with the publishing company and their poor standards of how a book should physically be put together.i work in archaeology so i was hoping to use this book, as many do, as a field reference guide. unfortunately before even taking it into the field i realized that this book wasn't going to survive very long sitting on a book shelf let alone being used in the field. the very first time i opened the book the binding gave up and pages started falling out left and right. i ended up putting a comb binding on the book just to make it usable. so if you're buying this version just be aware that there may be some assembly required."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make Money with your Studio","review":"I using this book for a school project and find it to be an excellent resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple step-by-step guide","review":"This is a simple English step-by-step guide to new recording studio owners.

I'm disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow swinger","review":"We have had this swing/glider for 6 weeks and it has been a life saver for our now six week old daughter who will not sleep in her crib. The reason I am giving it such a poor score is that the swing does not seem to have any power even though it is plugged in to an outlet. My daughter is only 9 pounds and the swing/glider only moves about 3 inches back and forth and the speed dial does not change anything. It used to work well, so I don't know what the problem is now.

I like the gliding option, which was more suitable for my tiny baby. He loves it and never gets bored of it. It does a wonderful job putting him to sleep. I also like the plug-in system, you don't have to worry about batteries or their cost. The music is quite soothing as well. Sometimes I put my baby to bed and he won't sleep, so I just play the music for him, and he immediately stops crying!

From the beginning it is nearly incoherent. There is no real introduction of characters (and characters are invented for a single page then dropped). There's no scale. After the dated entries I could never be sure what century it was placed in. And it jumps from a personal journal to a robot to a random human hundreds of years in the future to... well, I can't even describe the finale. The tectonic plates are *spoiler* sentient? Planets are dolphins?In short, Avoid this book at all costs. Not worth the read.

How disappointing it was to find that most of the themes on this CD were not complete but instead snippets that last 1 minute (give or take 5-15 seconds or so). And the sound quality on some of these sounds like someone put a cassette recorder up to a TV to capture the song. Not what I wanted when paying $30 bucks.This CD would be a good buy at $10 bucks or less. Any more and you are getting robbed.

However Marie Borroff's amazing translation adds that beauty and eloquence which only a master translator can produce. Borroff uses an alliterative meter which will get you tongue tied if you try and read it out loud. For example the first line is \\"Since the siege and the assault was ceased at Troy.\\" She also gives us beautiful rhymes at the end of each stanza, like in lines 1236-1240: \\"My body is here at hand,/ Your each wish to fulfill;/ Your servant to command/ I am, and shall be still/.\\" The story is full of symbolism, and confronts us with a tough philosophical question. You have to read the book to find out what that is however. The book also deals with the problems inherent in the institution of chivalry, and especially courtly love.

Within a few minutes there was another breakage at the end of the base.

Listening to this over the many miles was a great brain teaser, and stumped us for many of them. We could see the opening credits and scenes we remembered, but had so much fun trying to remembering these. We laughed like crazy when we figured them out, laughing with a long trip down memory lane.

Parenting: Part Joy, Part Guerrilla Warfare provides brief,sometimes inspirational, sometimes humorous and always true snipets of advice for those of us in the midst of this wonderful roller coaster of a ride known as parenting. I pick it up whenever I need a boost, a smile or assurance that indeed I am not the only person who experiences the joys and warfare of parenting. I intend to buy multiple copies to give as gifts. Every Parent should own this little gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about the current release","review":"Started using this book to set up win 2K-server. found that what the book showed and what I saw on the screen were two different things.

I am bringing it back to borders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just pretty pictures","review":"I bought this book because I like to see pictures of beautiful bridges, and I knew the author's reputation for great photography. However, there was a huge bonus -- the author's entertaining and informative stories behind the building of the important and/or beautiful bridges. Some parts of the descriptions could be dry at times but it is easy to skip to the next paragraph if you fell like you're getting bogged down. He also devotes time to why the bridge was important in the development of bridge architecture. Plus, you'll get stories about the people who designed and built the bridges. The author clearly has a love affair with this form of architecture -- he sees the art as well as the functionality aspects of b ridge building. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful movie!","review":"In this movie, a Cuban-American woman learns to love Cuban men and Cuban culture. I liked that this movie promoted embracing one's heritage. However, that's where the good stuff stops. The acting in this flick is TERRIBLE! The actors had no timing whatsoever. The romance is rushed. The male love interest has such a perfect jaw that it obviously must be a result of cosmetic surgery. It should be stressed that this movie promoted cultural pride, not racial pride. All the Cubans in this film are white. All the Black and mixed Cubans, both in the US and on the island, are totally absent. I find this incredibly problematic. Some of the subtitles on the DVD are mistranslated or spelled wrong. Further, at a time when one out of every three Latinos marries an Anglo, I'm surprised this film was made. I'm not sure how people in multiracial families or interracial couples will feel about this piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product and unexpectedly fast delivery","review":"I ordered this product and received it the very next morning. This fast turnaround was unexpected since I had not paid for any special urgent delivery.The product works fantastic. I've used it to digitize videos from my analog camcorder and also from VHS tapes created back in the early 90s on an old camcorder. The quality of the newer camcorder video is superb (no surprise). However, the quality of the old VHS video and sound seems to be enhanced (perhaps by the ADVC-55 A/D converter and/or by the Microsoft Movie Maker I used to edit the video) and is better than when viewing it on the VHS recorder. There is no flicker - no image capture problems, etc. I've not experienced any of the difficulties transfering old videos to my computer that some of the reviews have alluded to. I couldn't be happier with the product or the shipping response time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Purchase If You Use 9-pin Firewire","review":"I purchased this product from Amazon for use with my new iMac. The ADVC-55 uses 6-pin firewire and my iMac uses 9-pin. When I contacted Grass Valley Technical Support they stated that they do not support/recommend 9-pin firewire use with the ADVC-55. They stated that some users have had success using a Belkin 9-pin to 6-pin cable, but others have not. I was told that I should return the ADVC-55 and purchase the ADVCMini - which is specifically designed to be used with a Mac via USB. So I returned the 55 and bought the mini. Great return experience with Amazon! When I received the mini it had a sync issue (video didn't match audio). Grass Valley Technical Support couldn't solve the problem and suggested that I purchase a product from another vendor. When I visited an Apple store this past weekend, the sales person recommended an Elgato product over the ADVCmini - both were available at the store. Based on these experiences, I can not recommend Grass Valley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canopus ADVC-55","review":"Bought the Canopus ADVC-55 to transfer old VCR tapes before they degrade further.

I would suggest using the S-Video for transfers if you can, since you will get a better result. With the iMac you do not need the optional power supply for the unit. However, the iMac 27\\" 2011 computer does not have a Firewire 400 port, so you will need an adapter. I suggest the elago Firewire 400 to 800 Adapter for Mac.

She gets very little, much-needed relaxation when a local EPA person who was about to release a report okaying the dumping of sewage in the town's favorite fishing hole, suddenly disappears. Believe me, it just gets crazier from there on. The town is populated with a ton of wacky locals who add charm and humor to the intriguing mystery. The ending is completely madcap and wonderfully entertaining.

We just thought it was because she put make up on that day so she washed her face off. Well the next day her faces was covered in bumps and red and puffy. Not to mention it was itching and she felt like her face was on fire. She even got sick. Not sure if it was from her red inflamed face but DONT try it.

Maybe this product is only for people with severe acne. I didn't see a distinction on the box so I thought I would try it as a cleanser for occasional breakouts. I used all three products one night. That night my skin felt amazing! It was soft and smooth and felt clean. The next morning I woke up with a bit of irritation above my lip (below my nose). I figured I was just getting used to a new product and decided not to use it that night. The next day, I woke up with what I can only assume is chemical burn all over my face!

The disclaimer on the package tells the consumer that the product is sold by weight and not volume and that some settling may occur in shipping and handling (really? It's a powder, people. How much \\"settling\\" can there be?) This tells me that they have probably had complaints about this in the past and their legal department created the disclaimer. Either that or they knew it was deceptive from the beginning. I can just picture some marketing genius telling management that by making the container larger, but putting less product inside, they will increase their shelf footprint and visibility, and minimize their product cost while betting that the American consumer is too stupid to notice that the unit cost per oz. is way higher than competitors. Personally, I resent the insult to our intelligence and refuse to buy this product.

Looking forward to the follow up book."},{"rating":"2","title":"21st century Hemingway","review":"DeDakis has, like his predecessor, \\"embraced all human experience, the conflict of life itself\\" in this book -- love, deceit, fear, anxiety, anger, embarrassment, insecurity, there is little that every reader cannot identify with in one way or another.

Tightly written and a total pageturner! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Summer Reading","review":"John DeDakis's Fast Track is a smart \\"whodunnit\\" that starts quickly and clips along. It's a murder mystery relying more on plot and relationships than theatrics and gore. The use of first-person perspective is an interesting approach that allows the reader to feel more connected to the characters than a detached third-person would. Fast Track uses suspense, place, and time to develop this story. I recommend adding Fast Track to this summer's reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives New Meaning to \\"Rotten\\"","review":"Have the tapes, which were \\"free\\" at a library sale.

And most likely better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, tedious, incredulous and predictable","review":"If you like Ed BcBain novels, don't listen to this early one. I did so on BOT and if I hadn't already enjoyed some of his later ones,I would NEVER have read another . There are lists and lists and lists. The segment regarding stolen goods states what items are on each table....which lasted over 1 mile of walk/listen time. Most sentences come in pairs and the second repeats up to 50% of the words in the preceding one. Each character is a stereotype. There are flashbacks to Viet Nam ... which have no relation to the story at hand, even by a long and generous stretch. The elements of a McBain story are there. They just don't connect."},{"rating":"2","title":"good camcorder, but","review":"The scl860 is good camcorder, but viewfinder has no color.

This book also describes the days before the beginning of the Civil War. The characters are deep, if not a tad melodramtic. It is refreshing to see a female character in a \\"war story\\".The book's strength is in its description of events in the beginning of the Civil War. Another ineteresting theme is the anguish and confusion of the officers as they deteermine their loyalties. A final strength is Mr. Poyer's technical detail of both steam and wind propulsion.Overall, an excellent sea yarn about an obscure subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done! But not a book for everyone","review":"If you know Bernard Cornwell and Richard Sharpe, and if you know Patrick O'Brian and James Aubrey, then you'll really like and appreciate this book. If you quickly consume Clancy books, you'll like this book. But, if you're not comfortable making sense out of old dialect and historical references, then stay away.Poyer's skills have grown in such interesting ways. His first books were technothrillers with a tiresome \\"crazy captain\\" theme. (Gimme a break, Dave!) But he has expanded in awesome style.

I also like the luffa bits in this soap.What has happened to triple-milled, tea-rose, soaps? I have been unable to find any for, at least, a couple of years. They are all diluted with other scents added.

I don't recommend buying this soap from Dudur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing soap. Just love it!","review":"I have tried so many different soaps from store bought to organic, and this is by far one of the best soaps I have ever used. It leaves your skin feeling very soft and clean. There is no grimy residue left behind on your skin like some soaps tend to leave. It has a very rich lather similar to using a loofah and body wash, and the scent is amazing!Definitely a great soap for the following reasons: 1) doesn't dry out your skin, 2) skin feels clean and smooth, 3) smells great, 4) great lather."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent reference for pcb designers","review":"Full of practical design guides such as PCB Stackup, 3W rule, 20H rule, air discharge ESD protection, and ground plan & layout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book!","review":"A friend gave me this book to read, and it took me about a month to actually find time to open it up.

I would have read the whole thing in one sitting, if I didn't have other responsibilities. As it was I read it in 2 sittings, the same day.The legend of Katy's Church is a local legend. Flick takes an entirely different approach, but thoroughly fascinating.I originally purchased the book thinking that my 12-year-old history buff would like it. I'm glad I read it first.

These had much better color, a darker green that is fairly well represented in the picture. The clarity was poor (I don't expect diamond like clarity), so they really didn't sparkle. I'm guessing these could have benefited from a treatment of some sort. As Emeralds are in huge demand now, getting a good quality stone is very expensive.

What I really love about her story is its truth. There is no self-pity. Even when she says \\"this [stinks], I wonder if I can make,\\" she just plows ahead.The story is accessible and never maudlin even when it is grim. And there is plenty of humor and adventure to pull the reader through the tight little chapters.This story is the real deal--a great read, a compelling story, and a few lessons along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating.","review":"I was totally captivated by this book, which will stay with me. Susan's Parker life was turned upside down when her husband had a bad accident which paralyzed him from the shoulders down. This book is vignettes of her life since. Her writing reminds me of funny adventure travel writers like Tim Cahill, Pico Iyer, Bill Bryson and Doug Lansky. Her journey is not to a foreign land, but her life with a quadraplegic in Oakland, might as well be. Her description of how she built and found a new life is captivating, funny and moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"unflinchingly honest","review":"i loved this book and read it cover to cover in one sitting. susan parker is fearless. fearless in the way she faces her life and fearless in how she writes about it. this is a love story and a story of survival. it's poignant and at times it is laugh out loud funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read this book some time ago","review":"I really love the genre memoir when it catches me and absorbs me.

It's dated with poor film quality and bad acting. But I love it. The music, altho scratchy, is unique and builds off the visuals. The action is good - very good. Chuck has an excellent moustache and the supporting actors do their part. The moral of the tale is difficult to figure out at best, but you can feel the message even if you can't describe it. In my opinion, this film is (along with its runner-up, \\"Night of The Juggler\\") the Holy Grail of action B-movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Early And Lesser Norris Effort","review":"Good Guys Wear Black was the first major film starring Chuck Norris, who came to fame as Bruce Lee's deadly opponent in Return of The Dragon. Norris began his starring career in a ripoff of the CB radio crzae called Breaker, Breaker.But Good Guys Wear Black is his first major effort, and while it's not the worst he's made, it's not the best. This tale of an ex- Special Ops commander whose Vietnam unit members are being killed off is okay in places, and laughably bad in others. The dialogue in some spots is bad enough to make you pause and rewind just to make sure you heard it correctly. The highlight of the movie is the great stunt where Norris jumps through a windshield to get at a would-be assassin, but that alone is not worth the effort to see this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Guys Wear Black","review":"A Special Forces unit gets sent into North Vietnam to rescue some POW's. The unit is setup but a few manage to escape the ambush and survive. Five years later the remaining survivors are targeted for termination one by one.

The scene is at midnight and you don't get to see the action soo clearly, besides, Chuck Norris is not the one-man-army in that scene.The rest of the action scenes were SOOO SHORT!! You don't get excited enought! you think that the action is gonna go on, but NOOOT!! it QUICKLY stops to hear more blah,blah,blah!For Chuck Norris fans maybe this movie is worth watching it, but for those who want the \\"Missing in Action\\" style then search somewere else.Adios."},{"rating":"1","title":"CORNY CHUCKY AGAIN~!!","review":"I do not like CHUCKY.

They can discover everything except the obvious. -- Oscar WildeThe plot is about Lady Winderemere who goes from being a pillar of Victorian society to a woman of wandering morals. The woman who pulls her up is the one she suspected of being her husband's mistress. It's a comedy of society manners and morals with acerbic repartees and funny quips, in the great Oscar Wilde tradition.Now, more than 100 years later, it still has a thought provoking depth which is very much applicable to today's society as well, although we view such adventures with less criticism and more understanding.A wonderful comedy with all the wryness of Wilde."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version is 5 pages long; don't bother","review":"As much as it pains me to give a Wilde play one star, it had to be done.

The range of material is amazing, from works predating the Venerable Bede to Madeline L'Engle's plea to God to learn how to pray, written as she rode a New York City bus.I found this to be a beautiful collection of value to anyone interested in Christian thought and prayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"This man is a true talent and such a joy to listen to.

Looking at the back cover of the book you also see the photographer holding the heads of her subjects which also feels demeaning to the Japanese men portrayed in the picture: Japanese are not very touchy and touching ones head is generally not a good thing in most Asian cultures: the impression is of a woman and her two dogs. Not nice.Later in the book you find the photographs blurry and the picture text very poor: you could have filled these huge pages with a lot of informative and captivating text about Japanese tattoo and culture.

It's like what Wole Soyinka said about it, the book makes new gods to replace the old ones which have been destroyed. Armah's at his best when launching into poetical observation and instruction (e.g. the beginning of Chapter 7). His narrative flow gets a bit bogged down with the stylization, and that makes it drag from time to time. But this isn't a book about plot or character, really: it's a social history and a vision of a future based on a reinterpretation of the past.

The improvement that would be nice to see for the longer gate (5 FT) would be a support block since the span is longer. With the shorter gate (3FT) this is not as much of a concern. Also, since the gate is an expansion gate, it has give and is flexible. If your dog tends to hang on the gate with her fronts paws, it will sag.

Apparently, they no longer make the beefy ones with large members, and large gaps between the wooden slats (presumably because of tougher building codes that require smaller gaps to prevent a child's head from getting caught?). No matter, this lighter gauge gate does the job reasonably well for being built of small dimension hardwood. Installation is simple (as in the old days), function is flawless, and if you use it AS INSTRUCTED, it should provide reasonably dependable service.

I have it mounted at the top of my stairs to keep my dog from going down. My dog is extremely well-behaved, so any barrier will do, as he is not the type to push through. With persistence, a more aggressive pet or child might be able to get past this.I like the mounting brackets for the gate, as it actually allows for the gate to swing open and closed like a regular door, but plan to use your own fasteners to install the brackets. The gate also collapses, accordion style, but it's just a tad stiff, which will probably ease up with use.Another review noted the latch on the gate is a little difficult to open and close and it isn't the best, but for the price this gate is still a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what we needed!","review":"This is the perfect solution for keeping our two small dogs out of the kitchen while we're working in the room.

I bought this CD specifically for the Captain Kangaroo theme, only to hear it being played on a synthesizer! And at a much faster tempo! Surely a recording of the original song actually used on the show exists somewhere! I have really enjoyed other CDs from TeeVee Tunes and was expecting more. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Record the Originals or Don't Bother!","review":"Most of these are re-renditions of the originals.

This CD deserves zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back great memories...!!!","review":"My husband and I loved this CD.. It brought back so many memories of when we were children, real young children. If you like to live in the past and hear the great TV shows you grew up with. I recommend then for you to buy it. Some are not the originals, but very close to them. They make there point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great nostalgia trip for the baby boom generation!","review":"Sure, the quality of various tracks leaves something to be desired, but to judge this album on technical merits is to miss the point: for us baby boomers, this is the ultimate trip back in time. All of the tracks are very listenable and the newer themes have great fidelity. It's one of the very few albums to make us wish there was more when it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT BILL","review":"I bought this book in 1995, saw you can write reviews, and I thought so much of this book couldn't resist. It is one of 'the books' to read on this band. I have read it twice from cover to cover as I not only enjoyed getting to know the guys on a personal level (especially Bono who I totally respect) but it is really funny, why the media portrays U2 as a band that takes themselves so seriously I would not know, they are guys with such a balanced view of the world knowing when to laugh and when to cry.

The point of view here is interesting and the writing smart. I just wish the book were more equally about all four band members (though I know Bono is his very own case study!) Even if you're not into biographies or rock music or both, this is a worthwhile read.

It has as many pictures as the Annuals, LOTS more text.I've spent many hours with the Annuals and I can say that had I had this book years ago I would have saved myself money and grief. It's amazing how many plants are not suited for Philly summers and are sold here nonetheless. I have thought for years I must have a genetic flaw, some disturbing lack that prevents me from growing decent dahlias. Armitage has assured me that it is not me, it is dahlias. That alone is worth the price of the book to me.So many people are discouraged and give up gardening entirely because they think they have black thumbs when really the problem is the sale of plant material unsuited their area.I work part time at an upscale nursery. Perrenials cost $15 and UP, annuals $5.00 for a 4\\" pot. A gardener at any level cannot afford to be without these books.Plus there are so many pretty pictures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SCISSORS DONT SPRING BACK RIGHT","review":"I bought these scissors for my 3 yr old who is having difficulty learning to cut because of hand strength issues. Her preschool teacher recommened getting some scissors similar to these. I ordered these because they have a spring back so after she squeezes to cut, she doesn't have the difficulty of opening the scissors to make a second cut. After using these scissors once, she now has to pull them open because the spring back function is not working. I am not overly happy with this product. I had high hopes but they failed to work the way we needed them to after the 1st use! Im not sure what brand the preschool used but theirs worked MUCH better than these! : ("},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Very disappointed with these scissors. I had them for only one week and used them 3 times to cut paper and noticed they were cutting funny. As I was holding the scissors up to look at the blade to see if it was bent or something, I squeezed the scissors and one of the blades came off. It looked like it just snapped off clean where the blade inserts into the handle. Not fixable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collage Artist finds new direction in SoulCollage","review":"I found this while searching for art books and discovered it was all about my current passion-collage(!) plus making a personal card deck, similar to Tarot-a long time interest of mine.

I often use it to help answer life's questions. Through SoulCollage I've met new friends and also assisted old friends in making their own cards.

I had heard the song \\"Holiness\\" before I bought it and I thought it reflected the rest of the album so I bought it. I was wrong. Micah's songwriting ability is bland and lyrically challenged.

This set will bring back some wonderful memories and it included some really obscure stuff. It is however missing some really cool stuff too.It's hard to complain when your getting so many commercials, but they are short and so many more could have been included. The sound quality is pretty good considering the source material hasn't been preserved all that well. I love to throw the cigarette commercials in the mix at a party!...they always raise a few eyebrows!Over all this set is not bad, but be prepared for some disappointments, as for some reason some of the really cool commercials aren't included.If you can find this at a reasonable price then buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alice says, \\"Not worth reading!\\"","review":"I did not like Aliens Don't Wear Braces at all.

It seems very safe, I hit the corners pretty hard myself and it really does absorb impact. Some of the kiddie safety stuff is so obvious in your house, I hate that. But most people don't even realize I have this on my fireplace, which is nice.The only complaint I have is that where the corners meet the guard, it has seperated a bit. I took special care to stretch and make sure I installed it correctly, but after a few days once the adhesive tape dried and the material settle dI guess, there is a small gap between the corner guards and the main strip. Nothing terrible, still looks nice, but it can be seen.Overall, a great product if you want to keep your toddler safe while not making your home look like a day care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad packaging","review":"As the rubber is a 90 Degree elbow shaped running for a 20 Ft, the company has rolled it to reduce the packaging size. the inner most loop of the rubber is having a lot of folds and it is making it difficult to stick to the edge of the table.

It's easy to install and we've had no problems with the edges coming off, yet. If they do, we'll just reapply or buy stronger double-sided tape. Also purchased the elastic padded bumber, but even the small was too big for our coffee table and I don't sew (as some reviews suggested). The foam edges have worked just fine. Great invention that give us piece of mind and our son added safety while he plays in the living room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"We have a wooden fouton in our living room that we use as a couch. I put this on all the edges and it is absolutley amazing. My 6 month old doesn't bang her legs when she scoots around near it, plus it helps mom's and dad's legs because the cushion keeps sliding off. The only thing I see wrong is that the sticky comes off. We've nailed it into our fouton because we plan on keeping it there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of cushion and adhesive","review":"The product comes with several strips of 3M double tape, which seems tp have a lot of strength.

I put this on my coffee table and tv stand to protect my child from the corners. As it says in the manual you can easily take it off and just wipe the leftovers with a wet cloth...That is not true at all.

After awhile it started to move and crumbs from my son started to accumalte. It would move and all sorts of stuff would stick to the edge. After a couple months i couldn't stand it and took it off. That is when all my grief began. It was next to impossible to get the adhesive off my table. They told me it would rub right off. I tried to use every method in the book. After a lot of elbow grease and Lots of goo gone i finally got it off. I do not recommend buying this product. It is more work than it is worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"i bought this product and i am very dissatisfied with it. i placed the foam on the edge of my coffee table, and without child pulling on it, it started coming up. on the back of the box it states that this product will not harm furniture, yet i am going to have to restain my coffee table because the stain is peeling up with the tape!!!!!! the double sided sticky tape doesnt stick well to the foam either. do not buy this product if you plan on using it on wood surfaces!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky Tape Not So Sticky","review":"We bought this product to protect our 9 month old from bumps and bruises.

I am going to purchase one of the expandable guards (I have one on my coffee table now and it works very well!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Adhesion","review":"This product does not adhere well. I have tried it on wood, metal, and painted surfaces. What's more, other \\"safety\\" products I have purchased that use well-known 3M tape were defective as well. Also, when I tried to remove the cushion, the tape removed my furniture paint. Overall, I rate this item with 2 stars because the neutral color does not attract my toddler's attention and the cushion does prevent painful head bumps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I put this on my coffee table and it works great. Seems pretty secure and there will be no split foreheads with this stuff on the edges!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, looks great","review":"This works great. It looks much better than the non-adhesive cushion and so far our 10 mo old daughter has not attempted to pull it off. She actually enjoys chewing it as if it is a teether and it doesn't even leave a mark (she has 2 teeth). It provides a lot of padding and most importantly to us it pads the corners of our tables greatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont use it","review":"most of the reviews I have read on this product describe the protection it provides which is good. When these writers try to remove the adhesive from their wooden tables-GOOD LUCK. It took me three days to clean off the residue left behind by the double stick tape. What a nightmare. I used oil, mayonnaise, scrapped and rubbed. Finally WD 40 worked the best. All these suggestions were from online help on removing this adhesive. The product does protect as explained and is definitely cushion enough to prevent major bumps and bruises but in the long run it is not worth it. I would have put my coffee table away until the toddler years were over if I knew what I had to go through to get my table back to its original surface. Would never suggest it, recommend it or buy it again!! I would give 1/2 star if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money!","review":"Good idea but this is very cheaply made... it is not sticky enough to stay on anything... my 6 month old baby would just yank it off immediately.

We endedup putting this on top of another cyclinder padding that was not working well.We cut strips to fit on top and side to support our disabled son's elbow ashe leaned on it. The strips are nice and cut easily to fit. We put it ontop and side and we were afraid the side one might come off due to thepressure of leaning constantly on it. We thought maybe leaning the elbow on it might tug at it too much. However, to date it is still holding!!!.This product is very soft, works well, very easy to put on and staysexceptionally well."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as they should but adhesive bond could do some improving","review":"i reviewed similar product from this company before. it is a good product which can absorb force well so all in all it serves it purpose well.One thing it can improve on is the adhesive glue used for bonding. Currently it uses 3M tapes, which is okay but over time a child's curiosity will grow they will pick on it and over a period of two months of picking it may come off. But they give you plenty of 3M tapes, so you can put it together again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective parts","review":"this looks like a good product and I ordered two of them but the double stick tape was dried out and impossible to use!

Our son just started walking & we wanted to protect him. It took a long time to cut the cushion to fit the table. Then, the adhesive that comes with the product is horrible. Eventually, our son was able to get the strips of cushion off that had not fallen off on their own. We are now seeking a new product (as well as a new coffee table since the wood finish was stripped off)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great on fake stone fireplace","review":"A lot of reviews say that the stickiness of the tape isn't that great, and it isn't- but so far it's not a problem. The guards are great because we have a fake stone fireplace so the edge is much more uneven than brick, but the guard works great. A definite for anyone with a fireplace and a squishy little handful of a baby :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!","review":"As many others have written this product is NOT safe for wood furniture. Whe we removed it it actually pulled the finish off of a brand new Crate and Barrell table we had. Using several different solvents, a nylon pot scraper, about two rolls of paper towels, and a LOT of elbow grease I was able to get the massive amount of remaining adhesive off without doing further damage. Although the company does include a short disclaimer about how they are not liable for damage to tables, elswhere in the packaging materials it clearly states that the product CAN be used on wood furniture. They even show the product on a wood table in their advertising! I can't state emphatically enough that this product WILL damage your table - only use it on wood furniture you don't care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY!!!!","review":"This product is absolutely terrible! The corners fell off repeatedly, without my son even touching them. The double stick tape does not really stick. Basically, the guards have become teething toys for my son.

Buy that one if you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the price","review":"It comes off easily, very expensive product, based in what you get.Definitely not worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More work than I expected, but the results I wanted","review":"I looked everywhere in the hardware store for something like this, but I couldn't find anything suitable. This is great, closed-cell high density foam that can blunt a very hard wack. The adhesive is a very nice foam mounting tape from 3M that has enough grip to be toddler-proof, but it could still be peeled off and repositioned without damaging anything. However, it came in a bunch of little strips, and each strip of mounting tape needed to be peeled off and applied to the foam bumper. Both sides of the corner need many strips applied. For a long run, this took a lot of peeling and sticking, and it was a bigger project than I thought it would be. It wasn't difficult, but I wish I just had the tape in a big roll, or a pre-applied tape on the bumper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel good having it around","review":"This edge and corner set is a great value. We started with just corners and found we missed a lot of other dangerous areas, including a knee-high tall toy chest with thick drawers. This set was perfect to secure the entire thing. It was easy to trim and apply. I prefer the gray to the chocolate for lighter woods. Its sort of a cement tan color. Its very dense foam, so if you press down pretty hard you still wont feel sharp edge. Good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined my table!","review":"This product did not work well. Both of my kids were able to easily rip the corner pieces off.

Do Not Buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product for the price!","review":"Easy to put up, takes a bit of time, but overall fairly easy! Wasn't too crazy about the type of adhesive that comes with it, but I look at it this way.... I'd rather re-finish my wood coffee tabble than deal with all the boo-boos and broken teeth it(my coffee table) has caused! (I have three kiddos and this coffee table has taken a tooth from two of them before they were 2yrs old) I'm hoping this protector will prevent that with my third little one! Personally I hate this coffee table, but my husband will not get rid of it... I put this protector on my fire place too, and it looks and feels wonderful. I like that it streches a bit, and I had plenty of adhesive left over!

First things first-I like the dark color, it doesn't look too weird against my espresso furniture. I came on here to read reviews about damaging the wood-and I see both good and bad reviews on that. Since I just got my coffee table three months ago I was a little hesitant about it. What if it ruins the finish when I take it off? So I kind of just held off on putting them on. Literally that same day my son lo and behold lost his balance and fell forward causing a big knot on his little forehead :( I did not waste any time COVERING every sharp corner and edge on my table. I figure...if it ruins the finish oh well. I will buy another table. My son's safety is more important than any peice of furniture. The foam is very cushiony. Easy to use. Not sure how well the tape will stay as we are on our second day with it on but....so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more headaches!","review":"Easy to use and not just for babies.

Our 6 month old is rolling and scooting and is especially interested in the table. He has bumped his head a few times already.The foam is of good quality and was very easy to install but the tape does not hold well at all. My baby was able to pull off the foam without any problem, exposing the sharp edges. I would think that there should be a stronger adhesive in order to keep the foam on to do what it is supposed to do. A safety product like this definitely should not be able to be removed so easily - especially not by a baby.I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too thrilled. . .","review":"I was pretty happy with this product at first. My son suffered stitches a few weeks ago after a run-in with our coffee table so I thought we'd try this. Only problem is he wants to rip it off & it comes off sooooo easily.

(with 2 boys!)","review":"I bought this set about 2 years ago! It has served us well. We used it on our kitchen table that is glass with sharpe edges, it works great! My very active two year old has finally removed one of the strips after a year of pulling it off (and us putting it back on!) We are now buying another set to replace the old. These edge guards have saved us many trips tot eh doctore! When he runs full speed and runs into the table, he just bounces right off, no harm done. I'm not sure what we would have done without it! So if you have a very active child, they may pull the guards off, but putting them back on takes 5 seconds and there is extra tape, so you can re-stick them if needed! Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful with this!!!","review":"While the idea of this is very good and indeed it did do it's job in covering edges, the adhesive doesn't do a very good job in keeping it on. The corner peices (which are the most necessary) come off very easily and one little tug by your child and the whole thing is off. What does NOT come off easily, however, is the adhesive from your TABLE! It says to \\"rub\\" it off, however all rubbing does is makes your fingers sticky. I ended up having to scrap it all off my table with my fingernail!

I wish there were a lot more of the premade corners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the munchkin or safety first table guards","review":"This brand of table guards has held on to the edge of our glass table much better than those mentioned above. It's softer and sticks much better using the enclosed tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Wasn't For Us","review":"I'm only giving this product two stars because it may work for someone with a baby who is still crawling, but once your child starts pulling up or walking the guards wont matter or last. My husband put them on the furniture when our daughter was asleep, thinking that she wouldn't notice them. Unfortunately, putting them on just gave her an extra something to chew on.The bad thing is that the double sided tape that comes with the guards is practically useless! Your child will be able to take them off. And to our horror, our daughter tried to eat them. We count it as a loss. Maybe if we buy our own double sided tape that's a little stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"I gave it only four stars because the item arrived with some of it missing,that was however resolved.The product does what it is supposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guards","review":"We got this to use on a nice looking storage box that would hold toys, and look like it was ment to be in the family room. The box is a bit taller than the typical toy box and has sharp corners. I thought we needed both edge guards and corner guards. But after putting on the corners, I found the foam padding was stronger and softer than I expected and now we have the Edge Guards to use elsewhere. Because of the length of the edge guards, even more uses may come from this. More money to spend on the baby and we all now how much they want/need."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good stuff!","review":"I was looking for some protective material to mostly cover a lot of corners, but didn't want to spend a lot of money.This stuff works great, I cut it up into about 1 inch pieces, put on a couple of pieces of the double adhesive tape, and then put it onto a corner. While you get a few corner pieces with the kit, this way you can protect as many corners as you need to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non stick tape","review":"The bumper is made of good material, but the tape that comes with it doesn't stick worth a darn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product!!","review":"My husband told me that this would ruin our tables.

Their box says easy removal...I would like them to come to my house and take it off for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT HELPS","review":"When my son was learning to crawl I bought this to protect him and it has saved his head a couple of times. We put it on the top of the coffee table and the bottom self of the coffee table as well. I also have some antique book shelves that I put it on. Yes it comes off, but if they made the tape stronger they would have people mad because it was ruining their furniture. It is not that big of a deal to reapply it. It does come with a bit of extra tape. I love it, and would buy more if I needed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing","review":"To be fair, I should have read the instructions before buying this. It works by using double sided tape to stick to your furniture. We have nice wood end tables. The instructions pretty much say that there's a chance you won't be able to get the adhesive off of your furniture when you're done. While I don't want my child to bump her head, there's got to be a better way. I'd like to still have this furniture once she's more stable."},{"rating":"2","title":"intriguing techniques","review":"This book has several techniques I have not seen in other books. My interests are mostly in bookbinding, cardmaking, scrapbooking, rubberstamping, and other paper arts, and I found the ideas in this book were new to me, though they may be familiar to seasoned collage artists. I like the before and after photos, the gallery of ideas, and the variety of techniques covered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Image Transfer Reference","review":"I checked this book out from the library twice, and liked it so much I decided to buy it. My favorite feature: the book explains many methods to use for image transfers from copier, inkjet, and other image sources. It also has tons of full-color examples. I don't particularly care for the author's style of art, but the varied ideas, as well as the gallery of other artists' work, make up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A limited pallette","review":"I was disappointed enough in this book to take the trouble and expense of returning it. I read an article mentioned by others which gave a few techniques for altering photos. This book stretched out the article to book length without adding much besides bulk. The images shown were pretty bleak--take a bad photo, scratch it up, and what do you have? A bad, scratched up photo. NOT inspiring to even keep for eye candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book But Heavy On Book And Journal Making; All Work Very Time Consuming","review":"If you want some inspiration for art work you can do in a reasonable period of time, I doubt this is for you. Collage, journals, art books and altered imagery can be some of the most time consuming projects in the art world and the ones in this book are no exception. Frankly, I want to produce my art images and projects faster than this. Also, the imagery in this book has a tendency to all look the same. Look at the cover. You are looking at the stylistic range. All this said, I do not think this is a bad book at all. It is a very good book for the right person. If you have your heart set on making your own art book or art journal using altered images, including photo transfers, and you have the time to make a very detail oriented, full project, then this book will probably guide you the whole way. Also, if your personal style is more in the folk art way, all to the good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful images","review":"This book has many wonderful pictures and lists the items need to use for the effects but the instructions are not specific enough for a beginner to dive right in if they are not familiar with certain products. I find myself looking through for techniques that I have not used and really wish that several of the projects were a bit more specific. Overall I really love the book but could see that it could be overwelming for someone who is shy from trying new things."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Guide to Altered Imagery","review":"WONDERFUL! The pictures and ideas in this book are incredible. Don't panic if you don't do every exercise, they will wait for you patiently on the beautiful glossy pages of this book. Also, I found myself needing a notebook to write down my own ideas as I was reading and working through this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice showcase of art","review":"Reading this book was like visiting the museum for me. There's plenty of eye candy and inspiration and the author shares the techniques she uses to alter different types of images for her art. It's a lovely and varied showcase but though Michel describes the process of creating the artworks, it's not quite a step-by-step guide and may not be for people who aren't familiar with altering images or mixed media, or who prefer a more projects-type book with more detailed and visual instructions.I would use this book as a source for mixed media art ideas but if you need clearer instructions on techniques, I'd use a book likeSurface Treatment Workshop: Explore 45 Mixed-Media Techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book","review":"Love this book. It's one of my go to books when I need inspiration or a unique idea. I think all mix media artist should own this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"out there","review":"I did not find this book helpful at all; in fact, I didn't even keep it around because it was taking up valuable space! I chalked it up to $15 worth of (bad) experience! The techniques bordered more on vandilism than alteration, and the projects were \\"out there\\"- translated: weird.

It made the process less intimadating. There are great photos and ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointing","review":"Much too vague to be called the complete guide.

The script is adequate but in no way great. All of the main characters were believable and you could easily empathize with the boys, however it suffered in that none of the characters was fully developed and the ending was, at best, ambiguous.

No interesting features and just downright bad writing.The film does improve a little bit when the guys eventually go on the roadtrip (which by the way, takes FOREVER to get to that point, which means lots of mediocrity until the guys get in the car together and travel).The guys do very stupid things, like wreck their car, assume they've won the lottery when they really didn't and act like children, attempt to jump off the bridge when they get drunk and/or stoned to commit suicide, and lots of other silly things. One of the friends even lies to the other one about sleeping with his wife just to make a man out of him, but the writing is just totally poor so it's not interesting.Maybe other people can see the appeal in a movie like this, but the storytelling was just horrible the entire time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Primitive Quartet Vol. 1","review":"I already had this CD.

The story just works better. I wasn't a big fan of Haunting. It wasn't \\"horror\\" and the movie versions weren't any better. A few things bumping in the night do not a horror story make, nor are they particularly engaging. However, these characters definitely are. Don't expect anything supernatural but the story is creepy. Also, having grown up in a town similar to that in the book, it's frustratingly realistic. I only gave it a 4 because of the end, which was something of a disappointment. It isn't an ending.

The only thing that would have saved the story was if the girls were ghosts, but no they're not. I'm still wondering why I finished reading the book, so I have to give Shirley credit for that; she made me read a book when I wasn't even interested in the plot. That's a good writer, bad story though."},{"rating":"1","title":"we have always lived in the castle by shirley jackson","review":"i don't like shirley jackson's writing style. itis very long and drawn out and there is no climax.she doesn't properly end her stories either. shesuggests and ending but never fully explains it.there is no rising action, intorduction, etc. toher stories as most would have. most authors usethis format for a reason -- it works. hersdoesn't, that's why no one else uses it.thank you for your time,Angela Bishop"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic and Awful","review":"This is an AWFUL book. Two sad sisters with a disturbed Uncle hiding in one home with only the one poor sister going out to town to the store and having townfolk who hate and tease her each time she does so.The secret comes out at the end - about the murder - but the whole book is a real downer. It is sad, Pathetic and show how cruel people are."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will put you to sleep!","review":"Well, first of all I only read like 3 chapters and that was enough!! I thought the characters were completely insane and the book just didn't seem to have a plot. I would not recommend this book at all! If you're into insane characters and you like to waste your time on a horrible book then maybe you should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellently written with an unexpected twist","review":"Not only did this book have an inviting story line...arsenic in the sugar bowl...it was also very creatively written.

This story is great, and is now one of my favorite books. Please read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror, no....creepy, yes!","review":"This book was definitely creepy at times but a horror story, no. I don't want to spoil the book for those that haven't read it but I knew right away who the culprit was. It was pretty obvious to me. A quick read. It had my attention throughout the entire time. Some parts I had to shake my head, the villagers-WTF???? I loved Jonas!!! So cute. Reminds me of my little kitty.The book cover is really nice. Stands out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"The description of this book was better than the actual book by far. The only reason I finished it was because I kept hoping that it would get better. It never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious from the beginning","review":"I love Ms. Jackson's comedy, she has a wonderful eye for it but I really found this book dull, primarily because I saw through it very quickly. Dull characters make for dull books, and strange or not these characters plodded along on a well worn path, both lifeless and unimaginative(and I mean that). Strange or diseased is not always that imaginative because it's too easy. Jackson is always a good writer but she needed something with a bit more meat on the bone to flourish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"Although it explores some creepy psychological depths, \\"We Have Always Lived In the Castle\\" never really rises to great storytelling - or great story, for that matter. It's a very inward, and at times repetitive, tale about a family that has, for better or for worse, become isolated from its own community. One problem is that after a short while, it generates little interest in the reader for people living in this doomed, backwards household - nor of the people living outside it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spooky and Delightful","review":"In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.from the very first page, the book had me hooked. merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree. in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.everyone hates them and wants them gone. merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house. the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused at the number of high ratings","review":"I am scratching my head at the many stars given this book by so many people. I found it bizarre. I am sorry I spent any time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shirley Jackson gets it about ... grrrls","review":"As an English major (aaggghh) who rates Middlemarch perhaps the greatest novel in English (so far), and as a bad girl, this is one of my top five favorites of all time. What is the quality that is unique that I am not seeing in other reviews? Is it the deliciously claustrophic, even Free-Masonic nature of the relationship between Merricat and her beloved, Olivia-De-Haviland-esque sister, Constance? The dark, sweet underside of human nature is comfortably exposed here. Closet types (of any kind) ar definitely invited. Merricat is every toddler you ever loved, grown up to be exactly what you feared. Better than chocolate."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"This is my favorite book, and I read 1-3 books a week.

Needless to say I read it in one sitting. The writing transports you to a world that's almost upside down....twists and turns. Dark corners. You're not quite sure what's real and what isn't. It was an enlightening journey, don't miss it!Shirley Jackson...when she's good.....she's GRAND. Check out her other works as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy and Cruel","review":"In this novel Jackson has created a textbook-perfect example of an unreliable narrator.At first, it's easy to trust Merricat's view of the world, she seems like a sympathetic victim of cruelty from the village. But it doesn't take long before we another Merricat, and it is this obsessive, amoral, stunted and narcissistic young woman that forms the backbone and brilliance of Jackson's creepy novel. Yes, there are a few problems with the plot and some believability issues, but at the end of the day, this book is a brilliant character study and a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merricat, Said Connie, Would You Like a Cup of Tea?","review":"This novel is even better than Jackson's more famous _The Haunting of Hill House_. This is a novel about madness, but until the middle of the book, you're not sure just which one of the Blackwood sisters is off her rocker. Which one of the sisters killed the rest of the Blackwood family, and why? The sisters seem content to live in Blackwood Manor, even though the entire town views them as freaks and murderesses, until cousin Charles shows up. Then the fun really begins!What makes this novel turly creepy is the psychological disfunction of these two women. There are no supernatural influences here, as there were in _The Haunting of Hill House_; the antagonist is a person who simply cannot live in the real world, and has to create her own reality.This novel is an especially good read for a stormy night. But be sure to finish it at one sitting, as it will be sure to haunt you afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maddening!","review":"My low rating for this book may not be entirely fair. This book does have some merit in that it contains a depiction of extreme mental illness and family dysfunction. For that reason, it's not entirely without worth. However, it was a frustrating read and not enjoyable, IMO, precisely because of the mental illness and dysfunction portrayed within. I don't want to spoil anything by complaining in too much detail, but it was frustrating for me to see such extreme mental illness handwaved away by the other characters. It's not funny or \\"silly,\\" this character is sick and it's being entirely ignored! I was left unsatisfied. None of the characters were relatable and their actions were beyond strange. I'm unsure what the point was."},{"rating":"1","title":"the kiss","review":"i wanted only 1 copy of the movie the kiss.... i didn't notice til after i committed payment that there was a 3 in the number of copies field.... i tried cancelling but to no avail, i now possess 3 copies of the same movie and am not very happy!kaz"},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG ROFL THE LASHES RULZZZZZ!","review":"From Smother Magazine [[...]]:The Lashes offer an explanation about why they're not another \\"the\\" band: \\"Hi there, we're a power pop band named The Lashes.

Imitating the Strokes and the Killers is really played-out right now. What's the point? These songs are derivative with a capital \\"D\\". The world doesn't need one more moody-looking band with perfectly styled hair doing an inferior version of what's already out there. The music itself is almost passable but the lyrics are really DUMB! It's like reading a 12 year-old girl's diary.

Their unoriginal (and ultra-cheesy) power-pop may fool the average MTV teenybopper, but trust me, this really is awful stuff. What was Lookout Records thinking? Believe it or not, two of the songs are loving tributes to two different Seattle rock critics in a boot-licking attempt to win their favor. It didn't work, and in the process, every musician in town knows what kind of hustler's they're dealing with. One song is about how hard it is to be a rich scenester boy in love. BLECCCH! To make matters worse, their phoney-baloney press kit compares them to The Cars and Elvis Costello, and guess what, they sound NOTHING like either one.

All of the performances are superb; Brad Pitt has never been this good before or since, and Gwenyth Paltrow provides an important shot of vulnerability. Watch for Kevin Spacey in a key role, and be prepared to hate this movie for a few days after watching it -- until you are drawn back to it for a second viewing, to reassure yourself and hope it ends differently. Haunting and vicious; I have taken off one star for the particularly garish ending, and a few unnecessary grotesqueries -- but in all, a superb, thinking-man's thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"For your safty, no food before the film.","review":"\\"Seven\\", although is sometimes downright disgusting, is actually a terrific movie. Morgan Freeman stars as Somerset, a verteran cop on the verge of retirement, and Brad Pitt as Mills, a young gun ready to take on anything. After the two of them get their first case, they begin to discover that the murders they're investigating are not just at random, but as part of the seven deadly sins.The movie's killer is excellent, but I ain't going to tell you who it is, but that just ruins the ending.\\"Seven\\" is a great film, and is certainly worth your time and money. If you can stomach it, that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark twisted thiller that keeps you on your feet","review":"A great dark thiller keeps you on your feet the whole time.This is one of the darkest films I have ever seen.this killer was crazy in this movie.This is a must see movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those films that clicks","review":"It's a rare phenomenon. The combination of plot, dialogue, characterisation, look, feel, sound, music, acting etc does not always gel as well as it did here. An amazing film, all the more because of how the script made it to production in its original form. Apparently the standard creatively bankrupt suit-brigade got their hands on the script & made it more user-friendly, but Brad Pitt, having been sent the original by mistake, threatened to withdraw until the original was returned to its rightful position. Goodonya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like \\"Saw\\", but it doesn't suck","review":"Se7en is a film about 2 detectives trying to solve a murder case where the killer is executing people who he thinks have committed the 7 deadly sins. This thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat and has the best ending/climax that I have ever seen. This film will also act as a moral compass and make you think about your own beliefs about life, death, and sin. highly reccamended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I give it 6 Stars?","review":"An outstanding film, Seven, brings to the screen the story an about-to-retire detective and his replacement as they tackle a particularly nasty serial killer. Could they be biting more than they can chew...There are hints of The Bone Collector and The Silence of the Lambs, so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category.Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!In short, Seven is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"and you thought Kaiser Soze was Evil ?","review":"Wait until you see all the sick and twisted ways psycho killer John Doe (Kevin Spacey) tortures and slowly murders those whom he deems to be guilty of one of the Se7en deadly sins (believe me, I lost all interest in \\"strap-on\\" products after this one !)If you don't mind stepping over to the dark side (and I mean REALLY dark) you will enjoy following John Doe's bread crumb trail along with detectives Mills (Brad Pitt) and Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who are led from one grisly murder scene to the next over a period of a week.The contrasting styles and philosophies of the two detectives make for great tension and polarity, but you will not find one single light or happy moment in this film. From beginning to end, Se7en will give you an uneasy feeling in your stomach. Which is, after all, the mark of a great noir film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Boring and Predictable","review":"How anyone could watch this film and still speak of a surprise ending is completely beyond me. It was completely predictable, boring, and overly concerned with it's own cleverness.And isn't it about time that someone told Brad Pitt to give up on the acting and just become an underwear model? His rather sad attempts at acting are getting increasingly pathetic, never more so than in this drab waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repellant violence and shoddy scriptwriting","review":"I am amazed at the cast of fine actors who were willing to be involved in this gratuitous gore-fest. The scenes between Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are meandering, meaningless filler as the director waits, slavering, to spring another disgusting image on the viewer.What truly disturbs me is the positive response this primer for murder and degradation elicited from the public. Now, that's scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Folks","review":"I saw through this film immediately. I knew what was going to happen, and how it would end.

This film has no redeeming value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Spacey trying to act like John Malkovich?","review":"That voice was just WAY too much a homage to Malkovich.This movie was interesting enough, but besides the cute premise, there's not all that much here. I think that the three main characters (Freeman, Spacey, Pitt) were misscast and the screenplay missed its own mark. All the dialog was 110% predictable and the characters were too one-dimensional. Freeman did the best job, but Pitt was just a bit too much \\"12 Monkeys\\" twitchy.Someone below mentioned this already: the titles were better than the movie. Weird. The overall look of this movie is that it was put together by a committee of people more worried about covering their a**es then putting out art. Or even making a lot of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this version - GET THE 2 DVD SPECIAL EDITION","review":"SE7EN is one of the greatest movies ever made.

We don't learn enough about him, and what we learn is pretty formulaic.David Fincher is a great director, and I believe after seeing Alien3 and Fight Club that \\"Seven\\" would probably be very different if he had had total control over it. The mechanics of the film are great, but there is a hollow place in the center that keeps it from being brilliant.A definite first-tier rental prospect, but unless you are a Fincher fan, don't bother buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, BAD DVD","review":"I loved this movie! The amazing cast delivered an eerily awesome performance. However, the people at New Line Home Vieo decided that they wanted to put half the movie on each side of the DVD, even though the movie is only about 2 hours long. The result is, halfway through the movie, you have to flip the DVD over. I thought they invented DVDs so that it was unnecessary to flip them like laserdiscs. Ahh, well. Good movie.

Overcooked. Brad can't carry it.","review":"A brilliant opening credit sequence, and downhill from there. Painfully obvious and predictable, with one or two pretty good jolts, to be fair. Morgan Freeman is his usual splendid self, opposite Brad Pitt who is his usual vapid self. What does an actor of Freeman's abilities think as he works with someone of Pitt's ineptness?Lots of fancy dark dank city cinematography and MTV editing to distract us from just how predictable the entire exercise is. You will notice how the police never turn on the lights when they enter a crime scene, presumably because flashlights look cooler, they have that NOIR look, you know? Cool, man.No, not really.

AND it's an old, crummy transfer (not from the silver-retention print Criterion used on the DVD)??? What the heck did I just buy? Well, as far as I can tell, this is probably a copy of the pay-per-view version you'd see on HBO. I just wasted almost 30 bucks on this coffee table coaster. Because that's all it's good for.

Gwyneth Paltrow as the newlywed wife, so vulnerable, and equally stellar!It's revenge ala Biblical prorportion here, and very nasty indeed!

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give excellent performances (For not to talk about the murderer) and the Screenplay keeps you interested during the whole Movie (Say another Thriller during the 90s that was so good in overall?). in other words, Se7en is a GREAT! Movie.But why 4 Stars? I give the DVD 4 Stars because it doesn't include the TV Spots and the Audio Commentary with Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and David Fincher was not so good as I thought. It was boring in some places, but despite this.

The Blu-ray version is 2.40:1, and shows the scenes as they were originally shot. That adds to the grit and grunge.Sharpness, contrast and color are very good in the Blu-ray version (on a 1080p TV)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of the perfect movies in the history of film","review":"This movie has been one of my favorites since the first time I saw it at the theater. This print on Blu Ray takes it to a new level. Pristine picture and sound. Former prints I've seen have been somewhat grainy in the dark scenes but not on this print. All that can be said about the movie has been said. Great acting, tight direction, and one of the best endings ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Day Classic!","review":"Se7en is already a classic in the thriller genre. The story about a serial killer punishing his victims for their sinful living by killing them in a most gruesome manner. Old detective Summerset(Freeman) is put on the case with his new partner(Pitt), the movie is full of suspense from the first moment, the clues, the investigation and the two detectives private conversations. They are opposites. Pitt the idealistic young detective, that want to conquer the world, and Freeman the tired old man, that see that it makes no difference and you cannot change the world(even though he might learn something in the end). Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitts beautiful wife, and she is great even though she does not appear alot. The showdown is one of the best and most suspenseful I have seen in a long time.The movie is grim and dark. There are no strong colors and the light is always gritty, which helps to create the atmosphere of the movie. A great movie, great acting, great directing.

Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are two detectives coming from different backgrounds who blend nicely in their effort to find a serial killer who bases his murders on the seven deadly sins. Don't think things fall into place neatly as 'John Doe' promises his 'work' will be pondered and puzzled for years. Hollywood convention would have a happy, cuddly ending but writer Andrew Kevin Walker and director, David Fincher stuck to their guns and showed that a smartly done, yet shocking ending could perform at the boxoffice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thriller of the 90s","review":"Dark, yet it kicks @$$. Reminescent of 8mm. The killer was one sick dude, and Kevin Spacey's excellent portrayal of John Doe is still horrifying to this day.

The best dark thriller since 1990's Silence of the Lambs. Get it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"I'm obviously in a minority here. But IMO the movie just sucked. The thing that irritated me throughout the movie was the darkness and by that I mean the absense of light. The lighting is artificially dimmed for effect and it just doesn't work. Nobody works and lives in such poor light. The black and white film noirs work beautifully, but this movie seems stage-managed. Amongst contemporary movies, the lighting in &quot;Dark City&quot; was very natural and fit in well with the theme of the movie. This is a one gimmick movie and it got old within the first 5 minutes. I count this, along with &quot;Absolute Power&quot; and &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; as amongst the worst 10 movies I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a 2 hour Tool video","review":"I love most things dark, opressive, disturbing and stark, but this predictable-from-the-start investigation into the underbelly of human depravity failed to hold me past the thrid deadly sin. Creepy and sickening, I enjoyed the dirty feeling this movie left me with, but when the credits hold a higher artistic value than what's between them, it's hard to recommend a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the single disc version!","review":"I loved this movie, and spent the extra money to get the special edition. So what do I get when I finally open it. NO commentary. NO making of featurette. NO interviews. There are only a few deleted scenes, probably less than five minutes worth; some technical featurette about the opening that was boring and maybe seven minutes long; and an allegedly alternate ending, that to my eye, looked the same as the theatrical ending shot-for-shot.Save yourself some scratch and buy the single disc for half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Mood - Boring Story","review":"The mood was set perfectly by Fincher. I loved some scenes such as the stomach in the plastic bag. However, I hate movies where serial killers kill people to some goofy formula. There was nothing compelling to killing people 7 deadly sins style. It was just boring coming across more and more dead bodies.I hate Kevin Spacey. He just has that lispy voice and blank stare as he does in every movie. There are Sesame Street characters that are more menacing than this. (Snuffalufagus and the Grouch are 2 examples. Heck, Burt and Ernie are as well. Ok, Elmo and the rest are as well!)I loved the macabre mood in this picture. Fincher did a great job of that. I really wanted to like the other aspects of this movie but the story just bored me.I liked the style including the credits scrolling opposite than normal but the story had no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews here are overrated","review":"What do you get when you combined a prominent, experienced cast with an unusual story premise? In this case, a dull movie. A very dull movie, and it didn't have to be that way. The dialogue was insipid and unnecessarily vulgar, the pace painfully slow, and fine actors seemed to be going through the motions. The movie had \\"low budget\\" written all over it. I watched the film on IFC, standard def, and the color and sound were dreadful, especially the center channel where dialogue was often unintelligible. Someone here reported the latest DVD greatly improves on that. I'll take his word that is true, but it can't make a dull movie interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A totally boring movie","review":"I terribly disappointed by this movie. It bears some resemblance to The Bone Collector and Silence Of The Lamb, but has none of the suspense, mystery, good acting and good story that these other movies have.

Add all the stupidities up and you have one boring movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ending of a movie ever","review":"Although the actors are good actors - not in this movie.

A grotesque carnival of sickness... a horror movie... not uplifting entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea with good acting, but it just ain't funny.","review":"Taste is always subjective, particularly when it comes to humor, so reviews aren't too helpful, but I didn't care for this movie. It just didn't make me laugh. The Beavis & Butthead thing that Freeman and Pitt had going just didn't work at all. Kevin Spacey's eventual arrival brightened things slightly, but it was far too little, far too late. Well, I'll admit I might've grinned or chuckled just a little a few times. The fat man being forced to eat himself to death made me smirk, as did the lady getting her face cut up. And I'll admit that I did laugh out loud once during the decapitation part, but that's kinda cheap because decapitation is always funny. But a few funny scenes ain't worth the money or time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good on VHS","review":"Okay - the movie was good. I have no complaints about the movie. And I don't own a DVD player, so I don't know about the quality of the DVD... (I can't review it on VHS, because it's not available on VHS) It was good. Morgan Freeman, the beautiful Brad Pitt, the talented Gwyneth Paltrow... Could one ask for anymore?Possibly. If you've got DVD, you've got alot to complain about...

If you buy the DVD, you shouldn't have to turn it over to watch the rest of the movie...But hey - I'm not complaining.It was a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to be more, but this is a formula film","review":"I know why lots of people liked this film. It has many upcoming stars, like Paltrow, and some established ones who are not too bad (Pitt and Freedman). Then there are the biblical references and the planing of a chess-player style killer. But beyond some frills, is there really anything all that original or interesting? Unfortunately, with the exception of some vivid images and special effects, the answer is no. Moreover, the film is lacking in an original spirit, somethings that sets it apart on a fundamental level. I did not see it and frankly, I hped to find it.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"Se7en is a solid 5 star movie. But watch out. There's a Canadian version which is the wrong aspect ratio, 1080i (not 1080p), and contains no bonus features.

Of course I could not resist the temptation to buy it when it was 50% off. This is a movie about a crazy man (played by Kevin Spacey) who is punishing people who have fulfilled one or more of the seven deadly sins. This movie is not for the light of heart and definitely is NOT suited for children. The ending is very twisted but not all that satisfying. If you liked this movie you will also like the movie 8mm starring Nicholas Cage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Horror Movie of the '90's","review":"This movie is so incredibly disturbing because it is actually about something: the sense of sin that the modern world tries to deny and repress. Brad Pitt represents the principle that so many nowadays believe in: the proper application of force against other people is all you need to succeed. Morgan Freeman knows better--it's the enemy inside you, the enraged being that wants to smash the heads of his enemies, that's what really needs watching. John Doe is this death wish incarnate--he hates the world and wants to obliterate it and himself. Rarely have I seen a movie that so stylishly presents a contemporary mood (just check out those opening credits; you would think Trent Reznor had something to do with them.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"SICK","review":"This film is a sinister tale of a serial killer, seeking retribution on the sinners of the world, it is set in a city that looks like New York but it never tells you if it is or not but I expect it is, in the midst of the dirt and scum covered streets there is a killer on the loose played miraculously and brilliantly by Kevin Spacey, the cops Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the guys on his tail but he always stays a couple of steps ahead, it ends in horror and devestating tension, it is a classic but the darkness of everything in it is too unrealistic for me so it loses a star for that, but in terms of creating a scene by establishng sinister moods that you couldn't even dream of it is a master and I do love it so. Don't sin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mood swinger","review":"Whew, this was a heavy flick. The use of environment, really helped set the tone.

Really. It really is an affront to human dignity. Oh of course, it's super-clever, and superbly realised and quite intelligently put together and well-acted and packs a hard punch. I am not denying any of that. What I find so offensive is that this film deliberately co-opts and manipulates the viewer into identifying with and sympathising with darkness. I would almost say that the making of this film verges on being a criminal act against human decency. I am not an old, grey-haired prudish conservative. I'm young, I'm handsome, I'm pretty, I'm intelligent and as cool as they come and I have to say that this is one of the very few films I have watched that has left me feeling morally contaminated.

Good luck to you !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disturbing movie -- I'll NEVER see it again","review":"I've seen my share of graphically violent films. Some have artistic merit and some don't, but Seven is the most disturbing movie that I ever saw. I would never see this movie again, and I would recommend to those who haven't seen it not to see it.Director David Fincher is a disturbed man, and you can tell that he REALLY doesn't like his characters in this movie. I don't know how anyone could come away from this movie feeling good having seen it. This movie does not deserve a rating from me (I gave it one star only because I had to), only a warning not to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"Seven is a dark, brooding film, filmed in dreary colors, about a police search for a man intent on committing seven murders based on the 7 deadly sins. It is unbelievable, predictable and disgusting, a film with no redeeming features which should be avoided at all costs. It sets out to shock rather than entertain. You have been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross","review":"This film is absolutely gross. It has some of the most disturbing imagery in any modern film. People who are chained to beds and over days have parts of them gradually cut of and the like.Some horror films have elements of the absurd or are poorly constructed so that the repellent features don't seem real. Seven is one of the most well crafted skillfully scripted films made in recent times so that it is absolutely effective.The atmospherics and skill with which it is made cover over the plot holes. I saw the film and found that the imagery kept coming back for weeks and made me feel sick. However if you like that sort of thing there is no question it is effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh.... not bad","review":"\\"Seven\\" deals with two police officers (played by thespians Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman) who are trying to track down and bring to justice a killer, except this is no ordinary killer.

It is gritty, dark and very disturbing however Morgan Freeman, Gwenyth Pawltrow and Kevin Spacey are superb in their roles.

The film is shot nicely and everything, but there just isn't a very strong entertaining quality to it. It's dark and dingey. Normally, I like that sort of thing if it's done right. This is just too cold. The two stars are good. (spoiler) This movie isn't scary at all, nor is it very exciting.

I am sick and tired of flipping my Goodfellas disc over."},{"rating":"2","title":"effective little horror movie","review":"For what it does it's a effective little horror film if a bit gruesome to watch at times. Unfortunately this is Finchers only good movie, he's not that great of a director. He seems to be lost in his own visuals. Let's face it, other than seven none of his other movies made money, and most of them were flawed. The Game kept running on, Fight Club had a cop out ending and Alien3 was just plain awful. If given a decent script and if he sticks to it, like seven, he can actually make a decent film. Left to his own devices tho and he's off on a tangent. Some directors are like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie. Great DVD.","review":"\\"Seven\\" is one of the best thrillers ever made.

It is such a perfect reflection on a sick and numbed society that would hold this up in such high regard. It is a good reflection on the sickness of the people involved in producing this work. And I mean that sincerely, because I realize it took so very much time and effort to produce this film. And it is a reflection on the lack of ... lack of what? within the actors who took part in this! By the end of this film I, too, like some other reviewers here, was angry. Angry that I had wasted my time, angry that I had watched such tripe, angry at myself for having listened to and paid attention to all the praise that had been heaped upon this movie when it first came out. This movie still sticks in my mind as one of those that never needed to be made. It is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Silence of the Lambs Wanna Be","review":"Caught this on TV. Awful. Maybe it was good in another time period (1995) when Silence of the Lambs was still on the audience's mind.It's a mix of a Silence wannabe with an attempt at a 1970s Taxi Driver/Conversation overlay (too many dang saxophones and trenchcoats). It works with Morgan Freeman, but not with Brad Pitt whose essential 90s-ness jumps out at you. Kevin Spacey underplays it in an attempt to be another Hannibal. He is not successful.There are plot holes galore. The clues don't add up and the suspense doesn't build in the same way they did with Agent Starling. Things happen and you aren't sure why. Gwenyth Paltrow's character asks Morgan Freeman to lunch for no discernible reason and this later becomes a key plot element.Just a really stupid movie. As far as pure horror/suspense, the sloth guy tableau was the only one that got a jump out of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"brad pitt's performance is amazing","review":"Pitt, never what you would really call an actor, turns in a performance here that is nothing short of amazing, if you rule out the fact that no police department in the country would hire someone with Tourette's who appears to neither shave nor bathe very often.The storyline has all the depth and literacy of the last fourteen slasher movies you saw, which is appropriate because this is basically a fancy slasher movie.Morgan Freeman basically provides the only element of sanity in this movie. He often looks at Pitt in disbelief as though he were thinking, \\"They pay you to do this?\\"Putrid, disgusting, formless, meaningless, and needlessly excessive, this is an example of modern Hollywood at its worst. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"What a horrible film. How could the people who created this mess justify the existence of this film? How many more disgusting, pointless films such as this one which look into the depth of human ugliness are going to be thrust out at the public and presented as creative masterpieces? What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bells & ..................","review":"After checking out a myriad of \\"must haves\\" in DVD, I bought the recommended, and after having enjoyed the theatrical release, and credits, watched terrible dialogue and sloppy moments throughout. After the terrific credits the film is just flim-flam despite photography and actors. Just style !!!...a remake of regurgitated ideas from \\"Taxi Driver\\" /the detective side. Stick with \\"Law & Order\\" on any night. Loved the credits!!!Considering it was in New York, when can you simply travel to the desert in 1/2 hour..........? Or give a dinner party, and then explain to the guest AFTER dinner that your apartment is over a subway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy!","review":"Excellent! The end is very unexpected, and extremely well crafted. The acting is a bit wooden in places, but generally helps add to the mood.

Just about everything in the movie is perfection though it is not a movie I would recommend to the weak at hart. It can get a little violent but it is well worth it if you can stomach it. Can't wait for Fight Club either, read that book and then see the movie with Pitt and Fincher teaming up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really creepy!!","review":"This movie had me freaked out for a long time after I had seen it. What a great storyline! Serial killer kills those who are breaking the 7 deadly sins...who among us would be safe? Brad Pitt is awesome in his role, one of his best acting jobs... and Morgan Freeman, words can't describe his acting performance! Not scary in the style of \\"Friday the 13th\\" or \\"Scream\\" but more in a psychological sense...Rent it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, lots of suspense","review":"That had to have been the most suspensful movie i have seen in a long time!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Scary movie","review":"Seven is a film about 2 New york homicide detectives that must find a serial killer who is murdering people based on the seven deadly sins.

It is a somewhat disturbing film but it gets my highest rating as one of the best movies I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie - DVD could be better","review":"Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are detectives chasing a serial killer. This dark, gruesome thriller is a must see. Great performances are given by all. Kevin Spacy and Gwenneth Paltrow are also in the movie.My only gripe is that the DVD is 2 sided, requiring you to flip the disc halfway through the movie.

A predictable movie with gore for the sake of gore. The characters are so cliche it makes you want to gag more than the bodies they discover.

Save your money and your time, click on the next button."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointlessly unpleasant","review":"Fincher's a good director, and the film is visually impressive. It very successfully shocks and upsets the audience. Problem is, it is totally meaningless, totally devoid of substance. After the perfectly predictable but nonetheless disturbing finish, you realize that you have allowed yourself to get worked up about nothing at all.The film has plenty of stuff in it that could earn it 3 stars instead of 2, but the net effect of watching the film is negative. (I have nothing against upsetting films, but if they have no real reason to upset you, I'd rather steer clear. I was better off before I rented this thing than I am now.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seven","review":"I thought Morgan Freeman(Ironically a Cheater himself years later in real Life) and Brad Pitt(on a roll) did their part good,the story is unique but overall I found the movie disturbing and over the top when it came to the mayhem, on top of that you have Kevin Spacey(someone I detest and always plays the bad guy so it is fitting). My problem doesn't lay with the story but the way it carries itself in total disgust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crime/Mystery with a Philosophical Twist","review":"Directed interestingly, acted well, written heavy-handedly. Aside from the use of color, the directing has nothing on any other high budget action movie. Of course, these are well directed for their purpose. Morgan Freeman acts very well, Paltrow acts as she always does, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt. He wasn't always convincing, but this I'll blame on the writer giving him an impossible, unconvincing character. The writer was preaching, and he preached an interesting movie. But if you want to see the same message preached more intelligently, watch David Lynch's \\"Blue Velvet.\\" To give \\"Seven\\" its due, it preaches less blatantly than BV, but also less brilliantly. In the end, it is slightly more intelligent than the average big budget movie, but it is not perfect. It's worth watching, maybe twice, but not buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Twist of 95 an Spectacularly Chilling!","review":"If this movie dosen't have you tinking then your probabley a killer. What a mind bender and the chilling ora of sound affects done by the king Trent Reznor who is NINE INCH NAILS at the start of the movie. The remix of closer by NIN lets you know at the beging what sort of movie that it's going to be so you'd better clinch on to the chair or a loved one quick. You know because you've either seen Alien 3 or fight club or you know Nine Inch Nials's style and there record for sound tracks...The Crow, Lost Highway, Natural Born Killers, etc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"\\"Seven\\" is one of the most profound movies of our time. A serial killer is enacting all seven deadly sins through a series of grisly crimes. It is a riveting tale with a surprise ending. The social commentary in this movie is powerful. We as a society have experienced much in the way of moral decay. John, the killer, had decided that we were too sick to be saved and launched his own intricate and twisted crusade against us. Definitely a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNEXPECTED THRILLER!","review":"Excellent thriller, dark and with a surprising end. Great performances of Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow and especially of the extraordinary Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. Simply brilliants. Probably the David Fincher's best movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"They need to remaster this disc","review":"As many have said before, Seven is a great movie.Unfortunately, Seven is also an extremely poor DVD. Not only is the disc a flipper, requiring you to turn the disc over mid-film, it includes absolutely no extras.

There is absolutely no reason why a disc of such poor quality is allowed to remain on the market"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Received the Book!","review":"We never received the book, sad to say.

I wanted to see if these were accurate so I tested using Clear Blue Easy digital OPK and these into the same urine sample. CBE came up positive 1 full day before these did. They aren't as sensitive as they claim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as accurate as Clear Blue Easy (for me)","review":"I bought these because they were less expensive than my previous month's supply of Clear BLue Easy Ovulation tests. My cycle is pretty regular..27-28 days. These registered as negative for 2 days before ovulation. I had one Clear Blue Easy test left and I tried that one (CBE) immediately after one of these, it was positive! I'm not sure if I got a pack of \\"duds\\" or if these aren't as sensitive as the Clear Blue Easy brand.There was a very faint line, but not as dark or darker than the control line. Which under the instructions on the website indicates that it is a negative test. I don't think I'll buy these again! I will say, shipping was super fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I bought these because they were so inexpensive - and you get what you pay for. First of all, the instructions say to test between 10am and 6pm. But after getting no positive results in 2 months, a friend of mine said to test after dinner (between 6pm and 10pm), and voila - a positive test appeared! However, the bad part was that I got the positive result only after my temp had spiked that morning (which says that I ovulated that day). So it did not predict the hormone surge 2-3 days before ovulation, like its supposed to. So buy these with that in mind. Maybe buy extra strips and test once after lunch and once after dinner. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipping to Canada","review":"These strips were a great bargain over the ones available in Canada(which cost about $55 CAN for 5-9 strips). I bought 10 OPK strips and 2 pregnancy test strips for $21 CAN. Just be aware that it took about 3 weeks for them to arrive, so if you're in a hurry buy the horribly overpriced ones at Shoppers Drug Mart or pick up a copy of \\"Taking Charge of Your Fertility\\" by Toni Wechsler--it's a great resource on natural signals of fertility (ovulation)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, inaccurate and misleading","review":"I'm using these along with the saliva microscope, checking cervical mucus, and basal temp charting to pinpoint ovulation. I have PCOS so I'm very irregular and unpredictable. These cheap sticks are just that. I've tried using them all times of the day (even more than once in a day) and the control line is 9 times out of 10 very light. Sometimes I get a faint test line, but most of the time it looks as if it's negative. I know it's not negative because of the other testing I'm going. I wouldn't waste your money on these cheap things. They're very disappointing and discouraging to someone trying to conceive. Maybe I got a bad batch? I don't know, but definitely will not waste my money on these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ovulation strips did not work","review":"I tested from cd 10 to cd 28 and I never saw a positive. I think you get what you pay for and I will never purchase again. I would rather spend the money to find out if I am ovulating instead of just guessing. It was a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm pregnant, not ovulating!","review":"The first couple times I took these tests, they came out negative. The next two came out darkly positive. Over a week later, I took it again for the heck of it and it was another dark positive. I had pregnancy symptoms so I took a pregnancy test (the same day that I got the positive ovulation test) and turns out I'm pregnant. This is fine, since we were trying but I think this could be dangerous in certain situations if these tests are defective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching qualitative research? Check this new book!!","review":"Kathleen Demarrais has done it again! This practical, thorough, well-organized book will be an excellent text for qualitative/ ethnographic research classes. Your students, like mine, will learn a great deal from these chapters, which are short enough to be supplemental reading assignments and rich enough to spark discussion and reflection in your research class. The editor has provided thoughtful questions for each chapter and an index linking specific topics to the chapters where those topics are addressed -- both very useful to the professor using all or part of the book and linking specific chapters to syllabus topics. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trent's Last Case","review":"This quick read was an entertaining glimpse into early last century detective fare. Its plot twists were great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.....","review":"This is the first of Trent's cases that I have read and I am not sure how many there were previously, but this was an enjoyable read. The characters are developed nicely, the plot flows along at a decent pace, and there are enough twists to keep me guessing. Of course, the solution comes from left field, but was rather interesting based upon the characterization of the deceased. A definite old time mystery without much gore and [sexual content], but interesting nevertheless! Maybe I'll read some of his earlier cases....."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"This book is a waste of money.

The score alone is enought to make me gag; it could have been written for some cheesy made-for-TV movie or even one of the later Gunsmoke episodes.

The plot of this movie was predictable but that is quiet alright. The producer and director probably wanted to convey some other message and hence a standard plot was chosen.Clint Eastwood is a rancher who is strung up at high noon by a bunch of thugs from a nearby town. They accuse him of murder and theft of cattle. Eastwood however does not die. A US Marshall recues him and brings him to the judge for trial. Judge aquitts Eastwood.It so happens that Eastwood was a ex-lawman and judge appoints him as a Marshall. Then begins the story of revenge and justice as Eastwood hunts down the vigilante mob that tried to hang him.There are many interesting questions raised in the movie. What is the relationship between Revenge and Justice? How should justice be dealt out? It is a thought-provoking movie although it has somewhat banal action scenes. Regardless, it's a movie worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truncated image in both wide and std versions","review":"I love the film but...

This is great, but the problem is both versions are truncated versions of the original. The widescreen is even more truncated ! If you compare two images, Clint has some blue sky above is hat in standard, and you see only half of his hat in widescreen ! I say it this way to makes things clear, but I'm a tech oriented guy, I checked twice what really was on this dvd before writing this review.The 16:9 version is cropped from the 4:3 !

Despite the glowing praise which persuaded me to purchase the book, it's poorly written, completely flat and one-dimensional, alternately sickly sweet and falsely gritty. It gets one star for a well-written public relations campaign that claims \\"a modern-day parable\\" -- driving the eye-ball-rolling reader to persist to the end in a desperate (and unfulfilled) need to know why this book was ever allowed to be published in the first place.

But, I was desperate to try anything after other treatments had failed. I tried Ring Stop, taking 2 capsules twice a day for two months, as they recommended. It had absolutely no impact on my tinnitus. There was no reduction in the noise in my ears. This product does not work, it does not reduce one's tinnitus (at least in my experience) and I would strongly encourage you not to waste your money on it, as I did.

It is! I would have put this book down after the first chapter if not for my interest in the Hebrew language and Ravel's decision to include Hebrew etymology woven into the story.

The truth is this first novel is completely based and focused on Israel. The love story is touching. I share the view that the politics are simplistic. Still, they have a ring of truth and as a person who is strongly pro-Israel I felt it was important for me to read this book. I don't think the erratic movement from present to past was particularly effective. At times I felt I was reading a romance novel. That being said, I read it in its entirety in almost one sitting because I found it absorbing. I certainly would recommend it to others. I look forward to reading more of Ravel's fiction in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dmitry Markman","review":"I think it's very good bookI liked Hebrew words meaning/origin explanation tooI don't think I can share political view of the author, though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lily loves Ami","review":"Ten Thousand Lovers has a lot to say about the daily conflicts and commonalities that make up Arab/Israeli life. It was refreshing to see this \\"hot\\" topic approached from such an ordinary perspective, even though Ami our main male character has anything but an \\"ordinary\\" job. We tend to see so much information that is polarized to one view or another, it's easy to forget that most perspectives are likely much more moderate than those we see on the evening news. I liked Ami and Lily; they were earnest, passionate, and quite believable in the immediacy of their love during turbulent times. I enjoyed the linguistic information which is sprinkled throughout the story, and I think this novel would be an excellent selection for a book club, as their is plenty of fodder for discussion; albeit the discussion could become quite intense in a hurry depending on your political beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Thousand Lovers by Edeet Ravel.","review":"Set in the seventies, the novel demonstrates the political landscape of the newly formed Israel, through its citizens and their personal and professional lives. They are constantly coping, separating/distancing themselves, waiting for disaster.With the title, Ravel reminds the reader to look beyond the central story. This is the story of one lover, but also ten thousand lovers. It is the story of one couple, but thousands of couples feel this way. In a country that encourages distance for protection, the love of Ami and Lily is bound through intimacy and closeness with each other and with the land.A very good read -- hard to put down.

They are very small, not very soft and really are only patterned on one side. I wouldn't consider them to be receiving blankets so much as burp cloths or something like that.

I would be embarrassed to work for a company that turned out such a substandard product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small to swaddle baby","review":"Unlike other reviewers, I wasn't too upset by the quality of these blankets (I live in a hot climate and like the fact that they're thin), but was unable to use them to swaddle my baby because they're much too small. I now use these blankets as burp clothes and as head supports for my baby rather than to swaddle...sort of defeats the purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, but they are a bit small","review":"I agree with all the moms who believe millions of recieving blankets are a must! I just wish they made them a little bigger, like 40x40, instead of just 30x30. My little girl is tall just like her mom (5'11\\") and dad (6'0\\") so to get her feet nicely covered up, I have to swaddle her from the waist down!

They are soft, but the first time I washed them, they changed shape, and loose threads sprung out from every corner. Size wasn't a problem, because I have premature twins, but if I want to hold them both under one blanket, I have to use the Carter's blankets. I guess the moral is .... you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Are Awful","review":"After you wash them the first time, they get crooked and uneven trapezoid-shaped.

Cleaning this is a breeze with it's smooth stainless steel finish all you need to do is wipe it out never need to scrub and it only takes a few miutes. The gliding tray does not come off for very good reasons so you don't take your arm off. This is the way professional slicers are made.

This slicer is not worth any price. Yes, cleaning is obviously crazy after I had it on my counter. Besides that it doesn't even cut well because the slicing carriage gets stuck as you are trying to push it along. The carriage is mounted on a tube that acts as the slider mechanism and there is also a small wheel underneath for rolling along.. however it just doesn't work smoothly at all so you just get scraps of meat out unless you are fully muscling the thing which probably isn't safe.Oh ya, the motor started smoking after 10 minutes of use.

It broke down after the second use and is irreparable. Like one other person said on here, it just started to smoke, then the engine kept whirring but the blade didn't move. I wish I could have found the paperwork to return it because the gear is completely stripped out and they don't offer that part as a replacement, so I just wasted $100 on something that will simply go to the scrapyard. It's also very difficult to clean. I was extremely disappointed in this slicer and would not be able to recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about bad product design...","review":"Giving 1 star to this food slicer is actually quite generous and only happened because Amazon doesn't have a 0 rating.This food slicer is basically worthless for any use, for hygienic reasons: there is lubricant on the inside of the blade that gets spread over food. Cleaning the blade and/or the inside of the blade compartment is impossible, as the blade carries a gear on the back that sits on another gear that connects to the motor. Because of this, the gears need to be lubricated and the blade gets greasy all over.It's also impossible to slice anything slightly bigger than a roll, since the plastic hand guard can only be placed on the sliding tray in one position. If you have a <gasp> full bread, good luck slicing it! The same goes for salami, etc.Guess when I'm going to buy another Waring Pro product in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to clean!","review":"This product, as others have indicated, is very difficult to clean.

I can't say it didn't work, but you have to be patient. The motor doesn't plow through the work. You have to go slow to maintain the blades spinning speed. Cleaning required another 15 minutes and I wasn't satisfied it was clean enough to put in my cabinet. I am pretty good at maintaining and using a quality knife. While slicing up a whole roast is work, this doesn't make it any easier. Compared to my slicing by hand, it does provide more uniformity in the slices, but actually takes twice as long or worse with cleaning time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design","review":"We have had this slicer for a couple years and used it about 10-15 times.

This is one of the most sorry excuses for an appliance I've ever seen. It's been used only once and is going back tomorrow. The drive gear that turns the blade is plastic and the plastic gear grinds and skips under even the slightest of loads. I've checked more than once to make sure the blade is attached property but this lame excuse for a food slicer won't even slice a one pound block of jack cheese! A harder cheese such as cheddar would be the death of this machine. It's also not user friendly for cleaning. The blade is removable, but that's all. The tray that slides back and forth and holds the food won't even detach for cleaning. Terrible product and terrible quality.

Took blade off after using it once to clean it, per the instructions (use quarter on slot) and follow markings on the unit itself (open with arrow and close in opposing direction). When I put the blade back on, it failed to align properly and provided an uneven cut (and smelled too strong of burn in also). Called Waring customer service, and they indicated that instruction manual was wrong, and that new instructions weren't always out there yet. Should have removed three Phillip screws to remove blade! Don't use slot. Waring expects home users to remove three screws every time to clean it! And says put nothing, not even the blade, in the dishwasher. How are you supposed to clean it thoroughly? By hand? Waring needs a new design team. This is among the most poorly thought thru in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"sliced well, impossible to really clean","review":"The machine sliced a roast beef pretty well.

If Waring had any sense of honesty about this product they would drop the \\"Pro\\" and \\"Professional Quality\\" from its packaging. They shouldn't charge anymore than $50 and refer to it as \\"light duty\\". It is flimsy and does not cut evenly. The food guide \\"bends\\" too easily with the slightest amount of pressure resulting a thick to thin slice. The blade moves SLOW and it's not as sharp as they lead you to believe.

I'm latina, 5'11, 147 lbs and somewhat athletically built. I decided to give the bum bum and high and tight workout a try. WOW!!! I can barely walk and I worked out muscles in my abductor and adductor I thought i never had. I thought my gym leg workout was hard, but this is just as difficult and I\\"m only using a band and my body weight. I'm not much for words but if you have to spend money on something to target the saddle bags and inner/outer thighs then this is definitely it and the cardio portion is incredible and fun :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This workout program will make a difference for your bum bum if following the calender. The instructor does not give you good instructions of what move comes next and he does not break it down like other exercise programs. If you watch the dvd before trying it then you have a better idea and like any dvd, you pretty much will memorize it after a couple of times. If you have bad knees then you will have to be careful with the many lunges in this program. Other than that, this program will do what it is set out to do. I gave it four stars b/c I would rather have had better routine direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"The product arrived quickly and was in great condition.

Pain in the arse!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and Injury Inflicting Videos","review":"I have only been through the instructional Basics, and the Bum Bum videos so far. In my opinion, fully completing the Bum Bum work out would require the knees of a ten year old.No one with weak/problematic knees or backs should invest in this program.The exercises are well are targeted though, with the triangle scultping. The standing exercises just demand far too much from my knees.Classical pilates uses the same principles of working all the muscles (ncluding smaller supportive muscles), from different angles; and it is much safer as it promotes muscle, joint and bone stability versus fights it. For the amount of pilates BBL draws on, you'd be better off just doing pilates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Pleased","review":"I've held off on the purchase thinking that it would be too easy. I've done P90X and Insanity...along with Kelly Coffey-Meyer and P90 Boot Camp. Well I fell off the wagon of working out and needed something new to inspire my 4:30AM wake up work out. And this did the trick. I'm not a dancer by any sorts, and I found myself smiling during the Cardio Axe!! It's actually fun!The butt and ab work out are challenging. I gave 4 stars because I do think I'd need a few other DVDs for a fully round work out. Although the cardio is fun, it's not extreme.But I'm pleasantly surprised and so happy with my purchase!Also, I started my 4:30 work out mornings 2 months prior to Brazilian Butt Lift (I was doing Chalean Extreme, mixed with some Tony Horton and cardio)....oddly enough I've had more results with this work out. I noticed my thighs and butt start shaping immediately. I'm still not back in my \\"normal\\" clothes, but feel it's close, and look forward to it soon!Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"Very intense workout, I cant seem to be able to finish one workout without wanting to pass out.

You build lean muscle mass quickly. I started losing inches while at the same time building muscle, and all within the first month.

But in a good way!","review":"I have only done one of the workouts in this set, I just recieved it yesterday. Wow! It looks and feels like it really targets the butt. Can't wait to update this review after a week or two. The first workout was Bum Bum and it was fast paced, think it will take a couple of times to master the moves, but I already feel it. The instructor, Leandro? I think. He sounds a lot like Borat from those movies, it makes me laugh and smile when I hear him talk. But it isn't really annoying, just funny if you stop and listen. But he does talk alot and cues you to keep everything tight. Music was good and not at all cheesy, so that helps. The 30 minutes really flew by! Lots of lunges and leg work, I hate lunges with a passion and really dread them, but somehow he makes them bearable. Do this 5 times a week and watch what you put in your mouth and there is no way you won't see results. I look forward to updating this review to tell you if it's true or not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Butt Workout!","review":"I'm going on 4 weeks with the combo workout (there was 4 to choose from). and i've lost an inch on my waist and butt. the instructor keeps me motivated and eager to see the results. i did see results going into the 3rd week. but i think this work out needs to be in conjunction with regular cardio like walking or running to actually lose weight. i was fit to begin with, just got bored and wanted to try something new. if you're looking to lose weight, don't depend on just this alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new best friend","review":"So, me and my mom got this because I am a busy high school student and she is in the military, we figured we could both use it at different times and still get in the work out when we could. I am not a particularly fit person, even though i have been a martial artist for 13 years, and oh my goodness. These workouts are hard, but they are fun! Some people say that the exercises are hard to follow, but if you do the basics video before you start it is easy to pick up on what he is doing. It is the best, most fun work outi have ever done, and I have tried a lot of work out programs to try to get rid of my extra fat but this is one of the few that I have ever actually liked. My favorite is the cardio axe! I just finished my first week and I lost 5 pounds! I dint even do the six day slim down thing! I am sore every day and I have a fun work out every afternoon, I love it.

Both are strength training circuits, but are not aimed at the intricate muscles that women typically need extra focus on. I am 120 pounds and 5'4\\". I have always been slim and fit but have had difficulty toning the inner thigh area. This workout leaves you sore for days after each time. I have done the \\"Bum Bum\\" workout three times now, and it is exhausting. I love the focus on the legs with tons of squats, lunges, kicks. I can't get through the entire workout without being exhausted and needing to stop for 10 seconds or so, and I have always been an athlete. If you are looking to tone those pesky areas, this workout is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a dancer","review":"love this workout, don't like the cardio. I am bad at dancing and the cardio is a lot of dance so its hard to get my heart rate up and keep it there. I substitute with p90x plyo and kenpo and the gym. For real if u work it hard.

I am however built like a boy and now that I squeezed one out recently, I guess I have the pot belly and flat butt of a man. This was NOT an easy video to follow the first few times. He does not explain the moves very well or the foot work and alignment. That being said I made it thru two weeks before overdoing it. It has made a VERY noticeable change in my butt. It is much rounder. I want give it 5 because I am really impressed as I put on my pants and glimpse myself in the mirror how much it has changed my butt. I have to deduct because it is actually a rather advanced in that you would need to already know how to safely do a sidekick, and several pilates, yoga moves and proper foot placement and \\"angles\\" as he so often mentions.

It's not an easy workout, but once you get the hang of it you'll be fine. I don't agree with few reviewers that he's difficult to understand, he has a great sense of humor and specially he explains which areas you're working and constantly reminds you to \\"squeeze\\", so you can get the max out of you efforts.The only thing is a little annoying, but no big deal, is that sometimes they will switch back and forth the background set, and when they do it doesn't show the part of the body that we are working out. However, it doesn't happen that often and once you get the hang of it you'll know what you are doing.I highly recomend it, I'm working out pretty much everyday 30-40mins, and I've seen good results!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EFFECTIVE!","review":"I really enjoy most of the dvds in this set. The only problem I had was with the cardio disc, if you can't dance, like me, it's confusing and you look like you're spasing out.

I was out of shape but not overweight. I would not say I was a beginner/beginner in fitness.

I tried a couple of the others, and they were ok, but I expected more from this company. I have the Insanity work-out, and love it, but was disappointed with this one. In my opinion, the guy who narrates the work-out is also incredibly annoying. I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth Be Told","review":"Ok, so I purchased the DVD. I'm 30 and I want to ensure my butt gradually falls not drop like a flat pancake. LOLBut seriously, this tape is a LITTLE FAST PACED. Its wonderful having a motivated instructor but they should really put the level of the individuals listed somewhere. I have to bascially build my self up and still am not near with completing one session. The moves take TIME to do correctly. They are advanced and require balance. The instructor is a ballet professional but I don't believe he really took into account the women or men that were buying this. I haven't done ballet since I was a child and probably spent a few months due to my attention span became bored.But I believe if you continue with the program you will be able to complete the series and receive effective results.So good luck to the buyers.P.S. Be patient and stop when you feel pain - Its not worth hurting yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bum-tastic!","review":"I have been blessed/cursed with an ample bottom but could definitely use some major toning.

So there you have it - what more could you want?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Week is Tough!","review":"I saw the infomercials late at night which inspired me to order the dvds. I am young, 22 years old, and am in no way overweight (5'7 and 138 lbs) but I wanted to tone all over and lift my flat butt. The guide that comes in the package gets you to evaluate what kind of butt you have and you follow a specific workout for 4 weeks given your butt type. Then the last 4 weeks is the same for everyone. I have done a weeks worth of work outs and by far the \\"bum bum\\" workout has been the most challenging for me, it's pretty up tempo and heavy on cardio. I have to pause it a few times and am dripping sweat within 10 minutes! Compared to what others have said, I think the moves are easy to follow and he gives you pointers on how to execute properly. If you think the moves aren't challenging you either aren't doing something right or you are too advanced for theses dvds and should probably do something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivered as promised","review":"Purchased this for my daughter who has tried it for a couple of weeks or so. One of the DVDs did not work in the player like it should. I notified the vendor via Amazon.com and a replacement DVD was sent to me right away.

This product is producing results as the advertising promised."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Workout","review":"I am ending my gym membership because I enjoy this set of DVDs so much. With being consistent, and incrementally adding ankle weights, and higher resistance bands to the workouts, anyone can achieve the desired results they want. Carvalho is great. I enjoy his happy attitude and he explains things in a timely way so you never need to stop and potentially miss a step. Try this, and you will not be disappointed.

I'm on my second day of the pear-shape program and I am sore like crazy! My legs tend to feel like collapsing at the 10 minute mark of Bum Bum but that's the thing with this program; you need to push yourself in order to get results. The instructor is very energetic and encourages you to push. I'm only 17 and I have thick thighs and a not-so-firm tush and ordered this when I saw this on an infomercial. It's fun and tiring. I can't help but take 2-3 one minute breaks to catch my breath but that's because I haven't worked out since November. Can't wait to finish the program and see results!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is one of the best home workouts I have ever done. Leandro's enthusiasm is contagious as are the participants in this video. The instructions are clear and multi-levelled so that they are very doable by every level of fitness. There is a timer on each video that breaks down the excercize sets as well as total workout time. Instructions appear at the bottom of the video for those that do not like to workout with music, plus include the option to turn down the music or turn up Leandro's voice. The only reason I didn't give this a 5 was that I personally find the Tummy Tuck video to be extremely difficult due to neck issues..."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I HOPED FOR","review":"If you are looking for a video that will give you a Jlo or Kim K butt, this is not it. If anything I think my butt is actually smaller than when I started. I have been exercising for years, and I was able to pass the pencil test given by this video, but I wanted my butt to look bigger. My husband, son and my son's friends were unimpressed with butts of the girls on the video. So that is a range of 23 to 46 years old. Most of the videos seem to work more your thighs than you butt muscles, and I did not have any issues with my thighs. Anyway have given it more than a 120 days, and I am totally disappointed in my results. Waited too long so I can't return so I guess I will keep doing the High and Tight and Cardio Axe DVDs. Will look for a different DVD to actually work out my butt. What a waste of $70.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners!","review":"This video is crazy hard.

I am on week 3 and can see the definition in my muscles and can feel everything changing with my shape.

It will only play in my laptop. It does have a set up menu, but will only play in Spanish.As for the workout itself, it was disappointing. Definitely will make you sweat, so that's a plus, but there is a lot of twisting of the ankles and standing up on your toes, which sucks for anyone with a previous Achilles injury.

I wasn't expecting it to work at all, but it's worked better than anything else at keeping me exercising.

I definitely felt the burn! However, some of the moves may be a little too advanced for some who are not familiar with yoga or pilates. Some of the moves are not eased into enough so that you don't throw your back out! For example, there is a backbend at the end of the Tummy Tuck DVD that could be dangerous for some who are not as limber. Overall, this is a high intensity workout (even the basics's DVD) that could potentially transform your rear end. Also, you must somewhat practice some of the workouts before you can jump into the whole routine. I say this because the workouts are pretty fast paced and you could be hastily doing some of the movements just to keep up...and this is how you get hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Butt workout","review":"If you want your butt more firm and perky, legs toned and elongated, and abs looking better than what you have now, this is the DVD for you!

You start at full speed...... advanced level. I can't understand the brazzillian that well either and he's annoying to watch. The girls are all so fit and tall I can' keep up with it.

It only holds the regular skinny bottles which we didn't use. And even then it only held 6. Plus it's huge! It took up more space than any of our countertop appliances.It's also very cheap and poorly constructed. The little amrs that flip out to hang or dry items on kept falling off and the drawers always seemed to come off track. The door also came off track every time it was opened.It just ended up being a huge waste of time, money and space.

How could the reliable professionalism of Republic Pictures take such a nosedive? Except for the villainy of Carol Forman in the title role, \\"The Black Widow\\" offers few thrills or surprises. Instead, the producers rely on its catalogue of Republic stock footage to create a \\"new\\" chapterplay. The cost-cutting is painfully obvious throughout - made worse by a largely unappealing cast.

Fabulae Romanae works best as a reader complimenting a more structured textbook-based course. It is too disorganized in its approach to grammar and vocabulary to be valuable as a primary textbook. The texts can be a good fortifier of basic skills for the more advanced student, though. Everything from ablative absolutes to supines is covered at some point. The historical blurbs are especially valuable as a more simple compliment to students who are beginning to read Livy, Cicero, and Sallust."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs","review":"Recieved the book promptly and in the condition promised.

The author has spent a good portion of his working life in preparation: studying with Tibetan artists and craftspeople; and, becoming accomplished at rendering the brush drawings in an authentic manner.

I am THOROUGHLY disappointed. I have completed the game in it's entirety in less than 3 hours of gameplay! The graphics are decent, but not that good and certainly not cutting edge. The cinematics are ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. It's hard to describe it, but they look almost foggy, as if someone smeared virtual vaseline on the virtual lens that was shooting them. I didn't have any high expectations for this game because I thought it would be like most movie-based games --really, really bad. Well, I have to say that it sinks even below those expectations.

It has major probloms installing on XP. It took me an hour before i could even play. The controls are insane. You will often get stuck in the corner of a room. In the begining you must complete pointless quests to get useless items. I looked for a lost kid for half and hour and what is my reward. A mushroom!! I tried to explore the shire but whenever you take a few steps off the path there is an invisible wall. fighting is cheasy. you go through confusing mazes and hit spiders with sticks. no mater what haptens to your allies the will never die. All they seem to do is get lost. while in moria you can barely even see what your fighting. The voices are cheesy. The balrog is barely taller than gandalf and is easy to kill. The boss of the game is a ringwrath on a bird. While on the ground it does not even try to huryt you when it is in the air shoot it three times and the game is over. anyone who bought this game should return it like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I think this game is pretty cool overall.First off, the bads. The water is sometimes there and sometimes not. You can't be Legolas or Gimli. The faces and bodies of the characters look weird. Gandalf sucks with his sword when you first get him. The game is way too short.Now for the goods. The weapons are pretty cool and the orcs, Uruk-hai, and trolls are cool too. The graphics aren't bad at all. You get to fight trolls, orcs, Uruk-hai, a barrow-wight, a Balrog, the Nazgul (Black Riders), Men, spiders, wolves, and wargs in a bunch of different environments that are pretty detailed.The bosses in this game are sometimes easy, sometimes really tough. The only real big problem with this game is that it is too short. Overall the Fellowship is a pretty good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy, too quick to the end and not worth the cost!","review":"I do not play RPG's that often. In point of fact, this game was the first I have bought in almost 2 years. Anyway, I got through it in about 5 hours total playing time. It was fun for the Tolkien fan in me while it lasted, but I was shocked when the credits started to roll. Honestly, I started on a Friday night, played about 5 hours total though the weekend an finished with the Nazgul duel on the top of the mountain at 1:00pm Sunday! Not worth the price! Although Moria and the Balrog battle was kinda cool. I did enjoy being Gandalf and using the spells on people. And, if you are having trouble getting out of the Shire, just keep trying! Hint: rocks are good decoys for the dump wraiths in this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only runs with newest video cards.","review":"Do not buy this game if you have an older PC. I have 2 PCs and I couldn't get it to run correctly on either. One of the PCs is less than a year old. When I wrote to the support people, they told me that the game does require a video card with at least 32MB of video memory (and other requirements). Mine only has 16MB. To be fair, it does say that on the box (in the small print). They should be required to put that in big letters on the front of the box. Especially since you can't return it once you've opened it. I did go out and buy a new video card (PNY Verto with nVidia GeForce4 MX 420 w/ 64MB of video memory ). Now the game seems to be running OK, but I haven't done much yet. It does look good once you get it running. I don't think it's for the hard-core gamer though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"The best thing I can say about this game is that it is mercifully short (believe it when you read reviews that say 4-6 hours of gameplay max). The user interface is terrible, the quests require no real strategy or gameplay skill, and the story was pointlessly altered. Even the cut scenes were bad. Half the scenes are animated, and half look like they were taken from that wierd 70's LOTR movie/cartoon. This is a cash-in on the LOTR franchise. Avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Sad","review":"This is the worst game i have ever played. I would rather play pong or space invaders on atari.

We're not seriously expected to pay for this program which would have been considered unimpressive five years ago. The graphics are mundane, the character movement is crude and awkward, it doesn't play full-screen (it's always in a window). The cut scenes are played by 3rd rate amateur hacks with video/audio synchronization like a dubbed martial-arts movie. The third person view constantly blocks the objects your looking for and you can't change the view to be more overhead.The graphics are so crude the program should run smoothly on a 333MHz box but its really sluggish on my 1GHz.

The graphics of the game are quite good, the story isn't bad, but there is something lacking. If I had to say where the game went wrong I'd have to say that it was to fast. Also, the AI is very poor, you can sit and shoot monsters with your rocks (Frodo), arrows(Aragorn), or spells (Gandalf) from a distance and they will stand there without moving until they die. If you want a real LOTR game go and find a copy of Interplay's LOTR and the Two Towers (see if you are strong enough to defeat the Balrog without losing Gandalf), ebay may have them (make sure they have the manual w/ them). The one plus about this game was I picked it up for 25, @ gogamer.com which wasn't that much of a waste of money as it would have been elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for TRUE Tolkien fans!","review":"I love RPGs and this is a great one! All the people complaining about camera angles have nothing to complain about because the gamer controls the camera angles.In addition, anyone who is mad about the story or the voices not being the same as the movie shouldn't have bought the game thinking it was going to be the same. The package said nothing about being \\"based on the movie.\\" Overall I was very impressed with the graphics, especially the Shire which was beautiful. I also had no problems installing or playing the game on XP. So, those of us who knew Tolkien before Peter Jackson, buy this game!

The graphics are decent but the gameplay was terrible. First they send you around the shire doing dumb little jobs. Not a very exciting way to start a video game. Then you have to escape from a black rider. This is really stupid because you have to stay like 25 feet away from him but the game places you about 5 feet away from him. Then you run around fighting enemies that are just too easy. Most of the levels are extremely pointless. In one level they actually have you finding lillies.(I'm serious) All in all a very forgettable game...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Freedom","review":"With the simply massive world of Middle-Earth, one would expect that any games based in that world would give you at least SOME freedom or nonlinear gameplay opportunities. Unfortunately, this game goes against such expectations. There are quite literally only 1-2 paths for every segment of the game. Sometimes you can not even climb some hills or walk beyond a certain point in a grass field, the boundaries are so restrictive. The content remains fairly weak as well. Graphics are decent, but nowhere near jaw-dropping. Sound is not even worth noting. Fighting with Frodo grows dull, and fighting with Gandalf's magic is too gimped. The various fights while playing Aragorn are, in my opinion, the only pluses of the entire game. Nontheless, that bumps my rating to a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Rings:The fellowship of the rings","review":"Hated this game. Even after you download the Patch there are a lot of bugs in this game. There is no plot to this game, just a lot of shooting.

First of all, it's apparent right away that this game was rushed into production. On occasion, the game simply shuts down for no reason. God forbid you should try to alt+tab to another program w/ the game paused...it shuts itself down to be safe. The feedback in your speakers from the poor sound quality gets old fast. But, the worst part is, the game is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too easy and way too short. I couldn't believe the game was over after about 8 hours of play. This game takes full advantage of the hype surrounding both of the LOTR movies and borrows on that hype to get people to buy the game. Unfortunately, the game just plain ...[very very not nice]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Game Play.. Buy the DVD instead of watching video clips","review":"Weak game.

If you've bought this, wrap it up, send it to Vivendi expressing how crap you think it is.

I purchased the lilac, and a white cover and they both go well with my nursery decor. I only wish I got more that two!These terrycloth covers are thick, absorbant and easy on my newborn's skin. The only problem I have with them is that they shrink a little when you wash them. So, when you go to put them back on the pad the fit is a bit tight, but I find they pull out pretty quickly to thier normal size. When they do finally get to small to fit the pad I will go out and buy some more! I mean it's terrycloth, what do ya expect? Besides, the darn things get all kinds of yuck on them all day.

He has a beautiful and intellingent wife called Perilla, and a \\"butler\\" who is a total snob and who in the main looks down his nose at Marcus. Another member of the family is the chef who tends to get drunk and sulk in the kitchen. I do not want to give the plot away so why not buy the book, you won't regret it. All David Wishart's books are well written and researched and the sights and sounds of Ancient Rome leap off the page at you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not up to snuff","review":"I'm a huge fan of mysteries set in Rome - but this series falls short of the rest. I liked the first couple I read, but was stunned at how the quality fell off as each book arrived. David Wishart can write, but for some reason he rambles endlessly, puts in unnecessary characters - and this from someone who loves lots of eccentric charactes in her mysteries - and generally over does the slangy casualness. I do get what the writer is after, but I don't think he achieves if except fleetingly. I have found the books frustrating, as they are almost good. Which is worse than just plain bad. Well, with the exception of the last book in the series - which was just plain bad.

Publishing a bunch of quotes don't prove jack.In one glaringly ignorant sentence he infers that published bomb-recipies are a phenomenon perpetrated solely by right-wing militia groups. Huh. On the subject of internet policing he wanders from: the idea that governments should not, to the idea that the internet is a \\"self-policing nirvana\\", to wondering how laws to prevent nazis from having websites could be enforced.

I would give them 5 Stars, except for the following: bulbs could last longer and I wish they were still available locally in stores like they were 7 years ago. One thing worth mentioning, is that the bulb won't fit the lamp housing out of the package. You need to trim one of the three tabs a speck to make it fit. Takes 20 seconds using a sharp pair of side-cutters using the original bulb as a template.For the life of me, I can't believe people would say these don't make much of a difference, unless they already have decent stock lighting or HID already.

My muffins and cupcakes come out of the pan easily.Cons: The pan absorbed the color from some muffin liners and it will not wash off. The color, although very light, is now baked into the pan. Regarding cleaning, to get the pan perfectly clean I have to use a toothpick around the grove at the top of each cup and around the edge. Also the surface doesn't seem as tough as some of my other non-stick.

Still, he's never punished for murdering someone in broad daylight. The movie is filled with poorly thought-out stuff like that. Yes, the cash character has a delicious body. However, he only shows it shirtless once and doesn't show more of the goods. If you want to see lower-than-third-rate \\"guy flick,\\" then this is for you.

THIS THING HAS A HAIR TRIGGER.","review":"Thom Doty stars as Cash in this improbable grindhouse. Cash, who was a \\"throw away baby\\" gets released from jail. His sole purpose in life is to get revenge on drug czar, club owner, and bad guy Hector Gonzales (Jerry Lloyd) who had double crossed him during a bank robbery. Meanwhile Gonzales is in a turf war with other syndicates.Cash stops at nothing to get his revenge, killing and destroying everything in his way. The acting was typical grindhouse with the usual fun tough guy statements such as \\"What are you going to do? Kill us all?\\" The film includes plenty of killing, blood, and a decapitation. For those who like inane grindhouse action, this one has it. Doty has the toughness of Seagal, but the delivery of Austin. How tough? Check out his shoulder after he was stabbed and walked around with a knife in it.

She was totally oblivious to the fact that no one saw her friend and kept calling her crazy. I also think Ivan's explanation of himself and why he had to go could have been more powerful.

I wish I had an imaginary friend just like Ivan too.I was a bit unsure of Ivan initially because there's something a bit squirly about a 6ft man playing and acting like a little boy but I soon got over that and he grew on me.

It must be a good book if I'm feeling sorry for a figment of a book character's imagination......All in all a really good book and I would recommend it for anyone that likes a weepy but feel-good book.

It is a brilliant follow-up to their first CD. It may quite possibly be on the same level as the first CD. I love each song on this CD many of the songs are just wonderful such as \\"Ten Days Late\\" and the best one \\"Slow Motion\\". Yet, every song holds its own. As it is a wonderfully produced CD and shows the talent that Third Eye Blind has! A wonderful CD that each should own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I must admit I was greatly disappointed in Third Eye Blind's follow up CD. Unlike their first album in which each of their songs were unique, the songs of Blue seem to run together.

After hearing it, i was really disapointed. There are only 3 or 4 decent songs on this album. \\"Never Let You Go\\" is the best by far. I was puzzled by the previous reviews, i'm just telling it like it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Third Eye Blind?...yeah, that's funny","review":"well, when i got this cd, i was expecting it to sound something like their first album, which i listened to Constantly! It had so much meaning to me, and i felt that it had alot of emotion-a big factor that I look for when I choose music. But, when I started to listen to Blue...I was like, \\"This can't be them\\". I didn't really care for the cd too much and thought it was too \\"poppy\\" I gave it a spin a couple more times, and it did kinda of grow on me. But, now I don't even listen to it hardly because I'm still expecting that depth that I got when I listened to that first album, and I'm not getting that with this album. So, I would try to sample it before I bought it if I were you....overall rating? so-so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars, actually...","review":"This is a good CD. I like 11/13 songs on this CD.The only songs I don't like are The Red Summer Sun, in which the first minute is all right, and then Jenkins turns into a bad impression of Little Richie or something. And the last song isn't so great. But it's definately worth buying! My favorite songs are Anything, Wounded, Deep Inside of You, & Darkness. The other songs (with the exception of those 2) grow on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"If you loved their first album like I did and still do you will be disappointed with this mess. Yes there are a FEW decent songs on here but they stray so far from their first album its almost annoying. I have tried to give this album many listens and I still cant get fully into it. Thank god I didnt pay for it(I got it as a promo)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not as good as their debut","review":"Once again Third Eye Blind does not dissapoint. 13 tracks plus a hidden song=14 great songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This CD is everything the self-titled album was and more.

They never cease to amaze me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their new Blue CD left me hanging for more...","review":"I loved their first album, but this was \\"da bomb!\\" I really liked their thoughts in these songs. Very deep, and interesting"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 for music, 1 for compatibility","review":"Less pop than their first CD, but still their style. I thought it was going to be the opposite of the style from the first CD, and though it is a little darker, it still carries songs I like to hear. Most notable are Never Let You Go, Deep Inside Of You, Darwin, and my favorite An Ode To Maybe. I would recommend this CD for those songs, though the others are nothing to cast away.One other note is I could not listen to this CD in my computer, or make a backup copy of it. I do this with all my CDs and listen to my CDs mainly on my computer, so this dismayed me. I do not know if it works with any CDROMs so who knows. But this is a major drawback to the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proving They're No One Hit Wonder...","review":"I LOVE this CD! Its sooo good! And each track is very different from every other track. Theres a wide range and 3eb does a great job of covering each type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too dull and boring to be five stars.","review":"This CD is too boring to be 5 stars. Some songs, like An Ode to Maybe, Anything, and Never Let You Go make this CD good enough to be 5 stars, but the more dull and boring songs make it worse than it should be. If you like depressing songs, this is perfect for you, but they have to liven up in the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"3EB Originality","review":"This is a great new 3EB CD because it blends some of the band's original work with new mature upbeat music. Songs like \\"Never Let You Go\\" are great examples of 3EB's fabulous work! Get the CD; you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best CD yet!","review":"Third Eye Blind struck a huge audience with the release of their first self-titled CD. Since then they have been working on improving their music. I think that they have struck an even bigger audience this time with Blue. It is filled with a good mix of rock and pop styles in songs like 10 Days Late and Never Let You Go. Deep Inside of You is a great slow song, and one of the best that I have heard. If you don't have this, and if you haven't been thinking about getting this then you're missing out on 13 songs that are worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"i thought the song never let you go was really cool-i love that song. you should definately listed to the rest-it's good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"This is an excellent album. my only complaint-the riff of \\"Never Let You Go\\" borrows from the riff of a little-known Green Day song called \\"Prosthetic Head\\" so much that its ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Eye Blind does it again!","review":"This CD is GREAT! (The only reason it has four stars is because I think their first CD is just a little better, and the unedited version of \\"Slow Motion\\" isn't on it) all the songs, except \\"Red Summer Sun\\", are excellent. \\"Never Let You Go\\" is a catchy little diddy, but it gets a little annoying after listening to it more than two times. \\"10 Days Late\\" is wonderful, as is \\"Deep Inside of You\\". \\"Slow Motion\\" is THE BEST song on this CD... well, you might not think anything of it when you just hear the instrumental version, but if you download the unedited version you'll LOVE it. \\"Wounded\\" also deserves some praise, and all the other songs are very enjoyable, although they sound like filler on the first listen, give them a few listenings then you'll find yourself singing along with them. Excellent sophomore try. I can't wait for their third CD (If they make one, which I REALLY hope they do!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Clean Fun","review":"I work at a radio station and I have been listening to this cd for about a week now. I have to say that this album is very enjoyable and seems to grow on me with every listen. It's not the most profound music ever recorded, but it has sounded good for over a week and that's enough for me considering what else is out there. Good job TEB. You've made a fine album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third eye blinded","review":"Blue has taken my love of third eye blind and rocketed it into another sphere. Third eye blind has not dissapointed me. They have matured both as musicians and as poets! This album speaks to me. Wounded and 1000 julys are by far the most amazing traks. Please buy this cd, if you ever buy another cd ever again, it has to be this one. I could listen to only this cd for the rest of my life. Earth shattering!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Follow-Up","review":"\\"Blue\\" is not even close to what Third Eye Blind achieved on their self-titled debut. Although there are a few good songs here (\\"Anything\\", \\"Never Let You Go\\", \\"Deep Inside Of You\\") most of the CD sounds as though TEB was trying too hard to repeat the success of their previous release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Eye Blind Rocks!","review":"Third Eye Blind's first album is great and this one is equally great. If you love them you have to have this cd, and even if you don't love them you should still own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sice self-titled","review":"This is the best cd I've heard since 3eb's self titled release in '97. They have added some extra edge to their music, but it keeps the amazing Third Eye Blind sound. Also, unlike a lot of modern rock bands, the lyrics on this cd actually mean something, not just jumbled words thrown on a piece of shiny plastic. Although it doesn't have any songs that are at all like \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\", there are no space fillers on this album. You'll never feel the need to press the \\"forward\\" button while listening to this Cd. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"3EB does it again","review":"While Blue doesn't jump out at you like their first release, the songs are just as good. Besides the song everybodies already heard, Never Let You Go, Wounded is the strongest track on the album. If they would just give it a chance it could go to number 1. The first 7 songs on this disc are excellent until 3EB falls flat on its face on Red Summers Sun. Why is he screeching like that? Does that take talent? And they keep shooting themselves in the foot with over-produced songs they couldn't perform live (except Slow Motion) like Camoflauge and Farther. It was a nice addition to have New Girl added in the import, although its not exactley what you would call spectacular. If you just listen to the first 7 songs this is one heckuva cd. Just turn it off after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"3eb/Blue Review","review":"Blue is an extension of the lyrical extravaganza Stephan Jenkins displayed in the first self- titled album. The music is alive, and the words of each song seem to jump out and grab the listener. Jenkins throws in a few words that may make some people uneasy, but there is an urgency in his voice as he sings the very true to life words of each track. For those of you who are being newly introduced to Third Eye Blind, both albums are worth listening to - this is a talented band, with a powerful lyricist as lead vocal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Eye Blind's great sophomore album","review":"This CD is full of wonderfully diverse songs to tap your foot to, sing along to, and share you soul with. This is one of those CDs that can be listened to straight through - you can almost hear it tell a story.For $10, it can't be beat. If you're a fan of 3eb's first album, you'll love this one. It might take a bit to get used to after the first, but it'll grow on you and become a good friend.Highly recommended. However, if you don't have 3eb's eponymous album, I'd recommend getting that one first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"third eye blind is one of the worst artists on the rock scene today, just bad. Don't waste your money, (get the new weezer album when it comes out in the fall.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment--get their debut instead","review":"Words cannot express my dismay at this album. Their debut to me was a five-star masterpiece of pop-rock. It was simple, but good. Somehow, 3EB has managed to keep essentially the same sound (simple hooks, singable choruses) yet this album is so much worse.The passion and energy of the first album are gone. When Stephan Jenkins sings \\"I'll never let you go,\\" it's like a wimpy pop ballad gone wrong; when he sings about his girl being \\"Ten days late,\\" it's unconvincing and flat. Song after song on this album have that unmistakeable sound yet they all fail to match the power of the first album. I might have given it 2 stars if it weren't such a BIG let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare to be disappointed","review":"Although Blue has a few worthwhile songs (Wounded, 1000 Julys), it is best described as a vomit-inducing decaying pile of ... . (To put it lightly) The poetic lyrics and mellow instrumentals that defined Third Eye Blind as more than just another mainstream rock band have been traded in for empty babblings that have relatively no artistic value. In fact, many of these songs made me doubt Jenkins' sanity. Does he really feel that strongly about basketballs, or did he simply need a cheap rhyme? Although this album may appeal to a larger group of people, it is defintely a step down from the lyrical genius that was Third Eye Blind pre-Blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compareable to their debut album.","review":"I must say, there was evidence of hard-work, but Third Eye Blind just couldn't pull it off. No songs grabbed my attention like Semi-Charmed Life, Graduate, or How's It Gonna Be. Jenkins sometimes broke out into an annoying wine, and a high-pitched sound that was a bit annoying. The only two songs that I enjoyed were \\"Anything\\" and \\"Never Let You Go\\", and still these songs didn't spark anything inside of me. One of the things that absolutely shocked me is that one of their songs has a vulgar and horrible meaning! Slow Motion (on their album) is about wife-beating and the alike! Another thing is that, most bands I like I stay loyal to, so I automatically like their songs, but this album didn't make me stay loyal to 3eb. I prefer their debut album.If you haven't gotten their debut album, get it, it is much better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cada vez que lo oigo me gusta más","review":"Ciertamente este cd no es como el anterior de éste, mi grupo favorito, Pero no porque el otro tenga mejores canciones, sino porque éste es menos comercial. En Blue no hay \\"semicharmed life\\" con un estribillo pegajoso, ni canciones que suenan y suenan en la radio, pero sí hay excelentes canciones que te maravillan más y más cada vez que lo oyes y te hacen dar cuenta que ésta fue una buena inversión. LA genialidad de ésta banda se hace presente en Anything, Wounded, ampliamente en 10 days late, 10.000 julys, slow motion, es decir, en todo el cd, hasta en i never let you go. Si estabas pensando en comprartelo, no vale la pena que lo pienses, comprálo y ya, te aseguro no te arrepentirás.

I bought the import version thinking that it would have full version, but no go... good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Follow-Up","review":"\\"Blue\\", Third Eye Blind's second studio album, is really not even comparable to their self-titled debut. Although there are a few bright spots (\\"Anything\\", the CD's best song, and \\"Deep Inside Of You\\"), most of the CD sounds forced and too much like the debut (\\"Never Let You Go\\" being a perfect example). All in all a very disappointing result from a band that appears to be in some trouble, with this CD and with the departure of guitarist Kevin Cadogan."},{"rating":"2","title":"3EB IS ON TOP!","review":"OK People, no joke this album is the greatest ever! Each song is awesome! This is such a good use of $17.00! For real! INVEST! Plus the concert version is soo much better than the CD version! My advice: buy the CD, memorize the songs, and check these guys out in concert cause you will love it! They put on an awesome show...you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second album a disappointment","review":"I have long been a fan of Third Eye Blind and considered it one of my favorite bands. I enjoyed their first album immensely and listened to it many times. Though people complained about their rough sound, I appreciated the pure rock of \\"Third Eye Blind\\". \\"Blue\\", however, is completely different. 3EB's crossover into pop is a disappointment to me. Their style has changed immensely. (One or two of the songs even faintly reminded me of Savage Garden) Though I can see how that might appeal to many new people, it's a different audience than the fans of the old Third Eye Blind. Frankly, the thrill of the old 3EB is gone, replaced with a more \\"acceptable\\" (albeit boring and cliched) sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"troubled","review":"I like 3eb. But as i browsed the lyrics of the new album, I couldnt help but feel that the band was pushing what they had so that they could get an album out before christmas. Its still 3eb but songs like \\" 10 days late \\" are horrible. imagine sitting down and writing a song like that. there has been alot of conversation about the edited track \\" slow motion \\". The morons at the record company strike again, keeping meaningful music out of the ears of America. Everyone needs to hear this song, personally I can live without the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen more than once!","review":"WOW! Have the SF guys bitten off more than they can chew? At first listen, one might think just that. But, hold on kids, fasten those seatbelts and hit \\"repeat\\" on your CD player. ALthough \\"Blue\\" is not filled with hooks like the first album (although I have to admit that \\"Anything\\" has been running thru my head all day!) it pays off big. The guys aren't afraid to take some chances and have fun and you can hear the result. No instant classics here that you listen to for a week and then tire of. Each song has a personality of it's own. But, can they still Rock? Hell Yeah! And they can also dazzle with slow tempo gems like \\"Slow Motion\\". This is definately a \\"must have\\" this holiday season. But again, please give it a few listens OK?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"Well, I really can't compare it with their self-titled debut, that was a classic, one of the best albums I've ever listened to. I don't know if they will ever top that. If you're reading this and don't have the first album, go out and buy it first! That said, this is a very good album in it's own respects. Most of the songs are catchy and thoughtful, and as usual Kevin Cadogan's guitar playing rocks. Stephen's voice ain't too bad either, he actually sounds better in a lot of these new songs, although that's probably because the old ones had quite a different mood. All in all, this is more great music from Third Eye Blind, and even if it can't compare to the original it's still damn good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore Slump......","review":"What a shame..... The first is album is great from end to end but \\"Blue\\" fails to live up to its predecessor. There are only about 3 or 4 solid songs on this CD. The album is self-produced and it shows. There is some really bad(see experimental) vocal work on it (\\"An Ode To Maybe\\" and \\"The Red Summer Sun\\") that probably would have been cut by a decent producer. The majority of the songs fall under \\"experimental\\" and the result is a disjointed, disappointing second CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't surpass the first","review":"while not bad, this CD is not as good as 3EB's debut. Some songs are really good, like \\"Deep Inside of You\\", and \\"Never Let You Go\\". Also, the instrumental \\"Slow Motion\\" is suprisingly good. A lot of 3EB fans are going to be disappointed in their sophomore album, and rightfully so......they seem to be more \\"pop\\" now, rather than the more \\"alternative\\" they were before. Overall, it is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT sophomore album","review":"I was afraid of buying this CD for one reason--I was convinced that I'd be disappointed in it because Third Eye Blind's first CD was SO good that I thought that anything else that they made would not be able to stack up...boy was I wrong! The instant I heard it begin to play my fears were wiped away and I love this new album! My favorites are Wounded and Never Let You Go, but the rest are all good as well. I predict that Never Let You Go will be a major hit on the charts soon enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd rules","review":"all i have to say is that this cd rules.

To my ears, Blue doesn't share this balance. It is heavy, thick, and loud, but not clever or fun. Jenkins and company have great skill and I'm eager to see future releases, but this didn't live up to my hopes.

I would have to say that it is not as good as their first album, but it is by no means a bad album--even if you aren't a 3EB fan. Furthermore, very few bands with an immensely successful first album, put out a second album that is better than the first. Blue has some songs that are of the familiar 3EB style, some that are a bit more punk-like, and couple that were, well different, two in fact that just flat out s@#ked. The rest of the songs however, were awsome. I have to say that the first 6 tracks are by far the best songs on the CD. There is also a very good intrumental on piano and guitar by Stephan Jenkins called Slow Motion. If you are a Third Eye Blind fan, then I say buy this CD, and if you like the single anything (which is way to short) then buy this CD because there are some better songs on it, that aren't quite so short"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great rock album....","review":"....one of the most important things when I buy an album is that I don't want it to sound common ( ie., the new Tonic cd )....I don't like background music....well, BLUE is FAR from background music.....I THOUGHT I had written off 3EB after the first album, and couldn't believe it when I saw the video for \\"Never Let You Go\\" -- these guys were actually rocking out on MTV...they had the sound...the look...things that have been lacking severely in the last 10 years....3EB takes on a big rock sound that keeps things from ever getting common....the guitars and drums are louder, Stephen's voice is much stronger and more distinctive, and the songs are catchy AND edgy, like classic Cheap Trick....."},{"rating":"2","title":"thuird eye blind rocks!","review":"after the great debut, they are experimenting one more time with a great and simple rock.Standout songs: anything, 10 days late, never let you go and ode to maybe!I didn't rate it as five stras because some songs are boring and very repetitive, but it is still excellent BUY IT NOW, DONT LOSE TIME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Songs","review":"Blue is a very good CD and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a variety of music.

It is one of my favorite CDs. 'Blue' doesn't even come close to this. It is just another example of bad pop music. It lacks poetry and intelligence. On the first album, each song set a certain mood and had a certain emotion. This album has no emotion at all. When I listened to it the first time I was actually annoyed by it. You can't even hear what Stephen Jenkins is singing about on half the album.

This album directly addresses life's trials and tribulations. it, like most sophomore albums, is over-studioed. this aspect fades a bit with the third album, but it seems to work with the style of most of these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Its such a good effort covering many different genres. What makes 3eb different from other bands is that theyre not affraid to not have a specific type of music...theyre not afraid to experiment. You can listen to a 3eb cd and not get bored by the same type of music over and over again. Blue carries on this tradition in an outstanding way. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"just when you thought they couldn't get any better","review":"if you liked 3EB's freshman effort, you will love this one. A lot of songs along their original style but more complex and more depth to their sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS","review":"This CD is one of the best ones released in 1999, like Smash Mouth's Astro Lounge, The Pepper's Californication, or Limp Bizkit's Signifiant Other. My favourite song is \\" NEVER LET YOU GO \\". I suggest you buy BLUE it's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"This album was different then Third Eye Blind. Blue is a mix of rock songs mostly. The debut had more pop. The debut was better because it was a mix of pop and rock. The songs mostly are good though but I reccomend Third Eye Blind more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as their first","review":"When I bought this, I knew it wouldnt be better than their first album. It is probably impossible for them to ever make an album that good. On this album, you can tell they have matured in music writing. This is more deep with emotion. I think Camouflage is the coolest song on the album. It is a little wierd, but cool. Their is a lot of variety on this album. Every song doesnt sound the same. Thats what I admire about Third Eye Blind, they make their music so different from other bands. They have thier own original sound. The best song is probably 1000 Julys. It is a fast hard hitting song. If you have this album, and not their first one, you have to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as their first album.","review":"3EB ceases to amaze me. All of their songs are great, no matter whetether they are played on the radio or not. I love the song Never Let You Go, and many of the other songs on this album have the potential to be a big hit. Unlike the Backstreet Boys, who can't write songs fast enough so they just push out old peices of junk as \\"hits\\" to take up time until they make a new album. Thier last \\"hit\\" was on the charts for about 3 weeks, and now they have a new \\"hit.\\" 3EB, however, make songs that stay on the charts for months at a time, and people still like the songs after their initial success is over. This is true of their first hit, Semicharmed Life, which people still listen to even after being out for 3 years, unlike the BSBs, whose songs people forget about after 3 months. This CD is great, and I'm sure I'll be out to get 3EB's next CD when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok for teens, not mature enough for adults","review":"This CD is okay music-wise, but the lyrics are depressing! I don't know how anyone could enjoy a song like Ten Days Late, which is about an unwanted pregnancy, and the immature, selfish reaction to it.Deep Inside of You is almost as bad. 3eb often writes about pathetic, manipulative relationships.There is nothing good, happy or spiritual to listen to here. It is all about obssesion with carnality and the misery that lifestyle creates.If you are a teen go ahead and buy this CD. You may be able to relate, but if you are an adult pass! This stuff is beneath you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Something exciting in a world of boring music!","review":"The one thing I really love about Third Eye Blind's second c.d. \\"Blue\\" is that it's so much different than the rest of the boring music world. It's alternative rock with it's somewhat pop-like textures and phsycadelicness are far more exciting than Korn's new sellout c.d. \\"Issues\\". I also like to see that Third Eye Blind's maturing. I loved their debut (more than \\"Blue\\" in fact), but if they would have tried to duplicate it, they would have gotten boring. \\"Blue\\" is anything but sophomore slump. It's great! My only complaint is that Elektra made them edit their song \\"Slow Motion\\" because of it's reference to drugs and violence. It's an excellent song, but i've read the full lyrics and it would sound so much better with them. I can't wait until their E.P. \\"Black\\" comes out in the summer (hopefully). It will feature the unedited version of \\"Slow Motion\\". If you like \\"Blue\\", try Third Eye Blind's self-titled debut. It's even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Blue\\" isn't no \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\"","review":"Third Eye Blind's sophomore effort \\"Blue\\" is pretty good, but that's it. There are quite a few good hit singles that can be squeezed out of it, like \\"Wounded\\" \\"10 Days Late\\" and \\"Deep Inside of You.\\" But of course there are some songs theycould have done without (ie: \\"Red Summer Sun\\"). They show to be a bit more experimental than they were with their first album (ie: \\"Camouflage\\" and \\"Slow Motion\\"), but the content of the songs show no growth. They use pretty much the same verse-writing techniques that they used on their first album. Still the album is very good, and you will probably like it, especially if you were fond of their first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue - Thir Eye Blind","review":"I LOVE this CD.

I like the concepts she uses, and I do apply pyramiding to some of my routines, but some exercises (as she says in Bottoms Up) you'll find you can pyramid, and some you can't. So true!I also liked the VERY sensible nutrition plan, but 'Bottoms Up' I think is a much, much more comprehensive book on fitness and nutrition than 'Now or Never'. She goes into much more detail on both topics. I wish I had gotten this one first!Ah well - they're both good books, just if you're a beginner, start with Bottoms Up! If you're looking for a challenge and want to add a wollop to your workout - get Now or Never. :)But all in all, I really like Joyce Vedral's book so far, and plan on checking out 'Hardbodies' she co-authored with Gladys Portuguese :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pete and Pete Rules","review":"At last I've found the theme song for The Adventures of Pete and Pete!!!!

I also question the authors idea of a portion size. While she mentions 4 oz of protein, her recipes are much larger: Peppered Jack Daniel's Steak which claims to serve two calls for 4 rib eye steaks. The fish recipes for two call for anything from 1 1/2 to 2 lbs of fish.The menu suggestions for dinners for two contain all those serves 6-10 people recipes.

Besides relating dozens of stories of real gunfights the author acutally gets inside the head of the gunfighter and tries to figure out what made him tick. The reader learns for example that it usually wasn't who drew the fastest that won the gunfight but rather who had the greater nerve and time enough to aim.It's also amazing just how many shots were fired in the typical gun fight. And how many of those shots usually missed their mark. A testiment to just how much nerve and steadiness entered into the equation. I found the details such as where bullets hit and what types of guns mankillers preferred and why to be invaluable.I highly recommend this book.

The Bowie version was great, but the sound was tinny and hollow; Iggy restores the heavy bass and gives the whole package a much meatier sound. The new version packs a heavier punch than the Sex Pistols, the Dolls, the Ramones or anybody else who followed in the Stooges' footsteps. Sure, there are a few things that will take getting used to - for instance, the celeste parts in \\"Penetration\\" - but after several listens, these things stop sounding out of place.

Seriously, this album is ruined by digital distortion -- you could just as easily have \\"restored\\" the old CD yourself by running it through a cheap guitar distortion pedal. Actually, the result probably would have been better.The CD doesn't sound \\"modern,\\" it doesn't sound \\"hot,\\" it doesn't \\"rock.\\" There are no dynamics at all on this version, everything is maximum volume and distorted all the time. So in the climax of the song, when Iggy screams, it's no louder than when the song started, leaving a person completely unmoved. By then most people have tuned out the song anyway, since the lack of dynamics causes a loss of interest. Stay away from this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not \\"cheetah\\" and it's not \\"hide full\\"","review":"It's \\"I'm a street walkin' cheater with a heart full of napalm\\". Had to get that off my chest. Now, this album is beyond essential. 'Raw Power' is as great a rock and roll song as any ever written. 'Gimme Danger' out-Doors the Doors. 'Search and Destroy' out Dead Boys the Dead Boys. Every single song on this album is revelatory. Now, this mix. Well, hell, of course it's better. It's how the album is supposed to sound, as determined in Iggy's head, not by Bowie. It's great, it's exciting, it'll change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet Rock & Roll","review":"Another reviewer on Amazon, discussing a different album, stated that the album he was reviewing would be the one he would use to introduce an alien to Rock & Roll music for the first time. That is an interesting question, and to my own surprise, one I immediately had my own answer to.Iggy & the Stooges' 'Raw Power' is not my all-time favorite album. However, I do believe that it is the very essence of everything that makes me love rock music. The bad attitude, the feeling that it will all explode into a violent mess at any second, the distorted, kick-to-the crotch mix, and the menacing lyrics all say, \\"this is rock.\\"I would not end an introduction to rock music with Raw Power, but I think the argument can be made that this is one of the best places to start.Come to think of it, maybe Raw Power is my all-time favorite album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably Iggy's best stuff","review":"While this is not only some of Iggy's best work, this is (in my opinion) one of the greatest albums ever. Search and Destroy is a great album opener and the album either stays consistently good if not better as it goes on. Songs like Gimme Danger and Raw Power are songs that should be viewed as classics but are sadly over looked. While this album might be an acquired taste to some, it is a taste worth acquiring and this is a great album in every sense. A classic a five star album and above all a must listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st Generation Ig Fans - WATCH OUT (still great music, BUT...","review":"whoa - I found that THIS Raw Power is not the same as the import vinyl I had back \\"then\\". STILL a killer CD - BUT If you're an Iggy fan from back in the day - be careful - some of these new \\"remastered\\" CDs don't seem to be the same; especially THIS ONE .... He'll always sound good to me, but either the songs are different on the CD or they just don't sound the same - As a matter of fact, I'm going to stick to watching/listening to various versions (live, tv, old vids) of the same songs on the internet ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Loud Masterpiece","review":"Raw Power is one of the Stooges craziest albums, and Iggy Pop did a good job updating David Bowie's version. Search and Destroy, the opener song, is my favorite. The closing Death Trip is a good song that lasts for a long time. The Stooges had a big influence on punk bands like the Damned and Dead Boys who covered their songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best unreleased tracks not on this, live sound is mediocre","review":"The best unreleased tracks will be on the 3 CD \\"Deluxe Edition\\" which will retail at over $60! That's a rip off and a good reason to pass this up. All you really get here is the Atlanta show, but the sound quality isn't fantastic - the piano is louder than either guitar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"jimmy, jimmy & the leaking log cabin","review":"why get mutt lange to digitally enhance gregorian monk chants? when he first started wailing in a dearborn trailer park i'll bet osterburg thought there would never come a day when he would tour with a man called ben laden in a town called belfast. you cannot fix what's not broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This CD is not as good as you may have heard. It's not what I would call revolutionary--terrible lyrics, inept playing, and an overall muddy sound make this nearly unlistenable. A few good moments but too much crap to slog through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic, run of the mill pop punk","review":"I went shopping for some tapes at the local thrift store. Some dopey looking teenager was working there and asked if I was looking for anything. I said \\"Yeah, do you have any cool punk tapes? Like a Good Charlotte bootleg?\\" and he just laughed. He said \\"Girl, this is real punk!\\" and handed me some tape with a tranny on the cover called \\"Raw Power\\". It was only 25 cents so I bought it. And YUCK! This album is pretty much as run-of-the mill as you can get. Nothing special about this album at all. Real punk is Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\", not this untalented crap made by ProTools. Don't listen to it, EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY BECAUSE IT IS NOT A QUALITY PRODUCT","review":"This is garbage because of one thing ... the production and mix are truly awful. It sounds like you are listening to this through a transister radio, underwater and 100 yards away. It was purposely recorded that way.This is 3 chord rock and there is nothing special about them. With other punk/garage bands, you heard the same chord progressions and time signatures infinite times but with better recordings.I like some of Iggy Pop's material but I do not get it with this one. I know that this is regarded as a classic by a lot of critics I just don't get it.You should stay away because I cannot imagine anybody having repeated listenings of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 57 stars","review":"This is the greatest rock n roll album ever made. Period. If you don't own this you don't own anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Punk Record, In My Opinon Anyway","review":"Listening to Raw Power makes me hate the garage rock-revival scene. It all sounds so safe and so carefully calculated, thus completely losing the amaturishness and spontaniety that made garage rock so lovable. Raw Power is garage rock torn apart and reassembled in the most haphazard way possible. And that's a compliment. It's the first punk record: abrasive, uncomprimising, dirty, violent, and unpretentious. Iggy Pop alternates between a nasal drawl and a jagged bark. Ron Asheton's guitar completely obliterates everything in its path. This is what rock n' roll was meant to be, and it has everything that rock lost when it became a marketable commodity. It's sloppy and filthy and perfect. You know that a record has to be great when even a \\"ballad\\" like \\"Gimme Danger\\" rocks harder than the entire output of most modern punk bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album will blow your mind","review":"The very first time i heard this record, I finally realized what true punk rock was. Raw Power is simply one of the finest creations of rock and roll ever made, remix or no remix. The title fits the music perfectly: it's more raw, explosive, and primitivly emotional than anything else. Iggy is truly a god! Sad that most of the young people today have no idea who The Stooges are; they are missing a glorious piece of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable, literally","review":"I think iggy is playing a bit of a joke on us with this one. The volume is all the way down on this recording, so you have to crank your speakers up all the way. The treble is all the way up, and the bass is all the way down. Some of the guitar solos also seem to have a drastic increase in the already jacked up treble, making for a harsh squeeking noise that actually hurts your ears. It's like listening to AM radio on a small transistor radio with a 2 inch speaker. It really sounds like an awful quality live bootleg, and I'm not talking about the bonus live disc it comes with. The volume of the vocals also fluctuates wildly, and most of \\"Gimmie Danger\\" has no drums, just a hi-hat and cymbals. This is a drastically different mix from the original 1973 bowie mix. At times this recording resembles the screeching sounds heard on albums by Throbbing Gristle. Either listen to the original or the 1997 remastered/remixed version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life Imitates Art--Spinal Tap redux!","review":"Iggy (or whoever really remixed Raw Power) apparently didn't realize that the filmmakers of Spinal Tap were joking about turning up the amps to 11. All these vandals accomplished was to wipe out a good portion of the signal and make this cd unlistenable at normal volumes. As others have stated, Iggy and the Stooges were the proto-punk of their day. Way to trash a historical document, guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surfboard Wall Rack","review":"This product served its purpose, hung my old board on it. I was however, disappointed because some of the pieces on the wood were chipped and scratched, largely in part due to the packaging (which was terrible). This was very noticable because the chipped and scratched parts were white and stood out against the brown varnish.Won't be ordering from this company again, they had to have seen these damages before they shipped it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction, Terrible Design","review":"I have no idea who left these other reviews but the product I received was a cheaply made import that would not even hold up my 7'10\\" Tuflite without ripping two holes in my wall (not to mention my surfboard falling off). There are two bolts connecting the base of the rack to the \\"hook\\" and those bolts have a substantial convex head that prevent the rack from aligning flush against the wall. Additionally, there is only one small bolt hole to mount each rack to the wall. Even with a Molly Bolt, the racks ripped right out of the wall. This product is poorly constructed and, in my opinion, dangerous. Do not risk damaging your board and your walls with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK product if you are a handyman!!","review":"I had a 500K home with a bar. unfortunately, the builder did not provide a wine rack. I bought this item along with a red oak stem ware rack from another manufacturer. My bar cabinets are dark cherry stained. I attached the stemware rack below this and stained to match. It necessitated some precision cuts and some carpentry skills and the painful staining to match my existing cabinets. Also, I did not get any directions with this. Except that, the product quality is OK and it feels solid. Also beware that if you are trying to mount a stemware set like I did, there is some chance that sometimes the wine bottle can slip and break the bottoms (where it is hanging from) of your costly goblets. I have learnt it the hard way. Now I am very careful with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work!","review":"The item I ordered was delivered much faster than I expected.

David Poyer's research and knowledge, coupled with his ability to capture personalities and frame events is unmatched. I've been in the Navy for 38 years, and have never found a better writer about issues relating to the Sea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good solid Civil War read","review":"I came to this after reading James L. Nelson's latest novel, \\"Glory in the Name,\\" so there was some danger in getting too much of a good thing. Both books are about the naval fronts of the Civil War, but that is where the likenesses between the books begins to end. This is solid good stuff, and it's obvious that Poyer has done his homework. If you like Nelson's book, which squeaks out this one by just a nubbin because of Nelson's great sense of humor, you will probably enjoy the further advntures of Custis Claiborne in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series is OK at best IMO","review":"I have read all three in the series and it was a long drawn out struggle to finish. Poyer displays his great knowledge of events, sailing, and personal drama. If you are not a nut for detailed sailing and weak drama, then you may not like this book and series, because action is lacking. I have also read James Nelson Civil War Naval books and enjoyed them. This series is boring at times and had me flipping pages until something interesting occurs - it could be alot of pages.This is civil war naval stuff - a war that is not known for much naval action, except for a handful of events. As you can guess, our heroes hit all the main events, that is one event per book. The first is Sumter, then Raiders, and finally Hampton Roads.The series appears to have stopped. Likely because it is hard to keep anything interesting going. The only thing left to cover is river battles. At the used prices, I got what I paid for and an OK read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal!","review":"I love this scent and very excited to see it on Amazon at quite a discount compared to department stores.

I am an aircraft mechanic and these are the perfect blend of protection and dexterity. I tried the fast fit, and while good too, they don't fit as tight as these do. Any other pair of Mechanix get to thick and you lose the ability to pick up that washer that just fell on the ground, but these you can actually expect to be able to pick it up. These stood up to 12 hour days 7 days a week for over 2 months working on airplanes in Afganistan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never thought I'd write a review of a work glove","review":"I never thought I'd write a review of a work glove but I've found that Mechanix work gloves are so thoughtfully designed that they deserve special mention.They're available in a range of sizes for both men and women so that they fit like a, um, glove. Unlike the \\"one size fits nobody\\" no-name leather gloves that I used to use these still allow me to operate tool triggers and controls, handle smaller nails and screws, and perform delicate tasks while still having my hands protected from splinters and scrapes.I also like the velcro wrist closure. When I'm working working outside the closure prevents dirt and debris from collecting in the cuff and falling into the glove.I think the best thing I can say about Mechanix gloves is that they don't get in the way. They're not a necessary evil -- they're something you'll want to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"New style???","review":"I have small hands and the small utility gloves where perfect for a tight fit, but Mechanix changed the look and fit of their gloves and the fingers are too long and the gloves are not as tight.

Too bad they changed my favorite gloves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than my previous Mechanix gloves","review":"If you are looking for good a lightweight work glove, these are the best I've ever had. I had an older style of Mechanix work gloves that I used for doing yard work (mowing, raking, etc. They finally wore out and I ordered these.

Ambani's were the most visible business family from India in 80s. Everyone knows that powerful political connections are responsible for the meteoric rise of the ambani business empire. What the book talks about are many issues, which were kept under the carpet and never ever spoken in public. It is a very interesting reading.Anyone who is interested to learn how business can be done in India, especially before the privatization, must read this book. The link between politics and business is very powerful and though it may have diminished a little in today's India, it is not completely gone.I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to analyze the strengths of Indian business environment as an emerging country and wish to do business in India."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reading","review":"And I thought how great Ambani really was, that I knew everything about fairfax issue, the Indian politicians etc. I was wrong! Read this book to get an insight as to why an average Indian businessman thinks that one has to take a 'twisted' route to be successful. And why you can't realy blame them - especially the players during license raj. Though Hamish has tried to write a biography of Ambani, this book suffers from a major handicap - most of the 'revealing' things are not backed by the source of that information. But I would recommend this to those who are intrested to have closer look at the wheelings-dealing of politicians, businessmen and the mafia.

Produced by Mitch Easter (the guy that produced R.E.M.'s Murmur album and frontman for the band Let's Active), the Connells present these dark, beautiful, haunting folk-rock tinged songs. \\"I Suppose\\" is one of the standout tracks, with shimmering, chiming guitars, and \\"Over There\\" uses brass to great effect. The melodies are strong throughout, and the whole thing has an atmosphere somewhat reminiscent of R.E.M.'s Murmur. A great, overlooked album, and one of the best of the '80s in my opinion.

The guitar and keyboard solos are insane. The vocals are good but not great and their drumming is impecable. Still, through all of this there is something missing on \\"Hate Crew Deathroll\\". Maybe they have just become too good and they cant reach a higher plateau. I dont know what it is but this is not their best album. Musically maybe, but not as a whole. I recommend \\"Follow the Reaper\\". That album is flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bodom disc, but not the best so far.","review":"Still a solid release from this band, Hate Crew Deathroll is the last full album Children of Bodom have produced since their masterpiece \\"Follow The Reaper\\". The vocals are just as hard and aggressive as those on their previous release, but the songs sound a bit more similar on this CD. This is the only reason I give it four stars, instead of five. The songs \\"Needled 24/7\\", \\"Bodom Beach Terror\\" and \\"You're Better off Dead\\" are all stand out tracks. None rival COB's best song \\"Everytime I Die\\", from their previous album. This is, nevertheless, a solid offering. It is recommended for any fan of melodic death metal or black metal. The vocals are just as good as those in \\"Follow the Reaper\\", if not better, but the general emotional intensity of the songs is not as present as it was in \\"Follow the Reaper\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bodom does it again!","review":"Hails to these finnish dudes!Again another awesome release by truly one of the best finnish bands out there....and finland spawns plenty.I would say this album is more brutal then follow the reaper, Keys are less dominant and the drumming is more noticable.Songs are still catchy as ever... but some lack the classical guitar/keys battles that is found in earlier bodom.Standout tracks are Needled 24-7,Sixpounder,Lil' Bloodred Ridin'Hood,Bodom Beach Terror,Hate Crew Deathroll.Would have given it 5 stars but again the lack of technical guitar work compared to earlier work brings the score down.still a very kick ... album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bodom is Best","review":"This is a masterpiece. A perfect blend of thrash, power, and black metal. This Bodom cd in particular seems to be my favorite. It is a bid slower paced with tons of technicality.Alexi \\"Wildchild\\" Laiho is definately the star here although Janne Wirman is close behind as he is respected as one of metal's best keyboardists. Alexi has a great style of guitar that mixes the tapping of Van Halen, sweeps of Malmsteen, speed of Rusty Cooley, and squealing of Zakk Wylde and thats why this guy is my favorite. This album is a must as is every other Bodom, Sinergy, and Warmen album."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD FROM THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD!!!","review":"I own four Children of Bodom cds, Hate Crew Deathroll, Follow the Reaper, Hatebreeder, and Something Wild, and Hate Crew Deathroll is the BEST. I saw them in concert with Dimmu Borgir and let me tell you Children of Bodom, not even the main act, stole the show. They are incredible. The concert left me amazed, I was getting emotional because they only had 1/2 hour to play. They were so amazing. These guys have worked hard and made this wonderful album for all metal lovers ou there. Do yourself a favor and buy it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short review :D","review":"From a TexanIn short these guys used to be... well... like metal gods to me. THEY ROCKED!!! But sadly Children Of Bodom (this is the part where you cringe from the reviewer's discust) grew old to me within like 2 years, sadly. So although they are pretty great, soon they will turn stale, kinda like what nu metal does. But still this review shoundn't turn you away from this album if your like... not a very old metalhead, like lets say if your less than a few years old to metal you'll probably love Children Of Bodom to say they are like THE GREATEST!!! So yea, if you like the thought of a metal band having melodic influences in it, then you'll love this band (oh yea, some girls I know love this band also cause of Alexi Laiho's hotness haha). The older metalhead dudes might ummm wanna go the other way n check out Negura Bunget, Drudkh, Agalloch,Orphaned Land,Isis,Krisiun, and Vader. Peace y'all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Guitaring, Lousy Vocals","review":"Alexi Laiho is a guitar virtuoso. He is simply of the greatest metal guitarists out there. But his vocals are simply crap. I borrowed HTD yesterday and was floored by the riffs and the solos. But the vocals were a major turnoff. I recommend this to those kids who just need a reason to praise any kind of death/black/doom metal just because it sounds different than regular heavy metal.Highlight: Alexi Laiho's guitar work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The road leading to perfection","review":"True - this is not Tristania's best CD.True - this one only had four tracks.But if I told you you still get value for your money - wouldn't that say something about the quality of the music?

The price was exceptional for new product. not to mention a christmas cd that so many of my relatives wanted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Metal & Christmas??? YES!!!","review":"It has been a long time since I have heard a Christmas album that had me smiling from the beginning and laughing through the whole thing. This one did it. If anyone thought it wasn't possible to combine full-bore heavy metal and Christmas carols, Twisted Sister has proven it can be done -in a solid, highly entertaining album. I won't add much more since there are already so many well-written reviews here, but a quick answer to one question. As far as I know, Dee Snyder IS Jewish - so what, lots of Jewish performers have performed Christmas songs. Listen closely to O Come All Ye Faithful, to the little riff of a very traditional Jewish song they slip in at the end. This album really does rock the holiday! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"I bought this CD after watching the band perform \\"Come All Ye Faithful\\" on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. What a catchy tune!!!! And the whole CD has turned these Christmas classics upside down and for the good, I might add. The \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" riffs on the above mentioned song feel like they were always part of the song. I can't see my family being too keen if I put this on at the holiday party, but if you want to rock out with friends who understand, get this! You will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocking Good Xmas","review":"This is what a rock xmas CD should be. Songs you know but beefed up with metal rock and roll. Much better than other so called rock xmas CDs. The 12 days of heavy metal christmas is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Metal Xmas","review":"I have to admit that this is a pretty interesting Christmas cd. I expected a bunch of Christmas songs with the heavy touch from TS and that would have been fine in itself. But, there's a little more here than that. Each classic Christmas song is revved up TS style and also includes recognizable guitar riffs and/or drum parts from some of Twisted's more popular songs. Out of the few hard rock Christmas cd's out there, this is the best one yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Rocks!","review":"Twisted Sister really does a great job on this Christmas album. Every song is great. The last one has comic value, but then again, there is Twisted Sister doing \\"I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus\\", don't they all? If you like hard rock drums and guitars while enjoying some X-mas carolls, then you will LOVE this! And it was cheap. Get the DVD to go with it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a Great Christmas album for anyone who like Metal and Christmas songs.Or just anyone who is a Twisted Sister fan.My boyfriend loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool X-mas Music","review":"I would highly recommend Twisted Sisters Chrismas album to anyone who has thought the old standby carols were getting old. My family enjoyed the comic ladden lyric and music. Who does not like a little hard rock at Christmas time, that's what I want to know :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Rocks like the 80s!","review":"Twisted Sister plays Christmas songs as if other rockers from the 80s were playing them! Fun album and really gets people talking at the Christmas party!Twisted Sister plays \\"Silver Bells\\" like they think AC/DC would, and it ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe it or not, this is actually a good album.","review":"Many will probably dismiss this album as a novelty, and it IS a novelty to some extent, but it's really so much more. EVERY ONE of the 15 or so people who I've played it for has said the same thing: \\"Wow. This is actually GOOD!\\" Some even went so far as to say that it was a good album in its own right... let alone a good Christmas album (which it is).Honestly, it's clear that some thought actually went into the arrangement of the songs; this is NOT a slip-shot attempt at making a quick buck. If you like Hairbands at all, and you like Christmas music, this will be the centerpiece of your holiday playlist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why make a christmas album!!!","review":"This album sucks. I was so dissapointed when it turned out to be a christmas album. A metal christmas is right up my ally but i wanted a new studio album from TS with new meteral not a lame christmas album. Hopefully they will make a new \\"real\\" album, they need to after this, they can't end their metal legacy with this tripe.Please TS make another studio album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"I'm gonna make this review short and sweet. For quite a while I have been looking for a Christmas CD that I could actually play and tolerate for a good amount of time. I don't mind regular christmas music, but thing is I just wanted a metal christmas cd. I figured there bound to have one, so I ran across this beauty.Now, I'm going to be honest. I don't particularly like Twisted Sister but they couldn't of done a better job on this cd if they tried. Seriously, this is exactly what I wanted. A christmas CD played to the style of heavy metal. Everything is done to perfection and I have no gripes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rock Christmas CD!","review":"T S is not one of my favorite bands, I liked a couple of their songs, but \\"Twisted Christmas\\" is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BE JOLLY AND PLAY IT LOUD, MUTHA!!!!!!","review":"Being a true fan, I just had to get this. I thought that I would be buying it just to add it to my TS collection, I was dead wrong. This CD rocks TS STYLE from beginning to the end. It takes awhile to realize that these are Christmas songs and not just good ol' eighties heavy-metal. This is the CD that I will be playing when I am ready for the OLD-TIMERS to leave my house this Holiday Season! The true rockers will stay and drink beer with me while we PLAY IT LOUD, MUTHA!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I'm a great lover of all kinds of Christmas music, but I was light on heavy-metal Christmas music. Obviously. I took a chance on this CD and it didn't disappoint. While Twisted Sister doing Christmas sounds gimmicky, surprisingly it works. Most of the songs are earnest renditions of the classics while remaining true to the spirit of metal. I appreciated in particular that Oh Come All Ye Faithful - with more than a wink to We're Got Gonna Take It - was respectful of the religous content of the original. Sister probably never received true credit for their talent; this album suggests to me that they had plenty of it to spare."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this Christian music christmas album!!!","review":"Twisted Sister BRINGS the christmas feeling year round. (This is a CD to be listened to at any time of the year.) When I listen to it, it makes me feel better. \\"Oh Come All Ye Faithful\\" and \\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\\" are my favorite songs. Overall, it is an excellent CD. Now, if Twisted Sister would just make another Christian music christmas album for Christmas 2007, then I would be overjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas album like no other...","review":"I'm not a big Twisted Sister fan but I had heard some buzz about this CD just after it's release and was intrigued enough to buy it. I'm not disappointed! Dee Snider and the boys take some great heavy metal songs (including a few of their own hits) and melded them with some classic Christmas tunes. The result is a Christmas album that is far from cheesy. Lita Ford duets with Dee on \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\", which uses TS's \\"The Price\\" for the music. If you listen closely, you'll find songs from Judas Priest, AC/DC and Black Sabbath cozying up to the holiday classics. There is one original song on the disc, a heavy metal version of \\"The 12 Days of Christmas\\". Do yourself a favor...get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TWISTED XMAS","review":"IT WAS A GREAT SOUNDING CD GOT MY SONS EACH ONE WOULD RECOMMEND IT.IT WAS STILL XMAS SOUNDS AT A GREAT ROCK AND ROLL BEAT .EVERYONE WAS HAPPY WITH IT AND THEY CONTRIBUTED PART OF THE PROCEEDS TO (CAN) AN AUTISM ORGANIZATION BRAVO TO THEM FORTHAT AS WELL ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted Sister does Christmas!","review":"This is a pretty good CD.

Amazon will let you update the title of the review and the body of the review itself, but not change the star rating -- if you can change one, shouldn't you be able to change all?! My initial 1 star (*) rating has grown to a 3 star (***) but I cannot change that above ;( Oh well. As for the intention and execution of this recording, I still don't think this is the way TFS should go out, but I do not make their business decisions. I purchased this release and will continue to see them live every chance I get until they really do hang it up, but I really wish their last studio album wasn't this one...Although I just may get my wish, as their FINAL release may very possibly be a sequel to this novelty record..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for heading to the salt!","review":"If you are heading to the salt, you need this book to prepare in advance if you tie your own flies.

The number of characters seemed a little more manageable in this one, in terms of allowing them each to be developed. I liked the strength brought out in women and children in Purgatory Ridge. I also liked some of the twists in the book that I really didn't see coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I admit I love Krueger's Cork O'Connor series - but this installment is the best so far. Cork is a multi-faceted character; and you end up rooting for him. This chapter in the series has two plot lines, both interesting and the continuing story of Cork and his wife; estranged through the first three books. The children aren't \\"too cute\\", they are individuals and their characters are richly written. Jo's (Cork's wife) sister Rose is an ongoing presence. And the boundary waters and beautiful scenery continue to provide the backdrop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usual very good work by Kreuger","review":"This author takes the same small town in far northern Minnesota and the same lead character, who is in or on the fringe of being sheriff all the time, and creates novel stories each time, more than a dozen of them. I always rate them 4 stars, taking one off for minor imperfections such as a few too many named characters for the average reader to remember the basic facts about each of them until they've read 3 or 4, occasional very minor slips on grammar or technical issues (though he's almost flawless on the latter and covers a dozen technical fields e.g., guns, fly fishing, mining, shipping). Unlike other top serial writers e.g., Lee Child, he has so far resisted the temptation to let a ghostwriter step into his shoes for a whole book (or to write a book that looks as if a ghostwriter did it). And his hero has enough human flaws to be more real than most serial heros. May he keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cork O'conner - Purgatory Ridge","review":"Quite a thriller.

I used to DVD info and noticed that my most recent purchase is made by CMC and I'm having problems with some of the discs including burn errors. One disk has strange ring in the die. I have the NEC 1300a burner. I also having some trouble playing backups on the same drive on my computer. Less trouble playing on my Sony DVD player.

The problem is that these new discs will only burn at 2.4X, probably they changed the id coding in the dvds and the last firmware upgrade for the NEC 1100A doesn't support 4X writing on these brand. Now i'm stuck with a 50pack spindle that only burns at a slow 2.4X(about 40 min per DVD). So before you buy i'd suggest you buy a pair of individual DVD's just to make sure they will work on your burner. I'll guess i'll try the HP DVD+R 4X that are priced very similar. And also NEC won't do any more firmware upgrades on the 1100A. The newest version is 10GE and it does not support these.

There was clear labeling on the package that new firmware was needed for many DVD writers to work with these discs. However, my DVD writer was a variation of what was listed.

The only time I get disc verification errors, as some people have experienced, was when I first started using DVDs as a backup medium. I found that it was only when I tried to pack the disc full (without leaving much space left) that I experienced these errors. The amount of space seemed to correspond with the number of files that were being burned and not with the actual amount of data (possibly due to the amount of space needed to record the file directory, I'm assuming, based only on my empirical observations). Since then, I've consistently left about 250-300Mb free on each disc that I burn, and I've had essentially zero problems ever since. Hope that helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burned Great on my PLextor 8x PX-708A","review":"This is the first media i have used to burn dvds. I currently own a Plextor PX-708A (in my opinion the best 8x burner on the market) and plextor makes a 12x which i believe is also top of the line. If you buy a burner definitely go plextor, its worth the extra bucks. Anyways, with my 8x burner these 4x memorex dvds have worked great for me. I can even burn at 8x on 4x media! of course there is always a risk of it being a coaster. Currently i have burned about 25 of these disks, no coasters, it could be that the plextor burner is just top of the line which i am guessing is the truth. But so far no memorex coasters. I am giving this media a 4 star rating because i believe that they are cheap... the edges are all bumpy and definitely not smooth. Its not the greatest media, but it will do. If you are looking for great media go for taiyo yuden or verbatim, otherwise if you are cheap get memorex and try it out, the price isnt bad.

I highly recommend browsing the artists and listening to their tracks when you get a chance. It was an era of completely creative individuals. Not everyone could make music tracks back then,you had to have talent(usually) to be able to work in music studios to make tracks.

I think Willis went overboard when creating some of the slacker-girl characters, but it all works out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chaotic, sheep-laden event","review":"This novel was both hysterical and heart-felt - I found myself laughing out loud at the characters' predicaments, and then eagerly page-turning to find out how it would all end. A wonderful story - I'm off to discover Willis' other novels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"intriguing yet relaxing read","review":"This is not science fiction as we know it. It explained to me the bellwether phenomenon, which I was not aware of. I think that most of the conclusions in this novel are actually true. It is a very fast read and the story is enclosed in a relatively short form. The book is written from the point of view of a scientist who does research on fads in a big institute (the institute resembles rather a corporation to me, not a scientific environment I am used to, but, after all, the \\"science fiction\\" tag gives the author some room here). The research, although it seems to go completely wrong at the beginning, is a big success at the end. Sandra, the main protagonist, couples forces (and falls in love; the love story is funny, too) with another scientist, Bennett, who works on chaos theory. The solution of the problem involves some sheep and an incredibly messy mail clerk. Good laugh, entertaining with a twist (it can actually make the reader stop and think for a moment)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun little book","review":"This was a very enjoyable story that didn't seem to take itself too seriously. It was a nice touch adding the little tidbits at the beginning of each chapter about various fads that have come and gone throughout history, though I did not always agree with her commentary about them. Her underlying message about how many people in our culture are unable to think with much originality and are not even aware of their predicament was well founded. As a school teacher I see this everyday in the microcosm of my classroom. Her portrayal of corporate mentality has a certain Dilbert-like quality to it that I'm afraid may not be as exaggerated as I hope it is. The only thing I found irksome - and this is a small quibble - It seemed that every waitress/waiter/and assistant she encountered rolled their eyes at the drop of a hat! I would be fuming if I ran into as many rude people as our intrepid scientist did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this book","review":"I really liked Bellwether. It deals with one of my favourite subjects, chaos theory, among other things. In it, Connie Willis manages to work the plot so that everything the protagonist experiences, is part of the realization the character has at the end. All of the pieces of the puzzle are there, and only once it had been solved at the end, did I truly appreciate how Willis has woven it into the book. The tone is light, and there is a lot of comedy, but to a serious purpose. The elements of the protagonist's life chaotically intertwine with the scientific exploration of the book, and this merging of them is part of the book's point. It is both immensely enjoyable to read, and one of the finest science fiction books I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Pattern Recognition instead","review":"This is a formulaic love story set in what is supposed to be a research institution. The author has clearly done a lot of reading and found a lot of trivia about fads, and drops short infobites about fads in history into the text throughout. Unfortunately the plot moves slowly, the writing is competant in a breezey way and the researchers don't appear to do any real research. As a researcher myself I was disappointed in the shallow portrayal of science. Apart from the rather unlikely ways in which the main characters conduct their research (going to the public library to find general books on sheep? Sorting newspaper clippings but never having any idea of a theoretical approach?) there are just silly factual mistakes, like when the protagonist is said to have a double major in her PhD.William Gibson's Pattern Recognition is about the same general ideas but is much better written with a more engaging and less clichéed plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great springboard into the world of Willis","review":"I was able to meet Connie at a local sci-fi writers convention a few years back before I even read a novel of hers. One of the stands had this book there and I figured I would give it a try since Connie seemed like such an awesome person and I loved it. Its a nice easy read and enjoyable at the same time. It quickly brings you into the story and like a fishermans net - catches you quite completely.I have bought several copies since then to give to friends who I am trying to introduce to Connies' writing and each one has enjoyed this book. While it may not be exact on what a researchers world is, it has more information in it then many other books out there. Very rarely do you read a good book that is fictional that teaches you something at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comedy by a great writer","review":"Connie Willis just became one of my favorite authors. I've read and loved Lincoln's Dreams, To Say Nothing of the Dog, Doomsday Book, and now Bellwether. I recommend them all.Bellwether is clever and biting satire. It's a wonderful comedy featuring a few sane and balanced people trying to survive in a world of incompetent, sheep-like trend followers. That they find love amongst this chaos and develop a thought-provoking hypothesis about scientific discovery makes this novel additionally a love story and science fiction -- added bonuses for us readers!This is not science fiction as some may normally think of science fiction. It's a light-hearted social satire, love story, and comedy that takes place in an environment of scientific research. It's well-written, with a great plot and great characters. I can't imagine who would not like this book!Which of Ms. Willis' books will I read next? I don't know, but I can't wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"I read this book for a Book Club and was disappointed because it really is not discussion material. There is one clever idea about society having bellwether individuals which is belabored to death. This book is adequate for it's genre - that being low-brow sci-fi with some slap-stick humor. Other than that it is formulaic and repetitive. Even for summer reading it's a lightweight. I give it two stars because it does have one good idea, and it is a nice example of how to stick tightly to a formula when writing fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science fiction? Or just plain entertaining?","review":"This book is not for lovers of hard core sci-fi. In fact, it has few elements of traditional sci-fi.What Bellwether does contain is an entertaining plot, given substance by a subtext of chaos theory in action, sympathetic and realistic characters, and satirical humor. Willis takes aim at fads and trends, modern romance, and corporate lifestyles, and she delivers the goods.Douglas Coupland + John Irving x Kurt Vonnegut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screwball Comedy","review":"I love this book to death! It's marketed as science fiction -- mainly because Connie Willis is a science-fiction author -- but I don't think it really is. It's a novel about science and scientists. It's also a wacky, screwball romantic comedy. It's a great deal of fun! Lighthearted and funny, but it also deals with some deeper issues -- specifically, the nature of scientific discovery. It was a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"This dvd had its moments, but only a few. I enjoy camp, and have a good sense of humor, but there was very little humor here. The acting and dialogue were so poor that I couldn't enjoy the camp value that was intended.

Just a loose assortment of scenes that were overacted, underwritten and barely directed.) was one of the worst things I have ever seen. There wasn't a single moment when anything happening in it made sense. I watch soap operas, and this wasn't even close to a parody. Say what you will of the soap genre, there's better acting in any daytime sudser than in this piece of trash. At least in a soap opera, you feel for at least one character. I was hoping there would be a delightful twist where everyone was shot to death at the end, but no such luck. I guess they're saving that for a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made.....","review":"Bad acting, writing, directing, camera angles, color, voice overs and editing.

This one was a bit dull for me because there seemed to be nothing unusal or unexpected going on that really differed it from the first 4 books. The exception is the end event and even that seemed to drop a bit.However, I did read the next book, \\"In The Company of Cheerful Ladies\\" and found revived by it.I do love the characters and the description of the country. For me, the heroine is a bit too strong old fashion values and gives toward lecturing on them a bit too much as does her secretary/asst.

In the second video which I found really helpful he goes over Defense to Offense transition, Defense, Offense to Defense transition and Offense. Going over some basic zone and man to man defenses and offenses with the aide of another really good high school coach. Nash is really good as the Host, doesn't bore you, he's energetic and the kids he uses to instruct the viewer are kids we are likely to see at different levels we would coach.

Steve Nash is personable and makes a good coach. He is my son's new hero...besides his Dad (of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to read","review":"It is awful hard to find an Aramaic Old Testament that reflects the ancient Peshitta text. Happily this one does and it uses East Syriac/Nestorian script instead of the block script found in our Hebrew Tanakhs. Having said that, the script is small, sometimes smudged, and difficult to read. Sometimes the pointing cannot be seen at all. Since I use mine only for comparison of critical texts, the inferior printing is satisfactory. However, it will not make very suitable reading for someone who wants to analyze the Aramaic text, chapter and verse. It seems that inexpensive readable Aramaic Peshitta Tanakhs are in short supply here in the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steven Spielberg, this one's for you!","review":"Oy, such a movie this book would make!

My grandfather was also a Russian Jew who left New York in the 1920's. He moved the family down to LaFeria, Texas (near the Mexican border) to pursue his dream of being a citrus farmer. Later he opened a small grocery store/gas station. I always thought it was strange that he would leave New York and a Jewish lifestyle.

The song was \\"Over There\\", and I've loved The Connells ever since.This album is my favorite in their discography. \\"New Boy\\" is perhaps my favorite Connells song of all, and has one of the best guitar hooks I've ever heard. This album boasts many great songs, including affecting ballads like \\"'74-'75\\" (a huge hit in Germany) and \\"Disappointed\\", and energetic songs like \\"Slackjawed\\" and \\"Hey You\\".Why The Connells have never made it big in their native U.S.A., I'll never know, especially when there are so many less-talented and less-experienced bands getting much more attention than they really deserve.

The seams make weird divots all over the front that show under t-shirts and it isn't because it is too big. It fits well, the underwire is lower under the arms. Fantasie is good for short torso women. The material is very scratchy and uncomfortable. Underwire is very stiff. The straps are thin, scratchy and dig. I was very surprised at how uncomfortable it is because Fantasie t-shirt bras are the only ones I wear.

This book contains more than women's emotional reactions to hysterectomy. Useful information about various methods of hysterectomy, including little-publicized side effects and risks, is contained in the stories. To get the full picture, you need to read all the stories. This book helped me come up with a list of questions for the doctor, and helped me decide on which type of hysterectomy.

I couldn't finish reading it because some of the letters were so depressing. I did read about 80%. My feeling is the author received more \\"worst experience\\" letters because she received a greater response from those is support groups.

It is full of whining, complaining women. The title definitely needs to be changed. I think of all the stories in there I only read one truly positive one. Most of these women talk about the pain that they are in before the surgery then blame their doctors for trying to help them. My suggestion to all women about to undergo this procedure is to get a second opinion and to stay away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't confuse by the title!","review":"First of all, you have to forget the \\"24 hours\\" tale. Do you really expect to learn Visual C++ in 24 hours? No one can. To be honest, this is not a bad book, but it does require at least begin-intermediate C++ level.The first several chapters are just to help frersh your memory quickly, so you may want to skip it if you are really confident with C++. In the rest of the book, the author chooses a App-wizard approach, which can really help readers pick up Visual C++ within a relatively short period. The thing is you may also want to have another book for reference, like \\"Programming windows with MFC\\" by Jeff Prosise."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Detail, But I guess thats what they're going for...","review":"I am an Intermediate/Expert VB Programmer but I don't know anything about C++ or C, This book I think is mainly telling you where to put the code, how to work your way threw C++, but it did not teach me any code, It told me to put the code in the text document and run it but it didn't tell me what I was putting, I recommend this for C++ intermediate and above programmers, not for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"I'm a CS Student and with this book it was a breeze to pick up Visual C++. I've had 3 years of C++ already and I thought the transition to Visual C++ would be difficult. However, it turned out to be really easy. A word of advice though before you buy this book, learn C++ first, then make the transition. If you thought that is what you were supposed to be doing by buying the book, welcome to the world of programming. Buy another C++ book that details the major terms of the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this one","review":"The best word to describe this book is WEAK. I have muddled through this one and have been frustrated by the lack of clear example this selection contains. What little example that is provided is vague at best. I would give this title a negative rating if I could. This selection comes with an offering of the source code on CD that is supposedly used in this book. I wouldn't know because the the CD that was included with piece of work was damaged and the publisher's technical support department needed an absolute volume of information in order to even process my request to get a replacement CD. Once I complied, they responded with \\"we're sorry but this title is out of print and we can't help you, but thank you for choosing Sams\\". Thank you? Thank you for what?

Examples are given sparingly. When they are offered, they are not explained thoroughly. So this book fails miserably as a beginners' text. By chapter 3 or 4, you'd be screaming for help.If this book is intended for more advanced users, it covers too much of beginners' stuff. It won't appeal to this group of users either.So for whom is this book written? I don't know.

If you are like me, you were attracted to this book after a first glance at the title. I am telling you, if you buy this you'll suffer chagrin. For instance, the author tries to teach you classes, structures and functions in the same chapter, in one hour, whereas there are entire books written on those subjects!!If you are serious about learning Visual C++ and if you got time, I would recommend you of taking the long path. First learn C (you can try C Programming Language By Kernighan-Ritchie), then sail to C++ (with C++ Programming Language by Stroustrup) and finally open the windows (with Programming Windows with MFC by Prosise). This sure will take a while but you are guaranteed to be a VC++ pro.."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not how people learn","review":"As someone who is reasonably familiar with C++, but not with MFC and Visual Studio, I figured I could use this book to get me going with VC++ development. What a waste of time and money. The author decides against explaining what things do, and why things work the way they do. Instead, the examples consist of \\"type these cryptic symbols into this place in the code and voila--it works! Now--on to the next chapter.\\" It is frustrating to find yourself wandering through chapter after chapter hoping that he'll explain what he's been doing. No such luck.Buy a different book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't find a easy way from Borland to M$, this is it!","review":"I am wondering that how can a book less than 500 pages and still cover with lots of topics in the vC++ 6.0.

Your boss will love you, if you use such a good tool to cut the learning curve down."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this one...","review":"There are almost no pictures, and no screen results of the sample programs it uses in examples. This book is poorly written, and isn't very useful, especialy if you are trying to learn Visual C++. I found \\"Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days\\", the old non-visual C++ 5.0, to be a good book (by a different author)...so there's proof that this format works for learning a C++ style language, but this author failed to teach anything.

I've been programming for years, but have no Visual C++ experience. I was looking for something to get a quick start. With more difficulty than should have been necessary, I made it all the way through most of chapter 8, at which time it became a complete waste.The author skips from topic to topic and does not explain the fundamentals behind major concepts. Multiple pages are used to list every property for different controls and yet space cannot be found to explain basic ideas.This is a typical example of a good concept (learn something without reading a book that's too heavy to carry) that was not implemented well.

The only reason I got the book was for the compiler, and possibly to learn C++. I quickly found out that the book itself was completely lacking on any real C++ instruction. I think its really great that I can build a dialog box...but its absolutely useless to me if I can't call up the dialog box from a program that I've written.

The problem is beyond what one of the review said, that the author want you to remember every detail he had said. He himself forgot what he had said or not in the previous Hours. 2. Topics not well chosen. Some topics, like Font or Tree View in my opinion, do not deserve one of the precious first 24 hours. 3. Improper detail. For example, so many pages of the lists of every property of almost every control. A much heavy book won't do so. I guess the author was probably more serious with the first couple of Hours.

The author constantly introduces concepts without explaining them in the afore; assuming you know, which is contrary to it not assuming any programming exp. In addition, many instances he says \\"you can...\\", but doesn't tell you HOW; or why, etc.It's amazing how the Variables--probably the most important concept in programming--section is only 2/3 pages long (that includes discussions on how much space they take in RAM).

The result is that the reader is constantly fishing through previous chapters thinking \\"where did I see that explained before?\\" I spent hours searching for such details.

The author writes critically about leaders of both armies while understanding that sometimes, mistakes happens! The author provides good background material to the battle before and after.I am not sure what the previous reviewer wrote when complaining about lacks of maps.

(49mhz))Opened the second hovercopter (27mhz)....charged it up the recommended time...wouldn't spin at all. Then by luck, my daughter squeezed the 49mhz trigger she had from the first hovercopter. And it worked! So the company must have package mis-matched transmitters and receivers. This second hover copter flew beautifully, and flew for almost 10 minutes. This time, the hovercopter was able to be recharged multiple times. Now comes the bad news, the next morning, this hovercopter showed the same problems at the first one. It could no longer take a charge.Both are being returned today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed son on Christmas morning","review":"Don't buy this toy.We followed the directions, charged the hover copter but the propelers never really spinned fast enough to get it off the floor.Horrible toy - we wated the money and got a disappointed little boy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"My 7-year-old son LOVES this toy, but it really isn't worth the price. It takes at least 15 minutes to charge and then the charge only lasts about 2-3 minutes. It flips over easily which means you're constantly running after it to right it so it will fly again.

It is mostly styrofoam and breaks easily even when being careful not to crash it on anything hard. You will be lucky if it flies for 5 minutes per 20 minute charge. Most of the time your lucky to get it to 10 feet high. Once in awhile my son got it up 20 feet. He was excited about that, but it would never do it more than twice per charge.

The first night, we all had fun playing with it. By the next morning (after charging it all night), it would only lift about two or three inches off the floor. By that afternoon, the battery would no longer accept a charge - the toy was dead. After tinkering with it for about an hour, I gave up and had to console my daughter's tears. From reading previous reviews, it seems that some are lucky enough to have bought one of the saucers that was assembled with little or no flaws, and others (most of us) are unlucky enough to purchase a piece of crap. These toys are poorly assembled from the cheapest materials available (including the so-called \\"rechargeable\\" batteries). Unless you're a gambler, stay away from this way-overpriced toy.

(They are VERY delicate and made of lightweight styrene foam --so they can \\"fly\\"). I was disappointed and I'm guessing the two I saw at XMAS party were flukes.

How about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption and/or video dropouts (stutter or DVD lock-up)?. I thought it was my recorder until I read all the reviews... There has been a HUGE drop in quality recently. If you want to gamble with the recent sub-par quality of the Memorex branded media and \\"hope\\" every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here.

Two burns were approximately 20 mins burn, 20 not, then 20 burn, 20 not! forming concentric circles on the platter.

I've tried with different software too, I've had better results with Nero Express, but the same problem occurs.

I genrally like most of the things Amazon sells but AMAZON should be ashamed to offer these nasty crummy useless DVD disks for sale. Worst is that Amazon makes TDK +R disks harder to buy as they did not sell them directly at the time of my last purchase.These disks are just worthless as media intended to preserve your DVD data or images. Words just can not say how bad I think these disks are. If you never listen to another peice of online advice here me now.

In the 25 pack spindles I would buy, they would all work....so in Aug '04 I bought 2 25 packs at Circuit City (a mistake?). That appears to have been a waste of money. I just tried to burn a copy of something and I ended up trashing 4 disks in a row. I was convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else. Then I remembered someone had given me a blank Sony DVD-R disk, so I thought what the heck, let me try that one. Into the SONY drive it went and it copied without a hitch. That was the final straw for my Memorex loyalty. Out of a pack of 25, I have about 10 left, but have had to trash 6 of the 15 I used. Not a good success ratio.

I also use a few other products, like sprays and moisterizers and anti-frizz formulas. This helps straighten the hair and also gets rid of quite a lot of frizzies, even without the help of an iron.

Nails for drywall anchors? Really? Nails to hold up shelves? What genius thought of that!?The enclosed nails are are too small for the holes in the shelve arms. The nail goes right through the hole and doesn't hold anything! What's the point? Who designed this? A farsighted dyslexic!?The plastic anchors stick out far beyond the nail, requiring you to hit the plastic (or create a chisel type device).I have installed many, many shelves without incident.

Ashley Laurence is back for the first time since hellbound. The special effects are quite well made and the script is great being that the movie has a 3 million dollar budget. The music is great for the movie and sets the mood perfectly even to well sometimes. The entire videoe camera scene is so frightening and the psychological drama is totally creepy. It is kind of ironic that he goes to a chiropractor considering that pinhead has pins all over his head. The dialogue is not as poorly written as most horror sequells and is quite good. Pinhead only plays a small part and can almost be seen as doing a small cameo. I highly recommend this movie to all hellraiser fans and fans of great movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this entry into the series","review":"Maybe I like my movies to be more conforming to normal plot patterns, who knows. All I know is the way the plot jumped around in this movie left me dizzy and frustrated. Plus, I know there's been a desire to concentrate on the human characters rather than the Cenobites, but with this movie all the concentration is on Kirsty's husband--so much so that I became sick of seeing his face after 30 minutes of watching this flick. After Hellraiser II, the series just hasn't been the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?!?!","review":"This is by far the worst of the Hellraiser movies. I would go as far as saying this was in the top five of the worst movies I have ever seen. I rented all six of the series this past weekend becasue I hear so much good things about this series. I was pretty much happy until I put Hellseeker VI into the DVD player. The movie made no sense, Pinhead is hardly in it at all. The Cenobites seem to be afterthoughts of the writer. There was no horror in this movie. If I had wanted to see \\"Memento\\" I would have rented that instead. If there are any plans for Hellraiser VII please somebody get on your knees and beg Clive to come back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Review Of Yet Another Nail In A Dying Franchise!","review":"Imagine capatilizing on the \\"Halloween\\" franchise just to have Michael Myers show up for three minutes? Better yet. Does anyone remember the short-lived \\"Freddy's Nightmares\\" series where most of the episodes only featured Freddy doing hosting duties. If you're gonna turn a movie into a cash cow then you might as well pimp its most popular character for everything it's worth and give the fans what they want to see.Sadly, this movie which seems promising (especially with the return of Ashley Laurance) is just boring. For a sequel with the heroine returning, it tries awfully hard to forget that it is even related to the other movies. Laurence despite a top billing gets very little screen time and if you watched the last Hellraiser, you are getting about the same amount from Pinhead as you did then..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst movies ever","review":"This movie could have been better if they had decide not to release it at all. It was so bad that I got scared thinking of the how bad it was. Rather than seeing it I would recommend drowning yourself. It confuses you so much I can't even remember who I am.

I was excited when I heard Ashley Laurence (Christy In Part's 1 and 2) was coming back. Her character is barely in this movie for a full twenty minutes. This movie is horrible in general, and compared to the other five hellraiser installements, it's even worse. This movie barely has a plot, and you barely see Pinhead at all.One star is only for the fact it's a Hellraiser Movie, one of the greatest series of all time. Otherwise, this movie is not worth seeing. Get the rest of the series and leave this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"how many hellraiser movies is there??","review":"None of the films are good they all suck.

This is another one on the list of terrible sequels. It's probably just me, but it seems like the more of these movies they make, the worse it gets, and the less we see of Pinhead and the Cenobites. This wasn't scary at all. Frankly, I was bored to tears, and this is a total disgrace to Hellraiser fans. Inferno was already bad enough and they had the nerve to make another (horrible) sequel to add to the franchise. Let's admit it, Inferno was a cop thriller...not a Hellraiser (that was the first clue). They waited 4 whole sequels later to bring back Kirsty Cotton for Hellseeker, and that's the second clue that they are truely running out of ideas. I think the first Hellraiser was a classic, and now it's time to end the madness."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU FAIL!","review":"If Inferno hadn't have come out before it, this movie might have been bearable.

Hellraiser 6 tumbled along.... To the point were we started getting very frustrated with the way the movie danced around not alowing you to grab it and hold it. Without a doubt this plot was a tare off Jacobs ladder, a rip off The Others, with a back drop of a Xfiles maratathon. And of course a pinch of hellraiser (Because there was a total of 40 seconds of cinobites and a few mins of pinhead). No gore. No real blood baths. Just when the walls started coming down and classic hellraiser feelings started to flow though my body the movie was over. I was just really upset at how UNoriginal this movie was. maybe if Jacobs Ladder and The Others were never made would H6 be a movie worth bringing up. But those 2 movies exsist, and H6 totaly carbon copies them. Very disopointed.

In fact most of the Hellraiser films are quite good and even the later ones in the series have some merit.Sadly this one does not because...(1)Hellraiser and the Cenobytes are in it for about 7 minutes.(2)The story is ripped directly from Jacob's Ladder and Angel Heart.It is a TV movie with some interesting production values but just based on points 1 and 2 above I think you have a good idea of where you should keep your money.

The head casting was of poor quality and had grind marks all over it even outside of the hollowed grinds.

They **might** work with solid copper core Ethernet--don't know--but they're still very cumbersome as the other reviewer noted. A better solution if you're trying to connect Ethernet to a wall-plate is to use a Keystone \\"pass-through\\" jack--which has the RJ-45 female socket on both sides of an in-line connector-- which then snaps into the Keystone wall plate.

I grew so attached to the characters that the ending was incredibly sad. Every time the health of a sick character improved, I hoped they would pull through, only to be hurt time after time.

The concept of \\"character development\\" completely escapes the author, hence my lack of caring about who died, who is in trouble, etc. Why care? Another problem is the pace of the book. It is, to my knowledge, the slowest book you will ever read. Painfully, remove-your-own-teeth-with-a-screwdriver painful. I tried to bravely make it at least half way, but alas, my mind shut down at one-third. Wretched.

The paradoxes which prevent diseases from traveling through the net were too convenient and never adequately explained. What happens after Kirvin, who must be crawling with the plague, enters the net in the final chapter? I think the author deliberately ended the story where she did because the details of how Kirvin and the others are decontaminated ( the paradoxes?)would not bear close scrutiny.I was also troubled by the link between the modern plague and the church yard cemetary. The author implied a link but never developed it. The story would have been better if that plot line had been pursued.I,ve been critical of a book which I have rated highly, but I feel the book could have been a 10 if only a few loose ends were tied together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read while in the airport/on the plane...","review":"Just finished reading this after a coast-to-coast round trip, which seems to be the best way to digest this treatise...

Thought it would have been cool if Roche had turned out to be a traveller from even further in the future who happened to cross paths with Kivrin. He would have recognized her origins from her modern English ravings while she was ill, and they could have worked together to aid those they cared about without upsetting the space-time continuum. I could see this being made into a movie assuming improvements to the year 2054 situations and a more satisfying ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Willis is a fantastically complex writer, but this is her tour de force. Practically every paragraph is filled with both surface and hidden meaning, which makes repeated reads just as rewarding. Though the book revolves around the Plague of 1348 as it hits England (as well as another fictional, futuristic plague), this is at its heart a Christmas story, and as such as inspirational as any inspirational fiction I've ever read. Minus the syrup, moralizing, or easy solutions.Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate time travel book","review":"For the second time around, I am amazed by the character development in this book and Willis' ability to bring people and situations alive. I lost two nights sleep because I can not put this book down once I start. Although I understand why some authors don't go commercial, this is the one book that would be interesting as a movie (I have the actors picked out!) But then, in the next thought, I would be afraid to go see it since Hollywood ruins the essence of most books like this and is truly unable to leave it as it is.

It made me see history in a new way. In stead of just a steam of facts from a textbook it became stories of \\"real\\" people that affected \\"real\\" lives.

There are two strong main plots, both of which tie together neatly and reasonably realistically. Both of them have at least some surprise, mystery, and suspense. Meanwhile, these plots tie in with several others, including toilet paper supplies, bell ringers, and an overprotective mother splendidly. This also acts to provide some humorous relief to a book that can desperately need it at times"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most bold and enduring book I have read.","review":"Connie Willis takes on the daunting challenge of entering into the cultural context of the Black Death. She handles the effort with grace, power, and sensitivity. Her characterizations are simple and profound. The inclusion of the character Colin is insightful and effective. His youthful energy, enthusiasm, and penchant for breaking the rules provides just the right balance to the more weighty and tragic themes. Willis does not cut any corners in describing the reality of death and disease, but she manages to not let these passages dominate the overall trajectory of the story. Walking with Kivrin, we see the potential power of a single life lived by self-sacrifice. It is a novel with depth and beauty, one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"This story will stay with you","review":"** spoiler alert **A day after reading this and I'm still mourning the death of Father Roche...I thought this book was perfect just like it is. The story starts at the lab where historian Kivrin will travel back in time to the 1320. Her mentor, Mr. Dunworthy, suspects there is something wrong and advises her she should not time travel but of course, she does, and all things break lose both in the past time and present time.There were several things I enjoyed about the book: the fact that there was an epidemic and how they were dealing with it (made me think of '12 Monkeys'), the way all the characters from both past and present were connected, the way the author took you step by step through the ordeal so that it felt like we were really there trying to figure out where/when Kivrin was and how to make sense of things when nothing does.I think the emotions evoked by the story of this book will stay with me for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book to talk about!

Although there were a few nagging mistakes, the story telling was so good I willingly suspended disbelief and went along for the ride. There were a few times I thought I knew what was happening or was certain the direction the plot would take and I was, happily, wrong every time. This is the type I story you just love to talk over with other people...and there is no way to tell you why without giving some of it away, so get reading! And especially read and enjoy this book before Hollywood gets hold of it and appends a love story, a happy ending, and/or Julia Roberts."},{"rating":"1","title":"how did this win the Hugo and Nebula?","review":"I am plowing my way through all the Hugo award winners right now and after the sublime lterary quality of works such as Ursula K LeGuin's \\"The Dispossessed\\" and Miller's \\"Canticle for Lebowitz\\" I am appalled at this choice. The character's are flimsy and the plot, oh dear. Time travel always has it's problems but the solution to avoiding paradoxes here is something a ten year old could have dreamed up. A major portion of the book is spent trying to locate a time traveller in the past, and all the slapstick events that prevent them from doing so. The main character who is claimed as a brilliant student does the most inept job as an historian. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your page turner","review":"I found the book to be, in one word, boring.The plot doesn't move anywhere, sentences and scenario repeat themselves over the same chapter more than once.The thought of going to church (as one of the characters decides to do), takes more than 10 pages to happen, as she contemplates on whether to do it, or not and then again whether to do it or not, and then again whether to do it or not, and then something happens so she thinks it over AGAIN.WowGoing through 60% of the book, and starting to use the next button looking for the \\"spoken word\\" rather than the thought processes the characters go through makes me wonder if there is even a plot here or just \\"day-to-day\\" actions taking place here.I would say skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart-rending favorite","review":"Connie Willis' Doomsday Book is one of my favorite books of all time. This is something my young adult children can't understand--there is too much sickness and death for them and they think it's a depressing book. But for me, the compelling characters and their concern for each other is redemptive in the midst of both the Black Death of the past and a pandemic in the future. I love the characters, the story and the writing. It is Willis at her best. It is sci fi at its best. I highly recommend it to anyone who can stomach graphic stories about illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real tour de farce","review":"The cover of the book, calls itself a tour de force. I could think of less polite ways of saying it, but the best I can do is tour de farce. The book is simply poorly written. The genre is science fiction.

I know many people were amazed by the character-portraiting in this book. I wasn't, but that's not the point. The point is, if you want to write a book you have to think of a story. This book has none, only a \\"situation\\" that is made clear in the first pages. Read on the next 500 or so pages, but do not expect anything else (oh, yes, except more and more endless repetations of the same \\"comic\\" conversations taking place in the future - is this the part which is intended to be a comic relief? Jesus!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"An incredibly disappointing read","review":"I had heard so many good things about this author that after I finally read it I was frankly dumbstruck at how bad I thought this book was. Initially I enjoyed the historical part of the book but there was absolutely no dramatic tension to be found anywhere. It often felt as though I were reading two stories, one in the \\"present\\" and the other in the past that were related by nothing more than the attempts to bring the girl back. I didn't understand what the point was of the emergency in the present and what it had to with what was happening during the black plague. The whole read was ultimately boring and left me with a rather bad taste in my mouth.I cannot recommend this book and though I may try another of her books this certainly didn't make me want to try one anytime soon.Blech!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inplausible","review":"It is 2048, there are time machines.

In some years apparently, the most contrived, implausible work must win the Hugo / Nebula it seems. There are several examples, this is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read that transcends the sci-fi genre.","review":"Once I started this book, I could not put it down. But Connie Willis' Doomsday Book is so much more than just a compelling read. It is a time travel story that also succeeds as an historical novel, a parody of academic politics, a medical mystery, a suspense story and a meditation on moral, philosophical and historical themes. Parallel stories play out in the 21st and 14th centuries. The characters - particularly those in the 14th century - are realistically drawn and believable. Historians debate what forces create history -is it economics, great men, societal forces, everyday individuals? Connie Willis' position is clear: the everyday acts of everyday individuals are the key to the development and survival of civilization as we know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely, engaging read","review":"Fans of \\"Star Trek\\" type fare, look elsewhere. Everybody else, here's a wonderful book, absorbing and suspenseful and intelligent and even funny. \\"Doomsday Book\\" has a well-researched tour of the middle ages, enjoyably snarky commentary on university life, and a race-to-the-finish-line plot, all in one neat package. (Also does for the CDC what \\"Slow River\\" did for sewage treament.) If you're the kind of reader who must have dragons and spaceships, skip it, you'll only be confused. Those who prefer a little less convention and a little more craft should be very pleased. (I feel the same way about most Gibson, Nicola Griffith's \\"Slow River,\\" and the first three-quarters of Peter Hoeg's \\"Smilla's Sense of Snow,\\" if you want a baseline to judge these comments by.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and realistic","review":"As a medievalist, I find Willis' depiction of life in the middle ages to be believable. I like the author's approach to the time period. The people are quite different from us...obviously and unapologetically NOT modern. Yet, Willis convincingly links the past and the future in more ways than one. I find her future, with the bureaucratic tangles and incompetence, to be quite believable as well. Additionally, her characters are engaging and realistic. I particularly liked Mr. Dunworthy (and enjoyed his reappearance in other books) and Father Roche. She didn't resort to any of the tired stereotypes of the middle ages. I was particularly glad to see her depiction of genuine piety. Very well done. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have been better","review":"The book conssists of two intertwined stories, that of the student going back to study the Middle Ages and the 21st century academics trying to rescue her. The former is outstanding. The characters are real, the detail is fine, but even more, the unspoken inferences about medieval life and society drawn by the reader are the most fascinating part of the book. However, the latter is disappointing. It is at times plodding and clumsy. Attempts at comedy are misplaced and the characters are two dimensional. This 21st century portions really took away from the meat of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for Everyone!","review":"Doomsday Book is an engaging and emotional journey to both the past and the future. The genres in this book are so varied - do you like alternate history? Science fiction? Medieval literature? Medical mystery? Drama? There's something for you!As Medieval Student Kivrin embarks on a time-travel mission to the 14th century, something goes wrong. And then people start to fall sick in her home timeline. Kivrin is stranded in the past, not quite when she was supposed to be, and worried about the the shadow of the Black Death. Is it coming? What will happen to her and village people she is starting to connect with?If you enjoy a well-written speculative fiction story with memorable characters, this book is for you! I rate it for 12 and older on the Aardvark scale for death and social issues. Younger children would probably not enjoy it anyways, as it is fairly dense and complex, like so many of Connie Willis's well-developed tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonishingly miserable SF","review":"I suppose you might enjoy this book if you like the array of literature you can find in any airport.

Without going into too much detail, I'll just echo what some others have said: boring, repetitive and with many irrelevant details that did nothing to further the story line. How in the world did this win a Hugo??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful.","review":"Maybe I'm too demanding, or maybe too we'll read in the sub genre of postapocalyptic u/dystopias. This book is just utterly poorly written.The author is evidently not a native speaker of British English, yet foolishly makes the mistake of setting this novel in Britain, in a society and a language she barely understands. Is this a public school? A grammar school? Oxford University? All possibilities are mished into one mash within the first ten pages. And no, the British do not go on \\"vacation\\", not even the faux idiomatic neologism of the author's own devising: \\"vac\\".Grating, jarring. The writing gets in the way of a story, which I didn't have the patience to discover."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best around","review":"I started reading science fiction in fifth grade and by age 50 I have probably read thousands of them. This is one of my favorites. (In fact, The only other time travel story that I enjoyed more than this one was the Anubis Gates by Tim Powers.) The author brought the characters to life in a way that drew me in completely.There is no hard science here, the concept of time travel is just a literary device to set up the story, and is not really played up very much. The main storylines are the events in the past relating to our time travelling hero, and the actions in the present of the people who sent her.Like all well written time travel books, there are lots of threads that have to be skillfully managed and the author does a wonderful job."},{"rating":"1","title":"style is most frustrating","review":"I notice that a lot of people really like this book, but I found it very irritating. It takes until page 386 before the author gets to the point. In the meantime she uses and re-uses a couple of really irritating devices: characters constantly repeating factual information, like the symptoms of various diseases or constantly going over their concerns about someone's welfare; or character's about to find out some crucial piece of information but constantly being frustrated by some minor mishap. I get enough of this kind of thing every day at work and don't need to read it time after time in a book. The basic idea of this book is good and the last quarter of it moves along at a reasonably good pace. But it takes a long time to get there and I almost put it down several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doomsday is right!","review":"If you want sci-fi, developed characters AND engrossing storytelling than avoid this book at all costs. Then pick the Hyperion (in this case the Hugo was deserved) series by Dan Simmons, a modern master"},{"rating":"1","title":"600 pages and Nothing Happens","review":"Hugo and Nebula????? are you serious???????I dont know how many people could enjoy this terrible book. 600 pages and nothing happens. Miss Connie Willis never explains anything about how the NET and its paradox work, how can this be?.Boring, Predictable and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetition, repetition","review":"Oh dear, I see the point of the negative reviews. A great idea (thus two stars, not one), but done so badly. So much repetition, so little character development, such a slow plodding pace. I'm half way through it. Do I have the patience to finish it?I have read little science fiction, and decided to read this because of recommendations and because it won awards. Is this the best of science fiction? If so, why would I bother to read any more of it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bad episode of ER","review":"This book takes us through three waves of illness. One is a bad flu that hits a 21st century university during Christmas break. This wave is poorly written with several running jokes that (1) are not funny and (2) destroy any feeling for the deaths that occur.The other two waves occur in the Middle Ages. We get a lengthy story of the illness of a time travelling student/historian, followed by a separate plague that strikes the other characters.The story of the final plague is moving. Unfortunately, it is only about 100 pages of a 600 page book. And by the time you reach it, you have had an overdose of high fevers, racking pains, and drifting in and out of consciousness.The Hugo and Nebula awards for this book are unfathomable. Affirmative action for female science fiction writers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, repetitive, and annoying characters","review":"I started this book with high hopes due to it winning both the Hugo and Nebula. My only conclusion is that was an extremely slow year for science fiction publishing (perhaps Connie waited 5 years to strategically time its release). The characters are very one-dimensional, have annoying pointless conversations, and never seem to end up solving anything. The characters are very one-dimensional, have annoying, pointless conversations, and never seem to end up solving anything. The characters are very one-dimensional, have annoying pointless conversations, and never seem to end up solving anything.

I'm currently about 3/4ths of the way through but frankly, everytime I see another book I'd like to read, I put off reading this book again. The majority of the book takes place back in 1348 during the time of the plauge (through time travel) and most of that takes place within the confines of a house in a village. This book just goes nowhere. It is just plain boring. I wanted to like it, especially since another reviewer said it was better than Crichton's \\"Timeline.\\" This book is not even in the same league. This is the only book I've ever started that I may not finish. It's that BAD. Do yourself a favor and read \\"Timeline\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Too long, but a very good read","review":"This was a very good science fiction book that could have been better had it jusy been a little bit shorter. The momentum of the book sputters to a near-halt in the middle, but it picks up again and builds to a riveting, moving, if grim, climax.I read this book because of the accolades and awrds it had received, and it almost lived up to the hype. It was very well written, and the parts of the book taking place in the middle ages was very vivid, well-researched, and well done. The parts ofthe book taking place in the \\"present day\\" (2055 or thereabouts) was okay but had too many subplots and minor characters. Both plot threads could have lost a few dozen pages, but otherwise this is a very worthwhile book."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disapointed","review":"I love Time Travel stuff, expected a lot from the reviews. I got up to 300 pages hoping it would get better but I realized I was wasting my time. Dumb characters, little actually happens. Worst of all it's just boring. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATMOSPHERE BUT LITTLE STORY","review":"Going against the tide apparently. The spine of the story is extremely thin. The details meant to make you care about the characters were so bereft of interest that I found myself racing over whole pages looking for some scrap of interesting plot progression. A waste of a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific! Could not put it down","review":"One of life's greatest joys is discovering a new book that turns out to be wonderful--and I adored this book.Good mix of medieval and future, with a strong woman character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding, slow and a sleep aid","review":"I'm sure this book is great if I could ever make it through. I finally gave up about 1/3 of the way in. Why does Ms. Willis have to write about every single thought, emotion and insignificant story point that has nothing to do with the plot? I listened to the audio version and many times I just wanted to press a 30 second skip button to get the story moving. Several times I just blurted out \\"come on already! how many times is Kivrin going to go through her symptoms to self diagnose her illness?!\\". This book is opposite of Crichton's novel Timeline which was fast paced but lacked the historical knowledge and depth that Ms. Willis obviously included. The 14th century was a pivotal century in Western civilization, it would be exciting to find a book that would bring it alive. This book fails at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally powerful, thought-provoking","review":"Stayed up until 2am reading this tour-de-force.Moving from mystery novel to gut-wrenching first-person account of the arrival of the Black Death, from a young girl who turns out to be a very human Christ-figure.Powerful, powerful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good yarn.","review":"This book stands as a counterpoint to Crichton's Timeline. However, it is much, much, much better. If you like the thought of time travel, the period of the Black Death, in-depth (and highly plausible) tidbits of the psychology that the plague had on the people of the time, then this book is for you. It doesn't really get too \\"gross\\" until the end, and the last chapter is a bit of an anticlimax (although it is quite expected). Still, well worth an 80% grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine tale blending the distant past and the near future","review":"Willis weaves the Black Plague, mediaeval sexism, university bureaucracy, pandemics, and time travel into a engaging tale of vibrant characters about whom we quickly come to care and in whose shoes we tread days soon to come as well as days long past. Her portrayals of ancient England are rich with colors and textures that bring the reader into the scene. Wonders and horrors lurk in every corner as the plot builds delicious tension with seemingly insurmountable obstacles. If there is a failing here, it is with the too facile resolution of things. A bit more trouble in setting things right might have seemed more real, but by the last page our heroes have been through enough. An easy recommendation for any fan of speculative fantasy, this book makes me curious for more of Willis' work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A woderful, visual, emotional book.","review":"It has been quite a few years (probably three) since a good friend handed me his copy of \\"Doomsday Book\\" and said, \\"I think you'll probably like this.\\"I devoured every word of this book, and can still remember it clearly. It was lush in imagery and flowing with deep emotion. I could see every action happening in my head, and even though I'm a film student and often visualise the things I read, I thought this was a movie I'd like to see, and a story well worth sharing. Truly fantastic. My friend let me keep the book because I enjoyed it so much; he'd bought two copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your time","review":"This may story may disappoint the hard-core sci fi crowd whose first priority is imagined technology, and it will certainly scandalize some devout religious believers (if Christ can ask, \\"Lord why hast though forsaken me?\\" why can't the heroine?), but for the general reader it is a treasure. Among other insights, Willis' novel suggests that, despite all the earnest research, we may know only a little more about the past than we do about our future. But \\"Dooms Day Book\\" does testify to the endurance of the human race's saving virtues--compassion, fidelity, tenacity. If the human condition is to be improved, it will be more through their agency than through that of techonology. And like any honest and realistic narrative about the past, it leaves you grateful that you live now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 600 Page Novella","review":"This book would be twice as good if it were half as long. Three times as good if it were a third as long. Some characters we can care about, some compelling conflicts and situations, some moments of lovely writing: all of these were ground to dust under the enormous tedium of words, words, words.My best guess is that this novel won major awards based on its brilliant perspective on the time paradox. Trying not to give too much away here - but by the end of the novel we see that Kivrin has spent her entire adventure working well within the strictures of the time paradox. In one brief moment, Kivrin even sees the paradox as a form of fate and even perhaps as a form of a benevolent god. And Ms Willis makes this point in ways that are smart, devastating, and deeply humane. But, good lord (pardon the pun), she took the long way around getting there. It wasn't worth the effort. This book is boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books in the whole world!","review":"Connie Willis has written a fantastic book! I have read it multiple times, and this summer I have recommended it to dozens of people, who fell in love with it. You can't help but fall in love with some of the characters. You cheer for them, and dread their passing! It is a great read. The audio version is also fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting but predictable","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It seemed to be well researched, but I found it to be a bit predictable. I found myself a little bored with the modern day story, and flipped to the 1300's for the more exciting story.It seemed a lot of key points were repeated, as if the author forgot she had told us already. I also found the antiquated medical aspects (even for 1992 standards, when the book was written) were a bit childish (I'm an emergency R.N.) , and there wasn't enough \\"high tech stuff\\" (time travel aside) to make me interested in the \\"modern story.\\"The characters were sympathetic, and I found I liked them all. The story was thought provoking, and I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Time Travel, medieval lore, or just a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration","review":"I feel obliged to write this review because of the average rating of 4 stars. The pacing of this book is very slow. I can skip entire sections, and still find the characters mulling on the same questions over and over again.It's a book of frustrations, none of the characters get any where, same questions are asked again, and again, and again, the same action sequences happen again, and again, and again... There are so many scenes of examining gobstoppers so as to induce involuntary snoring (I wonder if it's the same gobstopper! Hmmm...).Two questions really go through the entire book, 1. what time was Kivrin in the past, and 2. what caused the epidemic.Really, if this book is 1/3 of its size, it would be a much better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I continue to reread.","review":"I thought I'd throw a vote for this book as it's one that I continue to reread and enjoy. This story successfully combines several genres - Fantasy/Sci-Fi, Historical Drama, and Medical Mystery. Granted, of the three, the Sci-Fi genre is least represented so if you're looking for a book that's all about time travel you'll most likely be disappointed. I find the glimpses into medieval life fascinating and would recommend it to those who enjoy learning about what life was like in times past."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked TimeLine...","review":"Doomsday Book is well researched and well written, with many believable characters and an absorbing plot. The protagonist is both multi-dementional and likable, and the reader finds oneself drawn in to her story.Definitely a \\"must read\\" if you're into time travel and/or the middle ages, and a gem for Willis fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connie Willis' best work yet","review":"I've read Doomsday Book so many times I've lost count, but I still love it. This is by far the most cinematic of Willis' works, but it seemed that she put a lot more work into the characters in the past. The sisters--Rosemund and Agnes--were my favorites. Yes, Rosemund was constantly in a bad mood, but who can blame her? How would any young girl react if they were betrothed to someone like Sir Bloet. Agnes, though, stole my heart. She was such a spirited little girl (I did feel sorry for Blackie, the puppy).... What I liked best, though, was when Kivrin first arrived in the past. The sections written in Old English are fun to try to decipher. Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"This book won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, so obviously I'm in the minority in not liking it. When reading for pleasure I'm generally hoping for at least one of the four following things:1. A fast paced page turner that keeps me breathless with anticipation.2. New, interesting ideas or insights about people, society, or nature.3. A world of wonder. New places, people, beasts, magic, technology, etc.4. Masterful writing. An author with the ability to make me smile simply through their use of language.Great books give me three or four of the above. This book gave me none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maisry got a bad rap","review":"I was so excited to read this. I had read that it was one of the top notch books about the Black Death. So many reviews have already covered the details that I am going to keep this short and just say it was a huge disappointment. I think it MIGHT have been salvageable if the whole story was set in the Middle Ages. I need to read an outstanding book now to cleanse my palate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept But Falls Flat","review":"After reading all the wonderful recommendations for this book, I decided to give it a try. What a dissapointment! Granted, perhaps at the time this book was written, the idea was rather original but the author was so long-winded that it made it a frustrating read. The reader has to get to halfway through the book before the plot finally got interesting, but by that time, I found most of the characters so irritating that I skipped several pages at a time to get to the end of it!I would recommend you check this out from your local library before spending precious $$ on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just a Story","review":"To put it simply, Connie Willis's 'Doomsday Book' is one of the best book I've ever read.When twentysomething Kivrin bravely journey's to the 1300's, she had no idea what terrors lie waiting for her. While she is trying to stay alive and sane in the brutal 14th century, her counterparts back home in 2058 are dealing with their own brutality, trying all the time to save the young, lost historian. Amazingly, like the angel she is thought to be, Kivrin takes the entire town under her care, nursing them as each one becomes increasingly sick. On the edge of death herself, Kivrin stays strong for her make-shift family, until she left completely alone.Desperately funny, painfully sad, unbelievably terrifying and astoundingly visual, 'Doomsday Book' is more than simply read - it is felt."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"A great deal of the book was annoying and felt contrived. After reading other, good works, by Stephenson, Gibson, Simmons, Gene Wolfe, &c, I was quite let down with this one. I can't imagine how it won a Hugo award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, strained, silly, shallow","review":"I bought this book beaceuse it got the Hugo AND the Nebula. Ever since Harry Potter got the Hugo I do not trust that award at all, but the Nebulas have been all very good. Well, this book is a big disappointment for me. I also read \\"To Say Nothing of The Dog\\" and this is even worse. The characters are ridicoulous, nothing happens, the plot is agonizingly slow, the plot twists are abvious chapters before they happen and the author just keeps repeating herself over and over again. I do not agree with other reviewers that female sci-fi authors are not good. Try some Le Guin or Nancy Kress, they write the best science fiction out there. But after 2 shots at Mrs Willis I give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"turgid writing -- beware","review":"There is a great idea buried in a whole bunch of annoying characters many of whom don't do much more than walk around the house waiting for more bad things to happen to them. At the least, Ms. Willis needs to find a better editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this win the Nebula and the Hugo?","review":"People have been recommending this author to me for years, and I finally picked up her Nebula & Hugo award winning title... and wow, was I disappointed. Read the Amazon editor's sumation and other reviews for the storyline, but here's my complaints:- contrived plot that doesn't explain itself- many 2 dimensional characters that were uneeded, except as comic relief and a way for Ms. Willis to demonstrate her obvious knowledge regarding 14th century EnglandThis book would have been much better with characters who had believable motivations and if the project had a better editor; no matter how long a book takes to be written, any good editor would've chopped well over 100 pages off this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and repetitive","review":"This book is far too long. A good idea is wasted by the author's relentless repetition of every detail, and her inexplicable inflation of every tiny plot point (Kivrin is so sick--will she make it to the window seat? Will she make it down the stairs? Will she get back to the manor house?).I lost respect for the Hugo award years ago--this book makes me wonder about the Nebula as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and repetitive","review":"I have no idea how this book won the Hugo and Nebula awards. The writing is extremely repetitive and the parallel structure of the novel (present + time-travelling past) is obvious an uninteresting.A good idea wasted on poor execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Book","review":"I read this book back in the early 90s and never forgot it. Somehow the phrase \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" came up in conversation recently and I flashed on a particular scene toward the end of this book that's been burned into my mind for close to 20 years. I guess I would take that as a sign it's a pretty good book. I'm ordering it now so I can read it again. Although I vividly remember almost all of the scenes set in the past, honestly, I've forgotten most of the scenes set in the future. It will be interesting to see how they read 20 years later. I gave it 5 stars anyway because if a book can haunt you for that long, it's got something special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I read this book on the strength of the other reviews, and of the favorable mention that it got in the reviews of The Plague Tales. The whole first half of the book should have been condensed down to one chapter. It's so full of stalling, filler, and just plain stupidity, especially in the future section, that it hardly bears skimming. I was so exhausted by the time I got to the meat of the story that I almost resented spending the time to finish the book. Keep away from this one unless you have a very high tolerance for pointless prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloooowwwww read","review":"Doomsday Book was very difficult to get into, a really slow read. This book had a depressing story line with no payoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"dry and boring","review":"It's really dry and boring; I cannot see why it's a hugo and nebula award winner. The way the author is trying to create suspense is really frustrating. Please don't waste time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time","review":"Could Willis foreshadow a little more? The first 200 pages read something to the affect of \\"does she have the black plague?\\" I wonder what's wrong with her, she had been syptoms similar to the plague, yet it is unconclusive....and so on and so on...Willis's characters have little depth and a central character, Dunsworthy, is an enitre yawn. This story could have been told in 200 pages opposed to 600. Save your time and your money.Get Micheal Creatines 'Timeline' instead if you like sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, often tedious, but still of some interest.","review":"Like others, I found the writing in this book overly repetitive (after being told for about the sixth time, I was pretty much willing to accept that one third to one half of Europe was wiped out by the plague) and sometimes tedious. Something that was particularly annoying was how the characters were constantly coming into and going out of most scenes, especially in the future part of the story. Similarly, the plague and influenza victims all seemed to be on a rollercoaster of getting worse, then gettng better, then getting worse, ad nauseum. It may be an accurate description of the progess of those diseases, but it hardly makes for page turning reading. Anyway, despite this, I stuck with the book and actually liked a couple of characters (Kirvin and Colin). And the historical insights were interesting. Overall, I don't feel I wasted my time, but the story could have been written much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minority Opinion; Truly Mundane & Boring","review":"Other reviewers have pretty well covered the story line so I will jump right to my opinion. I guess I was expecting more \\"hard SF\\" and this felt more like fantasy; only got half way through and put it down out of pure boredom. It was purchased based on the number of good reviews; should pay more attention to bad reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitious repetition (repetitively)","review":"This should really have been a short story or novella. The entire time I felt like I was reading a school paper whose author was trying to meet some enormous minimum word limit. Everything was repeated ad nauseam. I found myself saying things out loud, like, \\"Gee, I wonder what Dunworthy thinks about the 1300s? Oh, here we are: the fourteenth time he grumbled about the Plague and the highwaymen really cemented his opinion for me.\\"Also, as others have said, the author clearly didn't know what she was doing with the dialog. I lived in England for 7 years--Oxford for 5 of those--and I never heard anyone say they were going on \\"vac\\" (they go on holiday), or that they saw something on \\"the vids\\" (referring to television, I assumed). I suppose we could chalk these up to the author's imagined future-slang, but it came off as grating for me. Also, every time the American looked at her \\"digital\\" I wanted to roll my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective Time travel story","review":"In Willis's \\"Firewatch\\" universe time travel is pretty much confined to academic use since nothing can be changed in history. Historians travel back in time and make observations.In this book, probably Willis's best. A historian is sent back to the early 14th century but ends up in the middle of the Great Plague in England. At the same time a new plague is overcoming her home in 21st century Oxford. Trapped in this alien world she becomes involved with a wonderfully drawn cast of 14th century characters in a doomed village. The framing device of time travel works very well and this produces a quite moving work. I read this more than a decade ago and still occasionally think of it.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This is not just a good book; it's a great book. I'm sure that in times to come this will be hailed as a classic such as War and Peace and Moby Dick. Connie Willis's portrayal of what life was like in the Medieval Era is realistic and detailed. Her heroine, the time traveling Kivrin is one of the best portrayal of a brave, resourceful but ordinary woman in a calamitous circumstances. If you never read another novel, you must read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in years!","review":"This is a wonderful combination of science fiction, suspense and historical fiction, all of which I enjoy. More important, it has characters you care about.My daughter recently lent me this book. I got very little sleep that night, and did practically nothing but read the next day until I finished it. It held my interest like no book has in years. Even though I know my daughter would lend it to me again any time I want it, I must own it for myself, and am ordering it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Suprise!","review":"I'll be honest I had never heard of the author or anyone who had read the Doomsday Book. I bought the book based soley on the exciting title and the awards. Turns out I made a really good choice! Through the compassionate yet resolved Kivrin, the reader vicariously experiences the dark and fearful era of 1348. I love how the future of 2048 and the past of 1348 are used to explore the universal nature of beliefs, fears and inner strength. Even in such different eras, similarities between characters exsist ( as seen through Mrs. Gaddson and Lady Imelyne, as well as Kivrin and Father Roche, especially)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable book","review":"A truly remarkable book...not really science fiction at all,but rather historical fiction. Connie Willis uses the deviceof time travel to make the past feel real. Her medievalcharacters, from five-year-old Agnes to the social-climbingLady Imeyne, are unforgettable. Oddly, Kivrin--the maincharacter--is not as well developed. But perhaps thismakes sense since she is primarily there as an observer"},{"rating":"2","title":"I cried","review":"I bought this book on Audible, thinking it would take while to listen to 26 hours and 30 minutes. It was one of those books you do not want to stop. The characters became real and I hated to stop. Having made several trips to England, it was easy to picture the village and the church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even for non-scifi readers.","review":"After reading Doomsday Book, I loaned it to my mother (a devoted reader of mystery)... and never got it back. A thoroughly engrossing read, you'll be wanting to take it with you wherever you go until it's finished! You get caught up with the lives on both sides of time, and, indeed, at times it is harrowing. I don't think that reading should always be comfortable, do you? Especially if it means you're learning something about yourself and your views on others."},{"rating":"1","title":"exceedingly tedious","review":"I listened to the book on unabridged audio. I usually love long books, but 1/3 of the way through I had to stop. Ms. Willis uses language beautifully, but many of the sections are tedious and repetitive. The story creeps forward slower than her protagonists recovery from her sickbed. Ms. Willis may have researched the Middle Ages, but she didn't do much research on medicine-- it would be have been better to make up some drug than to have the physicians of 2054 using antibiotics we gave up on 30 years ago. If you want good historically based science fiction, read Stephenson's Baroque Cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible book","review":"I will never again use the Hugo or Nebula awards for reading recommendations.As has been said by many reviewers, pages of pages of silly miscommunications and characters continually passing out mere moments too early made it an utterly miserable experience.Yet, many, many liked it. I am fascinated by this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, intriguing, fun","review":"Just to keep it real, I had a hard time reading this when I started it back in June, but finishing it around Christmas time made it much easier to read, b/c that's the season/timeframe this novel takes place in. The book is divided into three major parts (booklets?), the first being the most tiresome, and the third being the hardest to put down. My impression of the main character Kivrin is a strong and brilliant heroine. A fun time traveling adventure, with frustrating battles with bureaucracy, and other challenges. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This won the Hugo and Nebula?","review":"As science fiction, this is a terrible book. As historical fiction, it's serviceable. However, this book's plot is paper thin, its characters are cardboard, and its extremely UN-exciting. The book drags on forever with no direction. I recommend other Hugo and Nebula winners, but stay away from this one, unless you want the history of the Black Death pounded into you over and over..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An astonishingly miserable book.","review":"I, too, picked this up on the basis of its Hugo and Nebula. What a mistake! Hands down the worst \\"science fiction\\" book I've ever read. Boring characters, none of whom are noble, evil, or in any way interesting. Nothing happens (other than unrelenting misery and pointless suffering). Zero character development; Kivrin has zero impact on the \\"contemps\\"; EVERYBODY dies; need I go on? Oh yeah: Wills doesn't even have the decency to punish the moron Gilchrist or whatever his name was...she lets him die peacefully offstage, never getting his comeuppance! An astonishingly miserable book. Run, do not walk, away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow ride","review":"This is quite different from most science fiction. Unfortunately, it did not work for me. The author emphasizes dialogue and developing characters at the expense of plot or action. Nothing really happens. We go back and forth between a health crisis in the 21st century and one in the 14th century, where people keep dying and the characters cannot do much to affect it, so we are forced to endure their grim fate along with them. For those who prefer characterization to action, this book may be enjoyable, but to someone like me (who admittedly tilts to escapist space opera when reading science fiction) it was simply a slow-moving story about dealing with death."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!!!!","review":"I have come late to Ms. Willis, and feel as if I should be mad that no one told me about her sooner. I noticed in the book, Book Lust, the author said it was one of the best time travel books she had ever read. So, I remembered I had it in the back of a closet, bought long ago and never read, pulled it out ,and I just finished reading it in two days. What a great book. I won't go into the plot, everyone else that has done that has explained it quite well. I just want to tell you to READ THIS BOOK!!! I could not put it down, but now that it is done, I am off to read another of Ms. Willis's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this win the Hugo and Nebula?","review":"The mental movie running in my mind while reading this was produced by the BBC in the 70's; the characters uninteresting and cliched, the colors washed out and the picture grainy. Am I becoming bitter and cynical about awards? Are they now given to the works that are the least imaginative and most user-friendly? If I find any answers I will probably also discover how Braveheart won an Oscar and the blandest top 40'ish musical groups win Grammies. Hugo and Nebula award winners are are not necessarily the vanguard of the genre, but they are usually sure bets for good reading.

It sounds like an easy promise to Oxford University student Kivrin, heading back to the 14th Century. Her trip is meant to be an academic exercise, not much more, but through an error she is dropped in the path of the Plague and into the lives of a family she comes to love. Meanwhile, back at the lab, a ferocious virus has attacked the 21st Century city of Oxford -- including the only people who can to bring Kivrin home.

It is really two stories: one in the future and one in the past. I liked the story in the past quite a lot more than the future one. It really gave me an insight into how life was back then: the social pecking order, the filth and disease, and especially the things about people which do not change over centuries, such as love, lust and duty.I recommend this book, though I don't think it is the caliber of some of the other Hugo award winning novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, avoid!","review":"This is probably the single most overrated SF book in recent years. I haven't read it in a while (and I *never* will again), but it left the impression of being slow, non-scientific (which you'd kinda hope a Hugo/Nebula winner *would* be), and generally boring. I forced myself to finish the book in the hope that it would get better. It did - when I was done, and able to read something else. The book is not horrible, just horribly overrated, and I'd recommend a potential buyer/reader to look elsewhere unless you've read everything else in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"This book proves the case that some reads are far better abridged, than unabridged. Repetitious, boring, tedious, rambling and, did I mention, repetitious and rambling? In the end, too many unanswered questions to situations mentioned over and over in the book, but never explained. Also, time travel can be a tricky thing, but at the very end of the book, the use of a \\"locator\\" has to be the icing on the cake. They didn't have satellites back in 1348 to my knowledge. Two stars would be too generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Throughout the first part of this book it continually rains, which made me more than once wonder when all the cardboard characters were going to dissolve and wash away. This book is simply bad, and the part that should have been most interesting, the part spent in the past, contains too limited locations, plot, and characters to really satisfy. Several of the plot points are so artificial and poorly resolved that the book becomes an exercise in frustration. I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book with a mediocre printing job","review":"I would give Connie Willis' \\"Dooms Day Book\\" an unqualified five stars.It was a captivating read. I recommend it warmly. The four star ratinghas to do with the book's physical aspect. The printing of this editionwas truly disappointing. There is so little margin on the pages, onewonders if the publisher was afraid of running out of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good.","review":"I have to agree with some of the reviewer's comments that I read before purchasing:(1) The wires seem flimsy and I dread having them get damaged.(2) The sound isolation and audio quality are both very good.(3) I would not buy these for running as the movement of the wires over clothing or heavy breathing cause significant interfering noise.(4) The sound isolation is best with the foam inserts.I also have an additional problem, that is, sleeping in an airplane (in coach) with these is difficult for the following reasons:(a) leaning against the window or wall transmits significant noise if the wires or phones touch the wall.(b) they come out of your ears easily when moving ear on pillowA reclining chair in business or first class would alleviate these problems ;>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rediscover your music!","review":"These are easily the best earphones that I have ever heard, in ear or muff style and way better than even the best speakers I have heard. Getting used to the idea that you have to put anything in your ear that deep is a little weird at first, but once you get used to it the sound is beyond description. I have songs I have heard thousands of times over many years and it is like hearing them for the first time. I can hear fingers moving on the guitar strings and the pick striking them rather than just the notes they produce. I hear background instruments that I never even knew were there. These are just phenomenal. Worth every penny of the retail price and a steal at the Amazon price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Etymotic Research ER6i Isolator","review":"This is my second pair of this exact make. Have used the first pair for over a year with no problems. Very good sound reproduction and if you get them seated properly the bass is very good. Great passive noise reduction which allows you to play the volume at a lower level saving some wear and tear on your eardrums. Very comfortable. I do like the foam inserts better than the silicone. Either way they get kind of gross and need cleaning (wax you know) fairly often. Best earbuds I have used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with my iPhone!","review":"I've had these Etymotic earphones for about a year now, and have loved them. But now, they've suddenly become an incredibly hot commodity because they're just about the only decent earphone I've found that works with my iPhone. If you're having trouble finding an earphone that works with your new iPhone, look no further. Clear, true sound - you won't believe how well you can hear with these if you've been using a noise cancelling earphone - make sure you get a good seal with the ear tip -- you really have to put it fairly deep into the ear, but you will be amazed by the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones !!!!","review":"I wasn't sure which of the all the headphones out there to go for, but I'm glad I picked these. The reviews are all pretty acurate. By this I mean excellent sound quality. Do yourself a favor, you've already spent too much money on a 30g Ipod so get some decent headphones to match it. You won't regret it. Not very much bass, however. But, you'll get used to it and when you do you won't even miss the headache causing thump. One thing though, and its small, when you get a proper fit, you can't hear anything else, I mean NOTHING. The isolator technology is awesome. With this comes a fit that, to me, is a little to tight. I think this can be easily fixed be a size smaller eartip.All in all, an awesome headphone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Great","review":"I highly recommend these earphones. They truly produce audiophile quality sound. The wire seems a bit thin, however after over a year of pretty rough use they work perfectly. They did stop working at one point, and it turns out that the built in filters were clogged and needed to be replaced. Replacement eartips and filters are easily ordered from the Etymotic website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile wires break or short-out too quickly!!!","review":"I'm on my 3rd pair of these headphones because I love the sound quality. However, EVERY pair that I have owned has had a problem with the wires breaking inside their casing at the base of the plug. I was able to replace 1 pair that was still under warranty, but now this replacement pair is showing the same problem!I have treated my most recent pair very gently, and I used a Curveyman cord wrap that was attached to the plug base to prevent tugging of the cord at the stress point where the wires join the plug. Despite this effort, my current pair has developed a break in the wires! Sound only enters through the wire for the left earbud. Since this was the replacement pair, I don't expect that Etymotic will replace an additional pair. I am very disappointed. This stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, very poor quality.","review":"My first set after a fair amount of use gave up. Because the sound quality and sound isolation is good I bought a second set. After very little use they quit working. They can't be fixed, even by the manufacturer, and the warranty is useless. Replacing the filters is also a hassle and expensive. Not recommended when there are so many other choices out there. I feel like I wasted $80.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Etymotic ER-6i","review":"I just loved the Etymotic ER-6i - while it worked. However my first ordered earphone left side's volume reduced about 90% less after about 2 weeks usage. Though I tried to clean and change the filter, it did not help. Because I really loved the sound quality and noise reduction level (i am a gardener and I am using very noisy machines) I ordered at once another pair of earphones. Unfortunately the second one took only 1 day. In the second day morning I realized, the left ear bud just quitting to work like the first one, only the sound level went down \\"only\\" about 60%-70%.After that I suspect this is a common problem with the ER-6i (Possibly that is the reason to sell for less on Amazon)I sent an e-mail to Etymotic and waiting for answer about exchange the defective items. I hope they know about the problem and solved it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO Good!","review":"I had a pair of these for about two years and they finally died. I tried V-Modas as a replacement but thought they were awful. Ordered these again. They're even a little better than my first pair. Crisp highs, detailed middles, and I find the bass true-to-life--on a string bass I can hear the strings being plucked. I hear extraordinary detail in the music, everything from acoustic to classic rock to alternative.I guess I wouldn't buy these if I wanted boomy bass, but I get a good seal and excellent bass for my tastes. Probably the most life-like headphones I've ever used and I used to do sound-board work.

I tried using the earphones on a Tivoli Songbook and Sony mini radio. I found the quality of the ER6i to be very shrill, thin and without any bass. Not near the quality of the Radio Shack. The fit was fine. I don't believe they sounded that way because I was using them on something other than an Ipod. The best part though was the little clip on the cord. Amazon was no problem on returning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Sound, Garbage Quality","review":"I'd barely used them a few months and one side suddenly cut out -- nothing to do about it.

I bought mine several years ago. Last year however, one of the channels started to cut out, so i sent it back to etymotics and despite being out of warranty they sent me a new pair. This new pair was great...until it too broke. I checked on several audiophile forums and this appears to be a design flaw with the ER-6i's, there is essentially nothing protecting the soldered connections, so natural wear eventually will cause them to fail prematurely. This time when I called Etymotics they told me that I would be able to buy a new pair for the discounted price of $75... the price of a new pair on Amazon.

I read the different reviews, both good and bad, and clicked the order button.BAD MISTAKE! When these arrived I quickly opened them up and hooked them up to my iPod Nano. Upon starting the first song, I thought something was wrong. Anytime there was any bass in the song, it was like I was listening to a 64kbs streaming audio file on the web, when in fact it was a rip of a CD at 192kbs. Absolutely atrocious sound anytime there is a hint of bass. Even after changing to different ear flanges and changing the \\"filters\\", nothing helped.

Overall a very \\"thin\\" sound...screetchy sounding with almost no bass. I thought it was my imagination so I reinserted them in my ears and played through another 3-4 songs. Nothing changed.

But the excitement quickly faded when I turned on my ipod, where was the bass!? Checked the fit, checked the instructions, played with equalizer settings, nothing. Bottom line: had I been able to preview the sound from the er6i compared to the CX 300, I would never have bothered with the er6i's. Whatever I lose in the fit, options, packaging, or other quality points of the er6i, is more than compensated with the rich bass and clear highs of the Sennheisers. Not only did the er6i lack bass, the highs sounded tinny to me.

Frankly my Sony MDR-A35 perform 10 times better and have better bass plus no hassle to put them in the ears and no need to change ear-plugs etc. Sony cost $19.99, Etymotic ER6i cost $140.

You will notice many tiny details you never noticed before in your favorite songs.That said, the build quality is not good. I'm currently on my fifth pair of these in four years. (The more expensive Etymotic phones have more intelligent design and much better build quality, so if you can afford better, please investigate those.) These will fail with normal use. If they fail within warranty, \\"repair\\" service is prompt (they do not generally repair in the case of the 6i; they just send you a new pair).I still consistently recommend these to people, just warning them about the relatively limited lifespan. As far as I'm concerned, the cost of buying a new pair of these every so often is still a great deal for the advantages they offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I bought these for two reasons. My original Apple ear buds are not very comfortable and have little noise cancelling ability. My son-in-law is a professional concert musician. He recommended the Etymotic Research line of products. I purchased this as a mid-level product. I fly many times every year. I love the noise cancelling aspect. Perhaps slightly more might be possible but I have noticed how much more relaxing it is to when using these to block out the roar of the airplane. I sometimes have them in my ears when I am sleeping. The sound is a huge step up from the Apple ear buds. Overall I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"4yrs and still going strong","review":"I bought these earbuds 4 years ago. The triple flange inserts can get a little uncomfortable after about an hour, but the foam plugs are ultra-comfortable.

The only way I'll get rid of them is if I upgrade to the Etymotic ER-4P.

You are essentially wearing earplugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy construction, mediocre sound","review":"My wife thought I was dumb for paying almost $100 for these about a year ago. Turns out she was right.They finally failed on me due to a weak connection of the wire to the headphone jack. The dual wires on these are thin and easy to damage. They definitely isolate sound (like any in-ear device) but the sound lacked significant bass extension in my opinion. There is also a filter inside that frequently gets clogged - easily replaced for $20 or so (seriously?).I recently got some SkullCandy ear buds for just over $10 and they sound much nicer, have better construction, and a microphone (good for the iPhone).If you are an audio snob and have to wear the high end stuff, then these are for you. As long as you can live with mediocre sound, flimsy wires, and you are prepared for them to fail at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive short-use earphones","review":"Upon the recommendation of a co-worker, I purchased the Etymotic ER6i earphones about a year ago. Initially, I was very pleased, as the sound quality was superb and the earphones where really comfortable to wear, even for an extended period of time. However, after several months of use, the right earphone stopped working all-together and a few months after that, the left earphone started to break in and out. For a product priced as this, one would expect better reliability than several months of use before it stops working properly. Not to mention, the expensive filters that seem to require constant replacement/cleaning. Overall, I would say that I am rather dissatisfied with this purchase and will be looking at cheaper alternatives in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy construction","review":"I've had these earphones less than 5 months and I had to return them today. The clip snapped off about a month ago, and then a few days ago the earphone cable-cover slipped out of the plug housing, exposing the raw wires.Oh, and another real annoyance -- though not one that would've made me return them -- was that the buds don't attach firmly to their mounts, so after a while, when I'd pull the earphones out of my ears, one or the other of the buds would remain jammed in an ear. I had to keep a pair of tweezers in my locker, in case this happened while I was at the gym.I bought the equivalent pair of Etymotic's 5-6 years ago, and they were MUCH better quality back then. (None of the three problems I described occurred, they're obviously not making them as well as they used to.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not designed to last","review":"The very thin wires and the poorly designed grip system for removing the phones from your ears add up to a poor quality experience.

The wires broke three times at the same spot - where it enters the plug. Each time I sent it back, customer support sent me a new pair. Great customer support for a poorly-designed product.

They stay in the ear canal, so I can slip on my helmet without knocking them loose. It's a little bit of a pain to keep them clean, but that's what you have to live with if you use in-ear-canal headphones. Sound quality is excellent, price (when on sale) is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"The noise reduction on these earphones are excellent. The sound quality is very good. The extended battery life that you get out of your iPod, because you don't have to have the volume cranked to play over the background noise, is an added bonus. My only complaint is not really a complaint, just an observation: if you've got smaller than average ear canals, these are probably not going to be completely comfortable. They come with multiple fit ear fittings, but even the smallest are a tad too large for me. Still the discomfort can be almost completely aleveated by reducing the number of times that you take the earphones in and out.Definitely a better buy than the over-ear or on-ear, battery using, limited sonic spectrum headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"etymotic buyers beware","review":"I experienced a partial break in one of the wires:tough luck , buy new pair.

I sent the set into customer service (overseas for me), and I was told that the Y connection was loose, however this wasn't covered by the warranty, however I could have a new pair for $74. I treated them very well, through normal use.

They stay on while I walk and the sound is acceptable.gm"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Like an Old Wire Crystal Radio","review":"After reading other reviews for the Etymotic ER6i I purchased it for use on long overseas airline flights. Before my last trip I tested the new ear buds with my Ipod Nano. I was shocked with the poor quality of the sound. The sound reminded me of the very tinny sounds from a 1910 home built wire crystal radio. I tried each of the removable ear pieces with no improvement. Obviously I wasted the cost of these ear buds and I have returned to using the Apple ear buds that came with my Nano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Headphones for Motorcycles","review":"I bought these headphones to replace the standard iPod ones I've been using for years.

Apparently, I have small ear canals and they do hurt my ears, even with the smallest tips on. In that respect, they are not comfortable at all, but would probably be great for someone without this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy construction outweighs decent sound","review":"I purchased these headphones to use with an iPod. I am often in noisy environments and found that the standard iPod earbuds let through too much ambient noise, so that I had to turn up the volume to potentially damaging levels to hear. The Etymotics, properly inserted, both sounded good and substantially reduced the ambient noise.HOWEVER, their construction is poor. I have had 3 pairs - the first I purchased, the second were a warranty replacement after the first pair broke, and the third pair were purchased after the second pair also broke. Now the third pair has also broken. In each case, the wires attached to the 3.5mm audio plug loosened so that one channel of audio was lost. I see other reviewers have had the same problem. With all of them, the shirt clip broke as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Absolute waste of money.

I have an iPod Nano (2nd-Gen), so I needed something good for working-out, cycling and skiing - these are not what I had hoped for. They have NO bass and would not stay in my ears, no matter what size tips I used. You have to REALLY jam them into your ears so they're not comfortable. Also, the cords are super thin and look like they'd wear out quickly.However, I am happy to report that Amazon was great on the return.FYI: I also tried a pair of Sony MDR EX-81's - they were even worse! In the end, I bought a cheap pair of earbuds (Sony MDR-E828) at Target for $13 - they fit, stay in my ears and have good bass. And if they break or get lost, I'll just buy another pair instead of crying over my loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Time!","review":"I have had an ipod for four years and have had always purchased sony headphones. Unfortunately, my puppy has found ways of finding my headsets. I thought buying the ER6i Isolator headphones would have been more superb than my previous sony. How wrong was I. The bass is painful, the filter replacement is complicated and will be misplaced when needed. The wire is too long and in the way while working out.As for Amazon, this is my first buy and my last. This product took 2 weeks for delivery and was falsely advertised for its delivery time.Do not waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect earphones","review":"This is the second pair that I've purchased, one for my wife one for myself.

All in all, great sound, great comfort all for a great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good sound, but kind of a pain in some ways","review":"These sound much better than typical earbuds and the noise reduction is really noticeable when flying (these basically work like earplugs with tiny speakers).But I use the flanged inserts and they are kind of difficult to remove from your ears without pulling off the tips. Also, the cord gets kinked up every time I put it into the carrying case.I'd like to see comparisons with other models and competitors noise reduction earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"i have bought 2 pairs of these in the last year. they have both quit working because of loose wires and i keep getting the runaround from the company about the warranty.

Problem still existed, by the time I sent them back they were out of warranty.Sad state of affairs for such an expensive product....I'm done with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working after a few months","review":"You would think that a pair of headphones that cost almost $100 would last longer than a $10 pair, but apparently not. I've owned the ER6i's for only a few months now and they suddenly stopped working. No sound comes out of either earpiece except occasional sputtering. I've taken very good care of these headphones, handling them carefully, keeping them clean, and changing the filters, but I guess that wasn't good enough. I have a pair of $10 headphones that I bought almost 2 years ago and these still work just fine while the ER6i is totally useless after just a few months. Absolutely ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Waste of Money!!!!!","review":"Bottom Line, I read many reviews on these and saw how many people had issues with the total lack of bass........It is true!!! No matter what others will tell you, you have to get them in your ear just right (and with me i had to use the foam earbuds) in order to get any bass at all......I am sending these back and going back to the stock (yuck i know) ear buds.A total disappointment!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"The ER6i earphones are excellent. They have good sound qualities for the extremely small size. The noise reduction is excellent as well allowing me to have music playing at a reduced level when outside noise is high (such as running a lawn mower)and still enjoy the music. I would highly recommend these earphones to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Earphones","review":"Sound quality is terrific. Sound blocking is amazing. Not the most comfortable in the world, but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't hear you","review":"I couldn't use the default plugs, but the other ones work well. The micro-accoustics are not too bad if you use the foam adapters. The sound on these is incredible, and LOUD. I travel a lot and use these as a lightweight replacement for my Bose Quite Comfort 2 headphones. These are great, but make sure you set them properly or you will suffer from a lot of outside noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal Clear Sound","review":"The Etymotic ER6i earphones provide crystal clear sound. The only drawback is deep bass response. You have to get a tight fit, which is easier with the included foam plugs, to get good bass response. With that said, they are still worth the money. I also have an expensive set of AKG headphones that produce quite a bit more bass (and I thought were extremely clear and bright) with the exception of deep bass,comparing them with earbuds, the ER6i's blew them away. The sound seems like it comes from inside your skull, you dont have the same perception with In-Ear ear-buds as you do with regular headphones or ear buds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent MP3/iPOD earphones","review":"These are excellent in-ear earphones. Great clarity on low and midrange notes. Bass not as full as perhaps Q-jays, but not lacking. In terms of comfort, would rate medium to high, however, any in-ear earphone require personal adjustment given ear canal placement. Comes w. assortment of ear plug covers. Right and left ears clearly marked. Would purchase again. For pricing, do internet search...many deals can be found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after several months","review":"Do a good job of isolating sound but they are poorly made. The wire to the ears is extremely thin. One ear went out after only several months of normal use."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound good but be careful","review":"I have had these for about six months, once they are seated correctly the sound quality is phenomenal. Outside noise is isolated as good as it can be for an in-ear model, bass is clear and distinct, mids are there, highs aren't too brightBe careful with how far in you put them. In order to get the best sound they need to go in FAR. The problem is if you have larger ear canals, and they go in too far, the rubber tip can become stuck in your ear canal. In my case the seal was too tight and when I removed the earbud by pulling on it (not the wire) the rubber tip was still lodged in my ear canal. I had to go to the hospital and have it removed by a specialist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphones go bad","review":"The wires on these headphones get disconnected after awhile and you loose sound in the earphone. This is the second set for this to happen to me after I returned the first ones for warranty issues. Maybe the case that comes with the earphones pulls the wires out? The wires should be designed so that they don't go bad. Be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works almost too well - shuts out sound completely.","review":"When they say this isolates sound they're not kidding. I bought these ear phones for use on the New York subway, and they really do block out everything. When I use them at the office people have to tap me on my shoulder to get my attention because I can't hear when they call me.Much better than balky noise cancellation ear-phones that cover half your head.The only warning is that if you don't like ear-plugs or the feeling of the earphones in your ear, you might find these irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound and Fantastic Noise Isolation","review":"great audiophile sound and fantastic noise isolation. I live in NYC and fly around a lot, so I use this on the subways and on flights. Saves weights vs. the Bose noise cancelling earphones and sounds better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated - tinny sound quality","review":"These headphones are good at blocking ambient noise and I use them in a busy office. However, the sound quality is lacking. There is a definite lack of bass and the mids and highs have a very tinny sound. Although the mids and highs are crisper, there is a lack of \\"warmth\\" in the sound. This may be due to a lack of bass. I'd like to note that I use these headphones with an Ipod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very high quality build and sound","review":"These \\"canal\\" buds are very high quality and have excellent mid and high clarity response. The bass response is clear and punchy, but maybenot as phat as some bassheads would like. I have tried numerous brandsand styles of over, on and in the ear type phones and am impressedwith these ER6is. Of the variety of tips that come with the buds, myfavorites have been the foam tips. You have to roll them between your fingers before insertion to make them small enough to fit easily, butit's worth the small extra effort. I use these with my iPhone. I had themmodified by UltimateBuds.com who fitted them with the original AppleiPhone cables and inline speaker/control button. This combo works amazingly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but lousy construction!","review":"I had these less than a month, and while happy with the sound, they constantly, like other reviewers, forced my Ipod into pause mode. Also the right headphones gave out completely due to a short in the jack. Less than a month! Come on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right","review":"I work out at a gym with loud background music that needs to be excluded from my ears. The foam plugs work well, stay in place and are comfortable. Run the electrical cords under your T shirt and there is no interference from the cords moving while you move. I listen to everything from classicle to punk. Good clear frequency response. Just enough bass and enough volume. The ear buds are labelled left and right and have little flat sides so that they can be inserted and removed easily without touching the somewhat fragile wires."},{"rating":"2","title":"They really block out noise","review":"I have tried various styles of earphones with my iPod and none came close to blocking out ambient noise like these do. The 3-flange tip is the one I use. I travel frequently and it used to be a struggle to listen to audiobooks on a noisy airplane. Not any more. The ER6i's create a peaceful environment and deliver outstanding sound quality. The key is to follow the instructions for insertion exactly. Dampen the rubber tip and insert with a slight twisting motion. If you don't take the time to insert them properly the sound will lack bass and ambient noise will not be sealed out. They are worth the higher cost, especially if you want to be able to listen to your mp3 player in a noisy area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to figure out the best fit for best experience","review":"I bought the ER6i based on the recommendation by a friend. Several colleagues had bought these too and were very happy with the earphones. I was disappointed with the sound quality at first and struggled a bit to figure out the right set of eartips. I requested samples of the small form eartips directly from Etymotics and now the earphones work perfectly. They certainly block out surrounding sound and you only have to turn on the volume to the desired level. They are light weight and easy to carry around.It would be nice if the set came with a adaptor for the airplane."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to follow the instructions","review":"I have owned these for over a year and have let several people try them. As soon as I show them how to put them in(wiggle them around while pushing them deeply into your ear) they want to go and buy a pair. The are hands down the best in ear pair of headphones out there with more true bass response than shure. If you wear them the way the manufacturer suggests you will love them"},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"I think the earphones are good, although a bit overpriced for what you get ..however the sound and quality are above average."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound quality","review":"The Etymotic ER6i Isolator Earphones provide excellent sound quality and good noise insulation for their size and price. The ER6i are very easy on the ears, unlike the hurtful headset provided with my ipod. I am happy to have purchased them. However, one cannot compare the quality to the Boise noise reduction headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"So maybe you just bought these, but....","review":"I bought these earphones about a year and a half ago and loved them, probably more than any of you five stars. I reccomended these to everyone I knew who had any interest in sound beyond Sony. After about three months of use the left driver failed. My use was strict to the iPod while sitting, sometimes while walking to another place to sit. Etymotic was great about getting me a new pair after I phoned in the issue, I had to pay shipping, but for my favorite posession, why not? Between that point and now I sent in the replacement earphones because the left driver failed. Seeing a pattern? Now, after only ten sittings, ranging from thirty minutes to three-hours per sitting, my left driver has failed again. My advice to you, the consumer, do not purchase these! They simply stink. They are fragile to the point where even if they were unused, and left in the original package, you could not insure that they are still working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do thing promised","review":"The sound quality is below average. Isolation doesn't work as good as the said. The wire is very thin and I doubt it will be broken at any time.

Maybe my ears are wrong or something but I found the experience really unpleasing.I'll stick to open/closed headphones from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy with sound quality","review":"The earbud have poor bass sound reproduction. Fit into the ear is poor. I've used other Sony and v-mode earbuds of similar design that cost half, sounded a lot better at all sound frequency ranges and fit much better .

The isolation is EXCELLENT(I can't hear people talking on the bus), the tips seal well and you won't feel discomfort like similar in-ears that have a larger frame. Bass is somewhat lacking(I'm a bit spoiled by bassy cans such as RP-21's), but detail and other stuff like that is good.The only things I don't like(being that I give it 4/5 stars) are that the filters need to be replaced(you are provided an extra pair, and replacements are pricey, going for about $15 for 3 pairs on Headroom), and the cables are rather thin.Overall though, they are solid headphones. I paid $50 for them, so no complaints here, because as of 1/6/09, they cost $76.25."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shuts out extraneous sound as advertised","review":"Bought these for my wife.

Got a sum total of ZERO response from customer service, I will never buy from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but these just don't cut it","review":"I've given these a fair try and tried every possible permutation of eartip style.I know how to use earplugs because I use them for sleeping . I also have excellent hearing and do NOT enjoy a booming bass in my music.No matter what I do , the best I can get out of these is a mediocre , and shrill sound performance. Even when there IS some bass, the mid range is 'flat' and high ranges are harsh, where the same source played through speakers or other external headphones sounds much better.Could be a matter of ear canal shape/size, but at best , buying these will be a gamble for anyone. Be prepared for the trouble of returning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped...","review":"...due to the light bass. I am not a bass head, so I wasn't too concerned about the reviews from others about the lack of bass. But this set of earphones was good for only one thing for me when I tried it out: sound isolation. When I have them on, I can hardly hear anything around me. Personally, though, I'd rather have just some more bass for that \\"kick\\" in my music (I listen to video game and anime music most of the time, and then some techno such as songs by TaQ, and then a little from every other category) and the extra \\"crispness\\" of higher pitched sound was not something I like either.So, I switched to a UE Super-fi 3. So far it has more bass than the ER6i (I think). I don't think the Super-fi 3 has as much bass as the Shure e2c-g's though."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird feeling","review":"I returned the Etymotic Research ER6i Isolator Earphones because they have to be jammed deep in your ears to work properly.

Unfortunately, less expensive one's I found have better sound quality. Yet, they do stay in the canal of the ear well and are nice for running or active sports.

Honestly I was expecting something very good but these were just were too nasaling giving off nothing but highs void of any bass. I spent a bit more and got some Shure's. Much superior in total range and much more true in sound. God I was really blown away with how big of a pile of junk these ended up performing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, no bass","review":"I bought these for running. I tend to run to the beat, and the beat just isn't there. The mids and highs are great. I have adjusted all EQ settings, and still just about no bass. On a plane, I would think these would be great. Good sound isolation, not great. I just was sad to hear just about no bass. I have gone back to my Ipod stock headphones. Sound quality isn't as good, but at least I have bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as I read","review":"Etymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones (White)The sound is OK, not as good as a pair of Sonys I bought at radio shack for $100.00.

All in all I rate them a weak 4 out of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied!","review":"I purchased the ER6i earphones primarily for use while motorcycle touring. I ride a sport-touring bike with a full face helmet. The low profile of these in-ear earphones allows a really nice fit under the helmet. Sound quality completly meets my expectations and matches units costing significantly more. The solid fidelity of the earphones combined with the noise reduction offered by the in ear design eliminates the need to really \\"crank up\\" the i-Pod in order to hear the music. I am very satisfied with these earphones and recommend them highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by Short on one side","review":"Product had great sound but the design made my ears sore after a short length of time. After a year, one side shorted out. Also, they are some nose made when the wires move or hit each other. Apparently it is a know issue and the upscale version uses twisted wires to each ear to reduce this effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but...","review":"The headphones provide superb audio quality (not that I can compare them to the Shures). But i was never able to get them to be really comfortable in my ear. Maybe its a pitfall of all earbuds, or maybe just my ears. Maybe. Also, they get kinda gross and earwax-y after much use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"I currently use the Bose-In Ear Headphones and love their sound, but had trouble with them staying securely in the ear without constant refitting. After reading the reviews of the Etymotic ER6i Earphones, I thought I'd give them a try, willing to sacrifice some sound quality in hope of finding phones that would stay put.My initial disappointment was with the flimsy look and feel of the ER6i. My ultimate disappointment was with the horrible tinny and shallow sound. I was prepared for less bass response than the Bose, but not across the entire frequency range.I tried all of the tip selections, knowing that proper fit is essential, but even with the smallest tips fit deeply in the ear canal, they just didn't respond. I tried adjusting the EQ on my iPod, but nothing helped.The ER6i phones were in a box and on their way back to Amazon within an hour of receipt. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable, poor bass response","review":"I followed the instructions on the included pamphlet (pulling on the top of the ear to get the canal to open properly, etc.) Tried all 3 different sizes of the flanged tips, plus the foam, and didn't find any of them tolerable for more than 10 minutes at a time. Furthermore, the bass response is utterly boring. If you like your music to have a bit of presence, and think you're entitled to a bit of it for ~$75+S&H;, keep looking.Finally, the isolation makes it possible for me to hear lots of things I wouldn't ordinarily - the sound of blood rushing through my veins, the action of my jaw if I eat while using them, my esophagus as I drink water, etc. I would think that for the price, I'd get a better sound experience than the whooshing sound of my own blood vessels with a topping of utterly mediocre bass.I have no idea how people can stand these. Will be asking for an RMA soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"These earphones were a dissappointment. I did my research on earphones and read that these earphones would be a great replacement for the ones that come with the iPod. I found they lacked bass and mids. I only heard the highs. I liked the fact they had earbuds that fit snugly in your ear. This was supposed to help block out all the surrounding noise, giving you a cleaner experience. The iPod earphones sounded better. Who knows they may have been defective for all I know, either way I wouldn't buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bass is non-existant!!","review":"I purchased these headphones due to their high rating in PC Magazine. Little did I know that the bass output was non-existant; even for earbuds. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as expected","review":"I bought this product with high expecations. I read all the reviews and used it accordingly.When I tried it, it had no bass response whatsoever and the overall quality was substantially less than the Apple earphones furnished with my Ipod. Other people tried them without my comment and also thought they were distinctly inferior. In fact they were so awful that I wondered if somehow I had gotten a dud pair. I returned them for refund and Amazon was great about that. Really amazed and disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bass(unless you shove them into your hypothalamus)","review":"Seriously. I had to shove these little things so far into my ear to get any sort of bass response out of them that I thought I would lose them. Fortunately the wires held and I was able to get them out. Despite the vertigo after removing them, they worked great as Q-Tips. I've decided to return them as I don't need a $70 pair of Q-Tips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good if you have the right ears- save your bucks!","review":"Very disappointing! Although I am sure I get them to seal (I hear a pop when I pull them out) there is absolutely no bass with these. I even got the Etymotic special pad kit (ask them- you get it for free) but this did not help. From what I read from other reviews they do work with some ears, but do you really want to spend this much money if there is quite a good chance that they are unusable for you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's not at all like they say it is !!!!!","review":"thought i paid a bargain price, because of the 50% off pricing with the good reviews on the product.but, it turns out, the product is not all it was cracked up to be.i really don't see too much differnce in quality of the sound or the convenience for the money that i paid for.my recommendation, just get a decent regular, or, even sticking with the original ear phone that comes with most of the product that requires earphone(i-pod, mp3 players, or computers...), you are not missing anything.bottom lime, it's not worth the money to pay too much money for a set of high end in-ear phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wires turn brittle like coathangers, NO customer service","review":"I bought the white 6i based on the advice of a good friend.

Last years earphones were great, better comfort, super audio quality, I use them with a i pod nano for motorcycling and running, The new ones are terrible in comparison. A little less comfortable (there is a difference in the quality of the rubber tips) and the sound on the new replacement pair is what I would expect from a pair of $10.00 earbuds from Wallmart. No low frequency sound like the old pair had. I just wish I would have checked for some reviews before buying the replacements, but thought I was buying the same product as the year before and I was wrong. I would send these back but I waited to long to try them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed in Reliability","review":"Thought I'd treat myself to an ipod upgrade.

Don't think -- buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noise isolation, good sound","review":"Basically this is the best value for noise-isolating earphones. Other brands usually goes for $200 or more. I use it mainly to listen to MP3s, don't expect any earphones to improve the quality just because they are expensive. This earphone is great at isolating outside noise, sound is pretty good too. A great money saver, definitely a buy. I know I would have regretted if I'd spent $250 on ultimate ears or shure. Etymotic price this earphones nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Noisy Environs.....","review":"It's true these earphones are a bit thin on bass, but for those who use their portables on planes, trains, and automobiles (ha!)they are a must-have item. The phones fit snugly and comfortably in the ear canal and simply seal out external noise. I use the standard Creative Zen Micro ear buds at the beach or when walking my dog, but when traveling the Etymotics are preferred because they eliminate the \\"white noise\\" of airplane engines--I even use them when mowing the lawn! Improved bass would garner the 5th star--maybe the ER4s would get that, but not in my budget......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare to buy another pair after a year","review":"My pair of etymotic stopped functioning after 13 months.

They have a very detailed, accurate sound, and I've found them to be quite comfortable after I figured out a reliable way to insert them into my ear canal. Try moistening the 3-flange eartips and inserting them upside down into your ear. Then loop the thin, lightweight cord around your ear and down your back.I wanted to try some of Etymotic's eartips not included with the ER6i, so I called Etymotic. Wow! Incredible customer service; I had free samples at my door in three days.I'm not exaggerating when I say I hear new details in music I've been listening to for many years with these headphones. If you like booming bass, these are not a good choice for you. But if you like clear, accurate sound reproduction, you'll be thoroughly impressed by these cans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific after you get used to them","review":"It took me about a month to figure out how to get the best seal in my ears. I cut off the smallest flange and actually point them up somewhat when I insert them. They reveal the lack of bass that comes out of the Ipod headphone amp so I use the \\"Electronic\\" eq to compensate for that. I'm a working recording engineer and I've been using them for live recording. My clients have been very happy with the mixes I've done on them which indicates that the 6i's are giving me pretty accurate frequency response. I thought I was throwing away my money when I bought them but now I think they're one of the best deals I've ever gotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"best \\"noise cancelling\\" in-ear phones","review":"I fly a lot and these little jobbies have saved my ear drums. I put them in and don't even plug them into my iPod so they can block out the noise of the jet engines. Strangely enough, I can still understand people as long as I stop my music. The sound quality is absolutely excellent. I use them when vacuuming, mowing the lawn and flying. They feel pretty funky at first, but I got used to them and now they don't even bother me. They're actually pretty comfy. The quality is outstanding and the carrying case is pretty nice. I hear really good things about Etymotic Research as a company.

The bass is not very strong, but the treble is crisp and clean - very nice.

I would not recommend these to anyone - save yourself the hassle!

Slightly concerned about pulling the wire out from the ear bud but so far that they have been great. Much more worth the money than Shures lower level earbuds, at least in my opinion.

The company is very helpful at letting you try different tips ,so that you can find out what is most comfortable for you. They must get a good seal for you toget any bass and get good noise rejection.The only downside if you use these dayly is the expensive filters and ear tips.I dont use them alot,they are mainly for trips,and mowing the grass.In thse uses they block the noise without having to turn up the volume to ear damaging levels!I rate them as a 4 because of the associated cost of the tips and filters $15 a set!.The company really needs to reduce the prices on these items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Average pair of phones - sound quality","review":"Bought this pair of sound isolating ear-phones after i had lost my pair of Shure E2C. Observing the high average rating of these phones, i thought that i'll give them a try. And I was really disappointed. The sound quality is marginally (if at all) better than the std pair of iPod headphones...and no where close to the Shure that i loved. I do realize that often people say that quality is quite subjective and dependent on individual preferences, but even my buddies didn't like it at all. Although they work great as ear plugs. I guess they may be good for others ...but for me I give it two thumbs down. I might have to return it or gift it to someone and get the Shure again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound that won't last","review":"Horrible lifetime. The audio is great, yes, but it just won't last. I'm careful and it lasted 7 months.

There are other phones with good audio out there at this price point. Stay away from this one if you value your hard earned money.About the audio... of course I don't need to tell anything.

I used to have the Sony MDR-EX71SL until they had an unfortunate encounter with the zipper on my briefcase. Perhaps I am unsophisticated, but I liked the overall inherent sound on the EX71SL better than the ER6i. The sound on the Sony's was warmer, and I felt like I could see the string vibrating on the electric bass, etc. It's possible that I haven't perfected the ear insertion procedure on the ER6i's which according to the user's manual and other reviews is critical to achieve optimal sound.However, in terms of listener isolation from ambient sounds, my experience suggests that the ER6i is far superior to the Sony product, and it was in hope of that isolation that I got these instead of simply getting the same product as before. For what it's worth, the volume setting on the MP3 player is several clicks lower than it used to be when on airplanes."},{"rating":"1","title":"one huge shortcoming","review":"After a year the rather thin cord developed a short near the 3.5mm plug.

While reading all about how great the bass was, etc. I was set for something special. It didn't happen. The bass response was totally lacking with all three of my mp3 players. I mean you can jam these things all the way in to your eardrum and it's still going to sound very tinny and weak.I went back to the ole creative earbuds that came with my most recent player and they sound great in comparison. I wouldn't use these Etymotic ER6i's if they were free, much less for $75. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Quality and Comfort","review":"I bought these earphones 2 days after receiving my ipod.

I had maybe 3 months of good use out of them before they broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"no bass, too much mid range","review":"I was extremely disappointed with the overall quality of these headphones. You have to literally shove them so far up your eardrums to get the faintest of bas response that it makes wearing these very uncomfortable. I have a pair of Sony in ear headphones that I paid half the cost and they absolutely blow these away. Easier to get in and out of the ear, more comfortable to wear, and crisper highs with lots of bass. The wires are also very thin and too long on the 6i's. A lot of people may say that the 6i's have a more accurate sound, but if your idea of great sound is all mid range, then buy these headphones, otherwise you are much better off with a pair of Sony's at half the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no bass","review":"These headphones have no bass! This is inexcusable considering the high price. The headphones are extremely comfortable, and the mid and high range sound quality is superb. Without adequate bass, they simply don't recreate the theater experience that Etymotic claims. Don't be fooled - all your bass are belong to other headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the airline trips","review":"As a frequent traveler, I wanted earphones that provided high-fidelity music reproduction while blocking aircraft noise.

I don't like a lot of bass anyway. I'd rather be able to pick out the instruments and not have them drowned out by the low notes. Some music I listen to has booming bass passages (think Tommy by The Who) and I need them to boom. They don't. I'd rather cut the bass with my ipod EQ than not have enough. With that said, I'd give them 5 stars for my tastes because they are just about perfect. I only gave them 4 Stars so others will know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not designed to last","review":"Having owned two pairs of these, I can attest to the poor quality of the workmanship.

The trick here is to follow the instructions and get a good inner ear seal. When you first put them in they will sound tinny but as your ears heat up the rubber inserts they will conform more to the shape of your ear...and presto; excellent sound. One last thing: if you're looking for booming bass get Headphones; while these have very good bass response they will not give you the bass feel you're looking for if you're into lots trunk rattling bass ala hip-hip and rap.

While the headphones do a good job of isolation and fit under a helmet rather well, they leave much to be desired in the sound department. I should have considered other reviews more carefully when they commented on lack of bass response. No matter what I tried (all buds including the earplug type) the headphones sealed well and were comfortable but lacked full range response. Music just sounded flat and tinny. If you desire strong mid-range sound or any decent amount of bass I can't recommend these headphones.

These earphones do sound good and when you get the fit correct with one of the three included ear piece sets they really do cut down on the ambient sound around you. I was able to set the volume to 50% of my normal volume levels that I was using with two other sets of headphones.These in-ear earphones do sound good, but you may find earphones just as good or almost as good at a much lower price.

It may not be fair to compare the two given their physical configurations, but if you look at the retail value of both, the Etymotics should be blowing the Sens out of the water, and they just don't come close to doing that.

These earphones offer you none. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nadda. NOTHING! And yes, I crammed them into my ear canals until I practially touched the inner walls of my brain. The seal was perfect. I gave it a week. And still, I heard nothing in terms of bass.Honestly, I do not know what the people who gave it five stars are thinking. Again, I am not a bass fanatic. I do not have monster subwoofers in the trunk of my car or turn my home sub \\"up to 11\\"! But on a bass scale of 1 to 10, these things are practically in the negative digits.Extremely disappointing for a set of earphones at this price point."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bass response.","review":"Well, I read all the mixed reviews and really wanted these phones to work. You'll notice many of the good reviews are by self proclaimed audiophiles or other \\"experts\\". Many of them presume if you don't hear enough bass, you either don't know how to insert the product in your ear or don't know good sound. Let me tell you, if I had inserted these things any further in my ear canal, it would have taken a surgeon to remove them. I've been using headphones of all types for twenty years and while I'm no audiophile, I know good sounding from bad. In my experience these things lack any kind of bass output.I tried all the different shaped tips that came with the product and different positions in the ear canal. Nothing mattered. I suspect these phones rely on specifically shaped ear canals. Yes, their clarity was amazing but the complete lack of low end was appauling. They're going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in product","review":"I was very disappointed in the earphones when the soft plastic tip became lodged in my ear. I wound up having to go to emergency to have it removed. The fact that they are not permanately attached to the earpiece makes them unsafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed","review":"I bought these headphones because I read good things about them. As soon as I had used them in my hands but it was difficult to be comfortable with them. Included some sleeves that fit very well into the ear canal but little use to hurt. On the other hand though it fits nicely into your ear canal does not completely isolate external noise. For all this I had to return them and buy me SCL2 Shure Sound Isolating Earphones - Clear that were cheaper and better audio and do not hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Low End","review":"I noticed immediately that there was something wrong with these earplugs. I ended up using them for less than 1 hour. There was no \\"low-end\\" AT ALL. I'm not into booming bass, but these earplugs were terrible. They sounded \\"tinny\\". I listen to Big Band, 70's & 80's pop, classical and none of my music sounded good with these earphones. My original earphones were a 1000 times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment...","review":"I'm not sure what everyone's talking about with these. I bought them based on reviews, and the sound is really disappointing. Could it be I'm doing something wrong? Is there some button or switch I need to flip on these things? Cause the sound is terrible. No bass whatsoever, no matter what the EQ setting on my iPod.And noise isolating? Again, I don't get it. I thought my ear canals were pretty mainstream up til now, but maybe I have fine grooves which let in ambient sound. I'm going to return them and buy something cheaper and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I got these specifically for use with my IPOD Touch which I plan to use while riding my motorcycle.

They dug deep into my ear canal (so far that it took a ton of earwax too). And I found the quality poor. (My cheap sonys sounded better)The e3c's are so comfortable - I don't feel them and the sound is way superior. - go for those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect reproduction of everything but ANY base <50hz","review":"Seems innocent to not reproduce the TOTALITY of the deep base of everything you want to listen to through the headphones, but guess what?It's a FATAL flaw.

As a result, these only lasted a few months before they stopped working."},{"rating":"1","title":"ER6i: don't belive the hype","review":"I had reasonably high expectations for this product, based on a few online reviews. I will agree that there is a certain clarity and presence to the midrange, but stop there. I am totally disappointed at this product. These could be classified as \\"gutless\\". There is *nothing* resembling bass here. In fact, they sound disembodied and thin. These do not deliver bass as the recording intended, they deliver no bass. These sound like $9.00 ear buds with a rubber surround. It's as if they took the same cheap transducers and made them into an earplug. The claims of eliminating outside noise are greatly exaggerated as well. They do kill about 15db, but nothing like the claim. I returned these. I recommend Bose \\"over the ear\\" headphones (really!) or Sennheiser 280HD for far superior performance at a similar price. Again, the ER6i are a good set of $12.00 headphones for $74.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small in size, small in sound.","review":"I wanted to use these earphones to replace the uncomfortable ones that came with my iPod. I was so disappointed with how the ER6i earphones sounded that I returned them. \\"Small\\" is the best way to describe it. Little or no bass at all and a very \\"pinched\\" mid range. One look at the responce curve tells the whole story...there is simply very little bass that comes out of these, only an overly pronounced midrange. These things just sound...bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"These earphones are not worth the money. There is absoultly no base tone at all. I tried inserting them according to their instructions, and there was still no base tone. I tried using them with different mp3 players and the sound was all the same. I returned them for credit and bought the Bose in ear phones. They sound great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not enough bass","review":"It gets two stars from me for comfort and clear high sounds. But missing three stars for lack of bass and tangling cords. I tried these earphones for two days and they are big on treble but very lacking on bass. It's not that I like bass more than most...the bass on the ER6i is almost non-existent. The $30 iPod earphones that came with my iPod package were significantly better, except for the fit and comfort. The ER6i phones are very comfortable and fit snugly...unlike the iPod phones, but the sound is all highs and little lows. If you turn up the treble in a factory car radio and turn the bass to -5...that's what it sounded like to me. Oh...and the cords are a mess...tangled every time. This will be the first time I've returned an electronics item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin weak sound","review":"I had read great things about the ER6i's, so with Amazon having a great price on these headphones I figured I would give them a try. Plugged them in and tried a variety of music and the sound was consistently thin and weak. I tried them with the flanges, the foam ear buds and nothing improved the sound. There is literally no bass and the volume has to be cranked up to get decent sound. These will be going back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way bright","review":"Bought this a few weeks ago on the advice of a friend to replace the stock ipod earphones which frayed on me (literally).These earphones are quite overated. My main objection is that they are extremely bright --any audiophile reading this will know what I mean by this term. If you are listen to and like the sound of tube gear, this earphone is definitely not for you. I can't stand more than a few minutes of it at a time without turning the volume way down--it sounds like someone put the treble on maximum permanently. Tremendous inherent distortion. I read with amusement some of the reviews here where the reviewers laud this earphone for 'clarity'. No accounting for taste, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"Neither the company who sold me the ear phones through Amazon or Etymotic Research would let me return these headphones. These headphones did not improve the quality of the sound, and actually sounded worse than the regular iPod headphones. I do not recommend these headphones for the price at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I wanted to rate this item zero stars but the system wouldn't allow it!I was amazed at how poorly these earphones performed in comparison with the earphones that came with my IPOD Shuffle.

I thought the sound quality was adequate with the JVC earphones but, since I use my iPOD a lot, I decided to treat myself to a better quality product. I admittedly am not an expert on earphones, but I was really amazed at the astounding improvement in the clarity of sound as well as the ability of the earphones to block out outside noise. The earphones come with three different sets of earplugs so I think you're pretty much guaranteed to get a good fit. The earplugs stay securely on the filters (which seems to be a major complaint against the $100 Bose in-ear headphones). It is, however, important to position the earphones properly in the ear canal to get the best quality sound. I think these earphones are a very good product for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice in-ear earphones","review":"I do enjoy listening to all my music on the ER6i earphones. Though they are relatively expensive compared to headphones you can buy at most local electronics retailers, the sound quality is well beyond anything I have heard before (I go through about 4 different sets every 12 months). The low frequencies don't hit as hard as I might want them to, but they still sound great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound and service","review":"Purchased from Amazon and brought them to MacWorld.

Buying another set for my wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using as in ear monitors for rock band","review":"I actually just used these last night in my band. They sound good, and do an incredible job of blocking out external noise. I even put them in without music playing and compared them to my Etymotic Research ER20's I used to use. These earbuds seemed to block out the same amount of noise (maybe even a little more) than the ER20's. The sound quality is good. The only complaint I have is that the wires seem a little flimsy, and when you move around a lot they make a thud noise in the buds. I resolved this problem by running them by wearing them upside down in my ears, then ran the wire up the front of my ears, then behind my ears, and then to a spot on the back of my head (where I taped the two wires together so they stay tight against me). I then used the clip that comes with them and clipped to the top of my back collar. That said, these worked great, and my drummer is about to buy a pair for the same use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound but build quality lacking","review":"I purchased the earphones in February 2007 and one of earpieces quit working in March 2008 just out of the 1 year warranty. They were used less than 50 times and cared for by an anal retentive adult. The sound was good but my ears would get sore from the earpiece after a while. I have thought about buying another pair because I liked the sound quality but don't want to spend $100 on something that may only last a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, poor quality","review":"Sound was awesome and all was great until about 8 months of use.

Decided to order it based upon the reviews from the other users. When I received it, I was totally disappointed though. The build of this earbuds seems very flimsy, and the sound leaves much to be desired, at least for me (and I'm no basshead - I know that appreciation and taste varies from person to person, but for me the sound was very dull).I couldnt return home without a pair of good new headphones, so I ended up buying a Klipsch Image S4 and a pack of Comply foam tips at an airport kiosk which allowed me to try a pair, and I dont regret it. Please, if you're considering buying this headphone, try to find it on a store and try it out first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the pricetag","review":"Like so many things they were great till they not longer worked.

There is slight improved clarity, but not much bass. All in all I probably would have kept them since for the money, you're not going to find amazing ear canal monitors, but the problem I have is with the tips - none of them work, except for maybe the foam tips (akin to common foam earplug) which will get slowly worse and worse especailly with sweat from the gym, and replacements are $14!?!? forget it. Who wants to be \\"rolling earplugs\\" every time you put earphones on either to make them squeeze into your ears. ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sound, however they always break","review":"I've never had better headphones than these, once they're in the vaccum of your ear all noise will be blocked out and you'll have the best music experience ever.However they're very delicate. My first pair broke in about a year of usage. Basically I could hear only one side, I suppose the cable broke or disconnected either on the plug or on the speaker.After that I bought a second pair, and I was extremely careful with it, I never put my ipod in my pocket with the headset plugged in to it, I'd always fold it the correct way and keep it in its separate bag.I did this religiously for two years, and about a month ago I was running with the headsets on, and the right speaker stopped working.I wish they'd make them a little more resistant, after using them I've tried to buy other headsets but the sound is crap compared to Etymotic and I guess I'll have to spend another $[...] since without music I'm just not productive at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent noise reduction, very good sound quality","review":"I was looking for a earplug/ earphone and these are the best ones I have tried yet.

I do give Weldon and Ankerberg the credit of doing a good job of research in this book. They analyze Mormon documents and appear to have a sophisticated knowledge of the Momron Church. However, my praise really stops there. The books makes several errors in its abstraction of evidence from out-of-context situations. Often the authors regard minute points in the Mormon faith far beyond their significance. They harp on points that really don't matter in the larger scheme. The result is that one must sort though a mess of writing before coming to a final conclusion. This makes the book very exacting to read. I suggest one reads something else before tackling the arcana these two authors invent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some people need to grow up.","review":"I do not agree or believe in Mormonism myself, but this book is total and utter immaturity.

After about a month or so, it discolored the wooden dining chair it was sitting on - beyond repair. I'm not sure if this is true only of the green seat. Also, after about six months a crack formed in the side (my toddler is heavy, again, so it could have been due to his size) and it eventually widened to the point that a huge chunk of the seat came off altogether. This is only after 7-8 months of use. I simply cannot recommend this product and truly wish I gone with another seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!","review":"Love this seat! We have a 3 year old who has no problem sitting in it, even though he's a \\"big boy\\" now. It travels with us everywhere. It is soft, unlike the hard plastic seats, lightweight, easy to clean, and a big bonus is no cracks for falling food to get stuck in. I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND this seat, and will say without a doubt, it is well worth the higher price (compared to any of the cheaper, hard, bulky seats). It is nice that it does not have to attach to the chair with straps and buckles, like others I've seen. It stays in place, but is easy to move, easy to get in and out of, and easy to grab and go. Even our daughter sat in it at a very early age, closely supervised of course. Among the baby/infant purchases which often seemed like must haves at the time, but looking back realistically were such a waste, this item was DEFINITELY WELL WORTH IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!

The problem we had after ony three days of use, is that the seats actually left permanent marks on the finish of two pretty expensive chairs. The paint was marred by every dimple on the bottom of the cooshie seats. ... . My suggestion; if you have chairs with a painted finish that you are hoping to protect, do not buy these unless you plan to put something between the cooshie and your chair seat which would defeat the non slip feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Read","review":"I enjoyed this book, which I read a few years after beginning my airline career.

I recommend it for airline crewmembers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Menacing and Beautiful","review":"This is one of my favorite albums. It is a recording of an improvised performance, one part Brian Lustmord, one part Shad Scott. Stylistically speaking, these artists come from widely disparate regions of the Electronic World, and yet they manage to compliment each other quite nicely. Scott occupies the foreground of the music for the most part, utilizing Autechre-esque rhythms along with bleeping melodies and casual synths, while Lustmord takes up the rest of the spectrum,injecting weird, muted noises and menacing organic drones. Overall, this is a beatiful example of noise art, more abrasive than Lustmord's collaboration with Robert Rich, but subtler than \\"The Monstrous Soul\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont wish for such dreams! (or, oh my god its 1993 again)","review":"But if you like your music dark, sci-fi effects included, buy this album.Lustmord Vs.

The story's not particularly gripping, but original enough to be interesting.Dana Andrews (The Ox-Bow Incident, Hotrods To Hell) and Brian Donlevy (Destry Rides Again, The Quatermass Xperiment) are businessmen in a tiny goldrush town in Oregon. Donlevy is engaged to Susan Hayward but Dana Andrews cares for her as well. Andy Devine (Island In The Sky, That's The Spirit) is a nearby settler, Hoagie Carmichael sings some songs, Ward Bond (A Guy Named Joe, It's A Wonderful Life, etc.) is a bad guy; young Lloyd Bridges (High Noon, Airplane) a good guy.You'll see a cabin raising, poker games, gold dust, a bar fight, an Indian attack, a shoot-out, and murder, all in technicolor. Definitely the choice if you just want to see one typical example of old fashioned westerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Feng Shui book that speaks to me","review":"I've browsed or read many different books on Feng Shui, but none of them speaks to me the way this one does. I'll admit I'm quite partial to Lam Kam Chuen, whose book on Qigong, (The Way of Energy) changed my life, and continues to impress me as the \\"must-have\\" book on qigong.In the Feng Shui Handbook, Lam uses an authentic Chinese Feng Shui paradigm (the five animals map) which is very simple, practical, and makes intuitive sense, as opposed to the mind-bending intricacies of other schools such as lo-shan, bagua, magic squares, Chinese astrology, compass directions, red strings and octogonal mirrors, which seem to me based more in superstition than practical effect.Lam's Feng Shui Handbook is the only feng shui handbook I've ever needed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one I still glance through,","review":"I bought a stack of casual feng shui books and I used them for guiding furniture placement so really, for me, it was more design than superstition that this philosophy is useful.

I also ordered another book by Simon Brown, \\"Practical Feng Shui\\", which also has its faults, but not as many as the _Feng Shui Handbook_. In this book there are too many general things mentioned, which don't tell you anything about the unfortunate placements of bathrooms and so forth, or directions at all. The only thing I got out of this book was the story of the turtle, the dragon, the bird Phoenix, the tiger and the snake in the middle, so if you are willing to pay money for just that, then go ahead and buy it.

Everything else is soothing instrumental's that will complete any night and help calm any person. The beats are hip-hop with a beautiful blend of piano, violin, and other various instruments that go well with these beats. Truth be told all this album does is make you crave more from these producers. It's hard to say who was better between Fat Jon and Nujabes on production but it's kind of in between. They both have songs you start to really love and can't stop listening to. The only thing wrong is the sound quality, it doesn't have the best sound on Battlecry and Siki no uta but it's very good on the other tracks. Also I think a DVD sould of been added because Siki no uta is not as good without the ending video from the series for some reason that video makes the song sound better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute...","review":"I have to admit this was my first time buying a knife like this, and I was quite pleased with it when it arrived yesterday.

Encompassing both pictorial arts and architecture, it points central themes in the arts of that time. It offers clues to further investigations as to the seminal character of the fundamental changes in the art and architecture of the late 18th century. And it is wonderfully wide in perspective and clear in its argument. It presents a number of focus in a period where one gets easily lost in either superficial statements or far too detailed information.It is a great starting point for any research into its period."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Their Best","review":"I gotta admit, this is the one I keep coming back to out of all the bootlegs I own. It just has a great mood, and except for one small screw up (early in Thin Air), it's completely solid. Vedder's voice is in great condition, and the rest of the band is also in fine form. I recommend this one if you want to hear Pearl Jam play most of their softer songs in a live setting. No, it is not an acoustic performance in the traditional sense (as the electric guitar is played appropriately), but it is a very nice addition to the catalog nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

Everything this band puts out feels like a gift, and I'm sure this will be no exception. I agree that they are the most talented, UNDERrated band playing today, and I feel they got a raw deal in the 90's, probably because none of them committed suicide. I have respect for Kurt & Nirvana, but there is much to be said for a band that sticks around, keeps banging away and producing stunningly great music, while at the same time taking a stand for things that are important to them, individually and as a band.

Live at Benaroya Hall had some good songs on it like like Immortality, Nothing As It Seems and Black. However, I didn't hear anything great and Pearl Jam's unplugged CD pales in comparison to Eric Clapton, Nirvana and Korn's Unplugged CDs.I enjoyed Man of the Hour.My issue with the CD is Pearl Jam played their soft (downsides) songs acoustically - big deal! Daughter's soft anyway. I would have been more impressed to hear an unplugged version of Go, Alive, Dissident, Once. Mix it up. That's what makes a great unplugged CD.This is not their best CD. Nothing Pearl Jam will ever do will compare to Ten. Pearl Jam peaked on their first CD.I have a question. How many live / acoustic CD's does Pearl Jam need to make??? Live on Two Legs was very good. Do we need 30 more live CDs?

The set is varied, with newer songs (some from \\"Lost Dogs\\") and oldies (like \\"Black\\" or \\"Immortality\\"). I suppose more key PJ songs could have been included, such as \\"Even Flow\\" (with its always impressive bridge), but it's still a satisfying set, with the occasional vocal crack or missed note.

We love the cardinals but could do without the pigeons, so we decided a window bird feeder would do the trick. I bought this brand based on the great reviews, some of which said cardinals used it. I have had it up for months and NO birds use it. But the main problem is, even if they wanted to, cardinals are much too big to land on this thing (don't know where they got the image from! Must be a miniature cardinal).Otherwise, it is good quality, attractive and is solidly attached to the glass, which is great.

These connectors make the strollers too wide to fit through even doors accessible to wheelchairs. The stroller's wheels get all hung up on one another in the middle every time you make a turn. I thought this gadget would save me from having to buy an expensive double umbrella stroller. Since I gave it a good try the strollers are gently used and cannot be returned. Now I'm out the price of two strollers and the connectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works for doubles too!","review":"I have an infant in-home daycare and needed a quad stoller for my four babies. When I first found these connectors, no one could tell me if they would connect two tandem double strollers together. I asked every store in town almost (some didn't even know what they were!). I just decided to buy them and hoped that they would work. So I went out and bought two Kolcraft Lil' Limo strollers, not knowing, of course, if it would work or not. I'm happy to say that they seem to work really well! I did have to buy a second set, though, so I have five connectors on mine(couldn't find room for the sixth one). Just lock the two inner front wheels so they can't turn and you're off! It is a little hard to turn corners(just take them at a wide angle), but otherwise it works great! I ended up spending just under [price] for the total cost of it, much less buying an actual quad stroller. I hope this info will be helpful to someone else also. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I have a small daycare and was needing a triple stroller. I wanted all of the children to be able to face forward, but those kind of strollers were quite expensive. I decided to buy three Chicco C6 strollers and bought two packages of the connectors to connect them all together. It works fantastic. They are very easy to put on and just as easy to take off when there's a day when I only need two of the strollers, I just disconnect one of the connectors and off we go. When using the connectors, it was easier on my strollers to lock the front inner wheels, so that just the outer wheels will turn, that way they don't turn into each other. I've already recommended the connectors to quite a few people. This is a great product and a very economical way to get a larger stroller!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the money","review":"Very convenient - I have a one year old and I babysit a one year old. I'm definitely not going to spend 100 bucks or more on a double stroller, but since I found two umbrella strollers on sale for 10 bucks each, my double stroller was only 30 bucks! It handles well.

Going over a bump in the sidewalk or making a simple turn and the connectors popped off. The rubber pads also fell out--one wasn't even in place when I took it out of the package. Hard to explain if you haven't seen the product, but basically if one connector came off there were up to 6 parts to collect. And this wasn't an occasional event. We walked one block and one connector fell off. We turned around then and by the time we were almost back the other two had come off as well so I ended up leaving one kid and walking them back individually. It took a lot of carefulness over each bump and they still fell off. Plus it required both hands at all times when pushing. Waste of money. Waste of time. Big disappointment.

Before checking in, I could push two strollers at once and my husband could take care of the luggages. After checking in, we removed the connectors to go through security. It is true that sometimes the stroller wheels got stuck, but until there is a better invention, I think this is good enough solution for now.

It's great for travel and is easy to clean. Because there are no straps, it's great for taking out to eat instead of having them sit in the dirty booster seats in restaurants. However, BE VERY CAREFUL when your child is in this seat. It moves around fairly easily and a wiggly toddler can certainly pitch it off a chair without too much effort. It would be best used on a chair with arms or side rails, but on a kitchen chair or stool with only a back and no arms, you have to be at your child's side at all times. I have also found that it's very slippery on leather covered seats and better on solid wood (not secure, but less slippery). Very easy to clean and makes a nice outside seat on the ground for going to watch a game or have a picnic.

I emailed the company and TWO MONTHS later they wrote back and asked for pictures. We'll do so and see if we can get a refund, as it's appalling that a booster seat that cost this much did not last very long at all!PS - we did get a replacement booster seat, but now have a different booster for my son while waiting for the replacement.

Both of them LOVE it. The seat is comfortable for them to sit on, unlike the hard plastic seat we had before it. It doesn't slide around on the chair, and it is SO easy to clean. I also like that it is easy to take along if we're headed to grandma's house. No extra straps, trays, or pieces to worry about! I don't have a single complaint with this seat after 2 years of use...it is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOOSTER!","review":"I love this booster seat! I have purchased both the Fold Up Booster Seat and the Deluxe On-The-Go Booster Seat only to be disappointed with too many straps and zippers. Not to mention, that my two year old daughter didn't trust their stability once they were strapped into the chair. She refused to sit in either of them. I purchased the Cooshie Booster Seat and she loves it. I take it everywhere. It sits securely in place and is comfortable for her to sit in. Not to mention that I don't have to worry about using the nasty boosters available in restaurants. I just clean it up with a damp cloth or antibacterial wipe and off we go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off great - but BEWARE","review":"We ordered two of these booster seats for our children. With the high price tag, we expected them to last through all four children. However, after two years, they both ripped. The problem is, if your child likes to get down from the chair by him/herself and you don't actually pull the chair back for them to get down from the front of the seat, then they have to slide over the edge of the booster. After awhile, it will tear. The entire side of both boosters is now gone. They still work but they look horrible. I would recommend a booster without the sides (which is what they turn into!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best booster we've used!","review":"I cannot recommend this product highly enough. We went through several other boosters before discovering this one while dining at a friend's house. The seat is comfortable for my two kids (now 5 and 3) who have each been using one since about 2 years old. They can climb in and out of it without the seat falling off the chair due to the slightly sticky nature of the rubber bottom. The seat is a snap to wipe clean with a sponge, and lightweight enough to carry to grandma's or wherever. My parents tried to buy one at Babies 'R Us to keep at their house, and apparently they have stopped carrying it and now have their own copycat (and greatly inferior) version. I found this seat to be well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat! Buying Another!","review":"I bought a Cooshie Booster about a year and a half ago for my son. Despite the daily use and not so nice treatment (my son throws it on the floor when he doesn't want to use it and sometimes drags it around the house to use in other locations), it is still in great shape. No breaks or tears and cleans up very easily. I also like that it's soft, so it doesn't scratch our dining room chairs and it stays in place well. Both my children seem comfortable in it and seems to enjoy using it. My daughter is now about 20 months old and she and her brother are starting to fight over the booster, so I am buying a second one. I didn't even consider another booster; I just went straight for a second Cooshie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Booster for kids.","review":"My twins really like this booster. It is comfortable to sit on and it does not slide around on the chair. It is easy to clean and we can bring it with us when we go on vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This booster can ruin the finish of wood chairs","review":"We recently bought three of these boosters for our daughters. We had just purchased a new dining set and the chairs were too low for our girls to eat comfortably at the table. The chemical finish on the booster migrated on to our wooden chairs and ruined the finish. The finish became gummy and any attempt to take off the gumminess took the finish along with it. We will have to get these brand new chairs refinished at our own expense. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy these boosters for wooden chairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning for your furniture","review":"This booster seat is a great concept but it destroyed my solid oak kitchen chair! It left a dark gummy residue on the seat and back spindles. I've tried everything to remove it but it looks like I will now have to have the chair professionally fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"Our daughter is almost 2- and the highchair was getting in the way more than anything. We found this chair and bought it immediatly. It sits onto our exsisting chairs and does not slip or slide off. She loves being a big girl now and sitting at the table. Its easy to clean off and very durable. We had some of the other boosters for our sons but they were never able to slide them under the table, so the chairs stuck out. Glad we found this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Great, Great!!!","review":"I purchased this seat because my 22 month old son (who is big for his age) just didn't seem comfortable in the fold away hard plastic one we had. He was always trying to slide down and wouldn't enjoy sitting in it. This seat is just the opposite! He sits in it great, he looks so much more comfortable and doesn't fuss to get out of it. Plus, with no crazy straps all around, it is so handy to just put on and take off the chair. I will admit, it may be a little pricey for what it actually is, but for me, it was well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooshie booster","review":"We love this product and so do are children. We got this for our daughter who is almost 4 years old because she can not reach the table without kneeling. This works great and she is so comfortable. My son (alomst 2) loves it too but without straps and because it is hard for him to sit still, I would not recommend it for an active toddler. The downside is that is slides from our fabric-covered chair so it is not the most stable."},{"rating":"2","title":"great seat !","review":"This booster is great. The material it is made of grips the chair so it doesn't slide around when the kids get in and out. We have 2 year old twin boys and having 2 highchairs takes up a lot of space. We switched them to these and they have done great at the table. Plus they are super-easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"the only booster my toddler will use","review":"Love this booster seat! My independant 2 yr old would not use anything else until I found this seat. He was over the high chair and other boosters I tried quickly and wanted to be a big boy. We have had luck with this seat for 4 mos so far and is nice that there are no straps so he can change chairs at the table if he wants to. Easy to clean with no hidden crevices, etc. Definitely worth the little bit extra it costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible product","review":"This product ruined my new wood diningroom chairs!It sat for a week on my chair and left a shiny residue that couldn't be cleaned off.I only wonder what is coming off on the child that sits on it.It is made by baking it in an oven in a mold.They say it is safe but I wonder!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection!!","review":"This is urban gospel at its best!! This album was so cutting edge for its time that nearly 20 years on, one has to be amazed at the production genius of Fred Hammond. This was the album that turned me on to gospel music. Still sounds relevant and fresh today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"This purse, I mean mechanic's tool bag works really well. The bottom is sturdy and is very capable of holding equipment. I have a few small complaints though.- The zipper is poorly designed- The side compartments are hard to open and they don't hold very much. They're divided into 3 small sections. (Although they do look nice)- The inside pouches are kinda annoying too.But, I would still recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little bag!","review":"I needed a bag in my truck to organize all the electronic stuff scattered in various places. All my chargers,cords, ipod plugs, pc cables, gps, digi camera and flashlights are now in a portable bag. I can take bag out for security reasons if needed. Very durable and heavy duty for it's size. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"The Rothco G.I. Brass Zipper tool bag is a high quality item. It is made of a heavy cotton canvas with a large solid brass zipper. I bought it to put some tools together to have in my vehicle at all times and for that it is perfect. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"All organic??????","review":"Perhaps the company should reconsider rewriting its promo for this product.

That is the only reason I am giving it 4 stars, else I would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Review","review":"Item was easy to locate on Amazon. It was exactly what I needed for the blender. Great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine. Looks like good quality.","review":"Works fine with our Hamilton Beach E52210. The blade connections on the bottom are perfect. As other reviewers noted, the top does not fit perfect. Our existing top is very tight on this new jar but it will go on (getting it off is the problem!). I just leave it part-on/part-off when mixing which is fine since I usually stir a few times, anyway. Overall it is great to have a new jar that works and looks decent to avoid spending alot more for a whole new blender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost fits but back to blending","review":"Leaks a bit in the blade department but not enough to stop me from blending. Just a trickle, no torrent of smoothie spills.Very happy I could just get this replacement and not have to purchase a whole new blender. Woohoo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit. Cost more to return!!","review":"I bought this to replace a broken HB blender jar. This product stated that it's compactable with the model I have. It was shipped to me on time. However, it doesn't fit on the base without leaking when I tested it with water. I wanted to return but found that it would cost me more than the Jar price to ship back. I contacted the seller hoping that they can provide a shipping label because otherwise this jar will be a brand new waste going to recycle. But seller refused to provide return shipping... It's just not a pleasant shopping experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service","review":"This was easy to order and the product made it to my house very quickly. This is just what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor fit","review":"The hardware (collar, O-ring and blade) and lid from my Hamilton Beach blender didn't quite fit the jar; it was very easy to cross-thread the collar, causing leaks, and it usually leaked anyway when pouring from the jar.I unwisely handled the thing by the collar the other day, and the jar popped off and broke. I'm just going to buy a new blender now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Oster Glass Replacement","review":"Broke a Costco-purchased Oster blender jar. The round glass jar for Oster is not available, only plastic. This one fit the blender very well. Not an exact match, missing the torque stop at the bottom of the jar, but this does not pose a functional problem. The Oster lid fits a bit loosely, but again not a real problem; the bottom parts (the blade and screw-on retainer) fit fine. If you have an Oster and want to replace a glass jar then this will work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real knee slapper...","review":"This has to be one of the most unintentionally funny movies I've seen. I was reminded of the 60's Batman TV series throughout, it was that kind of comedy. The outlandish situations combined with the overly deliberate use of police slang was a hoot. It is the only movie I can think of where nearly everyone in the theater busted out laughing during the 'tense and dramatic' climactic scene. Think 'Head Detective' with an index finger! I can't wait till this movie is out on video, so I can watch it again and again. If you're a fan if 'serious' movies gone horribly (and hilariously) awry, I can't recommend this movie enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could of been great!.","review":"I was actually dissapointed in the movie after waiting almost 3.5 years to see it after I had read the book. With the acters they had picked, that was their first mistake. And with the money and time they had to do this movie, it could of been better then Seven, but NO!. They did not hold you as the book did, and they even had that as a guide to go by. They missed putting in some of the best parts of the book into the movie which is why it held a person in the grip of terror. I can say this perfectly honestly, if I had the money and the actors, I could of made this movie ten times better than Seven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very original","review":"Very original story and well-acted. The filming itself was just fantastic and added a high level of suspense to some scenes.Denzel Washington plays a quadriplegic ex-detective who's been asked by the local police to help solve a case of complicated serial killings. A young female street cop (Angelina Jolie) catches his eye for having a knack for forensics, so he convinces her to assist him in the case. Queen Latifah plays his live-in nurse and is superb. She continues to be one of the most underrated actors around.Everything was well-done in the movie, and it's hard to find any weaknesses. The ONLY weakness is miscasting of Jolie. Although she does a fine job, her physique and personality don't match the desired traits of the character. In this instance, they were obviously looking more for a pretty face than for someone who actually fit the bill. Queen Latifah may have served better for this role. It's still a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not play on any DVD player. Only plays on HD DVD players.","review":"My wife bought it for me for christmas and did not notice that it clearly stated that it only plays on HD DVD player. I really like this movie and was looking forward to watching it!!! This product should not be offered for sale since the average customer would be wanting a DVD that plays on PS3, DVD, etc players. Since the item was opened we could not return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL WORHT SEEING AND ENJOYING!","review":"This is a great movie for those of us who don't like the horry - gorry! And don't need to disect a film to enjoy.Denzel Washington gave a great performance [like to see the critics give as credible a job.]Had enought tension and twists to keep you guessing and hate to admit it but loved the take down.It keeps one interested enough to want to follow the steps even after 3 viewings -- not enough good solid movies out there that don't get interupted by some unsavory nude scene to spoil the whole attitude of the movie.Thanks for a really good movie -- it is Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw off her hands?!?!?","review":"I love the movies. And I can pretty much suspend my disbelief for anything. But when a poorly scripted movie like THE BONE COLLECTOR tells me that a female cop walking the beat is going to be pulled from her position -- because she took some pictures of a crime scene with a disposable camera which are supposed to be phenomenal shots -- and made an instant crime scene investigator ... COME ON! Top that off with the fact that Lincoln Rhymes keeps making her go into these blackened areas where a killer may or may not be without any backup.... And top it all off when he tells her he doesn't want forensics to mess up the crime scene and he needs the handcuffs that are on the dead victim, \\"I need those cuffs. Saw off her hands.\\"WHAT?!? That my friends is messing up the crime scene. Since when is a beat cop better at that job than professionals who have trained for years at it?What a waste of talented actors.If you want to see the BEST serial killer movie, rent SE7EN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This movie was very good. I thought that it had a very suspenseful story line and a story line that was easy to follow. It took a new approach to detective movies.
