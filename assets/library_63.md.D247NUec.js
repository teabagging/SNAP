If you don't like live Jazz (as occasionally me) it is easy to forget it is live, it is a non-stop scent of music that enters you on this album, and I loved Robert Creeley long before Jazz interested me -- although he reads the same (albeit great) poems he reads as in the album entitled with his name. \\"Have we Told you all you thought to know\\" seems to quicken appreciation of his phrasing with a Great Jazz Band...\\"is it really, so quickly, now the time to go?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Affirmations for Self Healing","review":"This is a great little book.

This book is a collection of short essays, some originally written for Minnesota Public Radio - the same people that bring you Garrison Keillor and Lake Wobegon - that are loosely tied together, but can be taken singly without loosing anything. (It would be very hard to stop after just one though.) More than just being about the place, Cold Comfort takes a look at life itself -- what really makes us tick, makes us happy or sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply, beautifully displays the power of percussion","review":"In 1980 this was a breakthrough album, consisting of dynamic performances by master drummer / percussionists showcasing warmth, humor, intensity, and picture-painting. \\"World Music\\", American jazz, future primitive music fusing traditions of innovation. The melodic lines of vibes, marimba and xylophone blend with the power of timpanis, drumset, congas, claves and the rest of the M'Boom artillery. If you like Santana, Spyro Gyra, Gary Burton, Airto, Mickey Hart, or Combustible Edison you should check out this album. It's a gem. By the way, M'Boom is a large group of fine musicians organized by Max Roach -- it isn't Max on his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DEFINITIVE percussion album","review":"I've owned this cd for over 14 years and I just can't recommend it enough. The sounds, production and vibe on this album are as relevant now as when this was originally released in 1979. Max's ensemble creates the most original ethereal, world/afro inspired music you've probably never heard, and it's really hard for to me to imagine anyone not liking this cd because it is so surprising and seminal. A diamond in the rough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitly not a air conditioner I would recommend","review":"This is a very poor built air conditioner. When I unboxed the item, it was leaking oil. So I went ahead and setup this portable air conditioner in my office to see if it would work. This is a very heavy and isn't easy to move from room to room. It doesn't cool very well even on the lowest temperature. The coolest temp. I could get after running it for 24 hours was 70 degrees. This was during the evening hours after the sun went down and not during the day.

It is also delivered in a really off-beat humorous way.Unfortunately, if you can't get into the humor, it will be a very painful digging operation for the content.

It does have very good and specific information on snorkeling. It also has reasonable information on non-aquatic sights and things to do, though only the VERY high points. And has reviews of resturaunts and places to stay, including a few very cheap ones that won't be featured prominently in your typical travel guide. The maps are useless. Don't use it as your only travel guide on a trip. But it is useful, if snorkeling is high on your priorities there. Of limited value otherwise (as the title suggests)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd go elsewhere","review":"This isn't totally useless, but it's not all that great either. Allusions are tough to decipher and the writing is more \\"cute\\" than informative (or funny for that matter). No maps and disappointingly little of use for snorkelers, which is interesting given the man's business. It's not even as pointed as you would think, although it does get a bit vulgar and enviro-political (oh goodie) at points.

You'll find better info on Hawaii in any number of other guides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay For a Freebie","review":"I certainly wouldn't pay money for this book.It had a small amount of good info, but in the end I felt it wasn't worth suffering through the rest to find.I agree with the other reviewers who were disappointed in the lack of snorkeling info and maps.I skimmed most of the book and was sick of SB at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't pay money for this \\"guide\\"","review":"The lack of snorkeling info, and maps?

The Delta's plastic drive wheel stripped gears in the first month and I repaired it. For about the last 3 months I've had to tinker with it before it would start. I put it in the dump and bought this Wilton. The FIRST thing I did was open the power transfer box and check the drive wheels. They are metal, cheap metal, but metal and the look substantial enough for the 4/5 horsepower motor. First use it worked pretty good - runs steady, tracks perfectly, doesn't bog. It is easy to set up and quiet when it is running. I'd recommend this to a hobby woodworker. Light to moderate use, it will do just fine for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"I ordered this product from Amazon long before Christmas 2006. It finally came February 2007, but was badly damaged because of sub standard shipping provided by a cut rate company. I sent the product back and asked Amazon to ship VIA UPS instead. They said they would, but the same cut rate company delivered my second tool, and it was also damaged. I kept it to give to my son since it was his Christmas present. I reported to Amazon that the item was not advertised correctly. I waited a long time for this tool because it was advertised as a 15 amp, 4/5 horsepower disc/belt sander. When it arrived, it is only 6 amp, same as Sears, Home Depot, or anywhere else. It seems the false advertising has still not been corrected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in quality","review":"I bought the bowl for a gift, and when it arrived I noticed some some small gouges on the inside and spots where the colors were not consistent.

Some of it may sound great at some disco played loud, but for a home party, it is not inspiring. In fact, one gets tired of the same sound, mostly laid back, repetitive, some 70's type beat, some New Age, - it doesn't grab you and it certainly doesn't get a party going- Not worth the price. Have played it 3 times already to give it a chance and I still don't look forward to hearing it- The five that \\"passed the test\\" can be forgetable in no time. In fact, the melodies don't seem to stick. This is a way overrated CD for any demanding taste and can easily do without it. I didn't miss anything if I hadn't ordered it.

Even the Cafe Del Mar compilations are better value.Sure the Buddha Bar in Paris is great but it is nothing unique, special or worthy of this price for 2 CDs !

I strongly urge all those who hold respect and admiration towards The Buddha to avoid purchasing any buddha-bar music or paying visits to any of its restaurants. Many aspects of the restaurants ridicule and humiliate the Buddha- for instance the buttocks of the buddha is used as a fountain to pour drinks. To all those who respect the Buddhist philosophy, refrain from investing your money in this awfully disrespectful and humiliating group. Many buddhist countries have expressed their disgust at certain aspects this buddha-bar uses in its humiliation of the Buddha."},{"rating":"2","title":"World beat supreme","review":"The Buddha Bar discs are compilations of a variety of different artists picked by Claude Challe, who is a master. The pieces picked for Buddha and Buddha II, he didn't do Budda III, are exotic, and incredible. It is incredible how Challe has combined music from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and it all seems to fit. The moods conveyed on these discs simply transports you into the most wonderful state.Buy both Buddha Bar I and II, and I guarantee that you will buy the at least 10 more CD's, you will want the artists original discs, the music is that good.Buy the disc, either used on ebay or where ever, just buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never underestimate the power of marketing","review":"This is a mediocre sampling of what the Middle East and Asia has to offer as far as lounge music goes; traditional sounding vocals, chanting, and far eastern accoustic instruments, packaged in a cool box with the notoriety that it came from a nightclub in PARIS!! My question is: how could anyone justify charging this much for a couple of CDs?Some people would be proud to buy an unmarked CD in a brown paper bag because it's the music they are buying--others buy music to belong to the group or hype that surrounds it, or simply to see the cover sitting on their shelf. Buddha Bar is the personification of the latter and were it not for the pretty package, no one would pay 25 cents for this stuff.Go ahead, defy me and enjoy..fortunately there are enough fans that I was able to resell all 4 of my Buddha Bar series right here on Amazon and was able to buy three times as many CDs with the profit.

The dinner music is laid-back and easy listening. I would categorize it as lounge music. Some of the selections I already have in my collection of cds - that validates the appeal for the first cd. Worthy of a 4 star rating.The party music is dance music. Too much vibe, too much rhythm and not much else. In all likelyhood it will not be played again. Best described as a lot of noise.

That's this film.My first problem with this film is the premise: that girls at a girls' school would choose to caress and share tender moments with one another. Everyone knows that women of this age are just beginning to use their claws, and--like puppies--their claws are now the sharpest they will ever be. Every one of these girls should be in a mad, jealous, catfight to appeal to the few men in the film--but instead, they seem to want solely to touch one another or play mild, hilarious pranks.Secondly, the \\"artistic\\" mood detracts from the pornography (if you're into that), and the \\"pornographic\\" scenes detract from the artistry.

The auction enabled me and a guest to be first in-line, for us to take a picture with Mr. Aaron and get an item signed.The \\"VIP\\" line was filled with friends of the employees working at the store....I was number 17 in-line. No a big deal, I'll be in the first 17......wrong. They started to pull 10 people from the \\"general\\" line and every one VIP. So, an hour later I was still in line and by the time a get to the front to get my item signed. They say that no photographs are allowed.I paid over $500 for the right to get an autograph that I could have paid $130. What a major disappointment.Buyer beware when dealing with Steiner Sports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not the same","review":"I must say that this is my opinion only, but the Little Princess dolls put out by \\"DISNEY\\" are not as cute as the dolls made by Playmates Toys.

One way is from a musical standpoint, being a fan of hip hop artist DJ Shadow and wanting to hear how his music was used. Or you happen to be a fan of the cinema and enjoy independently made movies. Regardless of which way you come in, you will not be the same person the same way out. \\"Dark Days\\" is a dark movie, shot entirely in black & white, about people who lived in the tunnels underneath New York City, a population most people ignored. Director Marc Singer captures the feelings and opinions of each person, why they live there, and how they live on a daily basis. Some lost families due to drugs, others feel that this is the best way to beat the system. You manage to get yourself involved in each person, and hope for their best as the film goes along. The documentary ends on a good note, and it makes you re-evaluate your own standards of living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in fiction!","review":"It is sometimes easier to bury ourselves in fiction and enjoy the glitz of Hollywood rather than face the real issues in our world today.

He is now halfway though 2nd grade with a strong B average in Math. He admits that when he does bad on a test it is because he rushes though and doesn't use the stories.I feel that those who think it is too much for the children to learn do not give enough credit to the children!

The Wiggles have been favorites of hers for a few months now, but her attention sometimes wanders after several songs. With \\"Racing to the Rainbow,\\" she can sit through the better part of what is in the end quite a long presentation without losing interest. From an adult point of view, I found the narrative thread in this one a little more engaging and coherent than in some of the other discs that try to tell a story (e.g., \\"Toot Toot\\").The costumes are also notable in this one -- especially the velvet suits, which bring to mind the 1960s and another (much more famous) quarter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not a great book ...","review":"This could have been a delightful story.

The truth shall set you free? I hope so. If we can scrape away the layers of religious dogma, ideological imperatives, and geopolitical manipulations, perhaps a new awareness can lead us closer toward peace and a click away from war.

There are many good books in that genre that explore the concept of what humanity will look like, and even some that explore what we'll sound like. But this book stuck with me because while it took concerted effort to \\"get\\" how to read the story, once I did, it was practically effortless to maintain. Once I made the conscious connection between sounds and the words on the page, I had no issues.Ironically, I think younger readers would have an easier time making that mental switch, as I think it's the accumulated learned distance between the written word and oral storytelling that creates the hurdle that most negative reviewers seem to be stumbling upon. Focus on hearing the sounds that those individual letters make, and the cadence of a person telling you a story, and you'll have a much easier time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't finish it","review":"I am a fan of post apocalyptic fiction.

Picked it back up, tried really hard one more time, made it a little over half-way...putting it down for good. I got to where I could read a page of the language without having to work too hard, but realized the story was really dragging and going nowhere. No real character development to speak of. I'm sayin' it's almost like it's all gimmick no substance, and the book tries to stand on the weight of its own uniqueness, but fails.

I finally got my hands on a copy and gave it a try, and for all I know, those who call it such are correct. I couldn't tell. Hoban buys completely into the idea of creating a dialect that is only vaguely resembling English, and worse, he has his narrator use it for the whole novel. I'm sure there are those out there who became quickly fluent in it and could read this at the same speed they read any other novel, but I am incapable of such things. Every page took me at least ten minutes to get through. The end result is that the book is frustrating, incoherent, and ultimately unreadable.

Intrigued, I looked it up and saw all the glowing reviews. It seemed to be all that my friend said it was. I ordered a copy and was actually looking forward to the experience. Alas, after getting about two thirds of the way through this novel (and that was a slog, I assure you!) I finally closed the covers and gave up.

Its decayed futuristic pidgin English, filled with the author's puns, demands constant alertness. Its semi-opaque references to the old (present) times, with the old lost technological superiority, intrigue the puzzling-out reader. The author's skill in weaving together such disparate threads as an old saint's legend, an Iron Age post-apocalyptic future, and a coming-of-age-tale inspire awe and fascination.

There seems little interest in \\"Post-Ap.\\" explanations, theories or political observations which are usually the hallmark of this setting. All of this is ingnored, in favour of telling a story. Madness, violence, pidgin english, puppet-shows, all evoke a stylish back-drop, but don't wallow in self importance and deter from enjoying this really good book.

Darker than its predecessor, Gold Unicorn explores Tanaquil's struggles between loyalty to her half-sister Lizra, now the dreaded conquerer, and her own belief that the ideal world her sister strives for cannot be achieved by war. Added are several complications-- a massive mechanical gold unicorn Lizra has ordered Tanaquil to fix for her war campaign, the mischievous peeve, stinging mousps (a magician's creation formed of mice and wasps), Honj, the enigmatic consort of Lizra...and a hell world to parallel the perfect world Tanaquil saw in the last book.Obviously some people won't appreciate this book, but to those who enjoy Tanith Lee's particular style, Gold Unicorn is the perfect way to spend an afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quailty product","review":"Purchased on line and read the company specs but when the product arrived it did not perform the way it was advertised.

Even the main characters interact with dry dialogue which fails to break away from the author's voice.As a franchise novel, it does fine. It introduces the world of Kamigawa to the players and makes Toshiro Umezawa more than a 2/2 bushido'er w/ some fine looking card art.Fun for Magic players, but avid readers might want to look elsewhere, although the samurai fantasy genre tends to be a little hard to come by sometimes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good read.","review":"This is probably my third or fourth book by McGough.

She's a bit too young to fully comprehend the book series (she has no trouble reading the books but doesn't yet completely grasp the big picture of what she's reading) so we recently rented (and then purchased) the Nancy Drew movie. The outcome? She LOVED it. Literally watched it a dozen times in the first week we got it! Nice family fun movie!

You can't take a middle road.Yet that's what the makers of this movie tried to do. Nancy was sarcastically portrayed -- for laughs-- as a \\"little Miss Perfect\\" (which was not true to the original stories), and at the same time shown as the bright, spunky crime-solver. The combining of these two approaches mixed together about as well as oil and water.This movie tried to have it both ways. And failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drew for all","review":"I thought that being over 50 and loving the original Nancy Drew books this movie would be a disappointment....but that was not the case. Emma Roberts is just adorable as Nancy Drew and true to her character. That they kept her in vintage fashion clothes and with her blue roadster was genius. Teens can finally watch a movie without sex drugs and still have it rock....adults like myself a Carolyn Keene fan can also enjoy a flash back to when teens sought to become heroes.....tried to obey their parents....and enjoyed some good clean adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Nancy Drew","review":"A delightful family movie.

It has no script, no compelling characters, no acting, no direction to go, hardly any noticeable production values at all, it looks and sounds more like a failed TV pilot rather then a film.Emma Roberts acts like an idiot (in keeping with the dumb roles she has played so far) and her cast members look totally clueless in the roles.If you ever wanted evidence that Warner Brothers does not care about TV or movie, and only wants to make money, Here it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the books","review":"This movie is so adorable.

Then the film goes unnecessarily slow, without much interest for a short while, but fortunately soon picks up speed and interest through to the end.It is interesting to see Nancy's preppy but fashionable clothes and her cool roadster from the 1930's.

The behind-the-scenes extras are interesting.My suggestions for a sequel are under the \\"comment\\" button below."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun adventure","review":"This was a fun movie.

Pop Up Video version","review":"I downloaded this because it is listed under kids and family, not annoying VH1 spin off. It appears amazon is trying to sell bonus features from the DVD as an entirely different movie. The whole movie is filled with little pop-ups that make TiVo like sounds as they appear. It would be fine if I could turn it off or on but I can't even finish the movie it is so annoying.I should have read more closely but since the actual version of the movie did not appear under the kids and family section I figured this was it. So if you want the pop-ups go for it, but if you don't then go find the actual copy of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy Drew boomer","review":"I have collected/read Nancy Drew books from the 1950's on.

Great TWEEN movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good precode silent, may bore some impatient viewers","review":"I'm a silent-movie fan, so I'm patient to silent movies. Most movies made before 1920 lack fanciful camerawork, as direction was just becoming an artform. These films have a lot of wide shots, almost as if you're watching a play. \\"Cabiria\\" is one of the films that breaks the barriers of the day; panning shots begin to evolve; zoom effects created by rolling the camera to tighten the view of the acting; special effects, such as a volcano eruption that was revolutionary for it's time. \\"Cabiria\\" also raised the bar for costuming, set design and general investment in production.Kino on Video creates wonderful products and the print used on this DVD is very clean. The score is piano-based from the original 1914 score.Overall; If you are a silent fan, or if you're curious to see the films that developed the artform of film, \\"Cabiria\\" is a good investment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype. OVERRATED","review":"after reading many reviews on this so called masterpiece of surreal cinema I finally gave in to purchasing this DVD. comparisons to such geniuses such as Murnau, Cocteau, Bunuel, and Lynch which are repeatedly made to Maddin are idiotic. no offense to him but Tales from.. is in no way comparable to Eraserhead or Blood of a Poet. Tales from the Gimli Hospital is not a horrible film but it's not what people have hailed it to be. maybe I'm missing something that everyone else isn't. there are signs of a talented filmmaker none the less and his later work has proven that. that doesn't help the dullness of the story and the horrific acting that could only be compared as .......-like. anyway, judge for yourself. but don't be fulled by statements such as: \\"this is a must\\", because it isn't. just because something is filmed in black and white and vintage techniques are thrown in does not make it a digestable surrealist piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad...","review":"I was disappointed by this film. It sounded like something that I would really like. I was kind of intrigued at the beginning and I watched carefully throughout the whole thing but, for me, it just never came together to be anything moving. I mean, I think I understood the artisitic statement he was trying to make, but it had no emotional effect on me. Just boring, like reading a text book, you know? A thinking man's movie. But I have to say, there were some really cool shots. But I guess it really felt a student film. A pretty good student film. But a student film, none the less. I don't know. Maybe I don't get it, but I didn't like it. And I usually like these oddball kinds of things."},{"rating":"1","title":"noway","review":"not good at all.....

The story takes place in Gimli, Manitoba during the smallpox epidemic at the beginning of the 20th century. The story focuses on two friends Emar, and Gunnar, who are patients in a hospital room. This film has a dream like quality that has stories within stories, and a film style that is a homage to the silent pictures and surrealistic directors of the past such as F.W. Murnau and Jean Cocteau. David Lynch's film \\"Eraserhead\\" also comes to mind watching this movie. There is a creepy, but playful quality to Maddin's film about unconsummated passions, envy, and disease.Also included are two shorter films as well as a director's commentary for the feature film. \\"The Father\\" is a story about reminiscence and dread which is told with a self effacing sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"great chips","review":"I love BLUE chips.

While the chips are still delicious, the bags are often *extremely* under-filled - to the point that two bags have had under 5 chips in the bag (5 chips that certainly didn't add up to the advertised 1 oz bag size).

McAvoy is likable as the guy who's trying to break out of the old neighborhood and its patterns by going to college and pursuing girls; he just happens to have an amazing head for trivia (or as my mother used to tell me, \\"a head full of useless information\\").

An extensive biography of Mr. Alton precedes the main body of the book, and is well worth reading in and of itself, as it helps to explain Alton's important role in movie making.The main portion of the text describes how to use lighting, not only in cinematography, but also in still photography.

Although the book is outdated technically, Alton's technique can never be outdated, the basic fundamentals of incredible artistic lighting.

Especially atrocious is the usage of samples of the great Yarbrough & Peoples disco hit \\"Don't Stop The Music,\\" and adding lyrics like \\"we're gonna drop the bomb\\" to it. And finally, the kids themselves are quite scary-looking.

He never did better. Neither has anyone else. I have thousands of LPs and cds, and none is better than this. Not even Live Dead. Sinatra goes into the life, hopes, limitations and sorrows of an alter ego, and pulls the listener right in. The music is great. You become the alter ego too. Sinatra's voice is great and perfect for the theme. I have no idea why everyone does not revere Watertown. Well, so what. No explaining human opinions. I do not need to convert anyone. If you do not have this, or have it and do not regularly listen to it, your brain DNA is not getting proper nutrition."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Frank's greatest....really....","review":"Very sad album that tells the story of a woman who leaves her husband and two sons and never returns.... The style of the songs is very un-Frank-like, but no one does it the way he does....you can hear the anguish in every track....really very interesting to hear 55 year old Frank putting his all into this album....

While not a big hit, the song \\"I Would Be In Love Anyway\\" got a fair amount of airplay. From the first time I heard it, I thought that song was hauntingly beautiful and musically interesting, so I was intent on hearing the other songs on the album from which it came. But in my opinion they are weak, forced, and unremarkable. I suppose if you put on a CD as background music and repeat it often enough, songs can grow on you, but I expected at least some of the other songs to grab me the way this one did the first time I heard it. Sadly, none did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Material; Sinatra miscast","review":"This is an album with two passable songs, \\"Goodbye\\" and \\"I Would be in Love Anyway.\\" Most of the other tunes range from weak to insipid. Although Sinatra sings all the material with sensitivity and intuitiveness, the vocal portrayal of him as a man who has lived his entire life in a small town and worked for the Sante Fe railroad is unconvincing. The understated lyrical feel of Jake Holmes's lyrics is undercut by the overblown nature of both Bob Gaudio's melodies and Charles Callelo's arrangements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspend Logic and Enjoy this Disc","review":"Yes, I must agree with a review written prior -- the idea of Sinatra as a railroad worker is not a convincing one. But, Watertown is a truly gorgeous song cycle, and Sinatra sounds totally invested in these songs. It is a shame and, I dare say, an injustice that this album has often been overlooked and derided. It is a beautiful example of late 60s/early 70s pop. And, I think it holds up much better than many of the more highly regarded rock concept albums of the same time.Fans of Sinatra or good pop music -- you can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a trip to Watertown","review":"I bought this cd expecting nothing. I found it at a Tower Records going out of business sale. I had never heard of this album, and hadn't heard any of the songs previously. I have always been a fan of Sinatra's reprise era records, although the quality certainly varied, they were a time of creative expressions and different musical styles.Watertown certainly rates as one of his best recordings from this era. The song cycle was excellent. His voice expressive and the instrumentation interesting. I play this cd often. When you hear this recording you hear the voice of a man who has been around the block. A man who has had his share of heartbreak. This is accomplished without coming across as maudlin. Try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I have to say this was a pretty disappointing figure.

It's a great opener for the \\"Ultra\\" album, starting from where the band left off with singer Dave Gahan's drug problems. It's almost prophetic to that situation, but everything from that record was somewhat coincidentally related to Gahan's addictions.

It is relatively brief, and many important events in Washington's life and career are only given a few sentences or paragraphs. Most of the author's observations regarding Washington's character are not presented until the end, and then they are disjointed and seem to be mere afterthoughts. The author also tends to group many subjects into a single paragraph, perhaps to hide the lack of detail.

Why? I couldn't figure it out.

Much like in his novel The Black Box (composed of letters written by the major and minor characters) The Same Sea is a series of prose poems, loosely arranged, both chronologically and thematically. Taken together, they provide a patchwork of detail about a half a dozen characters, along with a \\"fictional narrator,\\" perhaps Oz himself (a post-modern touch) who also interacts with his creations in humorous and moving ways. The series of poems, like the sea of the title, are constantly changing, yet remain the same. Oz seems to tell us, human aspirations, dreams, and frustrations remain fluid and fixed for all. Importantly, this highly experimental novel is heavily influenced by the Hebrew Bible, and the translator provides some of the most important texts at the end of the novel.

Her gardener, Bob Finch, is suspected of having stolen a toy tea set from the local dollhouse museum at Brocklesby Hall, a grotesque country house owned by the eccentric, elflike Sir Mordred. In her quest to exonerate Bob, Dorothy spends time at the museum investigating and, in the process, learns much about miniatures and the little houses in which they are displayed. Two murders ensue, and Dorothy, of course, decides to find out who the culprit is. The story's big surprise revelation is easy to foresee, but the book is so charmingly written and has so many endearing characters that it doesn't matter at all.

Not glamorous or \\"sexy\\", she uses her natural curiousities to solve another case. Though often her now husband, Alan, tries to dissuade her from getting involved, her natural tendency to befriend people keeps her right in the midst of the action.

Dorothy usually pokes fun at other characters, but this time becomes downright nasty when describing other female characters. Maybe all isn't bliss with the adorable Alan, hmmm? Too, the ending is contrived, twee, and generally incredible. The addition of a auditorially challenged youngster is a welcome nuance, but the sub-plot never really leads anywhere. Finally, from a legal point of view, I must wonder if Dorothy now functions as an agent of the police and that all of her findings would be tossed (sorry, just the paralegal in me).

My 11-year-old sister, a much more rabid Pokemon fan than myself, has informed me of the different ways to play the game so as to win the \\"extra Pokemon\\" (Sentret, Marrill, etc.) but it is almost impossible to do so. I have had the game for over a year and have still not managed to win Sentret. Still, it's not as if I'm going to stop trying.

I agree with the other reveiwer who said the word 'fringe' does not belong in the title. The many illustrated instructions are very easy to follow ( shows how to make with machine and by hand) and the material lists are realistic items you can buy locally. My only complaint is it seems a bit dated, such as from the '70's with the color combinations and photos, of course that does not affect the usefulness of the book.

This book is rife with errors especially in the first few chapters. Things got so bad that I started questioning every result presented in the book that I could not immediately understand and prove, thinking that it might be incorrect. This book is not recommended for self study due to these numerous errors unless the reader is just browsing and wants a qualitative understanding. One observation is that the author sacrifices breadth for depth in her coverage of the material. A minor quibble is that the author misses opportunities to give simple proofs for \\"low hanging fruit\\" results and just keeps presenting page after page of results and formulae. These translate to missed opportunities to build intuition for the student. In summary this book while it tries to be comprehensive suffers severely from sloppiness and is not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muito bom.","review":"Gostei da abordagem.

After trying three other pillows, I thought this would be better for me as it would provide support on both sides and keep me from rolling onto my back. Unfortunately, i tried out this pillow for two nights and it was the worse two nights of sleep! Like many people have mentioned in other reviews, the seams are so tight that they cut into any part of your body that touches against it. I woke up both mornings with neck, shoulder and back pains which I really think was attributable to the uncomfortable tight seams. I really liked the concept of the pillow and how it enveloped your entire body.

I'm 26 weeks pregnant and even with a few pillows surrounding me while I sleep I was waking up on my back. I finally broke down and bought this $70 pillow. It keeps me on my side and even allows me to sleep slightly on my back without really being on my back. Exactly what I needed.

My friend that made the recommendation bought the original Snoogle that doesn't loop all the way around. She said if she had to do over again, she would get this one instead. I agree. This one gives back and belly support, and doesn't need to be readjusted if you turn over.

I tried sleeping with it a couple of nights and absolutely hated it. I thought it was too firm, too thick, and just plain awkward. I stopped sleeping with it. At now 8 months pregnant, I've been waking up achy--it's hard to get comfy at night and I would wake up in pain. I think this was because I would roll onto my back and sleep that way all night. I figured I should give this pillow another try. I'm really glad I did. I essentially now wake up pain free, and positioned much better (I tend to be able to stay sleeping on my side). I still wish it were a little less firm, but I do understand why it IS this firm. I'm a fan! It's a must for mamas-to-be who have a hard time getting comfy at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"My pillow arrived yesterday and it was just what I needed. I'm in my eight month and tried to avoid purchasing a body pillow b/c I thought it would take up too much room in our queen sized bed--so up until know I had been using a half moon shaped wedge. The wedge was inconvenient b/c everytime I switched sides, I'd have to switch it over w/ me.The comfort level is very high--not too soft and not too firm. It hugs my body and I can turn sides without having to lift or turn the pillow. The rating is short of five stars b/c the fabric, as other reviewers commented, is not a soft pillow cover material--it is slightly rough so I would suggest taking an old pillow cover, cutting a hole at the unopen end and sliding it through the body pillow to where your head goes so that your face rests on a softer surface.The pillow does not crowd the bed since it fits snug around me (I'm 5'4\\" and about 144 lb) and I naturally hug it towards me when I sleep.

When I use it though I actually use a burner cover from another set. You can not just use an open can of Sterno or the like because you can not modulate the heat. Even with the proper heat I usually reserve this set for broth or oil fondues as cheese or chocolate are hard to clean. I would only reccomend cheese or chocolate to a fondue pot that is a double boiler. Williams & Sonoma has a great set.

Jack Bruce's singing on these albums really makes the songs while Trower's guitar playing packs quite blues-rock punch. The musicianship is incredible on both albums.

The songs have a very commercial feel to them, but have enough \\"hooks\\" to grab you. The final track of the album, \\"End Game\\", has some of the lowest and richest bass playing I've ever heard. I never listened to Truce until I got this double-CD so it doesn't have the same history with me. However, try as I might, I just can't seem to get the \\"hook\\" with this one. It is ok, but sounds a bit uninspired and lacks the raw energy I associate with BLT. In either case, this disk is worth getting simply for the great BLT album and if you like Truce even a little bit, it is gravy."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLT soars, TRUCE wilts","review":"It was a good experiment; get Cream's vocal and bass powerhouse teamed up with one of the most sonic guitarists since some guy named Hendrix and sparks, well, sparks mostly fly. Except when they don't, which is the case with the second Trower/Bruce team-up, TRUCE. That one sorta lays down and rolls over. But the first album, BLT, is a smoker! From the opening riff of \\"Into Money,\\" through the power blues of \\"No Island Lost\\" and the balladry of \\"Won't Let You Down\\" and \\"Carmen,\\" heck, throughout the entire ten tracks, B(ruce) L(ordan) and T(rower) restore the good name to \\"power trio.\\" Dunno what happened the second time out, but, to be fair, TRUCE is a relatively pleasant if sleepy album. If you can find BLT by its' lonesome on CD without taking out a second mortgage, snap it up! Otherwise, this is still a good purchase to make. I might even grow to like TRUCE as much as BLT with a few more spins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find in stores","review":"It has become increasingly difficult to find Avalon Organics products in stores locally.

The imagery on it looks no better than a High School student doing an AV project while high on drugs.

However, any talent he has in music obviously doesn't translate into video releases. A Posteriori's DVD is a real snoozefest. Visually, it doesn't show anything but kaleidoscopic patterns. Within two minutes, you've already seen all you care to see. Not to mention that the video is based on one of Enigma's most boring and repetitive albums, and you now have every reason to pass on this one. Now all this COULD be saved by the 5.1 surround mix, but that's also a dud. The sound mix resembles more of an \\"enhanced stereo\\". Then on top of that, the DVD isn't in any kind of anamorphic widescreen, and the visual quality is extremely low.This is, simply put, a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychodelic music","review":"I like collecting concert DVDs of groups whose music I prefer.

The more interesting detail is that my wife and I have found ourselves to be pinball junkies. It's very addictive. The game play requires skill and stategy as you proceed to hit various targets on the board in order to unlock bonus games, and other prizes.

The centenary of the case therefore affords a convenient opportunity to review these developments in company law.

We hung out a bit, and I bought his Christmas Album with Chet Baker, which I rate at 5 stars. Laid back, kinda lazy, very different take on Christmas music.The first reviewer here is being unfair about Chris Mason's album Sakura, and think he's doing that because he was disappoited that it wasn't a Chet Baker album. Sure, Chris or someone dropped Chet's name, but who wouldn't? Taken on its own merits, Sakura is a nice, laid back jazz album with nice guitar and sax. It's actually kind of relaxing. I used to listen to John Klemmer, way back when, and his music did the same thing to me. Put the album on and enjoy it.Hey Christopher... why don't you have your own website?

As profane as Bukowski can be, though, I think that Bukowski was much more optimistic than Carey, who seems to share Bowles' view of man as an insect. Cruel, yes, but the cruelty of nature seems to be the prevailing view here. Man is a brute, with an impulse for perverse, sadistic acts, but what makes it all tolerable is the knowledge, Carey seems to suggest, that nature finally is capable of an even greater cruelty. Man acts with the hope of having an effect, but nature's final cruelty is to show once again that oblivion will be our reward. Is it the brutality of great empty spaces that teaches such a brutal metaphysic? Perhaps. Carey is exhilarating because his imagination stabs at our greatest fear. He writes completely free of the need to please. Yes, life is horrible.

I watched many of these races live and I hoped they'd at least show a representative bit of racing between each of the pairs, but they never show enough of even one lap to give you an idea of how these guys actually compared. My impression from watching Mick and Alex every year, every race, was that Alex only won when he ambushed Mich and once Mick was on to his technique that didn't happen again.

I did a small amount of weaving when I was younger, and this is a very nice set for children. I bought this for my 7 year old SON, who is very artistic and he is having great fun with it. My 9 year old is also very interested in it, so I am going to get another kit. But BEWARE!!! If you are buying this. The box only has girls on it!!!! I almost sent it back for fear that it would turn my boys off with the message that this is only for girls. Luckily, my sons don't pay a lot of attention to this, but ALEX should be more careful about the messages they are sending. Weaving is a great hobby for girls AND boys. Some of the greatest weavers in history have been men and in some native cultures, only men were allowed to weave. Weaving is a great and relaxing hobby that both girls and boys should be encouraged to enjoy.

The straps on the side to secure the top have changed from the older style of velcro straps to a shoe string type which you need to insert in the door handle lock. At first I thought this would not work, but I have to admit it is better than the velcro straps. The recent windy days that we had did not blow the top off. As well, the new straps makes it much easier to remove in a hurry. Another plus is that the cover material is made much stronger and with more material to cover the windshield area.

All in all, this is a pretty nice offering from the modern-day California indiebilly scene... The production quality and guitars are as fine a frame for her voice as Younger's ever gonna find, and she throws herself into these songs (most of them originals) with all her heart...

Coupled with that, the acting is equally superb with no arm-throwing, eyelash-batting overly melodramatic acting seen in films of the time. No real dialogue is needed to convey the story which is powerful on its own. I wish people would not give the entire plot away in these reviews; leave it to the viewer to see and judge for themselves. I am thrilled to see it released on DVD; I'm buying it and showing it to friends and to young people at my church to show them what consequences our decisions have on others and ourselves.

I've been looking for a good travel set so I got this one. But be careful and look at the pictures of the actual board. It's attached to the case and it appears that whoever made it doesn't really play chess. The orientaion of the board is sideways (white on right). So, if you're OK with having an akward case end in front of one of the opponents, or you like one of the other games, go ahead and buy it. But for my money, I'm still looking for a good quality travel chess set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep one in your car!","review":"My son and I have really enjoyed this travel chess set. It is small and easy to transport. Perfect for travel. We keep ours in the car so we can pass the time waiting for appointments, etc. Pieces are easy to move around the board yet fit tight enough not to fall out. I would have liked the little zipper storage compartment to face the other way to make it easier to get the pieces in and out. The only other fault is that the silver and gold pieces don't have much color contrast and it is sometimes difficult to tell the pieces apart, especially in the bright sun. Black and white pieces would have worked better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy set","review":"Really, this isn't worth your money at all and I regret spending my money on it. The bad: 1) The color of pieces are too alike to be able to distinguish with any ease. I have to hold it up to the light to see who is what. 2) Paint on pieces comes off easily. Now there is paint all over on the inside of the plastic compartment. Now it looks really crappy. 3) Paint on board comes off easily. 4) Perhaps this should be number one; the board is turned the wrong way. I had to peel it off and turn it the correct way.The good? Not much. It is a small sized peg chess set, which is what I wanted, but I've had to rebuild/repaint the set to make it usable, and even then I just gave it away because I was so mad about it. Not a good buy for your money. Get the Chess- by Family Games peg set instead. It's about the same size and price and so far has great reviews.

Unfortunately, I believe it is defective. The alarm, in either buzz or radio position only turns onfor about 10 secs. and then goes off. The book says it should stay for 1 hr. unless turned off. 2nd.

Love the fact that I can see what times both alarms are set for without having to press any buttons. However I do agree with other reviewers that the 'wave' function is a pain. I don't like it that I turn over in my sleep and the alarm just switches off - I would rather do this manually. But even when I set the clock with the 'wave' function off it still switches off when I lift my arm to press the button on the top of the clock. I am not a morning person and without having to actually switch the clock off I will go back to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy!","review":"Dual alarms. Programmable for weekdays and weekends. Display goes on with a wave of a hand. It is just what we needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"quirky alarm","review":"This product has nice features. We especially like the large clock numbers and the fact that when the alarm is turned on, the wake-up time is shown in red on the display. We have never used the radio so we cannot comment on the quality of sound and reception. Initially we had to make a manual adjustment because the automatic time set was about ten minutes fast. When the alarm goes off, it is supposed to gradually increase in volume until turned off. However, there were a few instances when the alarm would beep a few times and then automatically stop, giving the impression that the alarm never went off. This can be potentially dangerous if you do not hear the first few beeps. Although this is only an occasional occurrence, it was enough for us to render the alarm feature unreliable. Because of this, we are donating this clock to Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Product!","review":"This clock does have a nice display and great alarm features. However, within the first two months it started to randomly reset when the wave feature was used. Eventually, I turned the wave off, but that caused the display to go black again and again. This clock would have been perfect for me if it weren't for all these malfunctions. I thought mine might be a defect, but it seems that some people are having similar issues. I won't buy any Emerson products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 yr later review","review":"I bought this alarm clock to replace an old one, I like the big display and the ease of use. What has started happening was the display was not lighting up the numbers anymore. What good is a clock you cant see the time on, might as well use my wrist watch. I did find something that does make me feel better, is that if you hit it, the numbers come back for a few minutes.So far, it still keeps good time, havent been late to work because of the alarm not going off. If you are thinking of purchasing this item to keep for a few years then maybe look at a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got two of these - both broke within a year","review":"I purchased two of these clocks - one for me and one for my husbands.

This works really well, except the wave function is awful. I covered it with tape so it won't work. the problem with this radio is it will not stay on a station for any length of time if you can get one to tune in. I have exposed and stretched the cord to try to get reception. I would never recommend this to anyone. I should have sent it back. It is a piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never oversleep","review":"I have to admit that I'm a sound sleeper and hard to wake up, especially if I've been up very late. This clock is great and all the instructions are easy to follow. I've lost power due to storms and the clock resets to the correct time and alarm settings without fail. The alarms start out softly and increase in volume slowly. Although I wake most times just from the alarm, the ability to use the radio to wake me after a long night is great. I have the volume set high enough to wake me without it being too loud and waking others in the house. When it's time to change to/from daylight saving time, it happens automatically.The display is good for me at the low setting, but can be set to bright if you prefer. The only thing I don't care for is the tuner on the radio. The next model will hopefully be digital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it, buy something else","review":"The time and alarms would reset to midnight randomly and often. After a few days of no morning alarms this 'alarm' clock was just used as a clock and the old alarm clock for the actual alarms. If you are old, have poor eyesight, and you don't need to get up at the time you set your alarm for, this clock is the one for you.It quit working completely after only a few months use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"My wife and I love this alarm clock. We needed one with a large display for two reasons. One is because we keep the clock across the room so we have to get up to turn it off. If we kept it by the bed we would just turn it off and go back to sleep. The other reason is since it is across the room and we are both near sighted, if it was not big we would not be able to read it. We found the low light setting just fine for us. It's not too bright or too dim. The only thing we did not care for was the body heat sensor that snoozes the alarm as you approach it. Guess we are not into all the fancy technology. But, a little black tape over the sensor was an easy fix.I read a bunch of reviews before purchasing this clock and feel like we made the perfect choice. If you want a LARGE display alarm clock this is a great one with a price that does not break the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the older model","review":"I purchased two older model radios about 6 years ago and they work like champs. However, they did not change to DST on the new schedule, so I decided to replace them with two of these; one for weekends and one for M-F.The alarms on the clock I set for work never went off. Very disappointing, but I was able to get it replaced. The second clock stopped altogether at 11:13. Not great when you depend upon the alarm to wak you up. I don't know if I'll be able to replace this one, but I've dragged out my old Emerson. These have been a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensor is too sensitive","review":"I've had a SmartSet clock for years and loved it, but wanted a replacement after the change in Daylight Savings Time (I went from never setting the clock to having to set it 4 times/year). This one worked fine for 2 days. On the 3rd day, the sensor apparently decided not only to snooze, but also to set the time back to midnight. Emerson's customer service (terrible) told me to manually reset it, which I did. However, when I plugged it in back in my bedroom, not only did the time reset incorrectly, the date went all the way back to 2005. Resetting a 24-hr clock was one thing, holding down the calendar buttons to push ahead 5+ years was another. I returned it (AMAZON'S customer service was great).If you take a chance on this this clock anyway, I'd suggest putting a piece of black electrical tape over the sensor before you even plug it in. Maybe if the sensor is never activated, the clock will behave as promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I was very excited to get this clock. It does set itself automatically, which is fantastic. Also the large display meant I could read the time without putting on my glasses at night. I am severely near sighted.However the warranty is good for only 90 days and within 4 months my clock broke and started to display random times like 9:93pm. It costs $9 to have it fixed plus the cost of sending it back to them. It really isn't worth it for a $25 clock. I wouldn't recommend this item due to its poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Clock & Radio!","review":"Upon arrival, I plugged it in and it automatically set to the correct time. After awhile, the number became blur and there were no numbers, just a bunch of lines that make no sense. If I had the radio on, it would not turn off because of the glitch.

It has huge numbers and I love the dual alarm. However, it decides at random times to reset itself to the wrong time and the alarms reset themselves to 8:00. This has happened numerous times in the middle of the night so my alarms do not go off when needed. It will work for a few days then go haywire once again. I think mine is just a lemon.

Surprisingly, it is difficult to find a clock radio that allows you to turn the display off. This unit does however, and the best part is a simple wave of your hand activates the display.Another nice feature is both alarm times are clearly displayed when set. No more setting the alarm for pm instead of am and not noticing it, or thinking you have the alarm set when you don't.This unit uses a small lithium battery to maintain the date/time during power loss. According to the manual, it can maintain the proper time for up to 3 years without power (5 years with normal use).

The volume setting never really worked right. I had to make sure I checked the volume every night before going to bed to make sure it would be audible in the morning for the alarm. For some reason the volume could vary from silent to ear bleeding. I also needed to check the station reception as the slightest bump (or not, really) could get the radio out of tune.The motion sensing snooze never really worked that well. I had to practically wave my hand in front of the thing 10 times before it would snooze.After a year of fighting with all this, the alarm stopped working and made me late for work. It had made me late in the past with random volume and radio tuning issues as well.In the trash it goes. I really don't recommend this clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Clock Radio","review":"The Emerson is the best clock radio I have ever owned. It has extra large numbers that make them easy to see, and it is a very easy clock to program. However, the very best feature is the \\"Wave\\" which totally turns off the display and turns it back on with the wave of an arm or movement in front of the clock. This is very good for me as I don't like a lot of light next to the bed when I am trying to sleep. I can't think of a clock I have ever liked as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emerson Radio Mediocre","review":"The Emerson clock radio has a great clock because but the radio stations blur together, even for stations with a strong broadcast.

The energy act of 2005 that changed the DST for 2007 is going to be re-evaluated sometime, and congress reserved the right to revert to pre-2007 DST.

I cannot turn the radio on without constantly pressing all the buttons and then, when I succeed in turning the radio on, I cannot shut it off without pulling the plug, and sometimes it still plays when reconnected. I understand that the return period has expired but it is not worthwile to pay for returning the item for a partial refund at this stage. It is a shame that Emerson could not produce a radio that works for more than two months. In my youth they produced the most reliable products. I will continue to shop at Amazon and would even purchase another Emerson product, but this particular radio is a dud. P.S. It does keep excellent time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Alarm but Short Life","review":"I bought this Alarm to replace an Atomic dual alarm clock that was too hard to use. I loved this alarm clock. The set up was so easy. I just plugged it in and was ready to go. I love that you could see the time for the alarm settings. However in July the alarm just went to the wrong time in the middle of the night. We woke up late the next morning. I tried to reset the clock manually and the buttons on the top stopped working. I tried unplugging the clock, but when I would plug it back in the time would come on incorrect again. I called Emerson and of course the warrenty is only 6 months so they could do nothing for me. They suggested I remove the battery and then insert it again and plug it in. That did not help, so now it is in the trash. As good as the clock is the short life time and unreliability make it a bad choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"Pros:- The clock has two alarms, and you can have them set up so that 1 is for weekdays and the other for weekends. I don't use that feature, but it's nice.- The clock is large, and even has the time of the alarms shown at the bottom for ease.- Intuitive buttons for changing time.Cons:- The motion-sensor is extremely buggy. I had to eventually put sticky-notes over it so that it would stop going into \\"Snooze\\" mode and activating the alarm all day. Kind of an eye-sore now.- Even though I purchased a NEW clock from Amazon, the Daylight Savings Time was wrong (AGAIN), so now I have to change the time 4 times per year, instead of the normal 2 times for a normal clock.

WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO GET OUT FOR SUCH A ...GAME!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Let's put it to you this way. If you like exhibition games and thats it. This game isn't bad. But if you like any realistic play, that EA is usually known for.

I read this on a game related website. I'm not 100% sure, but if this game truly doesn't have a season or dynasty mode (only tourney or exhibition) then I'm not buying it. What is the point in this game without a season mode or recruiting and all that stuff? EASports has really let me down.Their NCAA Football has a great recruiting system. NBA Live has all kinds of season and career options. Now EA sports bball on the PS2 (supposed to be a great system) doesn't even have a season. I was going to get this game for by birthday, but now I'm definitely not. What a joke and an insult. I'll now look into NBA 2k2 or just wait until baseball season to buy a sports game. Heck, I might even try hockey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be Zero","review":"WHAT TYPE OF GAME DOES NOT HAVE A SEASON MODE??? Thats the whole point to EA games, was TOTAlly dissapointed with this game that i sent it back and got my refund. DO NOT PURCHASE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as people make it seem","review":"This game is not as bad as previous reviewers have made it look. It is missing quite a few teams and it is missing the season mode, however... It has an interesting new tournament mode that allows all 64 teams (your choice) to play wherever and whoever you want. You can also create- a - team with jersey, stadium, a list of players that you can make look however you would like, and even your choice of coach, logo and location. I created my local team that was missing down to the exact details of their names and faces. You can also easily make up a team. Fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this game!","review":"This game was just not fun to me. First of all the game just had a exhibition mode and a tourny mode, and after a while the game gets really boring. They should have of put a Franchise mode or at least a season in there. The graphics were ok, and the best thing was that you could create-a-team. But that was really the only good things. I thought both NCAA March Madness 2002, and NCAA Final Four 2002 could have been better. I guess I'll have to wait untill next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"NCAA March Madness 2002","review":"I thought it was a big disappointment to me. It was just not deep enough.

I mean are you kidding me? It is like I am playing the old Nintendo and keeping my own stats and playing my own season! It is the worst excuse for a basketball game that I have ever seen! It doesn't even have all of the players on every team? I could have bought NCAA Final Four by 989 Sports and at least I would have had a season mode!

This is the first March Maddness game I've played, so I must admit that I have little else to compare it to.The compunter knows when to hold the ball and when to rush it's shot against the clock. My favorite thing is that not only can you fast break without the computer somehow catching you (like in Live), but your computer controlled players actually finish the break with you, which is great (in Live the computer always seemed to stop at the 3-point line). My only problems with this game were 1) and this is huge, lack of a season mode; 2)Less coaching options than Live; 3) quite a few teams missing; 4) I don't know what Dynasty mode is but it sounds good. It would be great if they included some legend teams like the Fab Five, or Hoya Paranoia, or Phi Slama Jama. Now that would be fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth 5 bucks to rent.","review":"This game is a major, major disappointment.

What a disappointment! Nothing close to EA's College Football game, which was absolutely phenomenal. No season or fantasy modes is a major drawback in my mind. The only good thing that I found was that you can still edit your players and put their real names in. Another year, another awful college basketball game..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly dissapointed","review":"I bought this game with great anticipation. I thought it would be very similar to NCAA football which I feel is the most phenomenal game ever made. Instead I find out that there is no season or dynasty mode. All you can do is play the tournament. It is pathetic. the graphics are good but not great. I am sickened. Last time I felt this way was when I rented NBA Live 2001. What is it with EA Sports and basketball games? Have they forgotten how to make them? This game stinks. I will never buy an EA basketball game without renting it first. This is by far the worst effort ever by EA. WHAT A JOKE THIS GAME IS! Save your money please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst EA game in 15 years","review":"I have been an EA customer for two decades (I still have Archon for the C64), and this is the worst effort I have ever seen from this company. It should have been released under a different title, because it is not part of the March Madness franchise. The game play is good, the camera views are barely acceptable, and there is no season or dynasty mode. This would be a good standup arcade game, but I expect more for $$$.... I will never buy an EA game again without seeing and playing it beforehand."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Grahphics, gameplay, sound, control......all top notch. You would think that would make for an awesome game right? Wrong. Unlike all the other EA sports games, this game has no season, franchise or dynasty modes. No create-a-player feature. The only thing you get is an average create-a-school feature (what good is that without a dyansty mode) and a lousy tournament mode. That is it. What fun is a tournament without taking your team through the season. That's like playing Madden and only getting to use a team in the playoffs. What a bunch of garbage this games turned out to be. It would have instantly been my favorite game if it only had the features of all the other EA sports games. I would not recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"NCAA MM 2002: You can buy my copy!","review":"I brought MM 2002 thinking this will better than the 2001 ps1 version, but I was betrayed by EA Sports! I was looking for an improvement of the scouting to find there's no scouting!! No franchise mode! You can not call any set plays, so you are basicly guessing where the open man will be (I like shooting treys off a screen!) Commentary is bad and boring. I think the gameplay would have been good if I was so annoyed with the missing features!RATING: 0 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened EA?!","review":"This game had one big missing link a season mode. the commanentry is boaring and it's not a real chalenge, so far there not a reel good NCAA b-ball game. also when i played with uva it was not even close to what U-hall looked like. wait for sega's college hoops 2k2."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game should come with this warning: DO NOT BUY","review":"There is no doubt about it - this game is the worst EA Sports has ever come out with. When I got my PS1 a couple of years ago I bought EA's March Madness '98. That game is by far better than MM 2002. It's as if EA was scrambling to throw a game onto the market and pitched up this meatball. No women's teams (like in the '98 version), no dynasty, not even a Season Mode; I mean come on. I'm only glad that I rented the game instead of buying it; I advise you to do the same. (Now I don't know what I'm going to do with it for the remaining four days of my rental)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly a renter","review":"I played this game one time and it has sat ever since. Graphics are nice but reality is very low. Doubtful that I need to mention the lack of replay value with no season mode. I am truly dissapointed by EA's lack of effort on this one. I will credit the gameplay and that is what probably dissapoints me the most. The players look good the courts look good although the courts I played on had the color scheme all wrong. Once you have the player modeling and the background set, how difficult would it be to fill in the correct colors ? How tough is it to bring in the season mode ? We have it on every other EA game ! What a let down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this game","review":"EA Sports should be ashamed. Only 130 teams and no season or dynasty mode. This game is like one from 10 years ago with no features and no long-term playability. I don't know if EA Sports will ever recover from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"the king of college basketball","review":"This is without a doubt the best college basketball game to come out since Coack K for the Sega Genisis. It is very realisticand the game play is exceptional. It play's like NBA Live 02' Only Better. (NBA Live isn't that good). The only gripe I see anyone having is there is no Regular Season or Dynasty Mode. But its still the best College Basket Ball sim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait till next year","review":"The lack of season mode makes this game very old very quick. You can only play so many tournaments and exhibition games beore you just get bored with it. The only good thing about this game is the graphics. But they left out some features that made this game great on the PSOne, like a momentum meter that meant something.I can't believe that EA would release a game without a season or dynasty mode, especially after how great it made NCAA Football. Hopefully they'll get it right next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a lot to be desired","review":"Thank goodness I rented this game before I bought it! No season or dynasty mode, which are staples in every other sporting game out there, and the arenas and players aren't even accurate. If your tastes prefer an arcade style of game play, this might be what you're looking for with nice graphics and a good overall flow to the gameplay. But if you're into accurate simulations as I am, you do not want to purchase this game. Big disappointment considering what could have been done with a game as great as college basketball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rather play Atari!!!","review":"Bottom line, no season mode or dynasty.

I waited 3 months to get this stupid game and it just blows. There is no way a game of college should not have a dynasty mode to draft out of. College games of 3 years ago had this feature. All you can do is tournament and single game mode. Then to make me madder I bought it and could not get my money back from the store so I was stuck with it. I wouldn't buy this game to save my life. It just (was bad) big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"EA Sports makes a BOO-BOO","review":"In their rush to release this game for PS2 they forgot some VERY IMPORTANT pieces to this game.1. The team list is missing a large group of teams. I think somewhere around 150 teams.2. No season mode. This is the most glaring mistake. How can you have a basketball game like this and NOT have a season mode??3. No dynasty mode. Once again, BIG mistake leaving this out.The gameplay is fun, but without the above items, this game only goes so far. And that isn't nearly far enough.Don't get this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I cannot believe that EA sports made this piece of junk as part of its otherwise superior sports series.

You've got two selfish individuals who will do anything to get what they want. While Lenox exposes Farah to the \\"finer\\" things in life, he also exposes her to heartache, lonliness and maybe even regret. They eventually figure out that they do complement each other & complicate matters by falling in love, having to evaluate their priorities and what really matters most.

The influence of that great man from Rio has been evident throughout Franks' career.The songs here are slightly more reflective than on previous Franks' offerings but every bit as stylish, classy and intelligent.Quite a talent this Michael Franks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Tribute to Antonio Carlos Jobim","review":"This album was a tribute to the late great legendary Brazilian Antonio Carlos Jobim. Its filled with beautiful melodic and lyrical treasures. So as not to ramble, this album is a tribute to the man who so inspired MF; its sad and respectful, yet also beautiful and not depressing at all. I love this album. Its deep and touching. The 11 tracks are each interesting. It may be his most mature album. If you are a MF fan, you must own this disc.

There are a lot of books out there now that can help you help your child. This emphatically is not one of them. Read Steven Gutstein, Stanley Greenspan, and Catherine Maurice if you want to teach your child using behavioral interventions: there are so many sources online now to help parents new to the diagnosis.She's also way too negative about the possibility for the child's improvement, and I think she condescends to both parents and autistic children.

I do NOT recommend this book. Her now-dated standard dismissal of the emerging bio-chemical research on autism and its physical causes is noting short of criminal. Our child has responded extremely well to a gluten-free, diary-free diet. He has also responded extremely well to an ultra low dose of prozac. Both of these were suggested by leading, main-stream autism neurology researchers. MANY children respond well. There IS HOPE for your child. Many autistics are not permanently mentally retarded, as the author claims. The last five years have seen amazing progress in the treatment of autism!!!

You don't want to follow a therapist who \\"undiagnoses\\" 9 out of every 10 Autistic children, who calls Asperger's a joke, and claims that anyone who is friendly, intelligent, or in any way capable is not Autistic when 2/3rds of all Autistic children and adults are high-functioning or Asperger's and are capable--with the right therapy and right therapists--of having careers, spouses, and \\"normal\\" lives.

Autism is a very complex and difficult disorder to understand. All of the other books I read seemed focused on legal rights, or adult issues for autism. This book by Dr. Siegel, explains what autism is, and how to proceed after getting a diagnosis. Her main emphasis is on very young children whose families are at the beginning of this lifelong struggle. This book gave me many ideas on how to deal with my feelings, my family, and most importantly, my child with autism.

It covers all the bases and provides very basic information that is easy to read. So many of the descriptions of autistic children in this book are very similar to my son and that is so comforting. When your child is autistic, you think that there is no other child in the world like your child until you read descriptions of certain behaviors and explanations for those behaviors that really make sense.

The graphics are good and the music is OK, in my opinion. The ship has 3 different speeds (slow, mid, fast), but the fastest speed is nothing you couldn't handle, so you'll always want your ship on fast, making the other 2 settings pretty much useless. Game control is really good, no complaints there. One of the most dissapointing features is that the game only has 4 different weapons, and you can easily get all of them by the second stage. This makes playing the later stages of the game rather monotonous. In general, this is a really difficult game to beat, but then again that's not a new feature either.

Typically, none of these claim to be the only reason, or even necessarily the main cause of decline.But to a reader interested in classical history, the book's ideas can be provoking.

Fifty percent of the book is about being content in your life as you are and in the plans that God has for you. The other fifty percent is a practical guide to preparing for a mate. I think that the author, Kate McVeigh did well combining those two strands into one book. The book does have some practical advice that I found to be thought provoking and helpful. I also found the book to be very encouraging. In the back of the book, Kate wrote out devotionals for singles that are very good. If you are someone looking for a book telling you how to enjoy life as a single or you want to read solely about someone's awesome experiences as a single person, this book might disappoint.

The only thing that I don't like about the 3m peltor's are they can become a bit painful on the ears after a while. Its to be expected I suppose with any form of hearing protection but I would really love it if some company would come out with a comfortable pair of hearing protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay not great.","review":"I found these to be way too small for my head.

I returned them the same day they arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable to Wear at the Range, Good Protection","review":"I bought two pair of these hearing protectors for use at the firing range for my wife & me. We tried them out for the first time last night. They were comfortable to wear for the hour we were on the range, and provided more than adequate hearing protection when firing a .45 Auto & a .357 Magnum revolver. Time will tell how they hold up with extended use, but so far, so very good. Can't beat the price, either. Highly recommended...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice fit, does the job","review":"I bought these to use at an indoor shooting range for obvious reasons.

Very quiet.2. Durable3. Good value4. Comfortable.I use them when using power tools and also in the airplane. These units have the best trade-offs: you can still hear people talk (very softly to you) and have fantastic noise reduction. These units are also very very comfortable -- my best pair.Other units I've owned include the folding Peltor and an Howard Leight (super-high NRR). The blue Peltor is my favorite.BTW, the person who gave this hearing protection a 1 star is just plain _stupid_. This product is meant to filter out NOISE, NOT INCLUDING SPEECH. This is a .. duh .. safety product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent set of hearing protectors","review":"I've used a few different sets of hearing protectors in the past few years to block out background noise while I'm working. This pair is by far the best I've tried. The padding is very comfortable--even when I'm wearing glasses. They fit snugly, yet are not too tight, and they seem fairly durable. As with any pair of hearing protectors, they aren't as effective at blocking lower-pitched sounds, but other than that, they do their job well.

I ususally wear an electronic ear muff when shooting, but lately have had a little ringing after a long session at the range, due to the lower NRR of the electronic muff.

She is very pleased, they are comfortable and really block out these appliances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Based on the positive customer reviews I bought this product.

I recommend this product to anyone needing hearing protection.I got another set for my wife as she liked them also."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work really well","review":"The primary reason for me to buy these earmuffs is to reduce background noise (A/C, coworkers, construction noise across the street, traffic) at work when I need to focus. I have only used these earmuffs for this purpose, and I can say that they work really well. They reduce the external noise so much that you'll start to be bothered by your internal noise (breathing, heart, swallowing). They don't compress your ears at all and they have enough space inside the cups so that you use earbuds to listen to music.

Thestory was bland and unoriginal, the main character seemed like she wassupposed to be Eloise-like but without Eloise's spunk and humor, the colored-pencil drawings were adequate at best and bland at worst, the production values were shoddy (the tile wasn't even printed on the spine? Hello?), and more from there.Do not buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I must agree with other reviewers.

They did a great job of keeping the momentum going and the laughs coming through the whole feature. Just about essential if you are a fan of the show. If you aren't. . . well you probably won't like this one. The film does address the origins of the Aqua Teens, as well as Frylock's relationship with Dr. Weird.

Once you get past the fact that there is no real \\"plot\\", and just enjoy the gags, it's great.I can't begin to describe how random and plain weird this movie is many times. Things just happen or something is said that makes one half of your brain say, \\"WTF?\\", and sends the other into a laughing fit. You may want to rent it first, because this is definitely one of those films where you either love it or dismiss it as a waste of time. However, if you do like to laugh and are the kind of person who finds a chicken standing nonchalantly while on fire and screaming hysterically while two characters engage in casual dialog, hilarious, then you might love this film.

In a nutshell, it follows the adventures of the Aqua Teens, Master Shake, Frylock and Meatwad; a bunch of misfit fast food items as they work to stop a manic exercise machine, the Insanoflex, from destroying their city and ultimately the world. Throw in a very weird scientist and some crazy aliens along with the Aqua Teens' curiosity in finding out about their origin and it makes for a great movie.The DVD also comes with loads of extras, behind the scenes footage and a whole deleted version of the movie on disk 2.

What I do know is that it's along, boring and just full of uninsipred and no fun material.York gets a paycheque for slapping his name on a musketeer film, Depardieu does the same, and what's her name struts her stuff as a machismo female in training.I guess the one advantage this thing has is that it was actually shot in France, unlike the previous films, which were shot in Spain.

I believe that had I not had extensive experience with 3D before, I would have found it impossible to follow the content of this book. I found myself constantly astounded that this book made it past the copy editors. Besides the scores of typos, it reads like it was translated from Russian to English by a newly arrived Chinese Math TA. There are some good examples although they don't demonstrate all of the features of Java3D. I learned more from the online javadoc pages and the online tutorial. There may be some useful snippets of code to use as inspiration for your own programs but there is nothing in here that couldn't be easily generated by yourself. Who's writing a good Java3D book? If noone volunteers, I'd be happy to write one that's better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready to Run Java3d","review":"I was so unimpressed with this book that I returned it.

I've read plenty of good references in my day, and this isn't one. It reads at times like a sales pitch for the technology. Sometimes it's overly elementary and sometimes it's completely bewildering. Perhaps future versions of Java 3D will have the good fortune to be documented by better materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Organized Book","review":"Im a bit confused by the good ratings for this book. Must be freinds of the authors. The overall feeling you get reading the book is \\"rushed\\". There is no nice progression of simple->complex examples to let you learn the basics. The logical progression of ideas inside the chapters seems akward. Also I think the pages and pages of listings are just an attempt at bulk up the book.The authors seem like they know the material, so I am confused why these book is so light wieght."},{"rating":"1","title":"No technical book - only Plug and Play applets","review":"This book contains about 10 applets. The book explains the parameters for these applets. This book explains nothing about the code it just prints the sourcecode, but today nobody prints his complete sourcecode in his book when it is also on the CD-ROM. On the other side the book tells about programms on the CD-ROM, which are not part of the CD-ROM. Another bad point is that the text from page 11 ist copied and pasted to page 81, that's really bad style. If you want to use prepared 3D applets at your homepage, this book may help you, but this book is nothing for developers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent enough","review":"A fairly basic introduction to Java 3D. Its not really a technical book - and the authors and publishers are honest enough about that. It's utility in terms of customizable applets is dubious. The Java 3D tutorial is a better place to start if you already know 3D programming. Real sloppy work on the part of Wiley. No Java 3D SDK on the CD-ROM. The URL on the back of the book is to another book's website...Well, its not like there are a bunch of books on Java 3D to choose from anyway, so if you must have a book this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready-to-Run, provided you don't want to know how","review":"If all you want are some java applets that you can adapt to your own use without ever understanding the API, then this is the book for you. It glazes over huge issues, while spending page after page explaining how to adapt their own examples in vain hopes you might actually be able to use them. If you want to learn how to program Java3D - don't buy this book, you're better off with the docs. If you just want to swipe existing applets - still don't buy this book, you can probably find some online and save yourself $45."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geat help","review":"This book is a great help to those who want to run java 3D in Web browser.

Maybe if you know graphics already you already know some things in here but I don't know 3D computer graphics and am having some fun learning it along with Java3D. I recommend this book for people in my situation. Since there are no other books I don't know what to recommend for poeple who already knows advanced graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Help","review":"As someone unfamiliar with the Java 3D API this book was no help. Its very focused on creating Java 3D applets and doesn't go a lot into helping me understand the concepts behind the 3D API. I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good book","review":"It provides numerous working programs to illustrate the material in the book. Normally, I am not a big believer in code examples, but in the case of 3D programs, it is hard to really get the feel of what is going on without being able to run some programs on your computer. All of the programs are available on the included CD-ROM.The text seems pretty clear to understand (to me, a Java 3D novice). All the major topics associated with 3D are covered including geometry, translation, light, transparency, behaviors, fog, texture and sound.One thing I am extremely thankful of in this book is that the author is not an insane 3D missionary. I've read too many 3D books (especially on VRML) in which 3D cures the common cure and stops global warming. The author sticks to the how without the religion which is wonderful.On the whole, this is a pretty good book and probably the first one I will open if I ever end up working on a 3D project."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for everyone!","review":"A wonderful and extensive collection, on a wealth of topics relating to personal nutrition, and fitness.

This makes me familar with the latest research in sports nutrition, and I can verify after reading this book that you won't find the latest data here. The book has very few references, and the conclusions drawn by the author seem to be more based on his personal opinion than anything else. Even worse: he comes across as an elitist snob, yet makes errors to egregious that I question his knowledge of the subject. While it's true that the food supplement industry is often heavy into hype, Baugh condemns many products that he clearly knows nothing about, nor did he bother even researching them for this book. At the beginning of the book, he even denies the existence of sports nutrition itself! Anyone with any sense will save their money on this garbage book. You will learn absolutely nothing from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The book is very easy reading and some of the basic information is fine (vitamins and how they help the body). There are no studies sited in the book that proves what he states about supplements though. They are his opinions. His advice about working out is terrible!

This oil is nothing more than refined and dyed vegetable oil. This oil will shorten the life of any motor and it burns off or creates leaks because of its structure.More than being a huge money maker for the team who markets it as a high performance product, this oil will soon find itself as part of a class action lawsuit.

It is cheaply made, but it ran full time until now, when the power supply failed. So far I have not received a response from Sabrent tech support (they only provide an email form, no phone number whatsoever).On the bright side, it's made out of aluminum, which is great for sheding heat from the drive without needing a fan (means almost no dust inside), and I never had any problems with heat. It runs very quiet (obviously dependant on the drive to some extent).As others have said, the side panels are a tad flimsy, and you have to make sure they are installed correctly prior to putting the screws into the top cover.

Out of the box, it took well over 5 hours of charging for the headset to not even be fully charged. Once paired, the earpiece is whisper quiet. I had to change my set up to hear my friends through my TV. Once \\"fully charged\\", it lasted for a couple hours. Now, only about 2 months later, after charging on the PS3 nearly the entire weekend, the headset lasted for about an hour and a half. After that, 3 hour charge lasted 10 minutes. It is literally a $35 super light paper weight. Can't be used 90% of the time.

Unfortunately the earpiece is very uncomfortable. There are sharp plastic pieces that stick out everywhere around the earpiece so I constantly had to mess with it. The loudest volume was so quiet that I had to turn off everything else in my house so I could hear anyone speak. I couldn't even have the volume of the game turned up at all. Every time I spoke to someone else, they complained about not being able to hear me as well. I have now had this product for just under 3 weeks and it just stopped working completely. At first when it started showing defects, I could get the blue light to flash like the headset was on, but it would not connect. Then after a day of that, the headset will no longer turn on at all.

The sound quality was extremely poor and highly uncomfortable to fit around my ear. I always had to move it around to fit properly and it alway seemed to pick up every little annoying sound which I like to play loudly but I don't like to have other players hear my background noise and it doesn't have a mute button where nothing goes through the ear piece. So when I thought it had a mute button it would just shut off the link to the game(CoD:WaW) and then I'd have to hear everyones voice all come through my t.v. and it just sounded terrible that way.

However this is where the pros ends.Firstly the unit is NOT comfortable. You constantly feel the unit in and on your ear. I had to remove it more than a few times to check whether a piece of the rubber speaker component was torn and as a result protruding. Secondly the volume is terrible. I had to reduce the television volume to barely audible. The volume control on the headset was largely ineffective.

I have delt with different audio/visual companies and equipment for years and have never had problems like I had with Sceptre. This may seem like a great price for a LCD monitor, but please take one more look around. Sceptre's does not have the quality nor the customer service to make this a good enough deal.

Gloria Naylor's novel stands up extremely well, even in such revered company. The thing that lifts this book from a well-told love story to a true contribution to (African-)American literature is the storytelling frame. However, the subtleties of who's talking, and to whom, became most clear and enjoyable to me after more than one reading. I think that the introductory section to this book, with Naylor's vamp on 1823, and her veiled introduction of the two lovers is among the best-written pieces in contemporary literature. Bravo! (and i don't award five stars for everything!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, poignant, love story!","review":"There are really no adequate words to express what a wonderful read you about the embark upon should you take the time to read this book. It is one of the most poignant and soul-stirring love stories I have perhaps ever read. Each page is meant to be savored as though one is sampling a fine wine, as Naylor weaves a spellbinding tale of how love truly does conquer all."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than you bargin for...","review":"If you want to be trite about it, Mama Day is a great novel with fabulous characters and imagination. If you like to write in the margins of your books, though, Mama Day is an ingenious re-interpretation of classic Shakespeare characters weaving their way through identity in a world that exists apart from natural forces. While addressing gender, race, and cultural issues, Naylor's narrative is a vehicle for self-examination and understanding. Naylor is brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A story both tragic and wonderful.","review":"Set in the imaginary town of Willow Springs, \\"Mama Day\\" is about the magic of believing and the courage it takes to get there.

Mama Day conjures up a world of sights, smells and tastes that match my childhood memories. These are STRONG women - no victims, no wimps, no whiners allowed in Willow Springs. Light, dark and grey - they're all there in Ms. Naylor's prose. What a wickedly beautiful, moving, powerful book ! Thank you Gloria Naylor for conjuring the women of my childhood - for bringing them back to me. I love Mama Day !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Requires a lot of effort to follow the story!","review":"On a positive note, the book, characters, and plot were unique...definitely not your ordinary read. However, I found the book to sometimes be confusing and it was difficult to figure out who was doing the speaking early in the chapters. Additionally, I didn't care for all the supernatural aspects of the book. The book was not enjoyable to me because it required too much effort and back peddling to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is not a hard book to read minus that fact that nothing happens and it get's increasingly difficult to keep your eyes on the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are having trouble sleeping, read this book.","review":"I was forced to read Mama Day for my English class and I have to say it is the most boring book we have read all year. I would try to read it, but the reading was so slow that I would fall asleep after a few pages. I recommend this book to all feminist, women, and people who do not like to take risks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page-turner Romance","review":"Gloria Naylor's book Mama Day was wonderful. The story is told from the perspective of several main characters. The voice switches back and forth from character to character. You become attached the the characters and what is going on in their heads. You sympathize with them, want them to be happy. The romance between Cocoa and George is so honest and vibrant. They are not perfect, but they love each other. Mama Day portrays relationships as works in progress, not perfect ideals to be attained. Some of the themes include a search for identity and love of family and traditions. The community of Willow Springs is a community all its own, which hails no state affiliation. Naylor's phenomenal book makes the reader question his own identity in relation to his family history and relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally engrossing and extremely compelling","review":"You will be compelled to read this book over and over again. The characters will draw you into this story set in New York City and a fictional small island town located somewhere between Georgia and S. Carolina. The supernatural aspects of the book will leave you breathlessly in awe of Naylor's ability to weave times, events, and characters into an intrinsic quilt of fictious reality. There were times I forgot the characters were not real people and that Willow Springs does not actually exist. Naylor's words alone create the smells, tastes, and colors of a rural island town, as she brings the characters alive with colorful dialogue and imagery, placing her on equal ground with authors like Toni Morrison and Octavia Butler (Kindred). Each time you read this book, you will discover pieces of a complex puzzle that you might have overlooked the first time. This is a books that requires you to stay aware while reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and Lyrical","review":"Once I began reading Mama Day, Gloria Naylor's folklore novel, I just couldn't put it down. This is one of the best books I've ever read. The plot was kind of slow-building, but as I got to know everyone in Willow Springs, I felt like they were family. Cocoa and George were a moving couple, and it just broke my heart when ... oh well, I won't give away the ending. What really impressed me about Mama Day was the strength of Naylor's writing. Having to juggle three completely different character plots, she managed to give each one an authentic voice. The depth of her characterization was truly amazing. If you want to read a book that is moving, hilarious, and mythical, please read Mama Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Brilliant! Powerful! A genius of a writer! Prose worthy of a Pulitzer! Would that I could aspire to be such a great writer. Naylor's style is at times playful, other times penetrating, piercing the soul of the reader with vivid images of the small town and colorful characters. Subject matter is a little dark for me (especially toward the end) but the writing is superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And the winner is...THAT GIRL","review":"If there were an award for best overall presentation of a TV show on DVD, my vote would go to That Girl. The packaging is bright, fun and lovable, just like the show. The graphics under the titles of episodes on each disc are very creative (love the images of Ann and Donald that appear when the disc is first loaded). The bonus features are generous, and the price on Amazon is reasonable. To top it all off, the announcement of the release of the second season (in Nov.) was done in a timely manner--fans don't have to wonder when and if a second season is coming. Well done, Shout Factory!As for the show itself, the comedy is still fresh and funny with many laugh-out-loud moments. Ann Marie and Donald are adorable--you feel they really exist and I would love to have them as friends.

She was the first modern woman (AKA \\"girl\\") who put career first in a romantic sitcom. As an aspiring actress in NYC, she has a brilliant smile, wears fabulous clothes, has a neato apartment and sweetie of a boyfriend, and exhibits spunkiness and kindness in every show. You feel like you'd love to have a friend like That Girl. Great fun, sometimes funny, and always interesting to see the way the city and the people looked in the sixties. (Also interesting to see so many females without augmented breasts, botoxed foreheads, and bleached teeth -- so that's how our TV stars would look without modern cosmetic advances.) I enjoyed every episode, and found the background info on the series creation to be interesting, but the episode commentary offered is thin and could be skipped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional! So Glad To See These Again!","review":"I watched this show every week when it was on and enjoyed it. It is just as good now as it was then. I see how different the Season One episodes are in the opening, etc. and then how it changed in subsequent seasons with different openings.

The episodes really are not that interesting. Maybe it is the writing that I do not care for.Don't get me wrong -- I absolutely LOVE Marlo Thomas and I like her character in this series. That is not the problem at all. I just find the episodes from this season to be dull and lackluster. The only time it really is amusing is when Marlo's father's character becomes annoyed. Other than that, I do not find much humor in this series.This series is just lacking something and I cannot quite put my finger on it. Most other 1960s series I have seen draw you in and make you really want to find out what happens next. But this one, at least for me, does not. Perhaps the show got better in later seasons?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivien Leigh","review":"I believe that this was a well-made movie. Vivien Leigh has set the hearts of many Americans today. She has a heart that no woman or man could have today. When she made Gone with the Wind, it was the best move that she has made. Scarlett is a beautiful young lady who loved a man that had his life based on dreams, and not reality. When Scarlett got married to Rhett, she didn't believe that she actually really loved him but she did....This movie that was made about Vivien Leigh allows you to walk in her shoes, and live a life as she did...

Everything that can go wrong does- flat tire, lost luggage, a murder or two, a surly cop and being shot at. What makes this book interesting is how the main character, Tony, handles all these things. His bad attitude about New Age stuff I think is kind of funny.I would certainly read more by this author.I rated this a four (if I could I'd rate it a high three or a low four) because there are times that things are flat. For example, the parts with the lady cop with her attitude doesn't come across as being very well written. Also, there is a lot of casual sex in this book some of which could be left out.

I was hoping to relive some great memories of the natural beauty and to be reminded of the great energy and vitality there.

The dialogue and performances are hands-down the worst you will ever see, and the soundtrack is either cheesy organ music or slow, methodical drum-banging.

Watching this movie is at times really amusing becouse it's just so bad. A lot has been made of this one becouse it was the first ever 'Gore' film ever. With movies like Dawn Of The Dead, Demons, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare On Elm Street it is in some good company, however for every Dawn of the Dead there is a Pieces. So on the fact that it was the first of that era I will give it it's due respect. That however is where it ends.

Not to metion the fact the color of the blood was so bright red, paint red, and the acting was terribal. so terribal it seemed like the acters were reading their scipts while being filmed, it was so bad. The main acter, killer guy looked like Kramer from seinfeild.Now...... I can't give this movie all bad reasons, there were some things that were alright, and that was the storyline, But the main psycho guy, did a terribal job acting like he believed in egpytion Gods.

I found this toy to be very difficult to use. Initially, I thought my four year-old did not weigh enough to really \\"stomp\\" the spiders, but even after I tried to play (I weigh 150 pounds), I found that I rarely got a score for stomping the spiders. Also, the games are set up on a 30 second cycle. This is barely time for a youngster to start playing the game, let alone enough time to stomp a few spiders.I tried the game on a hard surface with very little improvement in its performance. My son really enjoys the \\"Chuckie-Cheese\\" version of this game with the rounded stompers and the pictures of spiders, but got extremely frustrated with the \\"at-home\\" version.I rated it 1 star for fun, since there isn't a rating below one. Two stars for educational since it would be if it worked and five stars for durability since we couldn't make a dent on the game itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a big hit","review":"I got this for my daughter's 4th birthday. I was excited to find it, since she loved to play the game at a popular children's restaraunt. She was excited when she opened the box, but it faded after playing the game 1 time. The spiders are hard to stomp, and it's hard to figure out how to get the right \\"mode\\" on the game. a waste of my money. It's going in the next garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID - This was a big disappointment","review":"This was a BIG disappointment for Christmas 2001. My boisterous 4 and 6 year old boys were UNABLE to put enough pressure on the spiders to register any points. Naturally, they quickly lost interest. This game had a lot of promise but IN NO WAY lived up to expectations. This is on the way back to Toy-R-Us as we speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, doesn't quit make it","review":"This game is a poor attempt to mimic the video games found at Chuck-E-Cheese. The spiders are large bumps of hard plastic and it takes alot of pressure for them to register a hit. Without shoes on it hurts and is difficult, with shoes on, the plastic mat will get ripped quickly. I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work and hurts your feet","review":"We bought this toy because my kids loved the game at the arcade. One of the few games they could play at a young age. The vinyl mat makes it an indoor game, but the legs on the spiders stick up into a point which make them VERY uncomfortable to stomp. What kind of indoor game do you HAVE to wear shoes to play!? Also, we still haven't figured out exactly how you need to stomp them to get them to work. Our scores are low because the scorekeeper almost never registers. This game sits in the bottom of the toy chest."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stompin Here","review":"I found this game extremely frustrating. At first I thought my four year-old wasn't heavy enough to stomp the spiders. But even I, a 150 pound woman, rarely made the \\"stomp\\" on the spiders. It did not work any better on hard wood, tile, or carpeted floors. The games are too quickly over - only 30 seconds in length and the multiple lights on the spiders are confusing to youngsters. I am very, very, very sorry I bought this toy. Now I have to pay shipping to return it.....I would not recommend this toy for children or adults (since I couldn't even make it work)."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID - This was a big disappointment","review":"This was a BIG disappointment for Christmas 2001.

Its information for masterful presentations provides breadth, depth, and enormous practical application. What's more, it is easy to read. The book is an excellent resource for anyone who needs to be a more effective communicator. David Dempsey has done an excellent job of laying out his outline in the contents. It is very easy to quickly turn to the information that is most needed in a given moment.Time after time, we hear popular voices, celebrity voices, and our own voices saying that speaking is an unresolved fear. David Dempsey provides such useful, detailed information and sincere encouragement through his anecdotes that readers will be looking forward to their next opportunity to speak.

At best, one realizes, whoa, there's a lot stuff to remember! At some point one would have to refer to the manual to fully understand what Mr Gregory does not elaborate on. And if you can afford that excellent camera, you should skip to the D70 manual to fully appreciate everything the D70 offers. I say don't spend the 5 bucks this if you are seriously considering using the D70 for more than an expensive automatic point and shoot. I give it 2 stars however for whetting one's appetite wanting for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small price, very small value","review":"After reading this book cover to cover, I had picked up only one shortcut button sequence and no tips or tricks. This is a good book for someone who has never picked up a digital camera or an SLR camera before (if you're used to a normal 35mm camera and need to learn both digital and SLR at once you'll be overwhelmed and this can help you). The pictures are good and the explanation is simple enough, but if you've used a digital or an SLR you can pick most of this information up without a book. It didn't go into anything that was difficult to understand. I bought the book before the camera and learned nothing from it, so I can imagine that if I had the camera first I wouldn't even have bothered buying the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So I figured, what do have to lose?","review":"It's only five bucks. Well, I lost five bucks. Don't bother buying this book. If you bought a D70 and you need this book to figure out how to work it, you should have bought a disposable camera. Do you really need this book to tell you to turn the ring on the lens to zoom? If you're sitting at home with your $1000 camera in your lap waiting for this book to arrive so you can learn how to zoom your camera, then this book is for you. Overnight it if you have to.

But while ..advertises this show widescreen, my copy certainly is not, which distresses me a great deal given that this is a very tightly shot show based a great deal on sight gags. Its better than the horribly hacked versions shown on Comedy Central but it still suffers greatly being reduced to U.S. television format. I expect this nonsense from A@E (The Avengers, The Prisoner, expurgated Monty Python) but I had hopes the BBC might come of age on DVD after the damage they did to their shows on VHS.

The show starts in good form with a strange and eery soundtrack. The humour is top class and clearly in the best tradition of the British comedy tradition. It combines the best elements of the Pythonesque with more traditional pantomime and the Northern comic style of Morecombe & Wise or Reeves and Mortimer. I haven't enjoyed a TV comedy this much since Fawlty Towers. You HAVE to get this DVD.The League of Gentlemen is delighfully in poor taste, totally irreverent, and yet the characters are endearing, despite their homicidal and psychopathic peccadilos.

If you have a strong stomach, and like to laugh, this is a great DVD to buy.BTW, after inquiring to BBC America, they told me that they currently have no plans to release season 2 in the States. C'mon BBC, give the people what they want: Season 2!!!UPDATE MAY 18, 2005: I've seen that BBC now has plans to release all three seasons of League of Gentlemen, plus the Christmas special, in a single box set.

This is an excellent find, and can be watched multiple times easily. Share it with your friends!Not a lot of extras on this DVD but you probably won't miss them. The commentary track is sometimes hard to follow but has interesting tidbits on how jokes and sketches originally came about, and how the show was put together.

The ink was not \\"smearable\\". Conclusion: This label is not suitable for laser printer. Memorex should caution that using a laser printer produce result that is smearable.

The labels stick really good and I've never had a problem with them peeling or coming off. This is a wonderful product and I hope it will be around for many years. I also have a printer that can print right on the DVDs, but find it is a hassle and I end up throwing more discs in the trash, so I'm really happy with these labels from Memorex.

This is one I feel beginners through advanced intermediate players will enjoy watching many, many times. Miguel does provide some philosophy and some tips--including how to develop solos using a ground-up approach adding 'melody' gradually (he uses all 5 drums throughout most of the video).But, you're going to want to sit back and watch, listen and learn from what he does. He's really something to behold. As for some of the ensemble stuff and DJ accompaniment--well, some of it's just a bit goofy for me. Still, this is a refreshing break from videos that are intended to be stepwise instructional.

I agree with other reviewers that this not an instructional video. Anga was truely a great and talented musician and will be missed. His perfromance on this video is outstanding. I would have preferred to see him play in a group situation or play more folkloric pieces. I could not relate to him jamming with a dj or pianist. That being said I think this video produtcion falls short of being a performance video. In my opinion the video lacks continuity and seems to be thrown togeather.

This isn't one of the best. A good romantic comedy has likeable characters, a good plot, and plenty of great comic scenes to keep you laughing. This film has decent characters (although the chemistry falls pretty flat) a so-so plot, (basically a marriage preperation course that takes the couple through every last tiff and argument in a matter of a few days,) and a couple pretty funny scenes (the scenes involving the robot babies were quite hilarious.) The main problems with this film were it's constant mockery of Christianity (while oddly trying to act supportive??) It's far fetched plot elements (the end is silly it's so far fetched,) and the lack of chemistry between the two leads (could've been FAR better.)Overall, this wasn't the worst romantic comedy I've ever seen (Two Weeks Notice takes that award) but certainly wasn't among the greats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Romantic, Nor Funny","review":"This movie is actually upsetting and aggravating to watch. My husband and I rented it to spend a nice quiet evening together... HaHa! We were both feeling irritated and bothered after watching this movie.Robin Williams is horribly irritating in this film. Although his point is to strengthen the couple's relationship prior to their marriage, he nearly destroys them in the process. There is no romance in this movie. He just tries to cram 20 years worth of bad times into a couple of months prior to their marriage... and then see if the couple still wants to marry.To me and my husband, it was sad to see the new and exciting love destroyed although it was replaced by \\"old love\\" that takes years to build.

He spends the wholemovie destroying the relationship of a happy couple through numerouscringe-inducing actions. The couple later reconcile -- no thanks to him-- and then THANK him? For what? What were the writers thinking?Terrible, terrible movie. Left us both annoyed and disgusted. The bestpart of the movie (well, the only good part) is when Robin Williams'character gets decked.

I think people missed the point of this movie. I viewed it as a satire to marriage preparation; however, there were some great points made. One, with marriage comes committment, trust, communication and children. Two, marriage is never easy and one should not go into it thinking life will be great. Both parties need to learn to communicate and work out the every day issues.The actors were great-like everyone else I love John Krasinski who I think was perfect for this role.I highly recommend this movie for a nice easy going, hilarious family movie.

During this 3 weeks, they have to pass the pre-marital class ran by the \\"reverend\\" played by Robin Williams.The chemistry of the couple is not believeable, the extent that the reverend goes to is so far fetched it's not funny, and the script has numerous holes/flaws (please see many of the other reviews, so i won't have to rehash).

And Many Moore is ugly. She's a person who gains a little weight (she appears about 25 lbs heavy here) and she ages very badly and gets very dense looking on film.

And then Robin Williams enters the picture and it's all down hill from there. The moment I got hit in the face with a baseball would be the time I said to Mandy Moore that the wedding is off. And the scene where she's blind folded and driving is just idiotic. She nearly killed people and then is mad at her finance because they don't communicate well enough.And then there's the minister Robin Williams who sends a child in to illegally break into people's homes and illegally wiretap them.The best part of the movie was when the guy finally punches Robin Williams.

Of particular note is how Terrible Ted steals the lead guitar solo for RENEGADE from the author himself, Tommy Shaw.The MTV style filming is embarrassing (though Tommy is more chagrined by his recollection of wearing DOC MARTIN boots) and the music itself is shallow and staid.

I've worn it swimming many, many times and no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped buying armies","review":"I've been buying Timex for swimming for years. But the last two I bought convinced me to find another brand. One watch (women's, under $20), has never allowed me to change the time. The other one worked for about a year but now it also won't allow time change. Very disappointed because they used to be great watched for casual wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Watch","review":"I was looking for a watch to use with my patients. I needed a timer and a stop watch option. This watch was perfect. I also like that I can put the watch on military time.I am not a huge watch person and so I didn't want to spend a lot of money. The watch still looks great, but then I only wear it when I am work. The band isn't my favorite because it is a little rubbery and sticks to my arm hair. It is a minor issue though for how great the watch is.I have had a couple of coworkers ask me where I got this watch. I have recommended this to a few friends. It really is a great watch for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty nice. Works as described.","review":"The watch fits my wrist pretty well. Nice color. Stopwatch and timer function as described. When you press the keys, there is a beep sound, which could be a bit annoying though. I don't know whether there's a way to turn it off. Otherwise all works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"I liked a lot shape and it looks wonderful on hand but I'm not able to adjust according to the domestic tried a lot of ours did not work any attemptThe attached paper explains with No media without the benefit"},{"rating":"2","title":"neat watch","review":"The watch looks neat and is not too large either, nice for a lady. However, the colour on my screen looks like a pale purple but the watch I received has a more of a pink hue. I hope it will give me good service, I only received it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this purchase, because it is a copy,mention it as Timex, but it is a horrible copy.","review":"I hate this purchase, because it is a copy,mention it as Timex, but it is a horrible copy.on any side says it Timex brand, and comes only a sticker that says neither is brand Timex.(I realize this is a horrible copy because I have one that if Timex brand)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused a severe rash","review":"Within 24 hours of wearing this watch after it arrived I incurred a severe rash on my arm and my arm swole up. I tried rinsing the watch and it didn't help. It takes about 2 days for the rash to dissapear, and as soon as I wear the watch again, the rash returns within minutes. Contacted Timex, but no response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"Great price for this watch, but I needed a calorie counter and it doesn't include this feature.

Large numbers are easy to see at a glance. Pink accents make this sports watch more lady-like."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok, not great","review":"You get what you pay for. Timex make some great watches; this isn't one of them. Very limited as far as features go. It's good-looking, but not what I'm used to as far as watches go. I purchased it for my girlfriend. She likes it, but I'm disappointed in the features and quality. I'm only giving it 4-stars because I knew it was cheap when I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Watch?","review":"I have had numerous watches but never bought one in which the battery was dead when I got it. Guess they can pull this when you buy online. Few people will bother sending back a watch because the battery is dead. Guess this is what you call poor quality control. Will remember this in the future and think twice about buying something that needs to run when I get it. Don't appreciate having to buy a battery right a way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Practical","review":"I wear this watch almost every day and have found it durable and reliable and useful. I use the alarm on it every day to help me remember appointments, the stopwatch comes in handy all the time, and the large numbers help me see it even when my eyes are tired. Great watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 7 months","review":"I've owned this watch for about 7 months and after typical use, the face of the watch is filled with water droplets. I understand that the watch is supposed to be 'water-resistant' to 50 m and I can assure you that I didn't go anywhere near 50 m. I was swimming in the pool and the next thing I knew, the watch was broken. I am really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fogged up and stopped working after 3 months!","review":"Granted, this is not an expensive watch... BUT, it fogged up and the display became unreadable after just 3 months of use. I never took this watch into water. Any moisture would have been sweat from my arm while running which generally happens to a running watch. And I'm not even that serious of a runner. Next time I'll buy something a little higher quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice cheap watch","review":"This is the second watch like this that I bought. The first one broke after 6 months. This one has lasted longer so far. It's a great watch for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"These things take a lickin and keep on tickin. Over the last 20 yrs, I have bought 2 of these watches from our local Kmart. They were both in the $9-12 price range. The only difference is mine does not have Timex on stamped on it. Its the generic store brand. I've been using my present watch for approximately 10 yrs. No battery changes have ever been needed.I have only recently had some minor issues with it. Its seems to have straightened out now, so I will continue to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not waterproof as advertised...","review":"I'm sure this watch works fine if you don't really expect it to be waterproof, or sweat proof, and if you don't live in a humid country. I owned mine for about two weeks before steam collected behind the glass. By week four it stopped working entirely (even though I took it off in the shower, etc.).Additionally, if you're a runner and plan to use the timers and use the stop watch functions, those can be difficult because of the ridiculous number of buttons you have to push. That wasn't too big a problem for me and I would have given the watch 3 stars based the utility of the buttons... if it hadn't stopped working entirely after 4 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough watch for $15!","review":"I absolutely love this watch. It does what I need it to do, and it is extremely durable! I just replaced my old watch (I got the same one again, of course), the wrist strap started cracking after about one year of constant use, never taking it off. By the way, I was on a swim team and I swam about 9 hours a week. It withstood countless showers and swim practices. The surface didn't get too scratched up. It was comfortable too. I highly recommend it, $15 well spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good.","review":"I purchased this watch for my wife just about a month ago. She works for a major supermarket doing food preparation. Her hands are in water a lot of the day. My concerns were how waterproof the waterproof actually was and if the wristband would not hold the water and chap her wrist. Well, she is very happy with it. I've seen it laying on the table the other day, the face and the band look pretty beat up but it just keeps working. So, yea I would say it is very worth it. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch for the price.","review":"I needed something that was a little stronger and water proof for summer months for gardening and outdoor things over my dressy watches, and this has taken a beating and still looks great. I love the light thing at night, works great for camping! The timer and alarm has also come in quite handy so overall a great purchase, even if pink is far from my favorite color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a pedometer watch","review":"I like the watch! Great price for the money, but it didn't have a pedometer and it kept coming up on the pedometer watch search. I will keep it to track my running, but that's about all it does other than keep the time. If you are looking for a sporty time keeping watch then this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got my money's worth","review":"This sport watch provided all of the functions that I needed for basic timing of running, biking, and swimming activities. I also love having the date on my watch face, and the colors were feminine, sporty, and cute.I wore this watch for over a year in and out of the water. After that time which concluded with several months of intense time in the pool, the face started to get fogged up when wet. I'm guessing that the seal around the glass was starting to give in.Overall, I was very happy with the use I got out of this watch for the low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch","review":"This watch does exactly what it says. I bought this to train for a 1/2 marathon. I love the stopwatch, but the timer is a little hard to program. I just trained myself to look down and stop when my time was up. I will get a different watch that has an easier timer or maybe one of the lap watches for my next training, but this one worked fine for what I needed it to do. It is pretty too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little difficult to set","review":"Loved this little watch when i saw it, and as much as I snorkel and swim, love the idea of I will have a time piece that is waterproof. The shipping was so fast. The only thing was.... it was a little difficult to first set up, but after that was done, no problem. The first day out, went to the beach and had this on, Totally loved this product! Will have a time piece for the beach for years to come afterall it is a timex...takes a licken and keeps on tickin!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enough for the Money","review":"I bought one of these (the unisex in orange) for my eight-year-old son so that he could time himself when he runs his two miles. I liked it so much that I got this one in pink for myself. I am not a serious runner, so I don't need great precision above thirty minutes. Also, I was more concerned about how it felt on my arm, (not too dainty and not too bulky), and that it works when I am in the pool. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the instructions aren't the best. However, considering the $13.50 I paid for the watch, I am more than convinced I got my money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch, this is my second one.","review":"This is my second one. The first one had a white band, and while picking tomatoes the band turned green. I could not get it to become white again, so I bought another one.Like the large day of the month and the time. The price is also great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"Picked up a broken package from the ups store after waiting on line for four hours and imagine my surprise when there was nothing in the box priceless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight, easy to program","review":"Watch arrived this morning. I programmed the date and time in the car, it took only a couple seconds when I followed the written directions. It's super light-weight, which is important to me, because who wants to be running around dragging along a ten-pound brick on their arm? I can't yet speak to the water-proof-ness or lastability of the strap, but for fifteen bucks, this watch seems to meet my meager requirements (large face with numbers I can easily spy while trying to hide the fact I'm checking the time; cute; pink). Because truth be told, not everyone who buys this watch is buying it so they can train for their marathon. Some of us just need a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste of Money","review":"I have had this watch for just over a month and it is completely dead. How do I know I've had it for just over a month? Because I seem to have just missed the window to return it. I am still trying to find a way to do so because there is absolutely no way this watch should be dead already - I only wore it to go running a few times a week and it never got wet other than a few drops of my sweat and it sat on a dry counter the rest of the time. I will replace the battery if I can't return the watch, but that will cost about as much as the actual watch and be a pain in the butt and I'm not convinced that it won't just fry a new battery in a month too. I read many positive reviews of this product before purchasing it, so I was surprised it turned out so crappy. It is totally possible I just got a lemon and it is a fine product most of the time, but I thought I should share my experience as I've never had even a cheap watch like this die so quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple but good","review":"I had a watch just like this in a different color that I use to time my runs. I don't need anything very complicated, and so I didn't want to pay a lot for bells and whistles that I wouldn't really use. This year, my sister wanted a watch for when she goes running, and so I got her the same model as mine for Christmas -- it's very simple, but works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sports Watch","review":"I love the look of this watch. It's light weight and stylish. The instructions that came with it are not \\"specific\\" to this particular watch so I'm having to learn how to use it through trial and error. All in all, I really like my new watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT water resistant","review":"Bought this in June 2009. Wore it off and on for 6 months. Took it on a cruise in December, had it in the ocean for less than an hour and it started to die. The inside was fogged up with condensation and within 2 hours the watch was completely non functional. I was in less than 2 feet of water. Although Timex will fix the watch for $8 if you pay for shipping, it's probably worthwhile to spend more on a better watch. Also a bad thing about this watch is that you can't ever turn off the \\"Beep\\" when you switch between functions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Very pretty and functional. Great price for such a nice watch. Sure it is \\"feminine\\" due to it's color (pink), but it's slightly too big for my liking (I prefer really small, petite, feminine-looking watch). Overall I'm quite satisfied with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best watch ever!","review":"I was looking for a simple digital watch that was water resistant and had a timer. This watch was the perfect one for me. The only thing that I do not like is that every time you press a button the watch will make a beeping sound, but it is not much of a problem for me. I looked but there was no way to turn the beeping off. Other then that It is a Fantastic watch! I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Simple Watch","review":"I've had this watch before but it was stolen when I was robbed. After being a few months without it, I'm so happy to have it again. It's a trusty watch, inexpensive and always fits perfectly. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken or Bad","review":"I got 2 deliveries of this watch and both were defective. I just opted for another Timex because either it was a bad batch or bad watch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've worn Timex watches for years - love all the features. This one is set up differently than the others, and at first, I just thought that was annoying because I had to learn a different way to set things up, but now even after reading the directions, I can't get the date set. It's a less expensive watch than the others, and while I like the look fine, it's been disappointing. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to understand the directions, but it shouldn't be this hard. I won't send it back because i didn't pay much for the watch and it's not worth the hassle, so I'll still wear it to the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for money!!!","review":"This was a great purchase, feels and looks good, for the money it is amazing. Heaps of functions, and I really like indiglo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratches on screen","review":"I have had the watch for less than a month and it already has several scratches on the screen. The scratches are so bad that I have to tilt the watch in just the right way so that I can read the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The minutes will not set","review":"This is a really cool looking watch and although the hour will set, the minutes will not set. I have been through the instructions many times, looked for instructions on google and on youtube. I follow the instructions to the tee and it simply won't work. A watch that will not set is worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute and easy to use","review":"So far I love this watch, it was easy to set up, comfortable, and isn't as bulky as most sports watches. As an EMT I certainly need a reliable stop watch at the flip of the wrist, and so far this one does the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY stiff buttons. Beware.","review":"I got this for my son. Of all ~12 timex ironman watches I have owned in my lifetime, this has the very stiffest buttons. They leave a red mark on your fingers when you finally push hard enough to operate them!!! I won't even bother to set this watch for my son, i'll only touch it if I need to turn off the alarm at 4:00 AM. THE WORST USER INTERFACE OF ALL MY TIMEX WATCHES.It's good if you don't plan to push the buttons !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so water resistant","review":"I have had several Timex watches. I love that they are inexpensive and can wear them into water and they last for years. I bought this one to replace an old one that still worked after many years, the strap had just broken! My old watch I would never have to take off to go into a pool at all. This one had about 1 month and got water inside it after going into a pool. It still works, but it's not really usable anymore, it's got water on the inside that is fogging up the front of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable, attractive","review":"More functions than you think it should have. Only drawback is the plastic band, which doesn't breathe very well while running. Looks hot on my wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Watch","review":"I bought this for my daughter last year before a cruise. My dog got to it recently, and ate the band,, so I had to buy another. She has never taken the watch off. Swimming, shower and it did not fog up . She loves it.

It has all of the features that I want on my watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent features and good life for the money","review":"It does exactly what it says it will. It looks great on my arm. It held up to two years of abuse by me (running, biking, swimming, triathlons, yard work, and raising two boys). Just like other reviewers have said, the watch band broke in two pieces, which meant I needed to buy a new one. The nice surprise was realizing how affordable this watch is, I couldn't believe it was so reliable for two years and cost so little. I've had other Timex sport watches that cost twice as much and lasted half as long. I'm ordering my 2nd watch today, I just wish they had some different color options."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"i continue to buy this watch. love the timer and stop watch function, holds up great through an active job and the gym. i never take it off and havent had a problem. eventually the band breaks but its still a fantastic watch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't waste your money on a more expensive watch.","review":"Better quality and durability than the 75 dollar timex I purchased.

A disaster for runners because after 30 minutes it does not show seconds--for a runner there is a huge difference between 30:00 and 30:59. The timer takes 4 separate steps to set and it's impossible to set anything without turning the indiglo feature on because the buttons are so poorly placed.

The usual plethora of instrumental sounds and moods keeps the disc intriguing throughout, but gone are the touches of humour which played so well in the first. Clogs still reside in the narrow boundary between popular and contemporary classical music, and still provide a rewarding listening experience. In fact, it's good that they are challenging themselves to come up with something new and totally their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banzai Girl a must buy!","review":"Well this Trade Paperback is wonderfully illustrated by Jinky Coronado its about her real life adventures as a school girl but exaggerated.

If you don't like the supplied clipart ....... use your own. I've used the supplied software for over a year and prefer it over all others I've used. It allows use of any font. It allows scalable rounding of text. The complaint about graininess is caused by trying to enlarge an image too much. There are limits. I do multiple disc set sometimes and this software allows me to easily mark disc numbers. The labels themselves are opaque enough to hide most manufacturers pre-printed labels. If you are not happy with this product, you won't be happy with any other either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for High Detail Artwork","review":"We had an order to produce about 100 CDs that had some high definition graphics as part of the CD label. Regardless how we tried the artwork did not come though with its full brilliance and definition when we used even the best photo quality matte finished labels. The producer then decided to give this product a try and we were all very pleased with the results.The photo quality showed up very well once we started using these labels. Also, these labels are a bit thicker and seemed to apply to the CDs a bit easier than some of the other types of CD labels. What was most important is that the client was very pleased with the result.Overall we give it 4 out of 5 only because we could not find a source from which to purchase them in quantity with the appropriate price break if we should need them again. For the price, they are great for short runs but if one is doing a large run then these are a bit pricey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look great...BUT......","review":"..the real test of these labels is to try and insert the cd they've been applied to, into your cars cd player.

The line of dialogue is clean and clear on the DVD. For those who only own or have seen the VHS the dialogue delivered by Nat, the lead kidnapper is as follows: \\"It's a synch someone survived because that thing wasn't from this world.\\"You would think that Image would at least use a print as good or better than what they previously used for their VHS release.

On Stranger Tides is an exception, although Powers ability to blend multiple storylines, myth, and history into a cohesive story is, as always, featured here.

I cringe, now, recalling the utter mish mash the Pirates of the Caribbean movies with their hodge podge of myth and fact and holllywood silliness.Only reason this didn't get 5 stars is that the book just ends - it resolves neatly and happily for all - but the ending is literally a page long - with the main character thinking\\" gosh there's all that other business about being wanted for piracy but I'm sure it'll sort it self out ok...\\" Would it have been so hard to write a 2 page epilogue set years later?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging pirate tale","review":"This is the first Tim Powers book I have read and all I can say is WOW!

Its kind of like that in real life, at school its always what your last name is that tells who you are and how you should be treated. In this book they finally go against that and the people without periods in their names are the appreciated.

Such photos speak to the futility of the Nazi cause as the Second World War in Europe came to a rapid close. The Volkssturm, a last-ditch response was nicknamed the Krüppelgarde ('cripple-guard') or HJ-Spätlese ('late-vintage Hitler Youth'). Its members could not be termed fanatical, if anything, they wanted nothing more than to surrender and get on with defeat and reconstruction having recognized a lost cause.The individual accounts of forced participation and ultimate capitulation are engrossing but ultimately sad. This is by far the best account of the Volkssturm's short service and ranks up there in terms of fascination along with the Hitler Youth and the Werewolves. All three groups represent examples of the Nazis power of propaganda rather than truly effective fighting forces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book to put you to sleep","review":"I know this isn't exactly an \\"exciting\\" subject, but the style of writing of this book was really dull.

What she does not recommend is yelling and making your child feel worthless. She also recommends having \\"love talks\\" with the child after the spanking. A friend of mine told me about the book, but because my dad whipped me with a belt or a switch when I was a child, I did not have any intentions of spanking my 4 and 6 year old daughters. Her methods are a lot different than when my dad whipped me and left stripes on my legs. I use Pritchett's methods when I need to discipline my daughters. They know that I still love them even though I sometimes have to spank them.

My wife and I were each raised with spankings, but have not done a good job of being consistant in our own home. After reading this book, we practiced it. Within days we found much improved behavior and attitude in our kids. In our opinion the key point is making sure that the spanking is coupled with a lot of love, hugs and communication. The only area that we may disagree with Jamie a bit on is that she states that the swats should be given to the clothed bottom. In our home, we have found that the child benefits more with the swats given to the panties or underwear.

It was erotic--sexy, but I thought Maria McCann could have added more to it. Yet, the author intended it to be more than just a homosexual love story..And this is definetly not your average love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Engaging","review":"I just finished reading this book, racing through it in complete thrall to the author. McCann has a grasp of the period which puts one in the moment and keeps one there.I could almost think of this novel as the death of hope or a portrait of madness so well realized that it causes a derangement within the reader.As sad as the outcome is, this is a must for anyone wanting complexity as much as distraction. I hope McCann will be writing more very soon. Read this book as soon as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing happens","review":"This story starts out great, it places you in 17th century England during a civil war. There is a murder and the beginning of interesting character development. Once the main characters leave the battle field the story tumbles down a long boring hill. Hundreds of pages of getting up in the morning, eating meals and going to bed. I couldn't wait to rush through it to see if it would bring back the fire of the times. Where was the history and descriptions to place the reader in this period of time and place. I found this to be one of the most disappointing books I have ever read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, just.... ugh.","review":"McCann wrote a rich, detailed and realistic depiction of Cromwellian England. She has an eye for detail that made me really REALLY want to like this book. Unfortunately, the main character is a self-obsessed whiner who constantly sabotages himself. I wanted to like him, and I wanted to root for him, but toward the end of the book, I had a hard time seeing his story through to the end.This is an excellent book for people who like endings where little is resolved, and who like having to read the last chapter three times in order to figure out what happened. It's also good for people who enjoy dark, cheerless tales with their protagonists self-absorbed and incapable of moving past their mistakes. I don't want to be too harsh on the book, but it's just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I did not like this book at all. The main character is a murderous, unpleasant, untrustworthy man. He is that way in the beginning and that way at the end. There is nothing to like about him so I did not see why Ferris, his lover, chose him to come live with him and his aunt and help him with his colony. The colony was a disasterous idea from the start and I would think this would be easy to see to anyone that thought about it. This is an obvious first book, and I don't think I'll be buying any future ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Meat Loves Salt","review":"I really did not enjoy this book and completed it because I was already half way through and felt I ought to. I am a historical fiction junkie so this lack of enjoyment is unusual for me. For me the story was slow and did not hold me enthralled. I was always looking for the next piece of the puzzle. Sometimes that piece was obvious and I just needed to arrive at it, and at other times it never really arrived at all but just...bumbled on. There were no big Ah-Ha's! for me. I judge a good book by whether I pass it on. This would be a 'no'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Henley Live: Inside Job","review":"I have always loved The Eagles, but my favorite songs were written and sung by Don Henley. This DVD is from a concert that was shown on TV years ago. I had a video tape that still sounded great, but the picture was really rough. I was pleased to find the DVD and destroy the video tape. I would recommend if you are a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZON...always a pleasure","review":"Just a note about Amazon first of all.....working with Amazon is pure pleasure!! Simply...if there is a problem they bend over backwards so to speak to fix the problem immediately. Anything I have ever ordered from Amazon was exactly as shown on their site!!Now...as to the Don Henley dvd...If you love the Eagles, most likely you will love this dvd, \\"Don Henley Live - Inside Job\\". Pure Don Henley and songs that you do not hear with the Eagles.Just an important note as I was a little disappointed (NO ONE'S FAULT) the format does not work with wide screen monitors. It simply does not fill the screen. Do not know about wide screen TV's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great artist, great music","review":"Everytime I had a chance to see Don Henley performing live, either in a concert( unfortunately the only one I had the chance to attend was while living in London back in 1989/1990 ) or in DVD's, like the Eagles one or this latest \\"Inside Job\\", I realize that I am watching an intelligent and very mature artist with a perfect sense on how to deliver good music.I must admit that I would have liked to see a couple of more songs from \\"The end of the innocence \\" album in this concert DVD but overall the selection is well balanced between some older stuff and his latest work. I would really like to see him recording some new material soon and hopefully, that at some point in time he decides to tour again and perform in more southern latitudes... more precisely in my hometown Buenos Aires. Lets hope that he does... I'm sure that the audience would be gratefull, as it always happens in this country with artists of the level of Mr. Don Henley."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad recording","review":"This DVD is a sad example of DVD audio. I was hoping that the earlier Eagles recording of 7 bridges road would have been the start of something great. This DVD failed to capture the quality of most modern CD recordings. Don's voice was not centered and was smeared between the left and right channels. The rear surround channels were a joke and consisted mostly of croud noises...yea...I paid for that??? If you like Don's music save the bucks and buy a CD recording. If you dont like his music avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Henley","review":"Don Henley isn't, and never will be, a flamboyant artist and this DVD only serves to prove it. The man takes his music very seriously and expects to be taken seriously in return. What this serves to produce is a very polished stage performance.As with Eagles performances, \\"Live: Inside Job\\" is an extremely good display of top quality musicianship. Henley gives impassioned and nearly flawless renditions of the best of his solo career, some Eagles material (including a twist on the classic \\"Hotel California\\") and some good new material. He is well backed up by an excellent band and choir.This is an excellently produced DVD. None of the material seems out of place, it is visually pleasing but most importantly with anything that Henley does the sound is rich and enveloping. All in all this is a fantastic listening experience for Henley fans but also for anyone who can appreciate good musicianship."},{"rating":"2","title":"DTS surround gets better at the beginning of Lilah!?!","review":"Great DVD! I agree with others that the DTS mix is not as good as 'Hell Freezes Over' but it's certainly a pleasant listening experience.One thing I notice with my DVD (which I'm not sure if it's a defect or what) is that, on either the DTS or DD version, the rear surround speakers seem to become more noticeable half way in the middle of the flute solo at the beginning of Lilah. You can actually hear the flute sound move from the front to the rear speakers (hummm!?!). Before that point, there is not much going on in the rear speakers, but after that point, the surround experience is greater with more instrumentation and background vocals coming from the rear. Is it just me?!? I'll probably return the DVD for another copy to hear if it acts the same way.None the less, the sound quality is very clean and this DVD is a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Henley at his best!","review":"One of the most surprising CD's from Henley in his career; at his best. Recorded in 2000 when his voice was at it's apex this collection ranges from a rocking \\"Nobody Else In The World But You,\\" with Stevie Wonder to a super rocking ,\\"Miss Ghost,\\" with Randy Jackson and Jimmie Vaughan. This slamming song has got to be up there on top with his best. Henley is known for his no holds bared lyrics and this lives up to his reputation of telling it like it is. \\"Damn It, Rose,\\" is a prime example. A must CD for Henley fans, you won't be disapointed with this one. I gave it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"I bought this DVD because I loved Eagles' \\"Hell Freeze Over\\". In addition with its DTS format, I bought it immediately without reading the reviews (I should always read the comments before go purchasing)!! After I watched it once, including the \\"New\\" version of Hotel California, I believe that I won't bother to watch it again. It is a waste of money. The DTS just gives me noisy audience sound from the rear speakers. Other than that I could not hear any digital sound. Besides, the chorus were just horrible, just singing noise and not doing the proper job. The classic, Hotel California, was raped!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not too good","review":"this is not a very good item in my opionoin i mean your pay ing 2 dollars for a background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The 5th I loved","review":"Minus Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis, the 5th dimension just isn't the same....and the worst idea was to Remake old 5th hits. Better moments are \\"Shining Star\\" but I would guess the only folks that bought this cd in the first place were OLD time fans of the group.and only the MOST die hards would really like this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea, but flavor is a liitle off","review":"I love the idea of being able to spritz on my salad dressing. It greatly limits the amount of salad dressing you use (i'm usually a person who pours it on). I use about 15 spritzes instead of the normal serving size of ten. This still is only 15 calories.The only con to the dressing is the sweetness of the Italian. I think it is much sweeter than any other italian on the market. I fixed this quickly by adding some white vinegar to bottle, and sptrizing away. Great Product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcendent beauty","review":"As a woman who has had breast cancer and is looking at bilateral reconstruction, I found \\"Reconstructing Aphrodite\\" to be a book of hope, life, and beauty. The beauty is not in reconstruction without scars but is in the very scars themselves, scars that speak of courage, determination and, above all else, the choice to live life to the fullest. The reflections accompanying each photo communicate the pain of living with cancer. But the stories do not stop with pain; they continue with love, laughter, celebration, joy and delight in bodies that have more to say now than when they were flawless. A truly exquisite book in all ways, one that I will share with many other women because it is so real. The scars are not airbrushed; the pain is not denied. I came away from this book uplifted and encouraged by the lived experience of my sisters on the journey with breast cancer. Forget \\"Playboy\\"; the women who have lasting beauty are the ones in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"At dawn they sleep","review":"a wonderful new tale from an upcoming author!suspenseful and edge of the seat. i hope to see more from this author! want a new tale in the age of same old same old? try this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Debut Is A Winner!!!","review":"This author's debut novel is a winner!

I read the entire book that day. As indicated above, AWESOME really doesn't describe the book. Should be a \\"must read\\" by everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense At It's Best!...","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. This book keeps you guessing from the very first chapter. Every chapter ends with more suspense than the one that preceeds it, leaving you wanting more. This bright and upcoming author has managed to create characters that you can understand . I can't wait to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for Season five!","review":"Not only did I enjoy Damages, but getting the instant video format is a real plus. It was great revisiting Patty, Ellen et al. John Goodman is always a pleasure to watch. Looking forward to season five. Hope Amazon makes it available on instant video. By the way, if The Good Wife season one would come out as instant video, I would grab that up as well.Damages: The Complete Fourth Season"},{"rating":"2","title":"So happy to find this on Amazon since its not on cable anymore","review":"I watched the first three seasons of Damages and then I couldn't get it on cable anymore. I was so happy when I found it on Amazon. Season 4 was just as good as the others with all the usual twists. Can't wait for Season 5 on Amazon!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I was so dissapointed with this season. I can't figure out why they had to sully up the season with so much filth, sex and bad language. I noticed it consistantly has a low rating so I can see that no one else liked it either. All the other seasons were so good and that tells me that people don't want all that filth. I hope they do better with the 5th season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show on TV!","review":"Absolutely one of the best shows being produced for broadcast today.

Very bad form on Amazon's part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to pay for the last 2 episodes?? Seriously??","review":"The series is just OK this season. Amazon MAJOR fail for making people pay for last few episodes after it was free for prime membership. I'm on the free premium trial (comparing it to Hulu+ and Netflix,) and I'm not continuing it going forward because of this action. Super shifty. Not enough good programs available for the yearly membership IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"So I'm not crazy ...","review":"Love Damages and was excited to find season four on Prime.

Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Step Down","review":"With the shift to FX this season was a major step down from the previous few.

And now they are making us pay to view. What gives?? Glenn Close gets an Emmy nom and now we have to pay to watch Damages season 4??? I am NOT happy!

I really like this show, and it was next in line for me to watch after I got back from my vacation. I come back and now the show is $2.99 per episode. There is a name for this, it's called bait and switch. People are far more likely to buy an episode once you have gotten them hooked on the story.

Any half wit can see it is broken. The bucket is completely unusable and now I have to hassle around with trying to send it back.

Needless to say, the story continues on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major mistake","review":"Marianne was not married to Nicholas Dunbar...she was married to John Dunbar. Nicholas is their son.

Although it gives great video (somewhat blurred) in daylight it also gives good video in color at night for a very good distance these attributes cannot be overcome by the large size and the fact that it requires the power source (110 outlet) where the camera is located.

Triple Play 2000 is boring and dull, and Tiger Woods 99 is confusing to understand and difficult to play.

They are light but can be engaged from both sides which has never really been the case with traditional road pedals.I have attached these pedals to a pair of Sidi Lighting Road shoes that I had. The pedals come with a set of two distinct cleats; one with two dots on them and one without any dots. Depending on which cleat you put on your right foot determines the amount of float you have (15 degrees or 20 degrees). There are no other adjusts similar to what you find on a Shimano pedal and there isn't a big cleat interface like you find on Speedplay pedals.Entry into the pedals is either by pushing your foot straight down or by rolling the foot forward. At the price I was a little reluctant to try them at first; but I find that the pedals are a decent value."},{"rating":"1","title":"American viewers paying $ 70 dollars more.","review":"Thanks to a previous review, I did checkout The Hitchcock collection on the amazon.com.uk website. It was one hundred pounds, which translates to about seventy dollars less than the American version. The box that it comes in is way cooler than the psychedelic cover of the American version.

Early analysis of the discs points up problematic transfers for MARNIE, TORN CURTAIN, FAMILY PLOT and FRENZY. In at least MARNIE's case it appears these are not just poor transfers but actual errors in the authoring. Rumours have already spread that the set may be delayed. Even if it is not, it's quite likely that a mail-in replacement programme wll be initiated, so buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Audio during the last 15 minutes","review":"Was so excited to get the collection as a gift.

Very Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Marnie' transfer is a mess!","review":"I read the reviewer's criticism of the Marnie disk but honestly didn't think much of it. After watching Marnie on Christmas evening with a group of friends, I was embarassed. This is a terrible transfer. I think the DVD version is actually better overall.

But Universal should recall \\"Family Plot\\"","review":"As most of have already commented, this is a stellar set with mostly excellent transfers of classic films. I'll echo the comment that the \\"Family Plot\\" transfer is a disaster. While not Hitchcock's greatest film, this is a sparkling comedy thriller that deserves a better fate. I was looking forward to it for personal reasons, having attended the premiere of this film as a kid at the LA Filmex event and a dinner honoring Hitchcock afterwards at the Century Plaza Hotel. Aside from the poor \\"Marnie\\" transfer, which some reviewers commented may be due to source materials, the rest of the set is amazing and well worth the money. Some of the transfers are so good (\\"Topaz\\" for example) it's almost like seeing these films for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Blu-ray Collection is far cheaper in Australia:","review":"Don't bother with this U.S. release.

I found them to be more sympathetic toward new age modes of exercise and healing than they were to fellow Christians who are encouraging others to eat better for better health. I have seen, read, and heard testimonies of many people who have overcome major health challenges by changing their diet. This book takes the stale outdated medical viewpoint that diet and raw foods doesn't make that much of a difference.Definitely would not recommend this book to anyone.

I don't care if the special effects in a 60s flick is bad, but the horrible acting and the stupidness of this movie is enough to make you cringe. You don't see the fake looking spiders or the manager wearing his fake werewolf mask for a long time. Most of the time you see the dancers talking in what sounds like the same voice. At one point, you see a fight between two of the dancers that lasts for twenty or thirty minutes(Seemed like it for me)! The acting and plot(maybe there was a plot. Who knows?) got dumber and dumber until I turned the TV off. What I don't get is why this trash got so many positive reviews. There are better B-movies out there people!This is not one of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GRADE Z STUPIDITY.....","review":"I have never understood why this film ranks so high on everybody's \\"camp\\" list. I have seen every incarnation of this thing under every title in a desperate effort to \\"get it\\" to no avail. There are bad/bad movies and bad/fun movies but this one falls somewhere near the garbage can. A plane of showgirls crash lands on an island and soon the girls are nude bathing and running around in various stages of undress. Their manager goes off in the night and gets bitten by a big goofy looking rubber spider. He turns into a monster and starts chasing the girls around. This Euro-trash flick is SO poorly made it's hard to enjoy it. Bad b&w photography, terrible dubbing....The possibilities are there, to be sure, but what could have been a trashy, fun (s)exploitation vehicle just flops out like stale jello. If you want fun Euro-Trash check out \\"PLAYGIRLS & THE VAMPIRE\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real horrors, not even much spider","review":"A horrid movie obviously made by people with no concept of how to make a film. The amazing plot is a plane carrying 8 female dancers and their manager, crashes, leaving them floating in a life raft. They finally wash ashore on a small island. The manager, Gary, gets bitten by a very large spider and slowly turns into a half man/half spider. I guess you could say that he then terrorizes the women, but it's really only a few scenes. Gary disappears for a good half hour of the film while the women romp around in various stages of undress. The \\"effects\\" are below what you would normally see in a high school play. The acting, well, there was no acting. There were a lot of lines being read woodenly and voices dubbed poorly. The whole spider thing was just an excuse to make a movie with a bunch of half naked women. Come to think of it, this movie was genius! If you must see this film, watch the MST3K version. Mike and the Bots give it more life than it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best but it was a fun to watch","review":"The story has 8 beautifiul (well some were) models and their boss crashlanding with the plane they were on in the ocean. They all survive and find an island in the distance. They make it and explore the island finding (no not Polar Bears or a mysterious hatch with a button to push) but a dead scientist all up in a spider web. They seek shelter in a cabin place. Their manager wanders off by himself where he is attacked by a spider transforming him into (no not Spider-Man) but a creature. The girls all giggle and skinny dip and what not. Eventually they are accompanyed by some men who tell them that a boat will come back to the island in which case everyone will be rescused. But their spider bitten manager stalks them in the shadows. It has its fun moments. Especially those skinny dipping scenes. The effects are bad of course but I didnt mind it.

If you really think you have to watch it, that is the only way to go. Just to watch it for it's own merit would be a pointless waste of time. It is sexist, badly dubbed, and has the most stupid plot possible. Get the MST3K version, have a laugh with Mike, Crow and Tom Servo, and remember...a hammer with a long handle must be for excavating uranium!

The information he sets forth gives much credence to our need to supplement in our defense against the effects of the toxins we have dumped into our environment. As our lives get more stressful, our bodies - especially our heart - need supplements that aren't in high enough quantities in the foods we eat. Sinatra explains the necessity of L-Carnitine in maintaining healthy heart funciton. It is an advantageous supplement for exercise buffs and vital for those of us who don't exercise as much as we ought to. We are especially the ones who need to buy (and read!)Sinatra's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also worth owning by fans of Vaughan Williams and Roy Harris","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this video, as I have enjoyed other videos in this series. Previn is the ideal host: clear, calm, authoritative but not smug, witty but not overly clever, and obviously in love with music and the people who compose it. He does not dominate in the performance; anyone who wants to see the details of how the music is made (rather than merely watching a conductor) will value this film. A special treat is the inclusion of the entire 3rd movement of Vaughan Williams's fifth sympthony, as well as the inclusion of part of a movement of the Roy Harris symphony #3. Anyone who loves Previn's performances of Vaughan Williams (whose music needs on film much more than it is) will treasure this video. Anyone who appreciates music that is not of the \\"dropped silverware\\" variety will also appreciate some of Previn's slightly pointed comments in the first part of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irregular performance, awful sound","review":"I couldn't agree more with the previous commenter (except for his generous rate of two stars): The tempi which Previn chooses are too slow (for a score that has precise metronome marks),and there are phrasing errors here and there, obnoxious glissandi in the violins that simply shouldn't be there and some messy passages one wouldn't expect from The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with such a conductor.But the worst of all is the sound, which is normalized, so from mf to fff don't expect any dynamic change: it just won't sound louder but \\"pushed down\\". And the transfer from tape to DVD is very disappointing too. I think the tune problems Mr. VanStryland found are actually speed irregularities in the original tape which make listening a true torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Performance","review":"The idea behind this DVD is a good one. Previn's commentary is illuminating without being too technical for non-musicians to understand. But the actual performance of Shostakovich's symphony does not do justice to the music. I can only guess that there was not adequate rehearsal prior to recording. There are problems with ensemble, phrasing, intonation and rhythm. Often the playing is not perfectly together, and the only musical conception in evidence is the desire to make it through without disaster. Previn is a fine conductor; I don't know why he would allow this inferior product to be issued. There is a terrific performance of this work on VHS, conducted by Leonard Bernstein; you might want to get that one instead. Also, I've seen notification that a (Cologne Music Triennale) DVD will be issued soon, so we may hope for better."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the shostakovich spirit","review":"Andre Previn's rendition of Shostakovich's gripping 5th Symphony lacks in all most all areas of excitement or originality. There are frequently ensemble problems in the strings... the video even zooms up on a violinist in the last movement who cannot play the part. Also... the recording quality in this DVD is poor. Pitch wavers considerably. Phrasing in the winds is choppy. Save your money and buy one of the fine DVDs featuring Herbert von Karajan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST","review":"Being a diver and a fan of the sea, having met Jacques Mayol the guru of breath-hold dives in Oct 2001 in Elba and upon learning that this famous book was now available in English, the next day I procured one from this site. Having since learnt of Jacques's passing on the 22nd of Dec 2001 I feel that anyone who dives or simply loves the sea and its creatures should get hold of this very remarkable book - before it goes out of production.A fantastic book with lots of beautiful photographs that takes the reader through Jacques' early life, his reactions in the form of questions and answers to the movie \\"The Big Blue\\" and his techniques on apnea, his travels and inventions and his views on the purity of the ocean and man's endeavour to demolish anything remotely beautiful. A fantastic book to have and to keep for future generations of a man who seems to much prefer living with the creatures of the sea than with homo sapiens on land."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a great admirer of Mr. Mayol. Since a child I felt always impressed about his contributions to science and conservationism. However, I just felt so disappointed when I read Homo Delphinus. Through it, he tries to cover many topics, but in such a superficial way that it made me anxious for not getting into any point at all. And his theory about the \\"homo delphinus\\" is only a collection of cliches and general thoughts.With respect to the book itself, it lacks the quality of modern books and the photography has been poorly incorporated.I am sure many people will love this book, but I expected far more from such a remarkable man as Jacques Mayol."},{"rating":"2","title":"tupperware super blue","review":"I received the item in a short period of time, well packed and was happy.

This engaging story is rich with detail and historical references. The main character is a young woman with a good head on her shoulders who is nonetheless attracted to a dangerous man. The story is fairly predictable. As you read, you can sense what will happen. I knew that a certain character would die and I also knew that another character would find what she was longing for. That it takes place just before the French Revolution adds interest to the story. My favorite Holt novel is The Shadow of the Lynx, which features another strong male character and a woman who is strangely attracted to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Be Fooled by the Title!","review":"Don't be fooled by the title!

One day, she meets the Comte, a meeting that will change her life. He is arrogant and mysterious, and instantly attracts her attention. Through a chain of events, she comes and lives with him in his chateau with his wife and daughter. After refusing to be his mistress the Comte's wife mysteriously dies. Did he kill her?

It is undoubtly disgusting, the plot it ugly and unnecessary. What bewilders me is that Minella, the heroine chooses a man so diabolical and evil. She seems like a sensible person, but obviously I shouldn't have judged her by her cover. The man she supposedly loves is so many years her senior, this fact sickens me, out of all the male characters in the book, she chooses the most wicked and detestable one. Also, this book seems to put down the French revolution as though it is a sinful event in history. I applaud the peasants who braved the aristocrats and wanted equality and independence. The poor were abused unjustly, the rich aware of the injustice were still careless and heartless. I still can't accept this book as a creation of Victoria Holt.

It's fine for background music, but it's missing part of what made me fall in love with the songs.

Because we are first introduced to the characters when they are still in high school and follow them through college and beyond, I would recommend this book for high school seniors and older. This book shows the harsh realities of life and love. However, it tends to get mired in the harshness more than is necessary. Although life often does not feature one happy ending after another, this book's adherence to melancholy and the unhealthy aspects of love and interpersonal relationships becomes trying as one reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME OF THE *BEST* POETRY I'VE READ!!","review":"I first read YOU REMIND ME OF YOU because I loved Billy Merrell's TALKING IN THE DARK so much... and I have to say that these PUSH books are just great.

Guy Chadwick has one of the most soothing voices in rock, which when combined with Terry Bicker's spine-tingling guitar produces some moments of pure pop beauty.As well as their most famous songs like Christine and Destroy The Heart, this CD also contains some of their lesser known tracks, like the unbelievably gorgeous Girl With The Loneliest Eyes. My only quibble with this compilation is the selection of some of the later tracks chosen over far better earlier stuff, but as an introduction to one of the most underrated bands ever, this CD does the job just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent biography and study of this poet","review":"A poet as great as Khodasevich deserves to be more widely known, and his shade is honored by Bethea's insightful study.

(sarcasim). If you read the credits on this album you'll see that he plays guitar, bass, double bass, vibes, sax, key boards, percusion and even contributes back up vocals. He also produces and arranges the samples and beats. This is impressive but is the music good? The answer in my opinion is unquestionably, yes it's great. It's mid tempo, it's funky and groovy, and jazzy. His ear for detail is superb and he keeps things interesting with varied instrumentation. The last song features a guest musician playing a banjo with a swinging beat. It may sound strange but like everything he puts together it just works.

I can imagine that Goldberg's tongue was firmly in his cheek as his protagonist wanders through a post-earthquake Los Angeles, desperately seeking to get back to the comfort and security of his gated community in the Valley. Along the way he encounters more trials and tribulations than Job. But he keeps picking himself up and wandering on to the next disaster to be inflicted upon him. There's a lot of humorous sarcasm directed at Hollywood and its producers, scriptwriters, directors and other denizens, and at their inflated self-importance and ego-battles. This book reminded me of \\"Candide\\" by Voltaire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!","review":"This book was great and a fast read! It was funny, sad, insightful and I just couldn't put it down.

I am not someone who is offended by the use of the occasional use of swearing in a book, but this book was just disgusting in the amount of profanity that was used. In spite of that, I decided to keep reading and hoped for a good ending. The main character keeps encountering problem after problem and eventually it just became unbelievable. Yes there would be some extreme situations in the event of an earthquake, but in my opinion, the author went way overboard in the number and severity of the situations. And the ending was extremely disappointing. I'm glad I did not pay for this book, as I would've been tempted to ask for a refund. There are millions of books to read, and based upon this book, I would not buy or even download another book from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Disaster Book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

FINALLY I found Lee Goldberg's THE WALK. While no one would mistake it for great literature, it was entertaining, educational and humorous. I grew to know and like the main characters. I'm not familiar with Los Angeles so it was like a walking tour of the city inside a disaster thriller. Goldberg did his homwork about earthquakes and like \\"Rogue Wave\\", sounded a warning as well as providing a good escapist novel.

In many ways, it was a very bad knock off of the Fight Club/Shutter Island genre where things are not as they seem and after the \\"surprise ending\\" nothing meshes or makes sense.As far as emergency preparedness goes, the only thing you might learn from this book is make sure you are in good enough shape to run and scream at the same time.Cheap entertainment at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The walk is just ok","review":"The book is well written but is slow, I kept waiting for it to pick up.

Especially if the city is LA and all that goes along with that? Would you help others? I liked the whole book and read it in a sitting. After spending some time in LA, I have to say that this would have been a heck of an ordeal. It really does help if you have some idea about the city before reading this, otherwise you wouldn't have a feel for the distances and the neighborhoods.This is not a survival primer, just a story about one guy trying to get home and do the right thing along the way after a big quake. I liked it and would read more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"I really liked the writing in this book-it was fast paced, exciting and funny. I really liked the lead character. He was very likable so you rooted for him in his struggles after the Earthquake to get home.

Definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a try.","review":"I passed this book by in the kindle store; then a friend said \\"You should read it!\\". I don't like disaster novels, but with that encouragement I decided to give \\"The Walk\\" a try. As soon as Buck (whom I would call the character in the best supporting role) came on the scene, the story became laugh-out-loud funny whenever he was around. Although much of the time I felt I was being treated to a tongue-in-cheek travelogue, it's obvious that Mr. Goldberg is a talented and very clever author with a gift for dialogue. I will definitely try some of his other novels. If you don't particularly like reading about natural disasters, \\"Give it a try\\" anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINISHED IT IN LESS THAN 24 HRS....","review":"I originally brought this for reading on my iPhone thru the Kindle app. It was the special buy of the day.

A great twist on the disaster genre. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentially good, beginning was very interesting.","review":"This was a potentially good book with a gripping beginning.

I bought this book hoping to learn something from it. Okay, I learned you had better be prepared because disaster can happen instantly when you least expect it. There. I thought the book sucked.

Initially, searching for physical safety, the walk becomes a quest for emotional safety and hope. In the process a shallow everyman finds self worth. The 'it was all an hallucination' was a trite angle to drop in at the end of an otherwise tight story.

It was very refreshing to read a \\"post apocalyptic\\" type book that was realistic but still exciting.I won't spoil anything, but my only major gripe was redeemed at the end.

This Book is nothing but a waste of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to put it down...","review":"I cannot say for sure if the book is good because after getting about twenty percent into the book the language and content just got too offensive for me. Amazon needs to find a way to give a rating of content. I can handle a certain amount of bad language but after awhile it becomes clear that it is just gratuitous. I truly believe the best authors can tell a fantastic story without that much vulgarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"surpise ending, no spoiler in review","review":"I was attracted to the main character immediatly. He becomes more complex as the story goes. In the process he picks up a side kick, discovers himself (so to speak) and has a slight change in mission. The challenges he faces are both heart racing and fantastic. You keep thinking \\"What else could go wrong?\\" and \\"NO WAY\\"I will admit, in the middle I put the book down. I am a prepper and emergency responder, so the situations and reactions are a little Hollywood. But, I couldn't keep it down. I had to see what was going to happen. I just had to keep the Hollywood in mind, and the end doesn't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining, a quick read that's hard to put down.","review":"I found \\"The Walk\\" to be very entertaining. Goldberg does an excellent job of telling the tale of one man's journey home after the BIG ONE hits L.A. During the book you'll be introduced to Buck Weaver - a very brash and forward character who doesn't mince words - he says what he means and means what he says. Weaver makes the book in my opinion.If you have ever read \\"Lucifer's Hammer\\" and liked that, you'll appreciate \\"The Walk\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book in the survival fiction genre","review":"Lee Goldberg penned a wonderful story interwoven with superb character development and a smooth plot that pulls the reader along at a very fast pace. The lead character, Marty Slack must deal with much more than mother nature on his journey to get home from downtown Los Angeles to his home outside the city. He has tied in elements of survival fiction that leaves the reader wondering what they would do in the event of a major catastrophic collapse of society, whether it be an economic, terrorist, or natural disaster. The plot is on overly done on survival details, rather it tells the story of a man who is only slightly prepared to embark on the journey, and shows some important lessons along the way.This one is a must in your survival library, along with One Second After, and Patriots."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Marty Slack is your typical California Network executive: A self-absorbed, shallow jerk who has little regard for people who are not able to advance his own importance. When he crawls out from under his automobile after the \\"big one\\" strikes LA, he sets out upon a journey that will take him across the city and return him to his wife. The journey that he takes is not just a physical journey, but one which Marty engages in a discovery of self. The plot twist was a bit easy to figure out, but still made for a good tale. Overall, a well written, fun read. I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long walk in LA","review":"Just sit back and enjoy a period to let your mind travel with the author Lee Goldberg.

I absolutely loved the combination of the apocalyptic story line mixed with the humanistic qualities of the characters. I love any book where I am surprised, and left to think about the book, and this book did that. It was not too over the top gory, which it could have been and I think takes away from a story sometimes, but just horrific enough to really give me goosebumps. It was like a horror movie from the seventies in that it left something up to the imagination. I got slightly bored with some of the description of the LA area, but that is just me.I will recommend this book, and look forward to other books from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maximum Enjoyment","review":"Download this now. Skip the trial version and just pay the minor price of admission. My passion is apocalyptic movies and books, but usually focus on zombies or nuclear destruction. Lee Goldberg takes on a natural disaster with the same kind of intensity I've found in those other genres and leaves me happily fulfilled.I love the idea of being one of the few left on this planet left to pick up the pieces and move on.

My first attempt was using the largest bit to drill a hole in plastic. On the second push of the drill, the bit shattered into 3 pieces.

Since I had such a great use for his book on paths I picked up his book right away. I could not put it down and was up all night browsing the book from cover to cover. The photos are very useful and inspiring. His descriptions of how-tos, dos and don'ts were especially helpful.

Besides, filmed theater has very serious limitations.My ideal Fledermaus is the magnificent movie made in Color in Vienna just before the end of WWII. The soundtrack was lost but after the end of the war the cast was reassembled and the soundtrack was recorded anew. I saw the movie several times in Zürich in about 1948. I would dearly love to see it again. None of the performances I have seen since can compare.The treatment of an opera as a movie was in 1951 used by William Powell and Emeric Pressburger in their great Tales of Hoffmann.

Faber should stick to offering his opinions on CNBC and forget about a career in writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a read","review":"If you have an ounce of savy about Wall Street you will find this book to be a joke. I think that even if you have never heard of Wall Street you would find this to be a little above kindergarden material. I also think David should stick to giving his opinions on the air and forget about offering them in print. This book just dosen't hold together. He tries to inject a little humor, but that too is weak. If he actually wrote this himself, which I can not entirely believe, then it is pretty poor stuff.

Nice try David, but no cigar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faber: One of the least anoying of the bunch..","review":"I ride the #4 train to/from work every day. I must have reading material or I'll lose my mind. This book was entertaining but seems to be more geared to the armchair investor.

It was worth the [price]."},{"rating":"1","title":"CNBC ... Alert","review":"Let's face it - business reporters are at the bottom of the investment food chain. Money managers sprinkle them with fish food, and the guppies bite at anything. Want to move a stock? Call a CNBC reporter and wait until they breathlessly deliver their \\"breaking\\" news. A pattern seems to be emerging with this parade of books from self-important Bubblecasters; they really have no idea how useless they are. So they pose with their Brite-smiles and try to tell you how much they know about investing, even though they are prohibited from buying stocks (I've never done brain surgery, but let me talk you through it). By the way, these reporters are quite self-conscious about other body parts (wink wink nudge nudge).

Second fiddle relief pitcher at Institutional Investor and now sitting in Kernan's shadow has caused Faber to get a little antsy come up with a book to turn the light his way a little. Remember, Sue Herera wrote a book about women on wall street and then Ron Insana came out with his. Both of these were a joke as well with very little insight.

My legs are stronger, and I feel more balanced in my body.

In the end I watched a review on youtube and this one came up trumps.Its variable speed is great so you to work up slowly to a good speed rather that deal with a set value which might not suit. I also like the padding on the ankle grips... this was probably my main gripe with the previous one I tried. Padding is essential, although some of you may still want to put more padding down, like a towel or something.The feeling you get when it stops is kinda weird and very relaxing. For those of you with mad lifestyles and only a few minutes a day to relax, get on this thing. The routine is short, you can do it anywhere you can carry it (it has a handle) and it forces you to let go a bit. If you don't relax your body and work against the flow of the machine its uncomfortable, but go with the flow and you'll have a cool experience.Finally, it seems to put me in a good mood afterwards. Kinda focused too. Yeah, not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"too expensive","review":"Only used a few times. Stomach is supposed to be empty when you use it.

Anything at all! This series goes absolutely no where until the last 20 pages of each book! The rest is worthless and boring filler that is completely irrelevant to the story line!Granted this one was a bit better than the last but all the deaths could have been accidents, or suicide, or old age! Nothing has been proven that a murderer even exists and being about 450 pages invested into this series a little action or plot development would be niceI suppose I'll skim through the final book to appease a mild curiosity to who the murderer, if one indeed exists, is! My advice would be to skip this series completely!

Fool's Bells was that book. It is a wonderful novel that focuses on the desires of 3 very different women to change their lives and be free, have some power and control. How the women gain their freedom, use their control and exercise their power varies depending on the women. However the results are the same. It is obvious from these women that we do have the power to change ourselves and our lives. One day we will be forced to take a stand, to breathe, and no situation no matter how traumatic should hold someone back. If we allow something to continue to have a hold on us, if we contiue to hold things inside, we are giving up our power, freedom, our voice and spririt. Very moving, captivating. The negative issues do not make the book, the characters and their survival does. This is as it should be in life.

It's not widescreen though, but this can be overlooked when you get caught up in the magic.Particular highlights included \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" and \\"Nights in White Satin\\".

Most of this is because when the popped corn starts to come out a lot of unpopped corn comes out with it. Reviewers are right, way too salty if you use all the salt. I have a 4oz popper so not much room. I cut the packets apart and empty them separately, throwing away most of the salt. Be careful if you do this. I ended up spilling corn onto the floor the 1st couple of times because I cut the oil packet way too close to the corn. Popcorn isn't bad tasting but can be a little chewy. Smell of it popping is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste and easy to use","review":"Just clip the top off, squeeze the oil in then add the butter flavored salt and popcorn. Very easy to use, and not as messy as measuring out units from the larger containers. The butter flavored salt is very good as some other rater posted and it's not too salty.

(Literally lifted the top off of my Stir Crazy.) So more is not necessarily better especially when you have to clean up a mess after every popping.- Quite bit more of the Great Northern Popcorn remained unpopped.- Great Northern Popcorn had a \\"chewy\\" texture to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not tender","review":"We were very disappointed in this product. I had read the reviews and was expecting a delicious, theater quality popcorn. I popped it according to directions in our stove top Whirley Pop. The popcorn was not tender at all, tasted old and chewy, with a lot of the hard hull remaining on the popped product. The popcorn also had a very strange heavy after taste and an odd smell. Another reviewer mentioned a slight coconut oil after taste, this was not slight but very pronounced. Our kids, who can each eat a bag of popped corn a piece during a movie--even if it's scorched, didn't like it at all. We each took a couple of bites and threw the entire bowl out. It was awful! If I can, I will return it and ask for a refund....if I can't, I will toss it out. I won't even donate it to the food bank...it was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chewy Popcorn","review":"I just bought a new Great Northern 8 ounce Popcorn Machine and I bought the 6 ounce packs and 8 ounce and both taste chewy. This popcorn seems to have a lot of moisture in it because all the windows tend to steam up really good. I also tried leaving the doors slightly open and metal try completely open which helps with the steam but the popcorn still comes out chewy. I'll try ordering a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as everyone claims.","review":"I read all the reviews before giving in and buying. After all the comments on how good this tasted I really expected to like it. For the price it better be as good as the reviews claim. I was completly dissapointed. So far I have tried 3 bags, all of which have been stale and not what I expected at all. Nowhere near the taste of movie theater popcorn either. I think I'll stick to buying plain kernels from the grocery store. The only positive thing I can admit is that it did pop up nicely in my popcorn popper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packaged Popcorn","review":"I used the packaged product in stove top popcorn kettle. The results were excellent. Easy popping, excellent taste, very small amount of kernels left in the kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This is great popcorn at a great price.

Just looking at it made my 50 year old heart slow down. Plus, we did not hear a choir of angels singing the Halleluja Chorus when we ate it; it was mediocre popcorn with many unpopped kernels. My own fault - I should have known that, like sausage, its better not to know how \\"movie theater\\" popcorn is made (hint: yellow food dye is essential). We cannot bring ourselves to eat this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Popcorn and Allows Adjustable Salt Content","review":"These packs guarantee that each batch you pop is fresh (obviosuly much fresher than even theater popcorn), and of course it tastes great! This is a perfect pack for 8oz poppers, everything is pre-measured. My wife really likes that fact that the the corn, oil and salt are all partitioned separately on these packs. That way we can control exactly how much salt goes into the batch for popping. Reducing the amount of salt by half still gives us great tasting popcorn. I can vary the amount of salt in each batch based upon the preference of the people that will be eating the popcorn. Everyone is happy this way. Try doing that at a theater concession stand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good!","review":"Purchased this to use with a popcorn machine and while the machine had to be returned the popcorn itself is good. My kids loved it and thought the house smelled like the local movie theatre. Its easy to prepare and the taste is great. No extra butter or salt was needed it was perfect for our family.

I have only tried one other brand and thought it was stale and did not like the flavor. For me it is not to salty in fact I add a little salt before I pop it. I use one or two a day and always have a bowl of popped corn out for my grand kids. When ever they come over they always head to the snack shack (a little stand alone cupboard)for a treat. We try to have healthy treats but I think the pop corn is probably more healthy than the granola bars,crackers,cookies or dried fruit snacks and they seem to like the pop corn best. The only problem or maybe a benefit is that I have to floss a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"popcorn lover","review":"The 2.5 oz. size bags of Great Northern Popcorn comes with oil on one side of bag and the popcorn and salt on the other side. This way you can add the oil to the popper and warm it up ( usually takes around 3 minutes.) Add the popcorn and salt and in just a few minutes you are ready to enjoy. Now I did found some old maids, but i had tried other popcorns and also found it true with these too. This has a good taste and just the right amount of salt.

It was well worth the wait. The first batch tasted just like movie popcorn! The texture, color, saltiness and flavor were just what I was hoping for.

When following direct instructions off of the Great Northern product you will be left with 20-40% kernals unpopped which is VERY disappointing.The fix for this is to only pop half of the contents (salt, oil, and kernals) one time around and then to make a 2nd batch with the remaining half. Annoying? Yes. But this will reduce your unpopped kernals from 20-40% remaining to about 5% or less.This brand taste amazing but I will botch it a star for this small issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend!!!","review":"If you preheat your stir crazy ... this popcorn makes it taste like it is from the movies!

I let my neighborhood use it for National Night Out, and bought these for that night. I normally buy 6-8 oz kits because they are available at a local restaurant supply store. Its quick and easy for me but there is always so much kernel waste. I figured that since the HOA was paying for it I didn't want to waste anything. The flavor for these are very good. A little on the salty side but with all the other sweet stuff we had out there that night no one minded. One thing that could be improved upon is the way the little pockets of the packet are separated. My machine calls for just the oil at first, to melt and warm up before adding kernels and salt. The way that the salt is directly connected to the oil pouch makes it VERY difficult for me to cut just the oil part open.

It is edible; although extremely salty. Tastes nothing like carnival style popcorn, severely lacking in butter flavor. The only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself.

It does not serve as a bioflick or a comedy. I am amazed at the graciousness of the reviews here. Simply put this film is an embarrassment to all involved. There is a terrific cast and an able writer but it all comes to nothing. Bette doesn't seem to know if she's in Big Business or For The Boys! I love Bette but she overacts and it is hard to watch. Every joke falls flat and it's pathetic attempt at sentiment rings false and forced. What were they thinking when they made this film? The critics were right this time around. This deserved to be a bomb in the theaters and yes, in your home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial on superficial","review":"This is a stunningly superficial film about incredibly superficial people. Bette Midler plays Bette Midler, of course, and Nathan Lane is simply wonderful. But the script stinks. Not more than a single laugh in the movie.

But it isn't worth anyone's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadow of a Doll...","review":"I've watched the DVD a few times, to see if there was any nuances I had missed from the film...There wasn't. Neither a straight up camp-fest (pardon the oxymoron) or a serious biography, \\"Isn't She Great\\" lacks focus, unlike the real Jacqueline Susann's desire to be a star. Bette makes a go of it, but she's as miscast as Patty Duke in \\"Valley Of The Dolls.\\" This is made more apparent by Stockard Channing, who does more with her 5 minutes of film, then Bette does with 90! Stockard would have been brilliant as Jacqueline, espescially in physical appearance. While Paul Rudnick was attempting to cover 50+ years in his script, he probably would have had more luck in focusing on the hoopla around Valley of the Dolls. As for the DVD extras, there were several missed opportunities: A bio on the real Jacqueline, behind the scenes, making of stuff. Bette didn't extend herself to promote this film. I can see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't She Great","review":"I just love this movie!! Bette and Nathan are super as is Stockard Channing who isn't in nearly enough movies. It's oneof those I laughed, I cried, I cheered movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miscast and Not That Funny","review":"This film should have been a laughfest given Jacqueline Susann's campy lifestyle and wild excess but things just don't go well here. Part of the problem is a story which can't decide whether to be funny or serious. You feel badly for Susann and her husband Irving Mansfield after their son Guy has to be institutionalized but that sympathy evaporates when they visit the hapless child only to perform their schtick in front of him. Bette Midler is padded and overly made-up to look like a fat yenta but she veers toward self-parody. Nathan Lane is way too effete for his role as Irving Mansfield but Stockard Channing (who should have played Susann) and David Hyde Pierce are spot-on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, delightful, & entertaining!","review":"I found \\"Isn't She Great\\" to be an excellent movie; while, I didn't agree with the book that Jacqueline Susann actually wrote, I do admire her tenacity to refuse to give up and remain focused on her goal!Bette Midler is an excellent actress, who has great quips to everything!For instance, when the character on the game show scene says, \\"I'm an optometrist too, I always look on the bright side,\\" then Bette Midler's response is something like, \\"I'm surprised you can even see the bright side!\\"Without the profanity and the vulgarity being said, the movie is a tear jerker.I recommend this movie to adults (18+) due to the profanity and vulgarity mentioned in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bette Rocks!","review":"This film is a fictionalised account of Jacqueline Susann's life and her drive to be recognized as \\"somebody\\".The flamboyant costumes and colourful settings are very realistic and bring back memories of the late 60s and early 70s.The cast does a great job, & Burt Bacharach's score shines..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and boring!","review":"I read the first part of the Fane series, 'The Forest Lord' and thought it was interesting though I am not sure if I am a fan of Susan Krinard's writing. But the 'Lord of the Beasts' is really boring, meaningless, and pointless. I had to go through 200 pages of convoluted writing before finding semblance of a plot. And guess what? after that I couldn't care less. The main characters are uninteresting and lack appeal. Not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy this one at a used price","review":"I usually love Susan Krinard, but not this series.

It's been on my nightstand for over a week and I have read two other books since I picked this one up. Its about a half-Fae vet who can hear anumal thoughts. (takes place mid 1800s) He's attracted to a well-travelled but tightly buttoned-up woman with a past. Its been about 200 pages and we have no idea why she is so straightlaced now as oppossed to long ago. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small, Convenient, and Annoying","review":"I like Berlitz' little guides. They are handy enough to put in a pants pocket as I traipse across a land where I'm illiterate and unable to speak good (insert language here). This book, however, was a more pointed example of another Berlitz book trait: Most of the time, the Korean folks I met had a puzzled look on their face, not because of the (horrible) accent, but because of the archaic and stilted Korean this book translated my phrases into. One new friend borrowed it for a few minutes and couldn't stop laughing.These books are useful but for this particular one I'd be forewarned."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite autobiographies","review":"Fred Pohl is one of the last of the original science fiction greats. He started publishing stories in the 1930's and he's still going. (I don't actually know if he's working on new SF now, but he's blogging at least...) He's been just about everything one can be in the field: fan, writer, editor, agent, president of SFWA, and more. This book is a marvelous look at his life up to the mid-70's (it's incredible that it's been so long since it was written!). From his experience in the Young Communist League in the 1930's (and what that meant at the time) to his service as an Air Force weatherman in World War II, his sojourn in the advertising business, his exploration of such fields as number theory, UFOs, ESP, and cryogenics, and of course his thoughts on writing, editing, publishing, teaching, and more. All written with a wonderfully dry sense of humor. It's just one of my favorite autobiographical works around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"The music and singing are beautiful (it's Purcell after all) but the production is a freak show, full of repulsive characters, ugly (as opposed to graceful) modern dancing and lots of silly and meaningless stage business. There is no attempt to recreate the beauty of the masques or relate the action to the musical themes. It is modern updating at its worst! See Minkowski's Platee for a successful update of a Rameau classic. If you like Purcell, get the CD and avoid this nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Work of an ignorant conductor - Bad continuo choice","review":"Harpsichord should be replaced with a organ and one or more theorbo. It is highly in doubt that Henry Purcell ever used 8'/4' choired type harpsichord to support continuo part for his trumpet composition. There are indeed Virginal (small & relatively inexpensive version of harpsichord) but these loud type harpsichords here were non existent throughout the époque of Sir William Byrd, Sir John Dowland, Sir John Blow, Sir Edward Stafford, Henry Purcell and his two brothers Sir.Thomas and Sir.Daniel Purcell, all held a royal positions in France, Denmark and England one or more times in their lives. I Suggest that the conductor resign from his post and should give up all harpsichord parts and get advises from Sir John Elliott Gardiner, William Christie, David Taylor, Konrad Junghanell and like to redo the work of Purcell. Those true gentlemen have great deal of knowledgeabout Purcell's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairies and Queens","review":"I've only listened to excerpts from 'The Fairy Queen' before this so I don't know its original form. I've always understood it to be a masque in which spoken word and music were combined much like German singspiel. This performance is through-sung in the usual operatic manner alternating aria with recitative. I have no objection to this or to the musical performance. The visual part however is a disaster. Whoever was responsible for it took a lame and obvious turn on the word 'fairy' and presented the fairies as the more flamboyant elements of the gay and lesbian sub-culture. The mortals, again obviously, are corporate types in gray suits except for a drunken poet. I suppose there was a plot to follow, but it was too obscure to bother with. The performance is messy, the costumes are messy, and the sets are messy, and they all have little relation to the music's Baroque formality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nightmare at the opera","review":"This is a nightmarish production that bears little resemblance to Purcell's story and is not remotely connected to his stunningly beautiful music. There are drag queens, gay couples, a \\"drunk\\" singer, bad taste throughout - you name it. It is not uplifting and inspiring, but depressing and degrading.It is so bad and absurd that I was surprised Peter Sellar's name is not in the credits.Avoid like the plague. Get a CD instead, close your eyes and enjoy Purcell's extraordinarily inspired music. You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT one of Purcell's bests","review":"When I bought this film I hoped thet it would be a tipical Purcell's film. To my dissapointment it wasn't. For worst its quite bad. But at least it has some very nice scenes, where you can admire all the glory of such a wonderful country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Marian Facts","review":"I like this book but it is more like a set of facts or prayers than a story.

The same thing happened going from El Paso to Austin Texas. We were routed south to San Antonio and back north to Austin, essentially two legs of a triangle, instead of driving through Fredericksburg, a 4-lane direct route. In other words, we had to have prior knowledge of where we were going and insert intermediate way points to get the program to map the direct route."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product at a reasonable price","review":"MS Streets and Trips installed easily on my W2K laptop and I was running the GPS locator within a few minutes. Except for a small learning curve, it is very easy to use. I used it on a recent road trip and was very happy with the accuracy and features. I was very pleased with the locator resolution and the maps appeared up to date (at least where I was traveling). The speed calculation was suprisingly good and the update rate was impressive, it was almost like looking at my speedometer. Turn by turn directions were very good and had sufficient options for routing. The trip cost could be fairly useful but you need to know mpg and fuel cost to get something close to reality. The altitude display is nice especially if traveling in the mountains. It also includes a pocket version for use on a PDA (which I am planning to do since it is more portable than a laptop). Overall it is a nice package for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good GPS for the price.","review":"I've had this for a few weeks now and have used it a couple of times. The software is nice. Contrary to what i've heard in reviews you can drag and drop the route as you like and it has many places of interest for travel. The suction cup for the GPS also works fine. I've heard others say you can get a nicer GPS that tracks with up to 20 satelittes at once. This one can only track 12, however i've never gotten tracked by more than 5 at once so I don't see that even mattering. My only problem with the gps is that i can never seem to get a signal when it's raining. Right now for example i've been sitting with it plugged in for 20 minutes and it just got done raining and is now cloudy and still no signal. On other days in this very spot i get a perfect signal. It may also be sattelite position though, i'm not certain.

It is useful for planning trips only if (1) you already know roughly the route you need to take, and (2) you use the software to find nearby places on your route for hotel, restaurant, etc. Now I am reading the help file to see if I can force it to go with the route I want."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"GPS unit will not work despite long phone support help from Microsoft and Pharos (GPS hardware supplier)Software interface is clunky, inefficientI'm throwing it away and shopping for a different solution"},{"rating":"2","title":"Updated is a big word for it.","review":"Updated is a relative word when it comes to this software. Not even close to maps on-line. It runs well on the Toshiba Genio e550 that I own, but you have to make a subset in your laptop and pass it to the PDA for each city or section of road you plan to use, which makes you consider carrying you laptop instead. Also the small screen of the PDA makes hard to see a clear picture to choose a route. I had to buy an additional compact flash adapter to be able to connect the GPS to the PDA. I understand hundreds of new streets appear nationwide so fast, but I insist maps on-line do a much better job to keep updated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this program","review":"This program almost got us killed.

The in-car navigation is less than optimal and is not safe for a single person to use. Navigation does nt inform the driver or user of when to take a specific road when a road/highway split, which causes huge issues when you are trying to navigate in any type of major metro area.Pros:1. You can map trips without logging on to a web site2. Has quite a few points of interests for finding restaurants, etc.Cons:1. Not for in car navigation2.

I have a dell laptop with a AC for the car and while its pretty combersome I really like having it. It has great reception and the voice prompt keeps me from looking at the screen all the time. All the functions are really helpful.The qualms that I have with this device is that you need to carry a laptop or pda (though i'm not sure if the gps would work - there aren't many pda's with usb). The whole setup ends up being pretty big and takes up the entire passenger seat. Additionally you need to boot up the compter everytime you want to use it...and if your speakers are quiet you'll need a usb headset or a line going into your car audio system to listen to the directions. I wish I had a smaller laptop and one with a better battery - if you have all that I would get this device, otherwise it may be a better idea to get the gps nav. computer with screen and everything attached to it (Garmin and whatnot)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product from Microsoft","review":"I used this to replace the GPS I had for my Pocket PC and I love it. I did a ride along with a police officer and saw this for the first time. I especially like the night maps.

You know there is no nutrition it but something about the crunch satisfies.Sadly our writer needed a better editor. The writer's urge to rely on chestnuts was rarely denied. It became something of a sport, however, to see how many pages Mr. Alpert could type before he gave into another worn cliche. That combined with his strange \\"hero-worship\\" of himself made what might of been a good story probably more self-revealing than this author intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not all about the presents, Stanley!","review":"You know how you feel when you eat that muffin or cookie that looks really good, but ends up being dry, tasteless, and a complete waste of calories? And you keep eating it because it's there, and it might improve (but never does)? That's how it felt to me to buy and read this book. It had so much potential. The title is great. The story is real. But it's poorly written, by an annoyingly arrogant and apparently editor-less man. His clinical writing (he seems to be writing a legal brief for most of the book) fails to convey the terror he must have felt. The last half of the book is particularly grueling, and the \\"lessons learned\\" are juvenile and materialistic (Oh, Stanley, a Cabrio??). Being kidnapped was probably the best thing ever to happen to Stanley. Too bad the experience didn't effect the change he seems to think it did (or result in the great read it could have)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying author, good book","review":"I have to say I did enjoy this books as most people will IF you can get past Stanley's arrogance and extremely high opinion of himself.The story does hold you but I found myself struggling to care enough about him. He comes across as the most annoying, self-centered person. There were times I wanted to put the book down, not because of the story but because of Stanley.As one other reviewer notes, at times he appears to come off as very racist, even though he always puts a CYA statement in to make you feel like he is not.Read the book for the story but it definatley loses impact because of the lack of feeling you have for Stanley."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAPPY Birthday","review":"I first heard about THE BIRTHDAY PARTY during an NPR interview with authoer Stanley Alpert. I'm a filmmaker and thought the story sounded very compelling -- I was not disappointed. Alpert weaves a great yarn, full of humor and suspense while wrapped in a deadly serious and intense background. He also manages to create a certain amount of empathy for his antagonists despite their deeds. A hugely entertaining read, with a wonderful message that anyone can relate too."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong item","review":"This was my mistake.

Great book to if you want a quick read, you can easily knock it out in one sitting. It keeps you reading even though you know the outcome from the onset.Often times the author comes off as pompous, commenting on how well he handled himself. These are the only areas of the book that I wanted to sit it down. At the end of the day you realize he deserves to pat himself on the back a little, I probably would have done the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting roller-coaster - with substance","review":"Stanley Alpert's book left me breathless - an incredible and exciting story. I was fully caught up in his kidnapping, despite knowing that he ultimately survived it. This is a terrific story & a great read. And more.Alpert devotes the second half of the book to the dogged, gritty, police work that caught his kidnappers within mere days. He describes the truly selfless heroism of hard work - and it is a wonder to read.But the greatest delight in this book may be the character of Alpert himself. The truth is, he survived because of who he was - a funny, self-deprecating, straight-talking guy. Alpert showed his kidnappers a unique mixture of humor and integrity - and they just liked him. I did too. Alpert makes the struggle of his survival achingly clear - he had to fight at every moment to remain calm, and connected, honest, and likeable. His was a superhuman effort to be casual. It is a fascinating story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Birthday Party -- not so happy","review":"Perhaps it was the hype from some reading friends, but I found this book a total disappointment.

I literally laughed and cried out loud throughout Alpert's account of his ordeal, which he relays masterfully and in great detail, weaving relevant stories from his career as a prosecutor throughout. If this were a novel, I'd say the story was too ludicrous to be true--Alpert is dead on when he writes \\"you can't make this stuff up.\\" This book not only entertains but inspires--the author magaged to emerge from this harrowing ordeal with some uplifting life lessons to share.

First of all, this is a Civil War \\"era\\" film, but actually has very little to nothing to do with the war.The film centers around a squad of Union soldiers on scavenger patrol, who in the process of relieving a woman and son of their chickens and other supplies, suffer a freak injury to one of their troops, and are \\"forced\\" to hold up at the farmhouse while he heals up. The whole thing is slow slow slow, and entirely acted out on this farm, which does not add to the story or entertainment value at all. Its boring actually, very boring.Dont look for Kris Kristofferson, he only makes a brief cameo. We all know Chris Cooper aint no leading man, and Patricia Clarkson is as droll and depressing as ever. Fine cinematography shines through on the DVD but the audio is just bad, sounds distorted at times. 2 Plows"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realities of War","review":"The movie brought out the realities of the Civil War. Most of the War was not spent in large battles but in camps and down time doing such things as foraging for food for the soldiers and their animals. This movie portrays one of the millions of behind the scenes stories that could have occured during the War. The movie is well done and ends sadly as the characters end up hating each other over their differences even though there were moments of common ground gained during the time they spent together. As a Civil War reenactor and someone with ancestors who fought in the war, I always appreciate when a Civil War themed movie is made."},{"rating":"2","title":"good Civil War era movie","review":"Pharaoh's Army covers one important but often overlooked slice out of life during the Civil War involving one Confederate family. Hint; Hide the food! Highly recommended. Moviemaniac.....years later: since zero out of five people don't like my review - and I don't blame them - I will add a few words more. This movie has a lot to do with running out of food and/or needing to hide one's food or stealing food or defending food within one particular household during the Civil War. Food means life or death during times of crisis. It takes that particular topic and explores it within a dramatic film setting.

Seemingly barely rehearsed, this is a bad TV special thrown together hastily to promote the two greatest Dollies while they were performing in the role. Yes, these are two great stars. Yes, that occasionally comes through here, particularly when they are working alone. Yes, there ought to be a full video version of both of the Broadway productions of \\"Dolly\\", so we could see them really shine: acting, singing and dancing. Still, there was no need to release this video.

This is decidedly not that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mismatched performers","review":"Pearl Bailey has a throwaway style that doesn't match at all well with Carol Channing's broad techniques.

Pearl Bailey and Carol Channing may not be singing together in their duets, but to have this on DVD is such a treasure! These two women give an all out performance which showcases why we love them so much, their PERSONALITY! It's only a shame that not much of these women are talked about lately.

The video, \\"I Know There's Something Going On\\", was made in 1982, the year the group ABBA, of which she was the second female singer (and the second A), broke up. As far as I know, you can't get this video anywhere else, and for $8 it's well worth it for any ABBA or Frida fan. There are some people who will remember the other artists on this disc, but the standout is Frida.

Sound average and with lot of interference. Came in cheap plastic pink wrap, no chord for plug into Audio and no carry-case. I am terribly dissapointed with this purchase, my past motorola purchase was a HT820, they were good but I lost one of the earpads (because they came attached and not fixed) and Motorola Customer Service is simply the worst!!!

The sound quality makes this item simply un-usable.2/ When watching movies or TV using the Gateway the sound is delayed from the picture.

My Vista system can't pair with them without a driver and the bluetooth drivers resident within Vista don't work. So they are worthless unless you can find a working driver. I have read that the Blue Soleil driver (priced at $20 on line) will make them work.Overall: Motorola out to be drummed out of business for selling a product without the software required to make it work ....or at least have it available for free on their web site --- which they do not at this time (11/24/09)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No sound","review":"This headset could establish a bluetooth connection to my laptop, however, it could not play any sound, even through the audio cable for non-bluetooth connections.

These headphones have great sound and block out ambient sounds very well. I don't like ear buds, so the over the ear design is great for me, but this of course means the headset is pretty big and bulky. It doesn't fold up very small either, the ear cups just rotate so that they can lay flat. I love pairing these headphones with my smartphone (Moto Q9c) to listen to streaming radio or mp3s. The Bluetooth works great; it's reliable, easy to pair, and sounds great.

Design: it's a big headset so the aesthetic isn't awesome to begin with, but the arch of the headband is more triangular/cone-headed than the pics suggest. Performance: quality seems decent paired w/ an iPhone 3G (3.0 firmware), but the range is ghastly even by BT standards - signal cuts out completely ~15 ft from the phone (I have another A2DP headset that almost doubles that and degrades quality more gracefully on the way out instead of cutting out completely).

I have a Dell laptop running Vista that I purchased in Summer '08. I had read about compatibility issues, but figured it was worth a shot at the price. I was able to connect to the computer fairly easily (the only other BT device I had connected to the computer before was a wii-mote), but had some issues figuring out how to get sounds from the headphones instead of the speakers. This site http://www.djkaty.com/vista/bluetootha2dp was helpful in sorting out that problem, though some of the BT stack issues she mentions no longer seem to be a problem as I didn't have to download Widcomm and was able to just get by with my default. Sound is clear, controls on the headphones work great (volume, up track, down track). As an added bonus, it connected quite easily to my cell phone, so I can have a massive looking hands free set as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorola Headphones","review":"These are good for music but make a terrible headset for phone calls...

The phone sound is great when you're wearing them, but can be a little less clear than normal for the person on the other end (still pretty good though). The only problem is that Amazon did not send the carry case or the stereo adapter. I called and they sent me another set missing the exact same pieces. Now they are saying that it's a warehouse issue and they'll discount the headset, which we'll end up doing just to keep the headset, but it's still very frustrating because as of now, I can use them with my itunes library off my computer, but not with my ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is really OEM with NO CASE or CABLE!!","review":"My friend and I ordered this a few days apart and he got one in retail packaging while I get one in a pink bag that is missing the case AND the 3.5mm cable.

Both missing items are SUPER useful and that makes me very sad.Otherwise the headset works, as in is capable of communicating with my phone (N95) and my computer (Apple MacBook Pro). I have three problems with the headset:1. N95 sounds pretty good, but it drops for about 1s every five minutes or so.2. MacBook music quality isn't that good, but it appears to be a common complaint because of the MacBook.3. Sound is about ~0.25-0.50 seconds behind whatever is happening on the source.

At first, I considered the source material and/or the source BT transmitter was to blame. However, exhaustive further testing showed that the upper-frequency response of these units just left a lot to be desired.

Not a good solution for hour-long conference calls, which is why I bought it.So then I went looking for updated firmware for my Nokia device, thinking maybe its Bluetooth implementation needed updating. A couple of weeks later, I had an update. By then, the Motorola headset would no longer come on. About 10 sec after plugging it into the charger, the lights would go out. Nothing would turn it on, with charger plugged in or not, even after charging for days.I also have to say, the manual is specific that the headset won't work while it's plugged into the charger.

Gene and Fred would both vomit if they were ever to witness this sort of debauchery.If you like Shakespeare,try any film but this one, this is the hilt of Shakespeare desecration.

Everytime it seems that a character got a little bit heartbroken or needed to let off some \\"girl\\" or \\"boy\\" trouble steam, they suddenly turned into Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers. The part where the men were flying in the air singing about love was almost too much for me to stomach.I do credit Martin Scorsese for taking a relatively experimental step with Shakespeare and making it into a jazzy 30s style movie. Many directors would not take such a chance. This is a movie that is more about fun than taking itself too seriously, and if you are the type that enjoys a good musical, this might be a fun movie to take in.I just felt it was too much musical and not enough dialogue, and by the end, I really didn't care about any of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immensely Charming","review":"What can you say, it works. The two curmudgeons who disliked the film should be sentenced to see the full play produced on stage for life - because LLL was probably unintelligible even in its own day on stage (tons of in-jokes that were almost certainly dated by 1600), and is completely beyond comprehension in this. What Branagh has done is taken the goassamer elements of the plot, brightened them with some first class songs and wonderful staging (can't say dancing, because almost none of the principals can dance), done one brilliant conflation of the Bard's best lines from the play (toward the end, concerning women's eyes and the lessons to be learned from them, superb editing) and come up with a first class piece of nostalgia, barely Shakespearean, but close enough.So it isn't the pure stuff by a country mile.

I bought it becauses there's Alicia Silverstone in it, and I figured a Shakespeare story would be interesting, he must be rolling over in his grave...

And the guarantee is pointless as I would have to pay to send them the plug, my microwave and then just hope that they cover the damages. It would probably be cheaper to just replace the microwave. WASTE OF MONEY!EDIT: While I still think the product is a waste of money, the company actually isn't that bad to work with. It took about 2 months but they just sent me a check to cover the microwave I lost.

The only indication I get that the thing is working is the little LED. Other than that, it's pretty hard to determine how well it works. It's not like it tells me when it protected against a surge. So, I give it five stars. It's a 3-pronger and it sticks in the plug like it should.I purchased this item for my treadmill because the instruction manual said that if the treadmill was tripping me up, then I should get a single outlet surge protector that met these specifications. Well, it didn't change a thing.

The Joule rating is 540 so its not going to stop a huge spike but for most everyday spikes it will be fine. I did look at a few other manufacturers and since this one is in our kitchen and very visible (it protects our new Genevasound radio) this was really the only one I could find to fit the bill. Hopefully it will never be used but if needed its good to know its there and the price is very reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for single-outlet needs","review":"I recently learned a very expensive lesson in modern-day microwave oven vulnerability to power surges. To add insult to injury, an easy-to-reach outlet was installed when my older built-in microwave was replaced, but the installer did not mention that new microwave ovens with computer motherboards need to be protected from power surges (Duh!). If he had, I could have spent less that ten bucks on this handy surge protector instead of a couple hundred to have someone come out and replace the fried components.

I have an AC adapter and a fat TV power cord going into an outlet and I can't use this surge protector with them together. I would need to buy a short extension cord to accommodate the surge protector and even then it would be a tight squeeze into the outlet. The older design was square and fit perfectly. I have an older one on my other TV with the same set-up and it fits fine. Why they changed the design and made it taller is beyond me but they screwed up! Hey Tripp Lite! Ditch the tall design and go back to what works.

I have it mounted right next to a real outlet, so have this coil of extra wire that sits on the bench and takes up space. I might cut it and put on a new plug.

If you hate it, you will be maddened because you didn't get it. Put it away, and try not to think about it.. If you love it, you will watch it repeatedly, and its voice will grow with every viewing. Measured, hypnotic, and very true to the West that faded away at last in 1970. The characters are familiar from life, but they are cursed with complete freedom, and they all have guns.

[The only thing that spoiled this for me was that I kept thinking of the feminist view of a gun. No elaboration.]This film, too, although it may seem dark and sad from the description, is really a laugh. Iggy Pop's role is one of the best. And, of course, Johnny Depp is always wonderful, but in this one he truly shines.

But the similarities are haunting -- from the emphasis on technical details and the role of technology, to the pure evil embodied by Jarmusch's bounty hunter Cole/McCarthy's frightening Judge Holden.This is a great film. It brings the Western genre into the postindustrial/postmodern era, and like all great Westerns it's not really about \\"The West\\" at all. Yes, Jarmusch hits us over the head with symbolic elements such as Indian's fire crowning the dead marshall's head or the sequence of the train's running gear leading Bill Blake toward his death in/rebirth from the dark Satanic mills of Machine. But this overt play of semiotics forces us to demythologize the code--or, at least, to question the structural narrative of the code as essentialist metanarrative/Truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Man","review":"Johnny Depp. I have never been disappointed by Johnny Depp on the screen.

Johnny Depp's character also floats out into the Pacific at the end of the film (Keough obviously didn't watch the end). This film is an incredible, refreshing, powerful drama that holds the intelligent viewer's rapt attention throughout.

Putting Iggy Pop in a dress isn't particularly funny or interesting. Neither is showing Lance Henriksen's culinary habits.

Filmed in a rich, textured monochrome, the movie follows a young accountant who leaves Cleveland, Ohio for a job in a remote frontier town in the Pacific Northwest. The defining cinematic technique involves presenting the story in short snippets -- chapters varying in length that fade quickly to black. But while Dead Man captures the feeling of a dream, and is chock full of symbols of various kinds, it doesn't really work as much more than an hallucinatory trip of sorts, and its attempt to tell a greater story -- the path from life to death to afterlife -- ends up being more odd and pretentious than artistic.

I would normally have ordered an extra small, and that would have been better.

I like a phone to remind me with a 'beep' but this phone has a long extended ring that's too loud and you cannot change it. I took it to the store, and neither the tech support or store manager could figure out how to change it. I got the software upgrade and that was a BIG MISTAKE!!

I was such a drama queen.\\" But the other \\"fights\\" like Irene and Stephen's battle in Seattle and Tami and David's LA blanket incident had already been re-hashed so many times on the show that I just didn't care about hearing them talk about it AGAIN.My recommendation - save your money and just watch re-runs of the show on MTV instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this tape!!!I wish they'd release more like it!!","review":"I know that Sony doesn't make new copies of this tape.I don't even know if a DVD was released for it.I highly recommend it has the four biggest fights of the first 7 seasons uncut and 100% uncensored.The Beth/Tami/David Los Angeles fight was the longest.It runs for about 17 minutes sometimes with 2 cameras showing on the screen to show what everyone was doing.Stephen/Irene(The slap heard around the world,Seattle):An infamous slap towards slap is exchanged between a mail cast member and female cast memberDan/Melissa(Miami):A nasty expletive-filled yelling match between 2 Miami Cast membersBeth/Tami/David(Los Angeles):The infamous blanket pull argument uncut and uncensoredPuck/Pedro(San Francisco):The argument between Puck And pedro that sent Puck Packing"},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"The real world fights dvd wasn't much to impress me, there is 4 or 5 fights in it; and it didnt really hold my attention.

The \\"live\\" trombones aren't heard, the \\"live\\" chorus sounds suspiciously synthesized, the \\"live\\" drums don't synch with what the drummer is playing... I assume the producers burned the DVD with the reference tracks the performers were listening to in their earpieces during the concert, so it synchs, but it sounds like a studio recording.Then when Jarre starts playing the \\"laser organ\\" it becomes apparent that they're just lasers ... no sensors, no musical instrument attached.So generally, I think it's a studio recording with some live talking and cheering mixed in, and a lot of staging that doesn't translate very well to video.

Lisa, a ten-year-old survivor, is very brave and determined. She lets no kind of obstacle get in her way to reach her goal which is to find food and supplies, medicine and first aid, and to help herslef and her brother Todd survive.

Lisa wasn't aggresive enough. She needs to enlarge her army. She wouldn't have stood a chance against the general but it was funny when lisa punched him in the nose. Lisa and the chedester gang should join forces. Tom was aggresive and lisa was good at making strategies"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but find the older version!","review":"I remember reading this book a long time ago, and when I saw a couple episodes of the TV show \\"The Tribe\\" it made me remember it and go searching for it again. The premise is very similar.I won't go into details on the philosophy and all that; other reviewers already have and besides, I just (still) like the book for the story. But I do have to say - find and read an older edition if at ALL possible! The \\"new\\" (1995) paperback is like a condensed version - the language is much simpler, shorter sentences, less moments of thoughtfully-worded consideration... paragraphs are shortened and sentences omitted entirely! The new version basically stinks in writing style, but the original (1977) really isn't that stilted at all. Why did the publishers go and do this? Doesn't make any sense to me. Today's kids aren't that much dumber than they were 20 years ago, that they need a version written for someone four grades lower!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go Girl","review":"The first time I wrote this was in the 6 grade, now I'm in the 11 grade, and it's still \\"stuck to me\\". The book gave you a sence of adventure to a 12 year old mind (and still does for this 17 year old.) and said \\"Yes girls can do it at any age!\\"And in my opion that could happen tomarrow. That would be scary though, a illness kills off all those who know how to work things, \\"keep the peace\\", and not let anything go to hello...And Anarchy would happen and through that a leader would be born; good or bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book read it numerous times","review":"I highly recommend this book - I read it in junior high school and then in high school and tried again in college but couln't find it until just now.

O.T.Nelson did a great job at the end of the book by leaving you hanging. I just think that she should have made a sequal to it. Lisa was very brave when she stood up to Tom Logan in the tower. In my opinion I think Tom Logan was the best character because he outsmarted Lisa and took over Glenbard. Charlie was a cool character to because he made all the battle plans for Glenbard. I thought Craig was a real loser because all he wanted to do was make a farm. Over all this was a very imaginitive fiction book. Great for 6th graders all the way to adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, but thought-provoking...","review":"I read this in my lit class. I thought it was awfully-written and badly ended.

Nelson's \\"The Girl Who Owned A City\\" is a bad book. On the contrary, I think it's a wonderful book because it makes the reader think: how would you survive, if you were in the same situation as the children? Frankly, I believe we should look at the book as yet another way of viewing things. Yes, ten-year-old Lisa does run a dictatorship. But I think we have to acknowledge that democracy isn't the only way to run an organization.Instead of dismissing this book completely, read it and think about it. It's a story I've enjoyed for many years now, and continue to enjoy even now that I'm way over twelve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I read this book, and I loved it! It is probably one of the top ten books on my list! I would definitely recommend this book (more so for girls 12+) I think it is great for discussion, and hard to place yourself in the book. The characters really come alive in this book, and there are many surprises. I would not recommend reading the back of this book, because it really gives it away. It is fun to find all the surprises. This book is so good, I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Overrated Book","review":"Although many have said \\"The Girl Who Owned a City\\" is an excellent example of science fiction, it is really an overrated novel. The story goes on very slowly, hits the climax, then speeds up and stops quickly. Next, you never get any feelings from the characters throughout the whole book. Lisa, the main character, always sets her hopes to high and when they are not fulfilled she acts particularly nasty to everyone, including herself. In the end, even though it has been highly rated, the book turns out to be unrealistic and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did'nt like it!","review":"Sorry to disagree with all of you, but I didn't like it.

But like all other books, it had it's faults. I think that there was too much violence in the story! I think Nelson did this because since the star of the book is a girl, by creating so much violence it would keep boys's attention. In my class it did for the boys, but the girls didn't like it as much( including myself). I think that the girl who owned a city was well written,but at the end the author just left you hanging! It didn't explain anything about what happened to the city. I give this book four stars because of the continous acts of violene and the unfinished ending.

Many books and novels of today's world discuss and explore the trials and tribulations of growing up with divorced, widowed, seperated parents. This book creates a world where the children are forced to grow up....without a living soul over the age of 12.

The reason we liked this book was because it kept us wondering what would happen next. It was interesting to see how kids could survive without adults. This book is about a deadly plague that causes the deaths of people over the age of 12 all over the world. Lisa, a ten-year-old adventurous girl, is forced to help her brother and herself survive without adults. She lives every day looking for food. She used her imagination to look for food in places she thought other people would never look.

Everybody acted far to old for their age-there's no waya five-year-old could drive a car. I think the characters were very unrealistic and unbelievable. In the middle the book got a bit better but the small spark of goodness was spoiled witha horrible ending. There is no way I could ever believe in a gang leader actually getting talked out of taking over a city. Maybe if he was really nice he would have made an alliance with Lisa but I find no way he could of gotten talked out of it.

The story is more about leadership and communication skills and using your brain in order to solve problems in order to survive and help others.

For example, everyone has an opinion on the ethics of going into a home (the owners are dead) in order to get food and supplies to live.

My generation never got \\"Robinson Crusoe\\", \\"Tom Sawyer\\" or \\"Treasure Island\\" so this was the closest I got to the adventure novel. There are certain leaps of logic that need to be taken -- where are all the bodies of the adults, for instance, and what about late bloomers and early developers? -- but I remember it as a generally well-rendered if optimistic vision of what happens after the world has ended. As each generation passes on less and less practical knowledge to the next, it's a fitting to wonder what children would be able to reconstruct from the hollow remains of their parents' world and what they would not. I'm the only one of my friends who was raised to build furniture and use power tools. How many kids know what's under the hood of a tractor or an engine? Lisa, the protagonist, becomes an embodiment of the seldom-realized American ideal of self-reliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I loved this book very much because of its moral: take nothing for granted.

The tone control makes more minute adjustments, the volume control really changes the sound as it sweeps. Crank it all up and you get the P growl and clank.

The first author is a doctor, but appears to have no experience actually prescribing the drug. He was asked to write the book when the drug was to be released in the US but had little or no first-hand experience with its use. Therefore, the entire book reads like a very pedantic review of the scientific literature, with long sections explaining things such as what double-blind studies mean. Furthermore, the author is overly cautious in that despite dozens of studies he is often unwilling to reach tentaive conclusions but says more studies are needed.The book Stop Depression Now by Richard Brown et al. on Sam-e describes extensive experience with prescribing the drug to hundreds of patients and contains everything and more from this book.

It's all about Harvey Pekar - who is every bit as self-obsessed as Crumb but with none of his friend's redeeming neurotic quirky charm. His writing is depressing and oppressive without substantive relief of any kind. Even Crumb's drawings can't save it. For the obsessive collector only, I would not recommend it to the average R.

Her writing becomes increasingly self indulgent and tedious as she drones on about her theories of hormone imbalance, depression, romance and cults. All of this would be quite forgivable, if she gave some insight into Carlos Castaneda. But because of her mental instability and \\"political incorrectness\\" she was unable to penetrate the inner circle of Castaneda and his followers and was reduced to the role of mistress (one of many, apparently). Did Don Juan exist? Did Castaneda and the witches perform magic? Really, I have no clue after reading this. She wasn't there behind closed doors (other than when Castaneda took her to a hotel room!). There is no insight here, but plenty of self pity and misguided soul searching. Don't waste your time reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST Read for ANY Castaneda Fan","review":"This review is for anyone who is familiar with the works of Carlos Castaneda. If you are unfortunate enough to exist in what can be described as a \\"follower mentality\\" you can still thank your lucky stars you avoided this gang. If you would like to read about the ridiculous depths people of this mindset will subject themselves to when encountering an inspiring individual leader such as Carlos Castaneda then this book is a fine introduction to monkey house antics.

The only thing I liked about this book was the dust-jacket cover. The book is so full of bizarre gossip and contradictions it is laughable. For instance, she writes that \\"she wasn't much of a drinker\\" a couple pages after graphically describing how she regularly got drunk on champagne with one of \\"the witches\\". After claiming to have been a close disciple of Carlos Castaneda for many years she provides no insight into what this \\"spiritual path\\" entailed. All she seems to have done was attend a bunch of seminars in Los Angeles and around the country and hop in the sack with \\"the nagual\\". A far cry from Carlos' sorcery training with Don Juan I'd say. She paints such a depressing picture of an incredibly disfunctional group of people including herself that's it's pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the many Men Castaneda lived as!!!!!!!","review":"Finally somebody has brought Don Juans teachings back to earth!

Who is to know what the truth is? Can we really say we know the man we didn't know? I found the book 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' quite uninspiring. The narrative was fear based and negative. For all those Castaneda lovers I would recommend to focus on 'Journey to Ixlan', 'The Active Side of Infinity' and 'The Art of Stalking Parallel Perception' by Lujan Matus. 'The Sorcerer's Crossing' and 'Being in Dreaming' are the books that beckoned the most sobriety in me.

If she really was a Sorcerer's Apprentice, she would have come out the other side a better person, a changed person. All I can tell from this book is that she didn't even try to be an apprentice, just a negative nay-sayer that kept judging Carlos from the outside and never tried to follow him. Sad little memoir indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for gossip","review":"The last time I read Taisha's book, which was about six months ago, I remember breaking down in tears at the end of it. Just weeping for the tragedy of it all. Now you may or may not understand why. I have read this book, and I guess it's fine for gossip, but nothing else. And the fact that Amy doesn't seem to want to reply to a lot of relevant questions, don't reflect too well on her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly bad","review":"I've read a slew of books in my day, nothing comes close, in sheer badness, to this one. Its hard to imagine how anyone could appear to be more reprehensible that Castaneda and his cohorts, as Ms. Wallace describes them...but then there's the mindboggling proof on nearly every page, that however vile the subjects of her writing may be, she tops them with a gorgons knot of deception, delusion (ongoing) and whining. Super yuck. Still, this may be the penultimate memoir of just how low someone with too much time and money on their hands can go. That its so badly written just adds to the \\"gestalt\\" of it all. Don't miss this if you want to read a bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-Blowing \\"Truth is Stranger than Fiction\\" Reading!","review":"This alternately beautiful, terrifying, wondrous, disturbing and profoundly human memoir of the author's 30-year spanning friendship-turned-relationship with the legendary Carlos Castaneda is compulsive, memorable reading. Ms. Wallace (a bestselling fiction and nonfiction writer, as well as the daughter of the best-selling novelist Irving Wallace) - a true seeker who is as brilliant as she is spiritual - shows us the best and the worst of Castaneda the man and his group (more accurately, his CULT), taking the reader on an unforgettable journey into both the light and the dark. Must reading for anyone fascinated with the Castaneda mythos; make no mistake, however - this is far more than a provocative New Age study...it's also a devastatingly incisive, ferociously literate, shatteringly tragic and ultimately triumphant story of an incredible and heroic woman's most extraordinary life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and Important","review":"Thank you Amy Wallace for this well written and truthful book. Knowing more about Carlos Castaneda, the way he lived, and the kind of human being he was, does a great service to those seeking to learn the valuable and magical lessons in his books; that the real truth for each person is reflected ultimately from within and not bestowed from without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad for the wrong reasons","review":"This book is definitely worth reading if you're into tabloid journalism. For anybody who's more interested in exploring the boundless possibilities of our existence... sorry, no. Throughout the book, the author seems to be crying out to the reader to pity her for her own choices... I don't see the logic here. Plus, Wallace's deluded narcissism shines through every page. The great mystery is why Castaneda would even have bothered with her in the first place. As well as what she might have thought she'd get out of the world of sorcery...I'm sorry I can't be more positive about this book.I just can't.It's not even wellwritten, and it reeks of ego, Hollywood style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Amy","review":"Even when Florinda tells her to smile, Amy can't do it. Such a simple thing but Amy can't do it. Instead she diverts her energy onto blaming Florinda for being a bad teacher. The whole book encapsulated in that moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth is in the Dreaming","review":"I was dissapointed but not surprised by this book. I believe that any of you who have repeatedly read all of Castaneda's books probably have achieved SOME level of understanding regarding the core concepts. Amy Wallace tells a very transparent story from the outside looking in with a particulary priveleged view. What struck me as the most important feature is that she does not talk about her own experiences with sorcery, just typical gossipy human garbage. Did she even practice any of this stuff? No, I think she was a little fan girl who got swept up in something far to vast for her. I dont really care about Carlos Casteneda, but Ive read all of his works over and over again for years. At a certain point things changed, and thats really all that needs to be said. If you know what I mean then you know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good movie","review":"I found Winaria to be a very captivating movie.

Alan unwittingly gets caught up in the war and looses sight of what's important... Veronica and Roland(with the deaths of their parents) are forced to join the war, and thus comes many bloody battles and more touching scenes.

As an adder bonus, you get to see wonderfully expressive art.If you've got $25.00 lying around, go buy this book.

I'm buying Church and State volumes 1 and 2 tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Society, Low Entertainment....","review":"High Society is made out to be Pompous. It is a tired lame story that runs on and on and never seems to go anywhere. If you like pointless mythical political stories that are dry at best, this is the book for you. All the supporting characters are lame attempts at farce. If you want to see something with Groucho Marx in it please get yourself a Marx Bros. Movie. If you want to read some lame Moon Knight Stories go read Moon Knight. The art is basic Mad Magazine fare, and the only interesting Character----Cerebus becomes less and less interesting as the story goes on. It's a boring 500 page political satire. You can tell Sim got bored with it as well as the last quarter of the book is drawn sideways.

However, the maker's claim that it will work with different operating systems did not prove true for me. It seems to work fine on a computer with Windows 7, but causes a problem on a computer which can be booted to Windows XP or Ubuntu 12-4. The problem is that the resolution will be changed to a lower value than is appropriate for the monitor, and the computer's image will not fit within the limits of the screen.

I decided on this one since I needed many locks and this one offers great value.

The worst thing about this product is that the catch that is supposed to prevent your child from opening the cabinet a crack and then reslamming his/her fingers in there doesn't work. The catch almost never catches. In fact the only time it catches is when an adult forgets about the cabinet lock and tries to open the cabinet with an adult's normal force. Then it catches. And it is difficult to unhitch. I could go on about the other design defects about this product, but I don't want to waste my time. I recommend buying one of the cabinet locks with a little joint and spring in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but ...","review":"The 'no pinched fingers' design causes doors and drawers to be stuck in an open position wide enough for my 13 month old son to reach inside and pull stuff out, which was what I wanted to avoid in the first place! Also, the clip which attaches to the cupboard frame is brittle--he has broken several by throwing his weight on the drawer (he doesn't quite weigh 20 lbs yet). Having to constantly disengage these hooks to return doors and drawers to the closed position has become an aggrevation.

Despite the great timespan of his work he is able to provide many interesting details and insights. He accomplishes this by avoiding a strict chronological approach. Sections are devoted to the various empires such as the Parthians, and, within these sections, chapters deal with subjects such as religion or classes in society. I especially appreciated the chapters on sources which explicitly describe our sources for the various eras. Because of Wiesehofer's approach this book is not at all a popular history. I would not recommend it to someone who does not already have a familiarity with the history of Persia. At times the book can be quite technical and assumes a fair knowledge on the part of the reader. However, if you have a familiarity with ancient Persia and wish to learn more about it, I heartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Overrated","review":"This is not a history of Ancient Persia but rather a set of essays on just a few topics: \\"The Testimonies\\" (i.e. the historical sources); \\"The King and his Subjects\\"; and \\"Everyday Life\\".Basically, apart from the Bisutun relief (text available at http://www.avesta.org/op.htm) and the Persepolis Texts (R. T. Hallock, Chicago 1969), nearly all the sources are Greek or Latin upon which the author relies despite the contrary assertion given by the publisher on the flyleaf. It's not the ancient Greek and Roman writers that the author attempts to discredit but rather the modern writers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.Better to read \\"The Persian Empire\\" by J.

I collect my favorite animals in plush form and I DEFINATELY wish to say that the Cuddlekins/Wild Republic company really emphasize with the detail in their stuffed animals-this bat is no exception!This bat is modeled from the Flying Bismark Fox Bat that is native to South America. Let me say, this bat is just adorable!! The wings are long and seem to be made with felt (or a combination of felt and cotton) and they are longer than the bat's body, the body is nice and soft, the eyes are cute, and (again) the detail is amazing!I definately recommend this plush to people that enjoy collecting their favorite animals in plush form, and also for children (just please remove the tag if you're giving this to a small child-all Cuddlekins stuffed animals come with one which includes information about the animal it's modeled after)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Flying Fox","review":"After visiting Sydney Australia and seeing all of the flying foxes next to the Sydney Opera house I purchased this item.

I enjoy the sick and twisted as much as the next gal, but this book goes way too far. Bad enough are the questions about putting puppies in a trash compactor (apparently money trumps compassion - a fact that pretty much breaks my heart), but the whole section on explicit sexual acts with family members is so far across the line, you can't even see the line any more. It is really just offensive and disgusting, and absolutely not ok for anyone who has been the victim of, or worked with the victims of, sexual abuse. Or, really, any person who thinks that even contemplating such vile and inappropriate acts is quite simply wrong.

By unconventional behavior, I mean behavior that is selfish in motivation and destructive in nature. I am not referring simply to behavior that is bizarre or indecent.

He hasn't grown much emotionally in the ten years since he graduated from high school (for example, he's never had a serious relationship in all that time; he's still mooning for his high school sweetheart.) The ex-sweetheart, Miranda, apparently decided to ditch her plans to become a doctor and went on the road as a stripper instead because...(hint: it's not because she's deep.)The surprise twist in the plot has been done in other mysteries and it's a great device, but it's not much of a surprise here (everyone in my book club guessed it.)All in all, I'd characterize this book as \\"workmanlike.\\" All the right elements are there, they've just been done better by more experienced writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard boiled crime","review":"Fast moving, suspenseful, well written and literate.

What they faced then is more like too many workers, not just in the meat packing industry but especially there, face or know they will face soon. This book about the strike is not a sociological or journalistic analysis, but the analysis of a longtime working class leader, who was also one of the central leaders of the anti-Vietnam war movement.

His performance suffers from an overly serious approach to these light pieces, which Tchaikovsky wrote very quickly and with little effort. Pletnev's tempos in the slow pieces suffer from excessive rubatos and they frequently fall apart. If you want to have music to fall asleep to, listen the very first piece, \\"January,\\" or even more lazy: \\"October.\\" It is deadly dull, and gets duller as he progresses. His tempos/rubatos are fatal, and destroy the charm of the music. I don't understand why this man is considered a Tchaikovsky expert....

I think Ms. Grayson is a very talented author and her other books really touch my heart. But this latest novel lacked characters that I could like as people. At best, Carson is a charming girl who is stubborn and willful. At worst, she comes off as a rich, priviledged girl who is spoiled rotten and does not bother to concern herself with how others around her feel. Her beau, Alec is also hard to like. He is pushy and helpless and appears to prey on innocent girls. He is a fast mover and seems all wrong for Carson. As for the other characters in the book, Carson's parents and aunt/uncle are boring.I was really quite disappointed in this book.

His egoism comes through even in the scholarly (though curiously uninformative) essay, which is heavily influenced by psychoanalysis, and conveys the vague idea that you should feel guilty for enjoying any of the limericks he's collected, which he considers by and large violent and misogynistic. Many of the limericks are shocking, some more so now than when they were written in the early to mid 20th century (though others, naturally, are far less shocking). They are full of profanity, lewdness, and cringe-inducing injury. But a few are quite clever and amusing.

You will be shocked by the language in these short poems.On the other hand, if you are open-minded, you will be entertained by the endless variety of inventive language in these limericks.

I first tried Spearhead on a G4 with 768 MB RAM, and eventually gave it up in frustration. In some levels (particularly the one that has you riding around on the top of a truck), the frame rate slowed down so much to make the level impossible.However, I've recently gotten a G5 with 1 GB RAM, and tried Sprearhead again. This time, the computer was able to handle the graphics nicely, and I was finally able to beat that level, although it was still really tough. I found that the later missions (defending the frontline, and infiltrating Berlin) were quite fun.All in all, a worthwhile purchase if you are not frustrated by slow performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frostbite at Ardennes","review":"As to the Wermacht, the weak point to this game is the snow, the Ardennes forest stage has no autosave feature and the quicksave doesnt work. Other snow bugs are:-1 out of 2 times planting the sticky bomb on the first battery of artillery stalls the game, forcing to quit.-The mountain top stage slows the game to a point can not be played at all. That happens even with the video and advanced options at minimum. Even playing in a 1 Gb RAM machine.The sound, the graphics, the play is superb, but dying from bugs is the worst thing can happen at any war, even a digital one.I would prefer to play this game in the PS2.

She's stiff and unlikable, and he just doesn't fit the role of a passionate, opera-loving chef. Neither actor is helped by the fact that this movie isn't quite sure what it wants to be. It jumps haphazardly from drama to cliched scenes of pillow fighting and a particularly banal clip of a desperate Zeta-Jones interviewing a quick succession of odd looking people for a chef's job, which I assume was meant to be funny. Frankly I'm surprised it's tagged as a romantic comedy as there was very little to laugh about or find lovey dovey, although I did I cringe a few times.I watched this movie on cable and I'm glad I never paid for the privilege. It's predictable Hollywood guff."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Reservations indeed. . . .","review":"\\"No Reservations\\" is excellent behind-the-scenes glimpse at food-and-beverage business and an excellent movie. The pressures of keeping the service, quality of food and the customers pleased is brief but real. Smooth operation of the every day of a restaurant is dictated by the staff on duty at that moment.

Not this time.No Reservations MIGHT have gotten two stars from me if I hadn't seen Mostly Martha -- Catherine ZJ is easy on the eyes, though less so in htis movie... But this remake is slavishly true to its inspiration, even to the music, while lacking all real emotion or strength. And given that Mostly Martha is a remarkable movie, how could this movie ever have been made? Some sense of self-respect should have moved all involved in this version to petition to have their names removed from the credits.Mostly Martha is funny at times, and tremendously powerful at others -- it's a sympathetic portrayal of grief and compulsiveness, all shown with such restraint that its impact is intensified. Martina Gedeck, as she proved in Lives of Others, is a tremendous actress. And the little girl is really good.So either see Mostly Martha and skip this, or never see Mostly Martha so this won't be so awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Friday Night Flick","review":"If you love to cook and enjoy watching romance movies, then you'll like this one.

As I love to cook a great gourmet meal every now and then, watching people cook in this film reminded me of watching The Food Network.As for the movie itself, in the beginning Catherine Zeta-Jone's character is real control freak. She's a talented chef but is extremely anti-social, rude, and arrogant. But then she starts working with a fun and unconventional sous chef who gets her to come out of her shell. Sure they bump heads not to mention ruin a few dinner orders, but in the end it all works out.

I removed the diverter and pulled the plastic center piece out with needle nose pliers and then drilled some small holes in the plastic around the brass stem.

I was going to replace the sprayer but after reading other reviews that the problems just keep coming I'm changing my mind. The faucet arm also pulses now I cleaned the screen but no help. I guess I'll be buying a new faucet,a Moen or Kohler."},{"rating":"1","title":"On our second one","review":"We have the Marielle and are on our second one. Our first leaked around the pivot after about six years of heavy use. Price Pfister replaced the entire faucet free of charge. I had to install it though. Our second one is now refusing to stay on when you want a small amound of flow. Full flow it works fine. We love it when it's working but I'm not sure about another Price Pfister. Follow-up: I did some google searching and found that you can remove the top trim pieces and tighten the large nylon \\"nut\\" which adds friction to the handle operation. This will keep the faucet from tuning off by itself. I'd say at least 4 stars now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"If I could give this thing zero stars I would. It is such a piece of junk. We bought it brand new and after 6 months the faucet developed a crack and leaked. I didn't keep the receipt (who would think I would need to on a $300 faucet) so I couldn't have it replaced under warranty. I patched it and that seemed to hold for about another 3 months until the sprayer developed a crack and started leaking. I tried patching it the same way and that didn't work. Then the faucet patch gave out and now both are leaking. So I've had this piece of junk less than a year and already have to replace it. If you value your money, don't buy this expensive faucet. It is nice looking but very poor quality.I'm now very concerned about buying any faucet from this company at all. If all their faucets are of this quality I don't want anything to do with them. Do your research before buying from this company. If I would have seen these other reviews I would have never bought this expensive piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Purchased and installed this item in August 20008. We've been extremely disappointed with the quality of this Price Pfister item. The soap dispenser does not work well - we are constantly having to refill it but the suction only dribbles out dish soap. We now have to have a separate dishsoap dispenser that sits alongside of the sink. Also, the single handle faucet handle has begun to \\"stick\\" when we run water. We are redoing our kitchen soon and will have to go with another product as we will never purchase Price Pfister products again. We've been happy with American Standard and Kohler and will likely go with those brands. Better to pay a little more for a quality product when it comes to bath and kitchen faucets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really for US DVD players?","review":"Thisfilm looks very interesting but it is listed as PAL format and says \\"all\\" regions.Which is it?

I bought one to see it in person. The plastic casing had some irregularities in it, but otherwise I was impressed. My biggest complaint is that it is made in China.

The articles present detailed evidence that Derek Freeman was correct, and Mead was one of science's greatest liars. Her books, followed by those of the hippy leaders at Columbia University (Kerouac, et al.), led to an enormous revolution in social and political thought (essentially the \\"New left\\" philosophy), including the foundations of the Women's Liberation movement.

The end product provides little coverage of any lines in these families. This is unlike the other books in teh series (Caro-Kann and KID) which provide a great introduction to an opening system and provides a great starting point for an opening repetoire.

I'm tired of slogging my way through one well-meaning micro-budget street drama after another, when those involved don't seem to have a clue what they're talking about. I'd reccomend that the makers of this angst ridden torture session of a film look at martin Bell's STREETWISE or Lech Kowalski's STORY OF A JUNKIE before they take it upon themselves to portray drug addiction in another film.

I wish you better luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Project Management Education","review":"This is an excellent case study about Intel's P6 project -- that became the Pentium Pro and part of the lineage for a number of other processors. The author provides the story of compromises made while the project proceded and the corporate politics endured at Intel. He also discusses the Pentium flaw episode and provides a technical rationale that thay may have led to that unrelated debacle. It is fun to read about some of the technical aspects of this project. One flaw to the story is the lack of additional information on why Intel settled out of court and paid millions of dollars for alleged patent infringement accusations relating to the P6 project. The book is surprisingly upbeat considering the author no longer works at Intel. If you like this book, Brian Bagnall's \\"On the Edge\\" about the rise and fall of Commodore computer is an excellent follow-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat for practioners of computer engineering","review":"It's really a treat. It should be in the bookshelf of a grad student or practioner in the fields of computer and electronics engineering.It is not written by some professional writer, instead, it is a book written by a engineer, with the very first-hand experience of the development of P6 architecture. If this book should have some imperfection or even mistake, I will take a psychological perspective to anylyze it -- just like I analyze my own development memos. 8-) As a reader of At Random, I can say that the writing of Mr. Colwell is comparable with those professional writers.BTW, I think the subtitle is quite fit for the content of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty Promises, Over-hyped","review":"This \\"book\\", more like an extended magazine article, is hardly \\"Soul of a New Machine\\" - that's just a laughable comparison. There are no daily digests of personalities arguing architectural features or fighting to meet an overly aggressive verification schedule. This book is merely a small compendium of paragraph length stores with longer chapters with \\"whitepaper\\" like advice. There's nothing particularly \\"Intel\\" or \\"Pentium\\" about the stories and you certainly don't get a feel for the people or the teams working with the project. There are better choices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"thin","review":"I was looking forward to a history of the depth of, say \\"Into the Black\\" about JPL by Peter Westwick, a professional historian. The Pentium Chronicles is thin. I think it's trying mostly to be a project management book. The context is poorly drawn, the technical issues are nearly completely unexplained, and the stories are told without zest. The sidebars make the book feel like it is meant to be bought at an airport and discarded to the next passenger. Colwell is undoubtedly a fine computer architect but his writing leaves a lot to be desired, at least in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny, but not complete","review":"I saw a bit of Lisa's stand up on Comedy Central, I laughed so hard. I picked this album out the other day and once again was laughing with tears in my eyes. Her comedy is vulgar, it is offensive and it is hilarious. As I was listening to the CD I was thinking that I remembered certain jokes a little differently. The reason for this is that the CD is edited from the DVD release. The language is still the same, but the bits have been shortened, it's not a direct audio copy of the video. The CD sort of sounds like highlights from the video.Aside from the edits, the CD will give you some great laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarlatti's masterpiece.","review":"When we think about the great choral works of classical music, the names we often repeat are Pergolesi, Bach, Mozart, maybe Beethoven and some others. But very rarely does Domenico Scarlatti, the profilic composer of several harpischord pieces, come along. This, in my opinion, is truly a shame, cause one of the greatest music he ever wrote, was choral music. And in this field, his crowning achievement was \\"Stabat Mater\\" for unacomppanied voices. It is a gem of a highest order. It has a beautiful structure, and it contains several immortal melodies. I myself put it right up to the greatest choral works ever written.Do yourself a favour and try it, if you love great choral music or beautiful music in general, you wont be disappointed. The perfomance of King's choir in this cd is solid and clear. Highest of recommendations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I purchased this product for my father who likes to wear old wool cardigan sweaters that are not machine washable. The only thing I liked about this product was the nice dark gray color. The cardigan is made from a cheap fleece that left fine lint all over my dad's shirt. It did not have a nice shape. My father is very slightly stooped shouldered and this accentuated the fact that the cardigan was short in the back. (I even tried the sweater on myself and the back was too short). The size XL had plenty of \\"stomach room\\" but the length of the sleeves and the overall sweater were for someone under 5 foot 9 inches. I would be afraid to wash and dry for fear the length would shrink more. I do not recommend this product, especially because of the lint. I am returning the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"the unfinished animal is roszak's journey of going beyond our futility of instinctual drives to looking at our potential and actuality of our existence. the evolution of consciousness is a step backward in examining the sacred culture of myth, magic and mysteries. roszak looks at everything from theosophy, to the golden dawn, to eastern philosophy and psychology. he contends that we can never do justice to one another as social animals until we have done justice to the visionary powers within us. written in 1975, the book is slighty outdated as many of the concerns about new age philosophy and wholistic thought is now more part of our culture and medicine than it was then. still a good book and recommended read."},{"rating":"1","title":"IEEE 1394 = Firewire :-(","review":"This product is meant for ipods that use firewire, not USB.
