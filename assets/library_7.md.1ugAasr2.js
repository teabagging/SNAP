Apparently she had a good idea, seeking to report on why and how black inner city culture glorifies staying down, but the message is presented in a look-at-what-I-can-do style that is very disappointing. She's much too much giddy with her own Hoo Ha reflections, such as her chronically annoying \\"(I'm ghetto),\\" and \\"(I'm not ghetto)\\" closings to every paragraph where she demonstrates a personal preference - and there are far too may of them.

No detail exploration is done on the subject at all; but just overviews of people she has met and things she has experience in her daily life. Very weak presentation.

BrotherMan on the corner is not interested in black socialism or a book about black culturalism. This book is a wake up call to all people in the sense that it's asking you to think about what it is that you do and why you do those things that are considered to be ghetto.

It felt like a long magazine article, but without any hard data behind it. I enjoyed the author's personal insights, but I would have liked some \\"meat\\" to accompany it. The author tries to walk a fine line: condemning the negative aspects of urban culture while not wishing to alienate herself from those who accept it. The usage of \\"I'm ghetto\\" was meant to convey the fact that the ghetto mentality is something that creeps into all of our lives, but its constant repetition seemed simultaneously apologetic and a proud wink to those whom would alienate her otherwise.I was greatly impressed by the author's character.

In fact, in my opinion, if you don't see the details and also in some cases stanzas you will have a very bad perception of the Yoruba culture. Then, I think, why this book?

Instead, it's about English life, English people, and looking and acting like Margaret Thatcher, something I hope no woman is striving for.Kathleen Tessaro begins her novel with lots of instructions and hope, I even envisioned myself buying an expensive purse. But it all turned flat, sour, and boring, the life of a 32 year old who, \\"surprise,\\" lands a beautiful younger man, after attending a, check this, weekend getaway with rich, rude, English people.

I thought I'd fall in love with this hapless woman and cheer for her but instead found myself amazed that she was even able to find love, let alone friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!","review":"Wonderful premise, eye-catching cover and utterly disappointing inside!

I had also read the reviews and they were good. Thus, I expected the story to be as good as the cover but, boy, was I in for a let down! This is definitely not a humorous chick lit, like Jemima J., Shopaholic, or Bridget Jones. This story has a good premise but the writing is dull and mostly unhumorous. I can literally count the funny parts on one hand. I cannot give credit for its depth either, since it lacked complexity.

The protagonist is completely unsympathetic... an infantile drama queen whose problems are all self-inflicted. Secondary characters and situations drag on for pages with no payoff or interesting conclusion.

(The average person - with no taste - needs SOME help.) I thought the exerpts added a lot of humour.Since I'm a 5+ book/week reader, any book's plot that surprises me gets an automatic 5 stars.If you are wanting something frothy, this book may surprise you with it's darkness.

Of course, the story has a happy ending which is also satisfying.Fun read.

The book started out as charmingly funny and rather touching but after a few chapters it seems that someone suggested that it take an edgier turn and advised the author to throw in an abortion and perhaps begin using the F word which she did. It picked up a little later and became mildly funny but by then had lost all of it's charm and I felt little or no sympathy whatsoever for the heroine. It's a shame to see such a great idea and a reasonable amount of writing talent go to waste like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK as a novel.","review":"To be honest, it was less than I expected.

Then came retarded, tard, person living in a special-needs home, etc. Does this author need to resort to this type of metaphor for her characters? And was the editoral staff so inattentive that no one found this objectionable? After all, imagine if these references had used race as their foundation.

An apparently realistic adventure novel set in the 'Death on the Nile' world of English gentry touring the pyramids. It begins with a story I had enjoyed in Pharaoh Fantastic, but then jumps forward a decade and picks up the same characters, somewhat worse for wear and aims them back to the same location. I was eager to see how the author would pull the characters out of their dilemma with only our world's resources to do it, when the book took a sudden left turn into fantasy.

I have enjoyed Lindskold's past books and Egypt is always an interesting subject. Imagine my dismay when the book ends up being a dud. The characters were very superficial with little personality, it was difficult to sympathize/relate with any of them. And though the book is seemingly set in the late 19th/early 20th century there was glaringly obvious modern slang in many of the character's speech. And the plot, sigh, the plot started out with a decent premise but was bogged down with irrelevant side stories and a lack luster finale. I do not blame this on Ms. Lindskold, this is clearly the work, or lack thereof, on the part of her editors. A little pruning here and there, and some constructive criticism on their part and this could have been a great book. Unfortunately, as seems to happen all too often, the editor's apparently functioned as highly paid spellcheckers.

The expedition is hampered by threats from a fellow archeologist party and a religious sect bent on protecting the pyramid, and helped by cryptic warnings from an anonymous source. The book start out with a bit of backstory to the search, and end with a suddenly appearing egyptian pantheon.My problems with the story are many. Most prominent is the simplicity and childlike way the story is told - 50 pages in I actually had to make sure it wasn't just a bad childrens book I had picked up - and the sudden tacking on of a 'fantastic' ending that is not in any way made believable or plausible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hoped for better...","review":"I first found Lindskold through When the Gods are Silent, an excellent book. Then Donnerjack, her completion of one of Zelazny's unfinished works, was excellent as well. I read the first three of her wolf novels; very good. So I had high hopes for The Buried Pyramid. Unfortunately, the first eighty percent of the book struck me as childish without the childlike sense of wonder, and as leading to a great climax. Also unfortunately, the great climax was nothing but a radical change in form, the sudden appearance of great magics and jarringly useless gods, and epic adventures compressed into paragraphs. I'll go try the 4th of her wolf novels now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozefest","review":"Awful novel, complete waste of time. Takes over 200 pages just to get started, moves along decently for under 100 pages and then goes off the deep end for the last 200 pages in a tedious, annoying meeting of mortals with a number of Egyptian gods and monsters. There is no solid ending with intelligent explanations to make the reading worth it, the story simply stops. That's it.The majority of characters are boring and unlikeable and the author spends endless pages and paragraphs dissecting their thoughts in what seems to be an attempt at teaching morality to the reader, but which only slows the plot, dragging it out endlessly.Trim the book down to 150 pages, add lots of brightly colored graphic novel art and a completely different ending and 'The Buried Pyramid' MIGHT be worth flipping through."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A GREAT LAUGH!!

Looks can be deceptive and I picked to watch this movie because of the cover and Mekhi Phifer but it proved to be disappointing. Because of the bad acting and unrealistic scenarios it is hard to take this movie seriously. My friends and I were laughing throughout the entire movie and the movie isn't even a comedy.In one of the scenes the wife and Mekhi are having sex in the jacuzzi or pool. Her gets wet and her hair curls up to its natural texture. As they are having sex she notices her husband and she hurdly jumps out of the pool and enters the house; when she enters the house her hair is straight.That is just one scenario that made the movie so horrible. It is really hard to take this movie serious. I would only recommend this movie if you want a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent with twists and turns from 1st frame to last","review":"A very suspenseful, sexy, thriller with twists and turns which keep the suspense flowing form beginning to end.

With lame background music, cheesy sex scenes and poor acting, it is borderline porn. The plot is unbelievable and I kept sighing through the entire movie.

It is clearly obvious why it was produced in the first place. Black males love movies where black males have sex....either consensual or forcibly.....with white females. This \\"In Your Face\\" sex farce was intended to stimulate black males......piss off white males........and possibly titilate white females with Socially Taboo sexual content, in which they are condemmed as Racist if they do not openly consider sex with black males as an option. This theme is prevalent in Perverse Hollywood these days....just ask Denzel. If it Shocks or Angers the watcher...they will push it to the limits....in the copious name of Artistic Expression. The rest of us are supposed to clap our hands and pretend to be entertained...when the agenda of this movie....and others just like it....is to Empower black males in a predominately white society.

After watching I was wondering why I never heard of it in the movies. I love movies and this one somehow snuck by me. I see so many \\"big budget\\" movies with very little plot and this movie comes and keeps me glued to my seat. How right the title to say uninvited guest when the main charachter turns out to be a criminal and then the plot twist at the end wrps the movie up quite nicely. Looking for a movie with a \\"who one it?\\" plot with a twist on the end then look no further. Be aware it starts slow but rolls up quickly into a modern day drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling","review":"One morning I just happened to wake up around 2 AM and had the pleasure of seeing this movie. At the beginning, I figured it would be kind of wack because it just seemed to me as if it were a low budget movie. However, as the movie progessed and the storyline got deeper and deeper, I found myself drawn into it. As sleepy as I was, and knowing I had to get up in a couple of hours for work, I wanted to see how the movie would play out. I must say, I was very well pleased with the plots, storylines, actors, sequences and everything that makes an interesting thrill story (not horror, just thrill). Nonetheless, I stayed up to watch the entire movie. I have been suggesting this movie to anyone who takes time to listen to my story (LOL).

Whether or not it was a good idea to rope in Justin is debatable. For starters, when they had TV performances of \\"Where Is The Love?\\" he never appeared to perform alongside them, unless you count last year's MTV awards, and even then he didn't really add much to the song that wasn't already there. Since then, they've had a mega selling album, another hit single, and a single on the way soon.\\"Where Is The Love?\\" stayed at the top of the UK charts for 6 or 7 weeks, and they constantly came back to Top Of The Pops, to sing live, which is more than some of the acts currently on the scene. Fergie has a fantastic voice, and can really hit the notes needed.This is a terrific song, although it's better hearing it sung live rather than on the radio/CD - you don't hear as much of Fergie's voice that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good meaning, But...","review":"terribly overrated song.

I dont even have to talk about this its so obvious.And the lyrics? Very lacking. First two lines they rhyme mama with mama's! I would have expected this from missy elliot, but not BEP.

Dwayne-Corneilous is so powerful and sincere it is hard to believe that he is under 40 years old. There is something Devine in him.

Also, the needle arm was out of alignment, so the needle kept hitting the metal plate on the base of the machine. I snapped two needles in the course of trying to sew a simple garment. It is not even worth my time to exchange this piece of junk.I gave it two stars, because it could do a straight stitch, and as long as you were only sewing together two pieces of thinner fabric, it worked okay.

It's in a metal case at the bottom of the machine...it is much more challenging than my BIG brother machine. She needs help with that part every time.2. The dial to choose the stitch type is difficult to use. It's big and thick and it's hard to tell where it's pointing (there's no little arrow to point at the number so you're sure about what you're choosing).3. My BIGGEST complaint: the machine doesn't move slowly. It's difficult to master the pedal on a sewing machine anyhow...to get the feel of it and learn to maintain a constant speed. This machine doesn't go SLOW. It's WAY too fast, and it's tricky to get it to slow down (even for me, a more experienced sewer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"never worked right","review":"I bought this machine hoping to be able to make some clothes and do some repairs and save some money.

The bobbin pops out and is hard to put in right, the needle goes down and gets its thread all wadded up in the bobbin so that you have to take the bobbin out and cut the tangled thread to get the material loose. I took it to a sewing machine shop to have them look at it, and tell me if there was something I was doing wrong, and they said it worked.

I bought from Amazon for small tasks only.I used a Singer stationary for years, loved it and wish I still had it.Just about everything I try to do with this one frustrates me. There are instructions for use but they don't seem to be complete.If I was to buy tomorrow it would be a Singer with a drop in bobbin and self threading. Hope there's remedy because I don't need another \\"thing\\" in my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for kids","review":"I gave this to my niece for her 10th birthday.This is her first sewing machine; she loved it and has been sewing like crazy.

Got it on a lightening deal from Santa to my 9year old daughter. Out of the box before threading or anything it was grinding. Santa failed on this one. Brother was going to send it for repair, but I just got a replacement from amazon. This second one has tension issues. Too tight, too loose. Changes within the same run. Frustrating. I spent an hour and a half working on it and finally got too frustrated. She came to me later so sad that it wouldn't work. There is no way she could work on this somewhat alone with the thread catching in the bobbin case so much. May oil, may get new metal bobbins, but may send this second one back. I have another brother, the 400 version for embroidery and sewing, I love that one and really hate this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst machine ever.","review":"I was given this machine for Christmas. I was able to sew about two dresses for my daughter before the thing broke. The feed dogs stopped working entirely, they dropped below the plate and upon servicing I found out that someone had forgotten to put in about 3 screws that were suppose to hold the feed dog lever up. When they went to service it things started falling out of the machine! Rather than pay to have it rebuilt, I decided to throw it out and purchase a Singer. I will never, ever buy another Brother machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sewing machine in the world!","review":"so i got this machine thinking it was going to be easy to use, Boy was i WRONG. its hard to get the thread up from below the machine. the thread keeps on getting caught in the gears and no matter what i do the thread bunches up!!! this is the WORST sewing maching i've ever used. I defentally do NOT recomend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Brother LS2125i","review":"This is my first sewing machine. I wanted a basic machine to work on. I figured the fancier the machine, the more parts that could likely malfunction. I've used other people's machines before, like older Singers Kenmores. I'm very impressed with this little machine. So far, I haven't had any trouble with it. I got it a few weeks before Christmas, and I've made a ton of projects, my kitchen curtains, several simple garments, gifts like aprons and fabric totes. It's awesome :). I will say that some of the instructions in the manual aren't very clear. I performed some maintenance and even my engineer husband had trouble making sense of the some of the pictures. Some of the pictures don't seem to match this particular model. You can find a ton of tutorials on YouTube for threading the bobbins and other things. I recommend this machine if you're looking for some simple and affordable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two years later and it's starting to die","review":"This machine worked fine for about a year. I'm now having problems with the stitching tangling and breaking. Have tried various needles, threads, tension settings and I can't figure out how to get through a sewing project without the thread constantly breaking and tangling. My conclusion is that it's cheaply made. My previous machine, a 1970's Kenmore, lasted me over 30 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"it does the job... some of the time.","review":"My first sewing machine. It's gotten me through numerous projects, but I don't have any loyalty to it. I am in constant fear of when the next thread catastrophe will be. It jams, bunches, chops thread, and is generally unruly. However, if you only need it to do one thing, one stitch, one type, with good thread, go for it. it can repair and hem. It works, most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, my mom loves it !!!!","review":"I ordered this machine for my mom. She just loves how well it works with it's compact design. The shipping was great and the prodcut came in before the estimated time. it offers a good range of stiching functions. My mom uses it for simpler tasks such as fixing and alteration work but this can be used for much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sewing machine for the cost","review":"Although this sewing machine lacks some of the smoothness and fancy stitching you can get with more expensive models, it works great! It's really simple and easy to use - I've just started sewing again after a couple years and I've already made a baby blanket, skirt, and dress. I'm really glad I got this machine because it was affordable and is perfect for both small mending projects and larger creative projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give zero if possible-- thread tension issues","review":"Like another reviewer, it was impossible for me to get the thread tension right on this machine. It wasn't me. I was taking a sewing class, and the instructor could not get the tension right, and told me it was the machine. The tension wheel is cheap plastic, and breaks easily.Save your money and invest in a higher quality machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little machine","review":"I personally do not sew but my girlfriend wanted to, so I looked around and read other customer reviews on many different sewing machine and this one had High ratings.

Immediately, pieces fell apart and were loose. I contacted the manufacturer and they told me the only way they could help me was if I visited their service center -- which happens to be more than an hour away!!! I am not willing to rent a car to drive to the service center at a cost greater than the machine. I am incredibly disappointed with this product.Unfortunately, I purchased the sewing machine 2 months ago and have only just now had time to open the box, read the manual, and try it out, so the return policy has lapsed. Waiting to hear back from Amazon, but buyer beware! I will not be buying from Brother again. Would give zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super easy to use!!","review":"I needed a sewing machine for some basic stuff and was tired of borrowing my moms machine. I didn't need anything fancy so I didn't want to spend a lot. This is a great and easy to use machine. Within an hour of being delivered I had read the instructions set it up wound a bobbin an sewn a lined bag handles and all together. Its not too heavy has a built in handle comes with extra bobbins in the box and feet are very easy to switch. I haven't ventured into button holes yet but zippers were super easy. I would definitely recommend this machine if you just need some basic stitches."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Mother Loves It","review":"I got this as a Christmas present for my mother. She had formerly used a 27 year old machine but picked it right up and after reading the manual for 5 minutes, started sewing. She was happy that it had a button holer function. The controls seem easy enough and the design is nice. Recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Returned It","review":"I am new to sewing and wasn't looking for anything other than a bare bones machine when I bought this. If I could sew a straight line with it, I'd be happy. Even with these simple goals, this machine did not meet my expectations.1) I could not get the machine to start slowly. It went at full speed or no speed. 2)No matter how I adjusted the tension knob, the fabric puckered (according to the trouble-shooting guide, I was doing everything right--right fabric with the right thread, etc).I have used two other machines in the past and I never had any trouble sewing a decent line. I returned this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for quilting, tension issues","review":"Got this machine as a gift. My first project went really well, a couple of denim bags. My second project, a quilt, went well through initial piecing. But when I started to combine the pieces, the machine had issues feeding through the layered seems. I would have to pull the pieces. So I got the even feed foot, which helped some. I did get it all pieced together, then I started to try and quilt. It's been a real struggle. I can't keep a constant tension. I would test it on a sample, start quilting, and then have to pull out an entire line due to bad tension. Test, quilt, success, quilt, fail, rip out, and repeat.I would recommend this for two layer, maybe three at most and not for very thick fabrics. I absolutely would not suggest for quilting. I'm in the market looking for an upgrade as I really enjoyed piecing together this quilt and I refuse to let the tension problem on this machine to cloud my enthusiasm for sewing.hope this helps someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"Bought this machine for my youngest daughter as her \\"first\\" sewing machine. Worked well the first 7 or 8 times she used it. Since then the tension is erratic, it doesn't feed evenly, it breaks bobbin threads right and left. After fussing with it for hours on end, and having NOTHING work right on it, I threw it out and let her use my Pfaff until she saved enough to buy herself a new Singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Horrible Bobbin System I've Ever Seen","review":"I am new to sewing, but not completely ignorant, so I thought this machine would be a good starter machine after my old Singer bit it. I was completely wrong.The speed goes full or nothing; there is no slow stitching. And the bobbin! I have never seen such a convoluted bobbin system in my life. Save yourself the trouble and just buy something else. This machine will make you want to break it, then you can't get your money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I just bought this machine when my older model finally gave up. I've had good results with my older Brother model, so I just assumed this would be just as good. It made it about five times before it decided to self adjust the upper tension in the middle of a stitch. It has also decided to switch from zigzag to straight back to zigzag in the middle of a project. I'm taking this machine back and getting my money back. I'm severely disappointed with the quality of this machine! I guess I'm going to try my luck with a Singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"This sewing machine is easy to use for a beginners like me.I am so glad I bought this machine. It is such a wonderful machine .it makes me want to sew more.I ordered this sewing machine thinking that it would only be good for small projects and quick fixes.The machine is perfect for alteration and works great.This is NOT a heavy duty sewing machine and it's easy to move it. i love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off to a rocky start","review":"I JUST got this machine today and was so excited! I finally bought my own sewing machine. I took it out of the box, went to thread the bobbin and the machine worked for a split second and then nothing. I think the foot control is bad. The machine has power, I have re-read the instructions a hundred times, turned it off and on, tried everything I can think of and it still wont work. Am I doing something wrong??? I am a beginner but have used a sewing machine enough to know the basics and can read and follow directions. Is there a trick that I am missing? I didn't even get to try one stitch! I am really disappointed and am now skeptical of this model in general. I hope it's just something I am doing wrong and not the actual machine. Boo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short thread Spindle solved","review":"This machine has a short spindle for the large spools of thread. Solved the problem with a drinking straw. Cut it just taller than the large spool of thread and put over the short spindle- voila problem solved. The rest of the machine is great for basic sewing- easy to use-thread- and fill bobbin. I will say as I am older Iuse a threader (the little metal gizmo with wire loop) but for the price of this machine it has many extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for novice!","review":"I have never sewn. This was an impulse buy during black friday. With a minimum of instruction from my hubby who actually had Home Ec. way back when, I have sewn a dog coat and doll dress. It is really easy and loads of fun. The other reviews saying it has only one speed are not using the foot pedal properly. It is just like the gas pedal in your car. Push a little go slow, floor it and you go fast! I love this machine. It seems sturdy and also forgiving of my rookie mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhgg...","review":"I have one of these and it STINKS. Its bobbin thread is never the right tension and I can only sew with cotton fabrics. The needle will unthread its self easily and it doesn't do long seams well.

Thinking I'd start sewing lessons with my grandkids I bought this little machine for simple sewing practice but I shortly discovered that it's too difficult and frustrating for even me who's sewn for over 60 years. The foot pedal take a strong pressure to start and causes the machine to take off galloping... there's no way to sew slowly. It's loud, noisy. The hand wheel takes quite a bit of strength to turn by hand. The only thing good I found about it is that it's attractive and all the parts were in the box. But for simple sewing, forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"sewing machine","review":"To begin, I am an amateur at sewing. The last complicated thing I made was in Home Ec in high school, a really long time ago. I needed an inexpensive sewing machine for little things, like making my dog a new bed. Turns out I could replace a broken zipper in my husband's favorite jacket too. Saved me the expense of having an alteration shop do it. This sewing machine is great! The comments about the instructions being unclear aren't true. The manuel is written in English and easy to understand, although there are other language sections. It's light, easily portable in it's box.(I didn't buy a carrying case.) The various foot attachments are easy to use. You get enough bobbins to get started. For the price, I couldn't be happier. Who knows what I can sew now that I have a machine that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"super cheap and fantastic","review":"I like this sewing machine a lot. I have made several shirts, several dresses and one quilt with it. The only thing I would change about it is the fact that it has no built in thread cutter on the side for when your done sewing and wish to cut the threads off without using scissors. I got accustomed to using one with my last sewing machine and have become lazy.....haha otherwise works fantastic. I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basic machine","review":"This is a great basic beginning machine. It is easy to use and to set up.

I gave it four stars because there is one unsatisfactory feature, the plastic handle that controls the presser lever. It feels weak, as if itwouldn't take much force to break it. Brother 2125i is good for someonewho doesn't sew too much. I use it, at most, for half an hour at a time.Brother describes it as a machine for mending and sewing. Making abuttonhole is a four step process, I have not tried it. I went through all the basic zig zag and straight stitches and all stitches were satisfactory.[...]A sewing machine is a mechanical device, I oiled it as soon as I received it.It is lightweight, and I wanted something I could easily put on a table.The 2125i is good for someone like myself who just wants to do a littlelight sewing or for someone new to sewing machines and not ready toinvest in a heavy duty one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner machine!","review":"My mom bought me this machine.

I would recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sewing machine for learning to sew","review":"I got this machine to help my 7 year old daughter learn to sew. It has been a great machine. The ability to control the machine at very slow speeds is not great. It tends to hum and then race forward. It isn't a problem for me, the parent, but my daughter lacks the control to deal with the faster speed. The controls are simple and only what is essential. The variety of stitches is just what she needs. It is easy to set up and thread. I haven't used the buttonholer yet and I noticed some machines use a \\"one step\\" buttonholer. I don't think the 4 steps this machine uses will be a problem, but if you plan to make a lot of buttonholes, this might be a consideration. We are very satisfied with this machine especially considering the reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"I am so glad that I purchased this machine.

There is only one speed, and it is very difficult and slow to start stitching; you have to really push down on the foot pedal to get it going, then when it does finally start stitching it takes off really fast.

I worked for Levi years ago and know how to sew. I will say I am very disappointed with this machine. I have had it apart at least 3 times every time I sit down to sew. It is VERY easy to misthread the very first step which throws everything off from the beginning. If you take that cover off to clean out broken threads you MUST put it back on before rethreading and sewing, otherwise the thread is behind where it is not suppose to be. I had to stop and clean out broken threads from the very first time I used it. I may be sending this machine back.!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a while but not good for the long run","review":"I would not buy bar soaps anymore after this mess but overall worked well for a while.

The dust created is surprisingly bountiful.--Always mask off indoor areas and ventilate. (The dust gets EVERYWHERE.)--Consider wearing a hat, bandana or other headcovering for all that dust. Maybe long sleeves too. Your arms will get coated as well.--Finished sanding? **Always** remove the spent or partially spent sandpaper from the rotator immediately. Why?

The screen has an excellent resolution - sharp and crisp. The backlighting is terrific for low light conditions. Syncing it to your desktop is as easy as pushing a single button. This unit comes with a Hot Sync cable that plugs in the bottom of the Palm (recessed and out of the way for carrying it around) and the Hot Sync button is on the cable.I would recommend this for anyone who is interested in getting into Palms but does not want to fork out big bucks to get started."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good basic tool","review":"For the money, this is a great deal, especially if you're not a person who's going to have 50,000 address entries, write a lot of email on their Palm, download War and Peace on it, or for any other reason need 8MB of memory.

Yes the clock is cool, but face it, for about the same price you can get a Handspring Visor, with FULL functuality with a springboard slot!!!! The Palm feels good in the hand, but it ends their. Please trust me on this, Ibought a M100 and I uste my Visor way way way more. It's hard to read text, because it's so small! And for a clock I have a watch. And the faceplates are garbage. They just make the screen deeper set into the device. You will want a visor, or at least a Palm IIIe"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like my PalmPilot!!!","review":"This has relieved me from hoisting around a really nice but heavy leather daytimer (my chiropractor approves!) I am completely thrilled with being organized and connected with my computer. To make one entry is heaven after years of having to maintain duplicate address book entries and calendar info. To have all the information sync'd is just the best! Wish I had this years ago when I was coordinating the parenting of multiple children and multi-tasking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as Handspring's Visor","review":"I tried the m100 and have to say I was disappointed. It has a very small plastic screen, flimsy, toy-like body and no expandability at all. It's also not Mac-compatible out of the box. I ended up getting Handspring's Visor Solo for the same price and am much happier (plus, it fixes all the problems mentioned above)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"People have been saying hey did you hear that palm makes a cheap reliable palm? The awnser should be, oh yeah i had a M100 but it [stinks]. This palm has no features, and it frequently crashes. I got the M100 just so I could keep track of my High School homework assignments. Boy was I wrong! Spend the extra [money] get a M105.UPDATE SEPTEMBER 13 2001Today I was writing down my homework and it performed a hard reset. Lost all my homework. Now will not turn off.Looking into buying a new PDA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many problems","review":"I have the 105 w/8mb memory but it's the same pda otherwise. The good stuff is the size and easy to carry around. The bad stuff is that you must use a serial port (the usb kit rarely works and is major trouble). My pda has to reset whenever you change the batteries so I must do this next to my computer to re-synch. If you can get it for cheap, it does the basic job. Make sure your pc has a serial port to sync, many newer pc's do not. Also, downloading software updates from Palm is a crapshoot since many dll's did not download. Support via email does not resolve problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adequate","review":"Good points:It does everything that you might expect from such a device.It rarely crashes (only when you install buggy software).It has enough memory to run numerous applications.It even runs Java, Python, etc. programming languages.Bad points:With a wallet in one pocket and a phone in the other, where are you expected to put the M100???Where is the free development software that you can find for similar devices?Overall, I'm happy with my M100. If only I had an extra pocket..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple is good","review":"As a recent retiree, I still like to use the bells and whistles of technology. However, I don't need all the features of the more upscale PDA's.Consider that the M100 is heavily discounted, in a market where technology changes quickly. Or, spend more and get more, especially if you need to use for business.Great for the non-business user!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old but good","review":"I got this Palm for Christmas 2001 instead of the usual slew of calendars I had received in previous years. Since then it has been reliable and has been a good basic organizer.Some have complained of battery life problems. While this does seem to drain batteries, I've found that using rechargables is the best option. Turning the backlight on causes a lot of strain as well. This should be synched with the computer whenever possible just in case a data loss does occur. These Palms came with a serial connector dock. USB adapters are available for it, and are mandatory for use with a Mac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the battery changing hassle","review":"Even for the cheap price, this is not worth the hassle. The batteries die quickly without any warning, thus losing any information loaded into it before getting a chance to hot sync with your PC. There are many other used products on the market a lot better than this one. Save your money and future headaches!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Device","review":"I had never seen the need for such a device until I was given one. Now, I can't get along without it. I love my m100. It synchs with my Outlook software so I can carry about my contacts as well as my To Do notes and much more. It has games to keep me occupied on the bus and trains and planes. It has the ability to beam cards, notes, and even applications between units. Amazing little helper! I definitely recommend it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, simple, and functional","review":"I just got my Palm m100 from Amazon yesterday, and within minutes I had it up and running, was entering text in Graffiti, and performed my first Hot Sync. The Palm 3.5 OS strikes a perfect balance between simplicity and functionality. Unlike the PocketPC platform, Palms don't try to do too much, and that's what helps them excel.The m100 is light, rugged, attractive, and comfortable to hold. The screen is smaller than other Palms, but quite sharp. I'm looking forward to getting one of the colored faceplates. My only complaints: the flip cover doesn't snap into place, and it requires a USB adapter to connect to my G3 PowerMac. C'mon Palm--in this day and age, USB should be the standard connector.Other than these small complaints, the m100 is a great value. Buy it if you've been toying with the idea of getting a Palm but don't want to spend too much and don't want something that looks clunky (like a Visor). You'll be surprised how much you can do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"with i the first 5 minutes of use this product had a fatil error the preons saling this item said it worked perfectly i never tried to return it i just took it as a loss and will not buy anything used on amazon.com unless it' a book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for glitches - poor Palm customer support","review":"The negative experience I've had with Palm's tech \\"support\\" has really tainted my overall experience with the m100. There are a number of glitches with my unit that no one in customer care was able to resolve, and tech support is only available via e-mail (e-mail, for a tech problem!?). Its sad that Palm's dominant market share has enabled them to be so lax when it comes to customer support. Order the m100 only if you're sure you'll never need to use their tech assistance dept. Also, keep in mind that the m100 doesn't come with e-mail synchronization software; you have to buy that separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners...","review":"Great for people who are just learning how to operate technologically advanced things. The only drawback is that it is not color."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is more practical than an iPAQ","review":"I have been around Palm for a long time. I started out with a Palm Personal (97ish), then I upgraded that to a Palm Professional, then I got a Palm III, then I won a Palm VII, but sold it brand new for a Visor Handspring Prism (Color), but then sold that for a Compaq iPAQ, and then sold that after about 3 months and bought a simple old Palm m100. I guess I thought having the latest and greatest is better but soon realized that having a $550 Pocket Toy wasn't that necessary. After having the iPAQ for about 3 months I used it less and less. It was cool playing full color games and stuff but it just wasn't worth the money. So the moral of this review is make sure that if you spend a lot of money on a Palm that you're going to use it. The Palm m100 suits my needs very well. Has my schedule, contacts, and memos which is all I really need outside of the home or office."},{"rating":"2","title":"M100 a great deal for great organization","review":"The M100 is a great PDA for the money. Just much of the same as a Palm Vx, and has some new features even the Palm Vx doesn't have (the little windo in the cover to see the clock). Easy to set up, easy to use, this little Palm is my new best friend. The only problem I had was that it froze up on my first hotsync, but doing fine now."},{"rating":"1","title":"expense tracking","review":"Be warned that this version does not have expense tracking - one of the basic functions that many people (especially repeat Palm customers) expect to find on their handheld. And it is not easy to find 3rd party software that has down-loadable expense tracking software (at least I haven't found it yet).What were these people thinking? Or were they?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery replacement causes complete data loss","review":"I was happy with this PDA until recently. Now changing battery always causes data loss. Manual says to replace battery within 1 mintue. I replace it instantly (5 seconds - I timed it , have to do jugglery!). Even then total data loss and have to resync everytime which is a big headache. Someone suggested having to supply the battery holder with voltage thru another battery pack while changing the battery. While that would work, that is a clumsy workaround and you have to be techie kinds. Even though I am techie kind, I do not like that approach. Palm should have thought about this reliability issue with this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted only a year","review":"After only a year of use the screen went haywire and did not recognize stylus properly. Could not fix it even with on-line tech support. They wanted [$$$]. to send it back and then additional cost to fix it. Liked it until it failed - Needed more memory for additional applications I wanted to add. Can't live without a PDA now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Palm m100 Handheld","review":"I must tell you, I was not a big fan of Palm at first. But I happened to get a gift certificate to Amazon, so I spent it on my Palm, not buying it for any particular purpose. When I got it, I realized how much can be done on such a small thing. My life is completely organized on that thing. I write down all my homework assignments (I am a student), my class notes, important events, and I even get CNN, the Sporting News and much more using the HotSync. The Palm itself is well made and very durable, and has many accesories that are worth getting. I myself got the slim leather carrying case and the keyboard, which I use to great extent. I would advise every student and people who love to get things well layed out and organized to get one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought mine from someone who upgraded. It was working perfectly for him, but he never commented on what happens when the batteries die. I travel a lot and can't have this problem, but when I get the notification that the batteries are low, even if I replace them within the minute recommended, I lose everything. Also, the graffiti is almost impossible to use and the typing with a stylus is cumbersome also. I've gone back to my Coach date and address book that I wanted to shed because of space and weight when traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned it","review":"i wanted this device to work and it did have the potential...positive was the ease of interfacing with my mac. big problem was imputing data either via the touch screen(non-responsive or incorrect response)or character recognition. backlighting was also very poor. would try another model if these problems were solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Palm m100","review":"this is a piece of [junk]. it messed up with the stylus. whenever I clicked a button at the bottom, it didn't respond.

With the Handspring Visor you can buy a 2-8 meg expansion module that plugs into the springboard slot.

This wonderful little handheld is PERFECT! It keeps addresses close at hand for last minute birthday/anniversary cards, reminds me of the kids' sports practices/parties, doctor/dentist appointments, and helps me remember my class and work schedules. I can't say enough great things about my Palm m100. It was definitely worth the purchase price. I also bought the leather carrying case which is great for keeping my Palm safe in my purse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off to a good start","review":"This was my first hand held; it was received as a gift and at first I was not impressed. My 105 was not responding to the stylis commands and seemed to be a total waste. But with one call to Palm's Customer Service center I had a replacement unit within just a few days. For my purposes such as names and addresses,calendar, To Do lists and Notes it's great. I've already replaced my hardcopy calendar and Agenda with the 105. Considering what you're going to use the hand held for, the basic 105 is prefect (why spend a ton extra for stuff you my nor use) but if you need a more expansive unit you'll need something more advanced than the 105. I have to say there are still some Graffiti characters to which it doesn't respond, but overall I have to give it high marks for it's fuctionality and basic value."},{"rating":"1","title":"A trial PDA . . .

But . . . after just 8 months of owning it, I could not tap the screen. I had to email the company to find out how to fix it. Their solution was to do a soft reset once a week.Two months later I decided I wanted to enter data via the PC and print a calendar for my husband. The connection was bad everytime, it was the software. The software was in working order when I first bought it.For my time and effort it was not worth it.

It includes lots of stuff, and the price is right, but most of the stuff is unlistenably bad. Nearly all the songs by the better known bands, such as Sham 69, Blitz, The Business, etc. are crudely recorded live versions. Even some of the studio recordings seem to be demo versions, or in any case different versions than I remember from the original albums, and generally sound muddy and bad. Also, there seems to have been no effort made to digitally remaster the original sources, so the whole CD sounds muffled."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story that Compels You to Examine Yourself","review":"William Bernhardt is one of the few authors who always makes me think about myself, my values, my understanding of the world, and then makes me a better person in the process of revealing truth through his outstanding fiction. This is true of his latest novel,Murder One, which does a terrific job of forcing anyone who thinks he or she is world-wise and a good critical thinker to think again, and observe again, and discover that reality is far different from what we thought. I reserve the last star only because I would have liked more of his subtle, ironic humor. I know of no other serious author who can make me laugh on one page and cry on the next. (The first book of his I read, I laughed out loud in my office several times and had my coworkers thinking I had gone off the deep end.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I had added Bernhardt to my list of must-read authors after his previous Kincaid/McCall, et al, books. I love nothing better than rich, recurring characters. I got to page 77 of Murder One before deciding to return the book. I'm so exhausted by stretching my understanding of reality, I don't have the energy to care what happens to these people."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I've read all of Bernhardt's other books and enjoyed them; I was pretty sure the wonderful recurring characters were going to induce me to add him to my lengthy list of must-read authors. I got through the Prologue and a few chapters of Murder One and have decided to return the book. I realize that, as in movies, it's necessary to suspend certain belief systems, and I'm willing to do that to a point, but this is way over the top. Totally unbelievable. I don't care what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable story!","review":"Wow, what a disappointing read. This is the first Berhardt book I have ever read, and at this point, I'm thinking, the last (perhaps after the stench of this one wears off, I'll give him another try). The story was completely unbelievable. A lot of the details seemed to have been described over and over (ie, the \\"cat fights\\", the mutilated body). It was almost as if the author didn't have enough material to make the book long enough, so he had to keep repeating himself. Also, I'm certainly an open minded person, but I had a real problem with a successful attorney getting involved with a nineteen year old...I mean, come on. And finally...the ending; I won't spoil it for those who might want to give this book a try, but the ending was SO ridiculous! I felt like I was reading one of those fantasy stories you might find in the back of a porn mag!

So I consider myself lucky to have bought this as a gift for my sister. It isn't cheap - but it isn't WalMart crap either. I was actually surprised how rugged it felt. If they had one like this in a man's design I am sure I would buy myself one. I never give any item a full 5-Star rating - since I've never had one to compare with. So I will give this a definite YES with my 4-Stars. And if you buy one as a gift or for yourself - you will definitely be getting your money's worth with this one.

Unfortunately, the included license number doesn't work for NT, despite what it says in the book. I called to obtain a working license number, and was offered one for an additional $249! Because I could not install and run the software, the contents of the book itself is of no relevance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning account of life at sea!","review":"This book was a nerve-wracking rollick through the seas. The writing evoked both fear and seasicksickness as the seas became rougher! It spoke deeply of the quiet hurt of fishermen's wives, the devotion fisherman have to each other, their boats and the ocean, and the ever-present dangers of the sea-faring life. The author used an interesting technique whereby he had two stories going at once--the present going backward and the past going forward. It worked and neither narrative detracted from the other. There were some places in the narrative which needed to be reread in order to be more clearly understood. In addition, there were a few technical words relating to fishing and boating which might have interfered with the reading pleasure of someone not as knowledgeable about maritime life. Nevertheless, this was a story well told and worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"a story for those who love and fear the sea","review":"having grown up and fished half moon bay with my father in the same era as neil, i realize something has changed in the way fathers and sons communicate. to me this is a book about the non verbal glue that holds men together. the only book i can remember reading twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking...","review":"Michael Koepf has done an amazing job.

It takes a good throwing arm and it needs to be adjusted just right to get it to fly properly. It also helps if it hot out since it doesn't fly well in the winter. The plane is very well made and has a high-quality feel to it. It's a good tool to get fathers and sons to play together.

I did it a couple of times, but there's just no reason to go back to it. Believe it or not, workouts don't have to be boring or painful. Zumba is a great cardio workout and incredible fun. Ripped is a really effective weight workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!","review":"It's an excellent DVD. I just bought it, but have been using it I got a copy from Netflix after reading all the great reviews about this DVD. It's wonderful I consider myself to be Inter/Advanced in my workouts and this workout really kick my butt. For now I can only use 5 & 8lbs weights.The time goes by quick and when you are done it's amazing how many calories you have burned. I have a heart rate watch and monitor and i am on my fat burning zone the entire time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME VARIETY OF SCULPTING EXERCISES","review":"I LOVE this dvd because there are so many different circuits included within the workout. Even if you don't have time to commit to the whole 40 min routine you can just do 1 or 2 circuits and still get a sweat session in. I love the circuit set-up and the non-stop twisting/turning/lifting/lunging keeps the heart rate up = calories burned! I've done the whole workout multiple times and I'm still seeing results. I used to workout 5 or 6 days a week with my guy friend and got in pretty decent shape, doing a different body area each day and was ALWAYS sore after those sessions. Now that we live in separate cities, this dvd is definitely an adequate replacement workout. This was definitely worth spending the 10 bucks... I know I'll be turning to it alot in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty workout but blab! blab! blab! and horrid \\"music\\"","review":"This DVD will definitely give your muscles a great workout and will probably work really well if used consistently--if you can stand Jillian's relentless chatter--never stops talking!--and the absolutely wretched \\"music\\" used in the background. If she could stop talking long enough to count her reps and give a little intro on what's going to happen next this would really improve this DVD. The point is to get a good work out but if you can't stand listening to her yabber on and on over the truly, truly awful \\"music\\" the DVD will stay out of your player. I have to work out to this on mute it's so annoying. Still--the workout is great although some moves are pretty hard on your back."},{"rating":"2","title":"i'm obssessed with jillian!","review":"This workout video is the best. This video is proof that you do not need a gym membership or more than 3 lb weights to get in shape. Even my boyfriend will do it with me. Jillian really works you out and she is very motivating. I love her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"This workout tape is all I imagined and more...worth every penny and more. Its like Jillian is in my living room with me. The Biggest Looser in your home. BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUT OF SHAPE AND OVERWEIGHT","review":"I am out of shape, 2 weeks ago I started using this dvd after doing my yoga dvd for inflexible people. I can not do the full circuit which is approx 50 minutes. This dvd allows you to pick the circuit you want to do or do the full circuit (OUCH!!). Since I am OOS (out of shape), I started with the warm up circuit one day, then the next day I did the next circuit and so on. Yes it hurts, but here I am on the 3rd week and I am doing 2 circuits a day. I feel and see my body toning up. I just gradually do what I can do everyday. Some of the circuits hurt so I either modify it to make it easier for me or I slow it down a bit until I can actually do it. Once you get over the soreness, your body will began to thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Time Favorite Workout!","review":"I have a good size stack of exercise dvds and this one is my absolute favorite. It literally targets every trouble zone. It brings your heart rate up and down which is supposed to be the best for burning fat. Jillian is also very easy to follow and there are no fancy steps or moves to get lost in unlike so many other dvds I have. This one is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Workout DVD","review":"I bought this DVD over two years ago, and I still do this workout twice a week.

I HAVE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"That Whole Fat and Muscle Thing","review":"So, I was always skeptical of people who said not to pay too much attention to weight, especially when you start weight training. I bought this video to help me get back into shape (3 years) after having my second child. When I started, I was 40 lbs overweight. I wanted to lose that 40 lbs to get back into my regular wardrobe. I've been doing NMTZ for two months, and I've lost 20 lbs so far. Not at goal weight. HOWEVER! Last week, I decided to try on my old clothes just because I was feeling good about my progress. Wouldn't you know, they fit! Comfortably! I couldn't believe it. I hate Jillian every morning I do this video, but I love her for giving me my body back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how you lose 35#!!!","review":"I will keep this short and sweet. I got this DVD over a year ago, and I do this particular DVD 2 x week, along with Fat Blast Boost Metabolism and 30 day shred (Jillian's other videos) and in the past year I've lost 35#!!! Was a size 14 last year, now a 4/6!!! This by far is my favorite video!!! Gives you a great workout, works all muscle groups, you're pouring sweat afterward, but it's not too difficult. Trust me, you can do it! It gets great results! I would give it more stars if I could. I love it way more than 30 day shred!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No nonsense Jillian","review":"Jillian is one of my favorite instructors, she does the tried and true.

She kicks my but. And not in a girly \\"you can do it\\" way. In a \\"get of your but and let's go- if you want to look good\\" way. I love her dvds! Her 20 min one is the bomb too for when you are pressed for time. I totaly trust her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Workout Video","review":"Jillian Michaels is an unbelievable trainer.This video is the most intense workout i have ever done. I have done every workout video out there and this is the best. This beats any taebo, the Firm, etc. I have already gone down a pant size after 3 weeks of doing this and the \\"Boost Your Metabloism\\" videos. Best workout ever and the results come quickly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Jillian workout!","review":"Having recently graduated from Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred, which I loved, I was looking for something else challenging but not boring! I achieved AMAZING results from the Shred and recommended it to many people. I read many reviews before buying \\"No More Trouble Zones\\" and most of them were right on!The exercises are mostly different from the Shred so you won't get bored and it has a little bit of a lower key feel to it. I thought maybe I wouldn't feel much soreness as I am in better shape because of \\"Shredding\\" all summer but that wasn't true!Jillian's exercises once again work to deliver her \\"big promises\\" that she will change your body! I am really glad I invested in another one of her videos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, butt-kicking workout!!!","review":"I purchased this along with Banish Fat and 30 Day Shred. This workout is an excellent, tough, but effective routine. I would not recommend for beginners, just starting to workout with Jillian. The routines are high intensity, you will be sweating and breathing hard!!! I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser and with some of the routines, I am out of breath and need to scale down my pace. I do this routine 3 x a week along with Banish Fat the other 3 days. 30 Day shred I do in the evenings because it is only 27 minutes long. Happy Exercising!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult for beginners","review":"I have had this dvd for like a year and tried it twice. I got through it the first time but couldn't complete all of the sets without stopping for breaks. I tried again and it was just too hard and boring. I may try yet again since it's been a long time but I wish there was a workout that was FUN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"for the advanced","review":"way way too hard for the beginner or the one getting back into the game.made me cuss alot!recommend Butt Bible by Pauline Nordine.you get 3 workouts each harder than the other,you start out pretty easy but it gets harder.i have seen results on me and i havent done it everyday or anywhere near everyday.i am on the 3rd workout and it is a doozy.Pauline is easy to listen to not too perky even funny at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a boring workout","review":"Ugh. I've never done any Jillian Michaels workouts before, but I must be honest... I expected a lot more. I could've made up this workout on my own. It's like a routine I found in a magazine and did in college. Why do I need a video for that? Boring, boring, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"Tried it out twice, but it's not what I'm looking for. It's not my style. Dont get me wrong, it does burn calories. I like another workout routine from her. Unfortunately, I can't find it and I don't know the title. Time to move on to Plan B - going to try out CrossFit with my husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK workout","review":"This is a good workout, but I am used to lifting heavy weights and was looking for something to use in place of that for variety. This dvd gets your heart rate up, which is great, but it's hard to lift heavier weights with this program. She uses 3 pounds for working the biceps--I could not even feel it in my arms so I used 5 pounds which was a little better but still did not get that soreness that you normally do the next day that lets you know you actually did something. This is a great dvd if you are not looking to increase your muscle mass but to burn calories and tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I'm totally team Jillian after purchasing and using this dvd. She motivates you and pushes you through the workout! The exercises are great: not too tough but not easy. I've noticed great changes in my body and I'm happy about that. Thanks Jillian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"This dvd really kicked my butt. It is a very good and effective work out dvd. I would highly recommend it to anyone who uses exercise dvds. I have worked out for years using exercise dvds. I have used many different types and styles of dvds. I plan on purchasing more of her dvds. This dvd gives you a very effective and not to time consuming workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great exerice video","review":"Jillian Michaels: No More Trouble Zones is an excellent exercise DVD. One of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifestyle changes","review":"Great DVD!! People can keep up with these tough, but effective work outs. I began exercising at my own pace and didn't feel as if I didn't get anything out of the work outs. I have lost 4lbs. in 1 1/2 weeks, working out every other day, and being more conscientious of what I put into my mouth. I think Jillian motivates and encourages her self and me through the work outs."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st time","review":"I rented this on Netflix and chose my circuits. I think I did all of them except 2. I notice if I choose circuits and not go straight through..that it's not as good of a workout. I vacuumed afterwards and can tell my butt is tight. I'll try all the way through next time. I'm sure it'll be harder then. 2nd night: 15 minutes into the workout I was pouring sweat. Going straight through and having 3 pound weights instead of 1 lb soup cans makes a difference. Even after the first workout I saw definition in my triceps and glutes and after the 2nd time of doing this, even more definition. I skipped the abs tonight because they are still a little sore from last night. Love Jillian! I now own 3 of her workout dvds."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"Jillian is a BEAST!! and I mean that in the MOST respectful way. She knows fitness like nobody's business. Listen to her, modify where you have to ...stay consistent and eat a sensible diet...keep your water intake high all day every day and YOU WILL GET RESULTS!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ho-ly Crap!","review":"I have a few dozen workout DVD's, everything from the The Firm to Taebo, and this DVD trumps them all. Don't get me wrong here, it will kick your butt but man do you know you are getting a great workout. You will feel it of course the next day but not just because you are sore. you feel it because it is already working. the next day after I used the first time, I felt stronger and already a little more confident even though I know that it will take more then once to get to my goals. I can't say enough about this workout and Jillian is a great instructor. There are no confusing dance moves or choreography, just a no nonsense tough workout that takes you back to those Buns of Steel days because of all the floor work. But even Jillian said those moves are old school but very effective and she is absolutley correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT strength workout","review":"I did this DVD yesterday and today my quads and triceps are BURNING. It doesn't incorporate much cardio at all (so I did Jillian's other DVD Banish Fat Boost Metabolism today as it is all cardio based) but it is a great full body strength workout and I will definitely be using it often. If you're looking for just one DVD to give you strength and cardio I'd look into 30 Day Shred instead but what I prefer about this DVD (and it's companion, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism) is that they're longer (45 minutes each) and give you more of a challenge as they don't have as many beginner modifications as 30 Day Shred does so you don't have the option of 'phoning it in' as Jillian would say. Bottom line: great DVD and great price. Just order it, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Jillian Michaels DVD","review":"Wow. I just did this for the first time last night, and I can tell it's really going to be a great workout. From just a few minutes of work, the insides and outsides of my thighs are S.O.R.E.! I love that she keeps you moving the whole time. There are a couple great ab circuits, and a lot of work for your triceps, quads & butt. I also did the 30 Day Shred, and dropped a size with that, and I can already tell that I'm going to like this one even better than the Shred."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD kicked my butt and it was awesome!","review":"I will admit that I am not in the best shape so I knew that when I purchased this DVD it would be a challenge. Not only was No More Trouble Zones a challenge, I could only get through 25 min of it! This DVD is great because even if you don't get all the way though it you still feel like you accomplished something and it makes you want to put it back in again tomorrow and see if you can get further through the workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I've done a lot of workout DVDs and Jillian Michaels' are by far my favorites. I don't need to lose a lot, maybe another 7-10 lbs, but really wanted to tone up. I started with her 30 Day Shred and just received her No More Trouble Zones, which I did for the first time yesterday. OMG! I have NEVER felt the effects of a workout like this, and I LOVE it. My obliques are even sore, which is so reassuring that I've actually worked them! I was dripping sweat by the end. I can't wait to do it again!! And I am excited to see how I'll look and feel in a few weeks. HELLO SUMMER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH hurt my low back","review":"I found out the hard way this program includes exercises not recommended by docs and physical therapists. You will hurt your back eventually, even if you are moderately fit and not overweight. This would be awesome if Michaels would take out or modify the dangerous moves like fully bending over with straight legs, and legs lifted doing windshield wipers and scissors. Also, superman is so much better for the back if modified. The warm up is inadequate too. I am so disappointed because now instead of working out I have to rest my low back until my overstretched muscles heal. What's the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pounds Shed!!","review":"This video is awesome. I used a firiends and needed to have my own, the trainer keeps you so motivated you want to keep up the great work. the best part about it, is you start to see the change and it's real nice I am told constantly.. try it, it works. I would not write a review and waste my time if I didn't experience it first hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome workout!","review":"I thought that I was in pretty good shape, but after trying to do this DVD, I am finding that I'm not. I am about to DIE after doing the warmup and 2-3 zones. I am planning on working up to doing the whole workout. I am using 5lb weights instead of the 3lb weights (that might be the problem). I think I will invest in the 3lb weights and see how far I get :) So far, I have done the workout twice, and feel like I kicked my own arse both times! You can really feel the areas you are working. I can't wait to be able to complete the whole video, I am sure I won't be disappointed in the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"I've been using this DVD for over a month now (usually 1-2 times a week) and I still feel the workout the next day.At first it was tough to complete the entire workout and for a person who is use to working out often there are still some parts/reps on the DVD I can barely push through.Jillian is great focusing on all areas of your body and I have noticed my arms getting toned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No fun","review":"If you have bad knee, you would not like it. It is bored, not fun, hard to keep going, disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"very tough","review":"I work out 6 days a week and was getting bored with my routine. I decided to give this dvd a try and see what Jillian Michaels was all about. OMG, this is tough. There are no breaks to rest and she works each muscle, exhausting it rather than alternate moves. It's been 2 days and I am still very sore. You will love it, give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Workout","review":"I was in pretty good shape before using this video, but after my second baby, and nearing 40, I couldn't lose this belly \\"mush\\". I used this regularly alternating it with cardio days, and it really kicked my butt - literally and figuratively. I thought I was strong before, but it really pushed me to the next level! Thanks Jillian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"This video is very effective. Jillian is tough, but encouraging, and has lots of good ideas for abs, thighs, buns, arms, and back that I will continue to use at the gym as well as in my home. For $10, this dvd is a great deal. You can either do the entire workout, about 50 minutes long, that includes warm-up and cool down, or choose a certain part of the workout to do, based on which part of your body you want to work on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Hard","review":"Super tough, all strength training workout.

Then you can ease into this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a keeper","review":"I'm not a gym kind of person, so I tend to have workout dvds at home.I've been doing some Firm dvds, which are good, but this one definitely gives those a run. I like it because the I can keep up with it, it's not that much cardio, and you really feel ur muscles working. I do have to admit that in a couple of circuits i let go of the 3 lbs. dumbells 'cause I can't handle it too much.Overall, I love this exercise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"This work out is good and you can mix and match the work out to what would be best for you.

This video is perfect, I love the whole thing, I felt like my abs were on fire.. I feel that this would be a great video for beginners and for more advanced athletes like myself. It was fun and the interval type workouts made it go by fast.I am a huge fan of \\"Biggest Looser\\" and Jillian does not let you down with this workout.."},{"rating":"2","title":"great advanced workout!","review":"I love this workout! Jillian is better than ever in this tough circuit training dvd. She uses light handweights ( I think three lbs )but I only have 5lbs so that's what I use and it is very effective. I like how she works the upperbody then lower in fast paced moves throughout all of the circuits. I also like how she works one side of the body at a time to really burn it out instead of alternating. Besides the super workout, she is very entertaining. If you're looking for an advanced strength training routine that will get results, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a fantastic buy!","review":"Like she says in the video, this workout is no joke but its totally doable.

Jillian sure does make you work in this one! This is one of my favorite workout dvd's, when you're done, you feel like everything is really worked! If you want to feel like you've had a great workout at home, I suggest you give this dvd a try :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This video provides one of the best strength training exercises you can do at home and without equipment. All three levels are challenging and are definitely worth the 22 minutes. Tried the level three for the first time this past week and believe me, it is hard. Will have to go back to level one and two for a bit longer to get strong enough to complete all the exercises in level three correctly. Since the workout is short, there should be no reason to get one in each day. I do mine every other day and then right afterwards I add at least 30 and most the time 45 minutes of straight cardio on the treadmill. The video definitely gets your heart pumping and enhances your cardio workout. Definitely a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sore all over!","review":"This was a great workout. I could feel that my heart rate was elevated and the next day I felt that I had worked out all my major muscles. Jillian delivers again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vicious and firming","review":"Jullian is the hardest, roughest trainer on TV. No one before or since will work you as hard as she can. This is a ROUGH work out. You do not know pain and suffering before you have been through one of her routines. How the other two gals behind her can keep their plastic smiles on their faces is beyond me. These work outs are weight based and they BURN unlike anything. You will be shaking by the time you get through it. And you WILL get results. This is about challenging yourself and moving in ways you never thought possible. The Surrender and the lunges with lateral shoulder raises are brutal, but you will see results almost immediately. Perhaps the best of the routines are the ones at the end, the old school mat work. It really burns but it simulates what you get when you do not have gym machines at your disposal."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word-AWSOME","review":"I love Jillian. This is a top notch workout sure to burn some major calories! Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workout!","review":"I love Jillian's no-nonsense approach to working out. She's always saying that she promises results and she does deliver. This entire workout focuses on strength training, yet her circuits get your heart rate up for some cardio as well. My husband has been working out with me and he is a total fan of hers now. A definite asset to any fitness dvd library!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough workout","review":"I like that you are given the option of doing the full, 40-minute workout or breaking it out into 5-minute circuits. She emphasizes proper form throughout the workout, minimizing risk of injury. Each circuit works multiple muscle groups, making for an efficient, effective workout. I recommend starting with very light weights until you are accustomed to the moves, so you can concentrate on form."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid workout!","review":"I own 30 day shred, Banish Fat/Boost Metabolism, Yoga Meltdown and this. I like this one the best. I love/hate Jillian throughout this DVD because she is pushing me to do things I wouldn't ever do on my own...it hurts so good. The very short rests are just enough to keep me going. When short on time I will do 30 Day Shred. This DVD is so cheap and SO WORTH BUYING!! My forearms were sweating!!! Wear a sweat band or you will drip sweat from your head for sure like I did...or workout in front of a fan.I love that she said 'do not erase what you did here today with eating poorly'. SO TRUE!!! I feel every trainer should say that with every workout DVD - no they should SCREAM IT. I have seen a personal trainer in the past and I have learned the hard way that 80% of being fit is WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR MOUTH. Please remember that!I am excited to see results from this DVD!('the surrender' is challenging but not so impossible like others make it sound. I find the plank moves more challenging.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I love Bodycombat and boot camp classes, and thought this would be easy for me... it was not! I felt challenged and felt my body being pushed. I think this is an excellent video and Jillian does a great job keeping you going!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this workout DVD","review":"This is a hard core workout that yields great results if you stick with it!You can expect to be tremendously sore the first time you do this work out, even if you are already in shape! That is one reason why it is so good!I also appreciate how you can work up from easier modifications of many of the exercises to the harder versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Title for the Workout","review":"I read great reviews and felt the greatness when I completed the workout. I loved the fact that she explains about each exercise the reason we are doing it, what we are working on and encourages through the screen. She has a legitimate smile and happiness, not camera shy to the point that the smile is plastered on. The routines are broken down into circuits which are 5 different moves repeated twice. They are not hard and yet you can make them more challenging or less, she lets you know how. I have earlier DVDs of hers and you can tell how much she has matured since then..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I am a die-hard Jillian Michaels fan. I have four of her DVD's and use them on a rotation basis (with some other videos thrown in on occassion). Her videos make you feel as though you want to die, but in the end, it's all worth it. By the end of the first month, these videos do not seem as hard as the first time around. This video is great because it not only gives a great cardio workout and everything else you expect from her videos, but it also specifically targets those areas that every girl wants to tone but has trouble doing (hence the name of the video!). I would definitely recommend this video to anyone who asks. But be warned- it's not for the faint of heart- it's for those that really want to make change happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"Jillian Michaels rocks! I am very pleased wth my purchase. Every mucsle is worked with this program. Jillian does not neglect anything. I have no regrets!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back with a vengeance","review":"Wow! if you have worked out with Jillian before, you will not be disappointed. If you haven't, get ready to rock and roll. Since her older DVD's like her 5 disc set, she has most definitely changed for the better. Her workout is harder than ever but her personality really has softened and matured. It feels comfortable like she is right there with you and you get through it. But be prepared to work hard. She truly is the toughest fitness guru!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Jillian Michaels Believer!","review":"My best friend and long time work out buddy got the 30 day Shred to help get us thru the winter blues of working out in Iowa during the winter. That jump started us to get No More Trouble Zones and 3 other DVD's to use this winter. No More Trouble Zones is super challenging, but doable! She encourages you thru it and kicks your butt at the same time. I feel real change in my body since starting to use it- more toned arms, lifted butt & tighter legs and my core is getting stronger by the day. I love Jillian; however, do appreciate the option to run the video without her commentary so after doing it for a while you can just listen to music. (I know you can put the TV on mute normally, but I think this option is great!). Also you can choose to do the whole video of skip around to the trouble zone section you want to focus on. If you are looking to tone up and lose fat, try this."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOUGH workout!!","review":"WOW!!! This workout is INTENSE to say the least! I own several of Jillian's DVDS, and in my opinion, this is one of the hardest. It truly is amazing though, I finished the entire workout feeling like I did an extremely great job of hitting my trouble zones. The DVD contains a warm up, 6 circuits targeting different areas, and a cool down. You also have an option to pick which circuits you specifically want to do if you do not have time or want to run through the whole DVD. My only complaint is she doesn't really give a whole lot of \\"beginner\\" modifications. There are certain things I could not do full out like all of them and would have really appreciated a modification. She does give a few, but not as many as in 30 Day Shred or Ripped in 30. Overall, this is a really great buy and I am excited to see the results. I plan on doing this DVD 2-3 times a week, switching between her other DVDS....love Jillian Michaels!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Ready to Sweat!","review":"This is an incredible workout. The circuits are quick and effective. Jillian is her usual self. \\"If you want results, you've got to do the work!\\" She mixes toughies in with less strenuous to catch your breath. My favorite is the warm up. The jumping jacks nearly killed me the first time!I like that there are individual circuits but wish I could pick 5 or six and customize a workout. Need to keep going back to menu to pick next circuit.Target had this DVD for $14.99 + tax. I \\"google goggled\\" it and presto, Amazon popped up with a nearly 1/2 price savings! Ordered in the store from my phone. Got it the next day. If only my sagging butt could be cured that fast! Lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michaels","review":"Great dvd! This is a serious workout for the whole body! After the first few times i was very sore. Prepare to sweat and work hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm addicted!","review":"I've never felt so energetic and strong after a workout as I do with Jillian's 'No more trouble zones'. I find myself wanting to get things done around the house for the rest of the day rather than sitting on the couch as I have so much more energy to burn. I get withdrawals if I haven't done this workout for more than a few days (I alternate with other DVD's). Mind you, I didn't exactly love it the first time I tried it as it HURT, but it's gotten easier and I'm ready to up my weights. I haven't changed my diet in anyway but still started noticing the difference within just a few workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"aidanmom","review":"I just finished doing this workout aproximately 2 hrs ago, and my legs and arms are still shaking.

I look forward to doing this tomorrow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"muscle tone","review":"This is the first fitness DVD I've bought, normally just do cardio in the gym. It has definitely helped with my muscle tone, created definition in my legs and arms, flattened my stomach. and I've only used it sporadically, sometimes one to three times a week for one or two months. I am going to be purchasing other Jillian DVDs, currently trying out Yoga Meltdown. Would definitely recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Moves, but High Intensity Workout","review":"This was my first ever Jillian Michaels purchase,and I have to say for the money, completely worth it. I try to be a runner and force myself to go for a 2-3 miles jog about 2 x a week, and I do yoga regularly, so I consider myself in shape, [...] It's difficult and intense. At first I didn't think I was going to get through it, but Jillian makes it go rather quickly, and I like the idea of the circuits. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I felt the cool down wasn't enough. My muscles needed to be stretched a lot more after the workout, so I just did it on my own, but I wish there was a little more stretching in it.In the past I have been a Tracy Anderson fan, but I just feel like her DVD's are way too esxpensive so I think I'm making the switch to Jillian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"Oh my god! This workout is awesome! I thought it was a long and boring video, like the ones that you just watch the clock and wish to be done soon, but not, this one is a 50 minute workout and you will exercise every muscle and every inch of your body, the time will go fast and next day you may feel sore but with lots of energy. I also feel stronger and I've noticed that my body is changing, I'm definitely happy with this product and I don't need a gym membership or a personal trainer when I have this one at home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i have never hurt so bad ever!!","review":"but that is a good thing.

I work out three to four times a week running and Pilates reformer classes and this workout kicked my butt! After the first night I was so sore I could barely make it up the stairs! Second day was much much better. I am on the 6th workout with interval training in between and I am not losing weight yet gaining muscle. Eat healthy, watch carb loads, and your body will definitely change with this high aerobic workout. I enjoy Jillian's low key style and she is really easy to keep up with...some days I have to end one circuit short! I hope the 30 day shred is just as fabulous!

It's difficult at first, but once your body gets used to it and if done on a regular basis you will really see results. I've been working out with this video for about 2 months, 4-5 times a week and the so-called trouble zones (arms, abs, butt, and thighs) are getting toned. Results are not instant like with any exercise, but I invite you to bring out a tape measure to see the difference after a couple of months. I partner this video with a morning/evening jog for about 20-30 minutes and a proper diet. I highly recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt Sick!","review":"A few things to start...1. I really like Jillian Michaels DVDs and 2. I am in good shape and work out 2 to 4 times a week and 3. I have a variety of workout DVDs and enjoy doing them as my primary means of exercise.This video was a good challenge and I enjoyed it up until about 35-40 minutes into it. It was at this point that I got this overwhelming feeling of nausea and had to stop and lay on the floor until it passed. This happened every time I did this video and ONLY this video. I tried everything, drank lots of water and ate something before working out and trying to stay hydrated during but nothing helped. I did some research and found that with constant raising and lowering of your heart rate (as happens in this video) it can induce nausea and isn't good for you. I passed on this one and will stick to her other DVDs because this one certainly isn't for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a Gut Buster","review":"I wanted an exercise DVD that would really get me in shape and this could be the one--if I were to use it more often. Unfortunately, I dread doing it because it is challenging so I put off using it more than every couple of weeks. Also, Jillian's demeanor sometimes bugs me. Yes, I want a serious trainer to put me through my paces, but exercise should be fun as well and Jillian can't quite compare to Chalene Johnson (Turbo Jam) for personality. At any rate, it is a high energy program that definitely addresses most of the stubborn trouble zones."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more trouble zones","review":"I used this, and still do, after my son was born. It really helped me lose the baby weight. This DVD makes you work hard, but you will feel accomplished. I like that you can just do segments of the workout instead of the whole workout.

Unfortunately, when I first previewed it I was disappointed in the imagery. Yes, it looks like you or I could have filmed it. However, a few months later when my son would not stop crying for anything I played it in hopes of anything to make him relax. within moments he was relaxing. ABSOLUTELY amazing and wonderful for he and I.While the DVD does not have the advanced imagery of other brands, I think it is simple enough that our babies can grasp it without being over stimulated!!! my husband and I had to remind ourselves that its not for us, its for baby. And our baby boy has chosen this one as his favorite. If I turn it on and he is out of the room he will come barreling down the hall. Its so funny. My son also does pt and ot exercises everyday. When he gets overly frustrated or refuses to participate the dvd or cd will relax him enough to do his exercises. This DVD is a must have in our house and anywhere we go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our family loves this Dvd!","review":"I love the calm baby Dvd/cd.

This cd is amazing and one of my favorites to have come out this year. They show that they can rock it out and that they can also slow things down a bit. And if you think their cd is good... Their live show is even better.

If your music is all over the place and has no direction or structure, you've lost me as a listener. At the very same time though, I refuse to listen to another rehash of nickelback. Fakiton is just that; nickelback with a different name. I was mildly interested in fakiton when I heard the linkin park-esque \\"take it all away\\", and decided to check em' out. So yeah, I actually paid full price for the LP (a waste, I know). The end result of fakiton (album) was 12 song mess, a cross between generic post \\"the long road\\" nickelback and cheesy 80's pop-metal. A-typical ballads, a few headbangers, and some radio singles; nothing more. Safe, but sorry, Fakiton just doesn't cut it in today's world of crossover acts and hybrid music genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hooba Who?","review":"In late 2005, Ryan, Marshal, Jeremy, Jeremy, and Josh barricaded themselves in a suburban southern California basement with a copy of GarageBand and a handful of Hoobastank guitar tabs. The resulting self-titled debut album, Faktion, is an exploration of the vast expanse of angstrock suckdom that is somehow overproduced, while remaining rough-around-the-edges.Vacillating frantically between self-loating and self-pity, each track masterfully blends off-the-shelf lyrics and uninspired guitar licks into a whole so much less than the sum of its parts as to be nearly mathematically impossible. The appropriately entitled first track \\"Forgive Me\\" not only sets the mood for the rest of the album, it serves as a warning and pre-apology as well.While a seeming contradiction, \\"Indie label sellout\\" is the only appropriate designation available for this aural felony. The shame is how cheaply they must have sold out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Sounds good...Arived on time. CD is not scratched. Case clean, Insert not ripped.

I was hoping all their songs were as hard sounding as the ones that I'd listened to already, but some were much softer.I don't knock them for their softer stuff, I just don't care for it as much. Overall, I think they sound pretty good. They seem like young guys that, if they don't sell out, will probably have a few more CD's worth listening to in the future.Overall, two thumbs up.

The yoke has a problem with its plastic shaft that is controlled by springs. It's almost impossible to obtain the neutral point. In fact the \\"pull-push\\" friction caused by the plastic-over-plastic (plastic shaft sliding in plastic housing) doesn't give any precision during the flight simulation. I am sure that for that price a better design should be a must. I am a General Aviation pilot and when practicing IFR procedures requiring precision in terms of altitude I feel really frustrated and my first impression is to deal with a toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the air more than ever.","review":"OK, I'm an old private pilot who has also flown Microsoft Flight Simulator before Microsoft owned the product but with this yoke, you really really add to the realism far beyond my expectations. The size of the yoke is close to those of most 2-6 passenger planes I have flown and so the feel is right at home in your hands. What's really amazing is that with it attached to the lastest version of Simulator, most of the controls functioned right out of the box with no programing. I was constantly surprised at how easy and how fully integrated the yoke and related buttons, etc. were with the software - functionally and visually - yes visually. You pull back on the yoke and a quick view inside the cockpit shows the simulated yoke moving almost in unison - almost scarry!Although twice the price of the Microsoft software it's well worth the price and if you are a real pilot or want to be pilot, the FAA lets you log some real hours of practice with this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I have owned every version of MS Flight sim to come out, but always been disappointed with the action when using the keyboard and quickly grew tired of it. However, I recently started real flight training and my instructor told me to get the CH yoke. I did and it is unbelievably realistic when compared with the real thing. A great training aid. Although you don't get credit for sim hours toward your license, if you work the same maneuvers and principles on the sim that you do in your lessons, it will save you hours in the air and with the instructor. He has already told me he can really tell the difference between me and his other students. Besides, it's just fun! Makes MS Flight sim what it should be. I didn't get the rudder pedals right away, but realized I can't do forward slips or crosswind landings very well without them. Also, the autorudder feature is nice for beginners, but it builds a bad habit of steering while taxiing with the yoke, so I got the rudder pedals too. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"This product does what it says, but it is very light weight, and made entirely of plastic.

I've owned it for three years now, using it with MS Flight Simulator, and it has degraded considerably since I purchased to the point of uselessness. I had hoped to use it for instrument practice, but no joy.At the start it was usable, though poor and nothing like really flying. Now it seems to have dead spots that make it difficult to hold altitude or directional control, and you are constantly trying to \\"nudge\\" it forward with tiny bumps to get it to change and it holds-nudge-holds-nudge-holds-nudge-jump. The jump overshoots, so you are back to barely trying to nudge it again. Maybe I'm expecting too much from a under-$100-yoke, but disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Flight Yolk -","review":"This yolk makes Flight Simulator \\"spooky\\" real. With the force feedback joystick that this replaced, I was never able to line a plane up directly on the line, nor was I able to do any beautiful touch downs.

All I can say is the controls stick real bad. The yoke, for example does not slide back and forth smoothly. I had even thought of spraying WD-40 on the shaft. But it still sticks.

I use it with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 and it works very well. The only problem I have had with it is that the clamps don't close quite far enough for my desk (which I think is average in thickness) so I have always had to place a wooden ruler between the clamps and the desk. That generally worked pretty well. During the entire time I have owned the yoke one of the bolts in the clmaps was always stiff to turn. Today it seized on me. I called CH Products technical line (except to be on hold for a long time) and they said to ship it back to them with a $33 dollar check for shipping and repairs. They said the brackets were not covered under the 3-year warranty. Keep that in mind.Otherwise this yoke has served me very well. The yoke is a little on the stiff side as some others have noticed but I got used to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great realism!","review":"I'm far from being a private pilot but after I took an introductory flight around Houston the bug bit me. In this flight the pilot let me fly a little cessna around once we were airborne. I rushed home and picked up MS Flight Sim along with this Yoke. When it arrived, I was amazed out how much this felt like the actually yoke I had used, minus the weight factor. It's easy to mount and move around, and configuring it on Win XP was a snap. I was very impressed with the quality of this product and will probably by the rudder pedals in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor choice for instrument work","review":"I purchased this and the CH Products rudder pedals to practice my instrument work. Other reviews mentioned that the control column does not return very well to a neutral position, with regard to pitch. Believe me, this is a major shortcoming of this product, and in IMC, you'll be searching all over for the correct control column position to control pitch. On the plus side, it does make you speed up your instrument scan, but it's a major pain. I tried flying a holding pattern today, and most of my attention was devoted to pitch and altitude. Even in the absence of wind and turbulence, the simulated plane flies like it's going through updrafts and downdrafts. Forget using elevator trim - the real issue is where do you have the control column positioned. I'm replacing this product.

I suspect it had it origin as a set of handouts for the author's students that was later assembled into a book.The few examples of applied bass lines use only roots and fifths. There are a number of scales and arpeggios worked out in various keys, but no discussion of how to apply these to build bass lines.There's a lack of discussion of upright bass technique- just a few pictures- and not much more for electric. I wouldn't recommend it at all for the beginner attempting to teach him orherself. For the advancing student looking for scales and arpeggios, I'd recommend Rufus Reid's \\"The Evolving Bassist\\".

Very tropical and easy to listen to, the rythym really cooks and flows nicely , especially on \\"Where's J.D.?\\" <My favorite piece> I wish these two would make more recordings together.

I didn't care for any of the 'white' characters. My focus was on The Black Girl since I, too would be seen as 'black' in that society. I destroyed my copy as soon as the class was over.

By the time you get to windows programming with AWT (halfway through the book) the author has apparently lost interest in instructing on the subject of Java and decided to do many other, irrelevant things instead (he prefers to discuss algebraic equations, code generators, and \\"outline code\\" rather than how to create buttons and other controls and setup their actions in response to events.

In several cases her science was flat-out wrong. She claims the radiation on Mars would make it unlikely for humans to visit there. Other books such as \\"A Case for Mars\\" written by Robert Zubrin thoroughly refute such claims. Humans to Mars must be promoted not discouraged. I also found the book to be very self-promoting. The word \\"I\\" just appeared too many times. The chapters dealing with her childhood were boring and tedious. What does that have to do with Mars? There were a few interesting parts dealing with what actually happened with the Rover on Mars but these parts were too few and far between for this to be an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shirley's story is motivational and intertaining.","review":"For a person reviewing books before live audiences, Managing Martians by Donna Shirely is a winner!

This time around the monologue didn't seem quite as forthcoming and fluid in its presentation. This movie did not have the same spellbinding effect on me as the earlier one. Another problem, I thought, was over production. I don't think the sound efects, music and camera movements add to the performance, but rather interupt and interfere with the connection between Spalding Gray and the audience.

The temperature differential between day and night was sufficient that we got huge amounts of condensation on the inner surface of the roof, which then dripped onto the things being stored.

They travel through an intricate world populated by different peoples that have all been conquered by the Emperor's armies to form a giant empire.Because of foul demon sorcery, Aleksander must rely on Seyonne to find the mysterious Wardens to unravel the enchantment cast on him. Seyonne must also regain his powers to fight the final battle against a powerful demon lord or the world is lost.Carol Berg has created a new world without all of the typical sorcerous mumbo-jumbo, where the magician doesn't need spell components and written words to cast spells. Instead the magician enters the souls of mortal men to exorcise demons.I recommend this book to anyone who wants a \\"breath of fresh air\\" in the fantasy genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what they mean by universal themes","review":"I like fantasy. However, I think I would have liked this novel as much if it was historical fiction, mystery or some other genre. Seyonne speaks to anyone who has been forced by circumstances to abandon a calling--in a non fantasy novel, it might be art, music or writing, rather than magic--in order to survive. I also like the way the two main characters encourage each other to step out of their socially mandated rolls, bringing out the best in each other and--since this is a fantasy novel--saving the world in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2000 New Years Resolution...","review":"was to actually get through either a Sci-Fi or Fantasy book.

Her characterization and growth of the 2 main characters and their relationship is among the best I have ever read. Supporting characters (Lady Lydia esp.) are also wonderfully three dimensional. Add to this an intricate but not overly complex plot with lots of unexpected twists and turns and you've got a real winner. My only regrets are that it ended and that the genre may restrict her audience. The author deserves to be sitting at or near the top of the NY Times Bestseller list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced start to the Trilogy","review":"The beginning of this book jumps right into the action, and you will find that the book goes by very quickly.

She conceals information from the police, doesn't inform her guests that they are in danger and makes no effort to keep the maids safe. They are sent alone to dark, lonely areas of the hotel and out-buildings - and when one of the maids says she's afraid - the housekeeper yells at her and sends her off to her death.

She sings so well that I hate to grumble about her acting. However, somebody needs to point out that she consistently over-acts, hams and grimaces, flaunts and flounders. She's such a quaint dumpling of a \\"contadina\\" that only a good deal of restraint could make her stage-presence appropriate for the love-maddened, spiritualized Nina. Now I've had my say.

WACK! I'm not looking for the sounds of Dr. Octagon, but some originality [...] would be greatly appreciated. He doesent even try to follow a theme (outside of his usual nonsensical rants)even though the cover of the album would lead you to think otherwise.. His beats are recycled; I identified at least four common beats that were recycled from as far back as Dr. DOOOM, they just have a different sound filter over the beat so it sounds different, but I found myself rapping 'apartment 223' off of Dr. DOOOM when I was listening to this album, because some of the beats are so...stale and plastic. I know you can't win all the time, but this cd was not cheap (compared to some of his other work), and I am quite dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"Is this the same Kool Keith that created Dr. Octagon, Dr. Dooom, and Black Elvis? \\"Spankmaster\\" represents a regression of creative energy.

With the exception of a couple songs (\\"jewelry shine\\" and \\"Blackula\\"), this album stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is just boring.","review":"ok, I hate to say it, but this never grew on me, i grabbed it when it first came out and, sadly, still it's very weak. I'm a huge Kool Keith fan and this is very disapointing. By far it's his worst album.

I was an accomplished pianist looking to begin studying some basics of organ playing, and I was not disappointed. Davis' book offers a very basic approach to learning to play the organ, from attack and release, to pedal excercises, and over 100 graded classical compositions. Most valuable to me, however, is the long section on phrasing and articulation and the appendix on the organ itself and hymn-playing.The only complaint I had was that it was very similar to the method of organ playing by Gleason. This book would be perfectly complimented by a competent teacher and Nilson's excellent pedal excercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Organ Music Training","review":"This is a good book for the beginning organist.

Why do we continue doing it when the poems are irrelevant, and truth be told, actually have horrid or inappropriate meanings? If you don't like to follow tradition for tradition's sake, buy Bruce Lansky's book instead, if not for your own children, then for your family or friends children. It's a delightful romp through our favorite childhood nursery rhymes using the same rhythmic cadence but with an entirely modernized twist on the wording.

Most of the tracks have a bittersweet message, although his strong faith seems to give him an inner strength as a source of support.As always, Gary sings with unbridled passion and conviction, giving listeners a channel to his hurt and disappointment. All tracks are well executed. My highlights include: the desperate NOTHING WITHOUT YOU mirroring his need for Amy and Jesus; DADDY CUT MY HAIR, an insightful and realistic look at father and son relationships; HOLD ON, I LOVE YOU I DO YOU BET, AS GOOD AS GOODBYE GETS, LEARNING TO LOVE and THE WAY YOU'VE SHOWN ME HOW, all truly heartfelt and beautiful ballads.OUTSIDE is not Chapman's best album, but it is a very good one and recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!

Yes, most of the songs wear out their welcome sometime into the fourth minute. This album is still great. I still marvel at the way Laetitia Sadier's voice meshes with the bouncy basslines and spidery guitar to make an effect that shouldn't work but somehow does.

I wanted a set that I could just switch arbors on the shaper and be ready to go. The problem with these particular cutters is they don't use a bearing. So, if all your shaping is on straight cuts, these will work fine. If you want to make a door with an arch, however, these are worthless. Freud sells a bearing to go with the set, but the way the cutters are designed, unless you have an inch thick piece of stock, the wood misses the bearing.

Most of her books in the Austin series are realistic, but I found this one to be far-fetched and heavy-handed. Instead of the political overtones I would have preferred a simpler story focusing on Vicky's relationship with Adam. I also find the premise of an ordinary high school student suddenly journeying to Antarctica and getting caught up in political intrigue to be inconsistent with the author's past work about Vicky Austin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing after Ring of Endless Light","review":"I was so excited when I found this book, and so disappointed when I *read* it.

The Vespugia stuff always goes over my head, but besides that it's a fabulous book with great characters and tons of suspense. When I first read this book in seventh grade I became obsessed with going to Antarctica. This January, three years later, I actually went there, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life, and I know I'm going to go back someday because it was so, so wonderful. One of the first things I did when I got hom was to search through my bookshelves and read Troubling a Star again- after all it had largely been what had inspired my trip in the first place, although I had only read it that one time three years ago. As I read it again (and all in one night) it was far more meaningful than before.

The book doesn't even go anywhere-- I agree with one of the previous reviewers that it just goes from Kid Loves TV to Kid Gets Bit By Snake to Ending That Doesn't Resolve Anything At All. I'm pretty sure that she just forgot to resolve the plot-- or maybe that's just her writing style. Whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising but disappointing","review":"Despite its rich writing and superb capture of Dublin idiom, this book is ultimately quite disappointing. It tells the story of a dysfuctional family with two alcoholic parents from the perspective of one of the young daughters, Tatty. Each chapter brings us forward a year in Tatty's life. Much of the narrative rings true but it stretches credibility somewhat that from chapter one, and at a very early age, Tatty is focussed on alcohol as being the main underlying problem with her family. Surely such realisation would dawn more gradually. Throughout, I felt that the anti-alcohol message (and there can be no doubting that children and alcohol should never be mixed) was the book's raison d'etre and this engendered a somewhat self-consciously self-pitying attitude in Tatty's narrative. Unfortunately, the book wears its heart too much on its sleeve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage - Screen dies after just a few movies","review":"The screen went blank after about playing around twenty movies.

Kind of creepy, it brought to mind all the directorial talent in ZOMBIE that somehow flew the coop here, and 2) the scene with the zombie head in the fridge that flies out and bites somebody.

When I finally figured out how to get the water out, the evaporator was pretty infested with mold. I tried this product, and followed the directions to the letter. Unfortunately, the only thing that happened is that it masked the mold smell for about 2-3 weeks.

I used the entire can to treat my vehicle and followed all the package instructions. This stuff does have a somewhat pleasant lemon scent. Took about 5 days of running the blower fan full blast with the windows down during my daily commute to get the lemon scent from the stuff to subside to a tolerable level.

For the diet, you might as well resurrect 1972 Dr. Atkins who apparently is somewhat of a god to him. The program is extreme and unnatural. Did I mention boring?

One major theme stands out in this accounting -- Mozart has never been considered human.

I do not recommend this book at all, even though it was written by someone of Michael Landon's family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother, Michael Landon fans.","review":"As a Michael Landon fan, I was totally disappointed in this book. Cheryl is riding on her father's name here. Her philosophy in this book has nothing to do with Michael Landon's legacy. After all the research I've done on him, I think he'd be disappointed with her far-fetched ideas. If this is the way she wants to live and believe, fine: If she wants to write a book about it, fine. But don't attribute it to Michael."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad widow","review":"The musicians all perform very well. However the acting and scenery left me feeling that this was really a very sad widow; an elderly person who laments her past. There is little merry about this widow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This production felt more like musical theater done poorly than operetta. The costume on Anna as she sings the Vilia song is dreadful on her, and the quality of the singing overall is just so-so. Though not a terrible production, I expected better from San Fransisco."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much","review":"This is a terrible WIDOW that is greatly overproduced. Whatever is enjoyable in it is destroyed by a overblown, gargantuan third act in which the kitchen sink could even fit. There is not a good WIDOW available on DVD yet"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a wonderful experience!","review":"Since I was in it, I can say that it was a delightful experience and one that I will treasure all my life, since it was my last performance as a professional opera singer.I debuted at the Met @ 21, sang all over the world, won a Grammy, and ended my short career (on purpose) @ 32 at the San Fran Opera. Lotfi was wonderful and I'm grateful to San Fran Opera.Buy this DVD and enjoy every minute of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the performance of a lifetime","review":"Bought this disc on the recommendation of other rave reviews that said it was THE performance to have. I already own two other recordings of this opera, but they fall short in various ways and I was hoping that this one would be the definitive version. To date, none has equaled any of the live performances I've seen of this delightful operetta, nor featured the best libretto I've heard for it. This recording, in particular, was a disappointment, in that, not only were there were no really wonderful performances in this version, but none of the voices were even particularly good. The costumes and scenery were gorgeous, but in the end, it's the singing that has to excel, and with music like this that soars, it's extra disappointing when the voices don't match it. The lack of English subtitles, which I knew about prior to purchase, just adds insult to injury."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aren't there younger Widows too?","review":"From the 2 versions avalable on DVD(the other one being the Australian one with Joan Southerland) this seemed the obvious choice and I don't regret it.With so few operettas on DVD ,every release has to be saluted,especially if it's as good as this one.It has everything that an operetta needs-well sung,funny,great music,nice sets,and rich costumes. The video and audio are superb.Only 4 stars because there are no English subtitles and because I think a younger widow would have suited more to this kind of production.I recommend this production for everyone who is looking for a good entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sumptuous widow!","review":"I really enjoyed this beautiful merry widow, this has been the best DVD bought this year, worth every penny!The whole production is gorgeous, the cast can't be better,after so many \\"minimalist\\" opera productions, this merry widow has it all: glorious singers, elegant dancing, spectacular sets and lavish costumes, this production is a dazzling non-stop feast for the senses. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't understand the words","review":"It was completely disappointing as we couldn't understand the words. I have a CD recording if I just want to listen to the music. In a DVD it would be nice to have subtitles for English as well as any other language. Very rarely can language being sung be understood. After years in the SF Opera pit my husband does want to understand what is happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whate a waste of scenery and costumes!","review":"I thought it would be impossible to ruin Lehar's The Merry Widow, but this production convinced me otherwise. The 2001 San Francisco Opera presentation excels in beautiful art deco stage sets; costumes are elegant to sarcastically lavish. It is a setting for a grand opera. Only The Merry Widow is NOT a grand opera: it is an operetta, a comedy, it is supposed to be light, funny, even frivolous. Unfortunately, this presentation is beset by show-off singing and exaggerated acting. Also, translation of Victor L��on and Leo Stein's libretto is wasted: it is very difficult to understand opera singers even under best circumstances, so the sensible way to present such work is in original language with translated text (on the programme for real-life opera, as subscript for video). For those who would enjoy the Viennese operetta, Placido Domingo's direction of Die Fledermaus will provide for a much more pleasurable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holly at the front door","review":"What a delightful book! I never knew why the landscape plan for my home had holly bushes at every entrance...to keep the evil spirits out! And the book is not sacrilegious or really for witches!

After watching it, I thought: \\"wow I could have thought of that\\". It's so simple, but it works great, I felt the burn the next day and I am a pretty advanced exerciser. It's only twenty minutes which is perfect for people with busy schedules. I only watched a small portion of the circulation and diet part because it's common sense stuff, although, I think it would be benefical for beginners looking to change their diet and start stretching. Overall, I would definitely remcommend this DVD for anyone looking to change and strengthen their legs! I can't wait to see what my legs will look like in a few months:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for what is offered and for beginners","review":"The nutrition info is boring to watch and not very informative. The exercises are very basic and really are primarily meant for beginners. If you are an intermediate to an advanced exerciser, I would not recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"I just got this last week, did the exercises for the second time yesterday. All I can say is OUCH. I'm am in decent shape, but this really challenged me, and in a short amount of time (less than 20 min). I can't tell about results, but I've just started. There is really some great information here, I'm anxious to see if this works. I think that the ideas about circulation seem to make sense to me so I'm hopeful I will have good results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The exercises in the video are good--they are definitely effective and you will be sore after your first attempt. However, the DVD is terrible. You can't skip directly to the exercises without having to fast forward through the other common sense junk. There aren't many tips on how to do the excersizes correctly, which is essential in doing an effective workout with out hurting yourself. (I must have been doing something wrong because I strained my knees.) Also, Kim is annoying--her form of encouragment to keep going is a series of \\"wow's\\" in a very bimbo tone of voice. Obnoxious. Don't pay more than $5.00 for this program, it's not worth anything more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout","review":"I feel this one the next day....The first time that I did this workout...the whole video, my legs were sore for 4 days. It was hard to walk. After that I picked certain exercises to do and I still get sore but at least I can walk. It is a great video."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD truly works for your legs.","review":"Person using it had tried and researched many programs but she says this one truly works from the get go. She loves the 20 minutes or so for a quick but highly effective legs workout. Totally worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really unprofessional","review":"After reading all of the positive reviews I was excited to try this DVD. Unfortunately it is cheaply made and the girl who leads the workout is almost unbearable to watch. They pick on an inexperienced girl throughout the whole video and now I can hardly stand to watch it. The exercises are useful, but the video is horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD will get you results!","review":"This DVD is wonderful! I have been doing the workout for a couple of months now and my legs and thighs are visibly toner. This is a good dvd for beginners and experts as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Permatex Headliner Spray","review":"This spray adhesive is more than comparable to the more expensive 3M product. The temperature rating of this spray adhesive means you can in fact, use it to glue headliner fabric directly to the underside of your roof. I used this product with some mylar faced foam insulation that is 1/2\\" thick (purchased from J.C. Whitney) and glued that insulation directly to the underside of my roof. As long as you follow the directions you will have no problems gluing carpet, headliner fabric or heavy weight materials like the mylar foam insulation I use to insulate and quiet my car. I was able to buy 2 cans of this adhesive, and paid less for those 2 cans than I would have paid for a can of 3M spray adhesive from local body shop supply stores or home improvement stores like Lowes or Home Depot. This stuff WORKS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super hold for sun exposed trim","review":"Used this on a-pillars trim for vinyl and fabric covered plastic. One month now, its holding strong even exposed all day to direct sunlight. Applied over thin fabric on my Jag that faded and peeled off. Coated heavy on the vinyl and let dry. Sprays on thick and slightly foamy, You need to coat both pieces. Its removeable before 5 mins, but is super sticky and will leave uneven gummy residue to scrape off. Its twice as strong as 3M spray adhesive, but more importantly , wont fail under hi heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Permatex is not for me!","review":"First thing I would like say is I have helped replace a couple of headliners ten or twelve years ago when I worked at a shop. So I am familiar with the process but no professional. I took headliner out of 2000 Pontiac Bonneville, clean the fiberglass board, wire brushed it and cleaned it with paint thinner. A week later vacuumed the board and laid out the foam backed liner. After spaying the board and back of liner I let it tack one side at time. The stuff stuck really nice I had one small wrinkle and tried to fix it and there was no way it was coming up without ripping the foam. I used a can and a half on the liner and board. But, after install a month later I came out to the car and the front is sagging. You can still push it back and it sticks but falls back down after a day. This could have been my mistake as others have had luck or just a bad can glue. Either way I'm not using it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember to follow instructions","review":"I bought this adhesive along with a headliner replacement fabric from Amazon. It's very simple to use and does what it's supposed to and it's easy to see where you have or have not applied. I personally used the whole can on a headliner, but I just wanted to be thorough. I would also either use it on a day without breeze or wind if you do it outside. If inside, just make sure you get some fresh air. I used it for a headliner for a beater I bought and it has held up great for a few months. Cheap way to improve you vehicle's interior appearance. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work","review":"We had high hopes for this professional-sounding adhesive. But after a week, the headliner was hanging loose again. Looks like we're off to the upholstry shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have repaired headliner myself","review":"I tried repairing the headliner while it was still in the car, and it didn't go very well. It was the headliner along the edge of the back window, so when I sprayed it, the glue would form droplets that trickled down to where the headliner was still attached, and they soaked through. Now the headliner has yellow glue splotches on it. Also, because it's a spray, it's hard to spray it evenly over all areas. So there are still areas that are detached. And I couldn't get all the bubbles out either. I should have just had it done professionally, which is what I have to do now to fix the mess I made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiskars CraftCrate Rolling Organizer","review":"I'm a college art instructor.

It is very sweet and it's simple story and uncomplicated charm made it an absolutely first rate film for younger viewers. I think you may only appreciate it if you watch it with a younger person (aged 3-8) because for adult tastes it seems rather low key and simplistic...however my four year old absolutely loved it....again...and again...and again.... In a media world of fast pace, special effects and graphics I think we can all to easily overlook films like this, but for a younger viewer it is absolutely perfect- it has strong family values; the difference between right and wrong; two cute dogs and the triumph of good people over the \\"baddies\\". It is a simple tale, easy to follow for children and well acted. It totally has a thumbs up from me. When can I buy this in the UK?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny and unoriginal parody","review":"On paper this looks good: take some of the most recognizable characters from science fiction, give them funny names a la Mad Magazine, and create 30 minutes of hilarity. The only real problem is that the creators of Star Warp'd forgot to do anything remotely funny with this series. Darth Vader is represented as \\"Darth Vapor\\" and uses \\"the dark smell of the Force.\\" This basically means 30 minutes of fart and poop jokes. If that's your idea of a good time, it's your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good (Failed) Try","review":"It seemed like a great idea - to meld all the classic space operas into a short animated film parody. So what went wrong?

I recommend it if you want to laugh at some stupid stuff or just laugh in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very guilty pleasure","review":"This show originally aired when I was a senior in high school, and everyone watched it, but me. I did not want anything to do with some mtv reality show. Ironically enough... a few weeks ago I caught a rerun on mtv, and I was hooked. So I immediately felt compelled to buy the season. My biggest complaint it that it is sooo short. Just 9 twenty minute episodes (excluding the first 40 minute episode). The bonus disc is very nice though. It has deleted scenes from each episode, enough material to add about 20 minutes to each. As others have mentioned, more football footage would have been cool, but I thought there was a good balance between the students personal and athletic lives.I can now say I have finally been addicted to a reality show...just one that aired three years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!!!!","review":"I live over in Japan and my wife, who is Japanese, asked me what was I watching, because she thought I was watching a college football show. when I told her that is was highschool, she could not believe that this was highschool and she kind of got hooked into the series as I did, but I wished they had more to show. I enjoyed every minute of the show and it made me miss highschool, because I love football and I enjoyed all the hard hits, the great passing and running and just the over all spirit this show had.

Ultimately, Mahalo, My Love is a fiery, exciting, and especially engaging historical romance from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book does NOT contain the plays!!","review":"You would think from the title that this was a collection of four of Stoppard's best plays with some commentary. The plays are NOT included, which, for me, made this book worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointiing","review":"I have loved every CD by Brooks & Dunn, but this one doesn't do much for me. Mainly, there are too many songs that are too slow; the thing I like best about these guys is their rockin', boot-scootin' honky tonk, and that's almost entirely missing here. Also, \\"missin' You\\" was a bad song when John Waite sang it and it's still a bad song. I hope next time B & D put out something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeeehah, Country Music Rocks!","review":"My nephew gave this sucker to me as a gift.

Unfortunately the fans of this dribble wouldn't understand any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight Rope First Step in New Direction Awesome Album!!!","review":"I am a serious Brooks & Dunn fan and Tight Rope is equal to, if not better than some of their other albums. This album was definately a change of pace from previous albums, but it is a stepping stone towards what Brooks & Dunn accomplished on \\"Steers & Stripes\\" and \\"Red Dirt Road\\". Its true that none of the songs were co-written by the duo, but they each bring some unique material to the table and they are both amazing song writers. Ronnie's voice is flawless as always, but Kix also steps it up on this album and I think that his songs are a nice contrast to Ronnie's. If given more opportunities I think some of Kix's songs could shine as singles, but he is willing to let Ronnie sing on songs that have a good chance of being hits.Anyone out there who has liked Brooks & Dunn will enjoy this album. Ignore the critics and make up your own minds as to what is a good record and what isn't. If you don't own this album you need to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissects the modern Work/Life balance problem","review":"This was a great, insightful, enjoyable, well-written book. It clearly dissects the problem of why it's so hard to achieve a suitable work/life balance today, and clearly describes some underlying causes. For me, it certainly lived up to the praise it has gotten.In short, Reich's central idea is this: as consumers, we love the terrific products and deals we're getting in today's marketplace as a result of increased competition. However, the dark site of this is that we must work longer hours as employees and be more innovative to ensure our companies outpace the competition. These time pressures are fragmenting our personal lives as we reduce the time we spend with friends, family and community. Reich has many interesting insights and observations beyond this overall theme as well. Overall, I recommend this book -- reading it was time well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Joke","review":"Reich and the globalization gang are a joke. While it is true that the trinkets from China are dirt cheap, the things Americans spend most of their money on like housing, health care, education, and energy have sky rocketed because they are produced domestically in largely oligarchic markets. Real per capita GDP has almost doubled in the past 30 years while real hourly median wages have slightly declined.

We miss you Lady Kier and the boys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic reference book","review":"Everytime I am confused about an element of Japanese grammar I consult this reference book and I always walk away satisfied with all my questions answered. The translations are fantastic, the example sentences are chosen to clearly demonstrate the grammar point, and different usages are explained. What I like most is that this book takes varying English translations of the grammar point and shows how they are conceptually connected, so that you only have to remember the one grammar point rather than memorizing a bunch of seemingly different English translations.I hope to be a Japanese teacher in the future, and I'll be keeping this book by my side at all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of filler between the good songs","review":"Don't be deceived by Amazon's description of this 3-disc set -- there's no Jazz Butcher or Alien Sex Fiend here. I frankly don't know why those two bands are named in connection with this album. The songs collected here loosely fit into the genre of punk-rockabilly, but the quality of the cuts is extremely variable. Some of the songs are inspired -- but more of them are not. You're better off just buying a Cramps album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am sooooo happy!","review":"I think this is one of the best comedy series I have ever seen!

It's impassioned with a consistent spinning wheel of a lover's mystery...keeping nostalgia alive, content with thoughtful places that you can hear, touch and feel for yourself. Excellent substance...in a relaxed manner, feeding constant messages, essential information, just enough to impatiently turn to the next page....there was no substitute for the peace this book made me feel...so much so, couldn't pick up another book for quite some time, wanted to.

Have always been a fan of Uniden products but this radio totally misses the mark both in radio quality and the customer service I received from Uniden in trying to correct the problem. Here it is July of 2012 and the radio is basically useless for trunked operation. Audio is very garbled and flutters. 5% of the time it is clear audio. Must be a temperature issue but they have not solved the problem. Uniden refuses to give me a new one.

When on a road trip I picked up my local police from 50 miles from my town. My other scanners don't pick them up after about 10 miles. It's also compatable with ECAS Trunked System, which is the main reason I baught this scanner. It also gets rid of the anoying beeps at the end of each trasmission of the fire and police. Also great feature is the conectivty of the scanner to your computer makes programing very easy.

She flattens the pillow so much that it's hard to fluff it up again (the pillows are attached to the sofa). So I tried to adhere the strips all along the back of the upholstered sofa and it did not stick. I got more strips on me than the furniture.

However, when I'm appyling the item to my furniture, it sometimes attaches itself to my fingers and then the sticky strip is ruined. I'd say this happens about 1 out of four applications. My kittens stay away. It sticks well to both fabrics and woods and doesn't discolor or cause any other weird residues. It's clear, so it's not noticeable once applied. It's a pretty good product, and if I could apply this 100% of the time without the attachment to my fingers and wrinkling up, I would have given it a 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticky paws great for wood work","review":"Sticky paws works great for stopping cats from scratching wood such as all the wood trim around doors that they stretch out on and scratch. I bought the sticky paws in the hopes of using the sticky strips on my new leather couch and loveseat but the reality is that I think the sticky paws might damage the leather so instead I just keep the cats out of the living room when no adult is there to supervise them - kind of like having little kids again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total garbage","review":"I purchased this product for the same reason that all of did, and it failed on both my leather and cloth furniture to such an extent that I took the time to write this review. It failed to prevent the cat from scratching a $7000 leather sofa from the first day of use, and when I removed it, it left a sticky residue that was very difficult to remove (used goof off, and reconditioned the patch with leather conditioner).

I got these to keep my cats off of my countertops and kitchen table. Within minutes of applying the sticky paws, my cat was on the table walking over the sticky tape without hesitation. Now I am trying to remove the tape, but it has left a sticky residue everywhere that won't come off. I've tried rubbing alcohol and dish soap and the sticky residue is still there. I love how it specifically states in the description that it is easily removed and leaves no residue behind. This product was also very expensive and I could barely cover my countertops before running out of the strips. Save your money...if you want to try something like this, try double-sided tape instead.

Oh, do I. Although she plays piano on only one song, she holds her own with these orchestra-backed songs. Her voice is rich and full, and totally hers. Time has blessed her with an alto as strong and rich as pure cream. She takes the song \\"Papa, Can You Hear Me\\"--that's right, from the movie \\"Yentl\\"!

Also, the EM-500 offers the multimedia card memory system, so memory can be easily expanded.The EM-500 seems targeted at a younger market, with great multimedia capabilities (MP3, 240 x 320 TFT 65,536 color screen, excellent gamepad).Its main competitor, the Compaq iPaq, offers more memory and speed, but less colors, and, most importantly perhaps, the keypad of the iPaq cannot register simultaneous clicks, which limits its gameplay capabilities.If you want a good Pocket PC for both \\"serious stuff\\" and games and multimedia, the EM-500 seems the way to go.

Her vocals are typically amazing as she brings her own touch to songs like ANYONE WHO HAD A HEART, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF, A RIVER FOR HIM and DON'T TALK. She explores her high soprano with the airy title track and the ethereal HEARTBEATS ACCELERATING.While WINTER LIGHT is not Linda's best effort, it is assuredly one of her most adventurous. Linda can sing just about anything, and she's proven that throughout her illustrious career. She remains one of our finest female vocalists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've been cleaner...","review":"The CD arrived VERY quickly and plays well. I did not play it for several weeks, though, as there was/is some brown \\"crud\\" on the case. Why is there a notch cut out of the case as well?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unjustly Overlooked","review":"Those reviewers who say this is one of Ronstadt's most underrated recordings didn't go far enough--this is definately without a doubt her most overlooked record. A perfect companion piece to her equally classic CRY LIKE A RAINSTORM, HOWL LIKE THE WIND, WINTER LIGHT finds Ronstadt calling on friends old(Jimmy Webb) and new(Bacharach and David) for some of her most intuitive cover choices to date. While everything here is first-rate, she's particularly strong on 'Anyone Who Had A Heart','Do What You Gotta Do', and the album's bookends, the gorgeous 'Heartbeats Accelerating' and the Enya-like title tune.But the real stand-out here is her simply magnificent reading of 'I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself', which she not only makes her own but showcases one of her best vocal performances ever. A classic that was never regarded as such,WINTER LIGHT justifies not only Ronstadt's prominent spot in popular music, but remains a perfect example of how an adult pop album should sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Revelation!","review":"This much-maligned CD actually features some of Linda's most accomplished vocals. She changes styles and musical genres so quickly and completely that each CD sounds like it could be by an entirely different artist but for that INCREDIBLE voice.Initially, I though this CD was a little too sleepy, but I have grown to love it and recognize that Linda is an artist that defies categorization. She is also very brave, because no one should have the gall to cover a tune already recorded by Dionne Warwick AND Dusty Springfield(two of the greatest voices of this century.) However, her version of \\"Anyone Who Had A Heart\\" is a wild success, it is a testament to Linda's greatness that she found new depth and heartache in a song that has been sung to death.She works similar magic on the Esther Phillips hit \\"It's Too Soon To Know\\" (with Aaron Neville on harmony vocals), and the Beach Boys \\"Don't Talk\\". There is not a single bad song in the bunch. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops, I was wrong!","review":"When I first bought this album, I listened to it a couple of times and put it aside, disappointed. It just didn't leave a big impression on me. It took me a couple of years to give it another listen, and lo and behold, I've fallen in love with it. There are a couple of missteps to be sure, but there also is some of Linda Ronstadt's very strongest work. I've especially become enamored of her version of Jimmy Webb's \\"Do What You Gotta Do\\" - a very wise love song with a gorgeous vocal. The centerpieces of the album are 3 great pop songs from the 60's made famous by Dionne Warwick and Dusty Springfield: \\"Anyone Who Had A Heart\\", \\"Oh No, Not My Baby\\" and \\"I Don't Know What to Do With Myself\\". I won't say Ronstadt transcends their performances, but her renditions can stand right alongside of them, and that's saying a lot. All in all, a criminally underrated album, by myself as well as others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie Next","review":"Nick Cage does it again.

Yet another poorly executed action film with a matrix-ish subtext concerning the nature of reality and so forth.The writers and director could care less about any intellectual or philosophical discourse and use \\"belief systems\\" superficially only because it's the thing to do these days and such ponderous platitudes are required for the story.

It scratched all my Sci-Fi itches. Sure, there were a few plot holes here and there. But overall great acting by Cage, Biel and Moore. It was also a treat to see Peter Falk. I loved the scene in the diner where he tests his options for approaching her.As much as I loved it, the movie failed at the end. I was expecting to see an alternate scenario, but it just left me hanging, and not in a sequel sort of way. But in a \\"the movie wasn't finished\\" sort of way. If that's the way the book ended, I suppose I can forgive the director for choosing to end the movie that way. But then I would say that Mr. Dick left me hanging.

This genre of film is right up my alley. A good story line. Excellent acting by Mr. Cage (and I'm not a fan). Supporting cast adequate. Fast moving - action - kept my interest throughout. The story moves easily from start to finish. The theme: time, and ones ability to see ahead - not really unique, however, with a \\"different twist\\", which I thoroughly enjoyed.

First, Nicolas Cage is laughable. He is a horrible actor. His choice of movies, mainly action hero films hides his incompetence as an actor. If he wasn'tFrancis Ford Coppola's nephew, we may have been spared his one dimensional man acting. Second, the plot of this film is comic book material. Phillip K Dick's books aren't all great material.This movie is for the simple minded, one dimensional, testosterone idiots that made Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Diesel and Van Damme stars.Heaven help us that this non-sensical crap is being consumed by our youngpeople. Dumb actors, big tits exposed and lousy scripts. Perhaps this explains how an idiot like Bush could become President of the United States.

In fact I recommend the short story collection entitled \\"Second Variety\\" by Citadel Press. While you are at it, read Dick's comments on the story \\"The Golden Man\\" in the Notes at the back.

Nickolas Cage is a favorite actor of mine, but his movies have been the pits lately, for the most part. I recommend watching this movie right up to the point where Cage's character gets busted in the casino. That whole idea of him outfoxing casino security was great together with the fascinating ability that he has.....and then.....the inevitable laughable, forced, typical, ridiculous, homogenized, hollyood plot kicks in, and your left wondering why great actors like Cage and Julianne Moore signed on to stuff like this.

The movie is entertaining to those who like action movies that do not follow a linear progression and are not looking for a lot of butt-kicking by the protagonist. This may be the last movie that Peter Falk (one cameo scene) will appear based on recent news that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and advanced dementia.

And it offers proof, w/ \\"Prayer in Open D,\\" that the woman just doesn't write songs herself enough, because that is simply one of the most beautiful songs ever written. If you are an Emmylou fan and do not have this record, please get it soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch (and overlooked) Emmylou","review":"Those that knew Emmylou after 1995's magnificent \\"Wrecking Ball\\" might never hear this 1993 album, and those that gave up on her because of \\"Wrecking Ball\\" might not go back to this album. And that's a shame. It's a great collection of songs, and her voice seems to have reached a new resonance on this album. She yet again selected great songs, worked with a great team of players, and sang her little heart out. She even penned one of the most haunting and wrenching songs I've ever heard: \\"Prayer in Open D\\". Whoa! (Hear the live version on \\"Spyboy\\" too).If you like any of Emmylou's \\"moods\\", this will fit in no matter which it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glorious offering","review":"I was 16 years old when I first listened to this album, and even now, more than seven years later, it has lost none of its vibrancy. For someone who had limited exposure to the country/folk genre (and absolutely no previous exposure to this particular artist), I found Ms. Harris's earthy voice to be positively refreshing. She manages to make every song on the album uniquely her own, even the much covered \\"You Don't Know Me.\\" \\"Prayer in Open D\\" and \\"Loving You Again\\" are among the most heartbreakingly honest songs I have ever heard, while \\"Jerusalem Tomorrow\\" and \\"Ballad of a Runaway Horse\\" are superbly haunting tales. There are simply no disappointments on this album. Whatever the style or tone of the song Ms. Harris handles them all masterfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to Emmylou","review":"While I had always known of Emmylou Harris, it wasn't until this album came out that my fascination with her began. At the time I was working in Downtown Baltimore and remember distinctly hearing Thanks to You on the radio and just loving it. And then many years later, after becoming reintrocued to Emmylou by buying Red Dirt Girl, I began collecting her entire catalog, and Cowgirl's Prayer is among my favorites. Crescent City is easily in my top 5 Emmylou songs of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice variety","review":"I like this CD a lot. It has a nice variety of styles and, even though Harris strains on high notes, which I hope she'll fix, she has a very interesting voice. Country music was never my favorite style (I hated it growing up) but I've been listening to more bluegrass - American music - in the last several years, and I've liked Joan Baez since the last sixties. I like music that tells the story of our country, in this CD that is the cowboy song, \\"Cattle Call\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowgirl Music","review":"One of Emmylou's best!!Each and every song is just so wonderful.Have listen to it for years!!!

As one of the leading brands of ukuleles, I was pleased to see the great quality and simple craftsmanship handle a beginner's mindless pluckings. It doesn't go out of tune too easily and I found it to have a great sound.

It's a quick thing to do and it really brightens the entire instrument up.If you're really serious about learning the instrument then spend the extra money and get something that sounds more like a Ukulele.Overall I love it. As a first introduction to Ukulele from piano and guitar it's not bad. I can't wait to get a new one; but I wouldn't know that if I hadn't bought this one.I gave it a 4 because really there are better sounding instruments out there.

From sinking hard & fast to the bottom and floating on the top of a turbulent ocean, to drifting & buffeting against winds amidst atmospheric clouds. And then, finally, we are shot into space to tumble through the ether.Blue October can play (really play) but they are mechanics & artists of experience. This work represents an engineering and creative masterpiece that evokes memories of past masters of similar artistry, like Genesis and Marillion. Yet there is something completely novel that instills every song with a fresh and unique sound that beats and breathes. These guys don't write songs; they paint music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Once again Blue October releases an album that shows their beautiful diversity and the thing that all of us fans admire most... their unique ability to create a sound that does not limit itself to the label of a single genre.Most will be familiar with Hate Me which went platinum in 2007 but don't stop listening there as you will miss out on some of their most breathtaking music. Into the Ocean depicting Justin's suicidal thoughts will resonate with everyone as only his music can.18th Floor Balcony will leave the images that only falling in love can press into ones soul.

And like Marillion, this CD will be included on my \\"top 5 CDs to be marooned on a deserted island with\\" list. I have to admit that song #4 \\"What if we could\\" and song #10 \\"Pulled a wire through my cheek\\" are both skipped... the rest of the music reflect an amazing skill in song writing and lyrics. His pain and struggle with drugs totally show up in his music.I do have to say the album version of \\"Hate Me\\" is a bit too long - the \\"credits are rolling\\" filler at the end of the tune is totally unnecessary.I have recommended this CD to a few friends all of whom say the same as I - its a great effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves to be the breakout hit of 2006","review":"Mixing melodic pretty songs like Into the Ocean and Congratulations with powerful stronger songs like What if we could and Hate Me, Blue October creates a perfect balance of music.Never too soft but never hammering you down and with a strong lead singer and diverse instrumentation(love the use of a violin player)Foiled is a very satisfying release and with it's low price it should shoot up to the top of the charts.Blue October have their own distinctive sound so if you're in search of great new alternative rock this is probably the best you'll find in 2006 so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost there","review":"I really like a majority of the songs on this abum BUT I can't say I like all em'.

It woudln't be Blue October if they didn't.Weather if your a Blue October fan or not, this is an incredible album and is well worth the price. There's something for everyone on ths album from the deep-rooted rock sounds of Drilled A Wire Through My Cheek to the disturbing/cool ballad Shes My Ride Home to the catchy, 80's-ish Into The Ocean and X Amount Of Words.I my humble opinion this album is worth buying and worth telling a friend about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"The lyrics on this CD are almost all very disturbing and dark, however the music is beatiful and lessons learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately...","review":"When I tried to play this CD, it would not read on any CD player.

If you are someone who does not like that, be careful. As for the remaining songs, they are worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody, but overall pretty good.","review":"Despite being pretty moody and relational as a whole, this album was actually quite diverse in its sound. You'll find hard-edged songs like \\"Hate Me\\" and \\"Drilled a Wire Through my Cheek\\" and a couple of pop-sounding tidbits, \\"Into the Ocean\\" and \\"Overweight\\". And there are even a couple of corny love songs, \\"You Make The Sound of Pulling Heaven Down\\" and \\"18th Floor Balcony\\", the latter bordering on ballad, and both tripping my gag reflex just a bit. But there were some really good songs on the album that you won't hear on a radio station.

Not so. Aladdin Sane was, indeed, Bowie's most refined effort up to that point, taking the simple rock'n'roll sound of Ziggy Stardust and moving it light years ahead, mixing excellent guitar sounds with saxaphone and Mike Garson's piano work (to say nothing of Bowie's phenomenal lyrics). Aladdin Sane is, indeed, more sophisticated than was Ziggy and it still sounds fresh and cutting-edge today. Songs like \\"Panic in Detroit,\\" \\"Drive-In Saturday,\\" and \\"The Jean Genie,\\" sounding variously smooth and genteel, yet somehow vibrant and energetic, easily put the works of thousands upon thousands of today's \\"alternative\\" artists to shame. Anyone who passes this album up in favor of Ziggy Stardust or, indeed, many other albums is missing something beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"a step below","review":"This album is full of catchy up-tempo songs that are a lot of fun. The piano playing on the album is quite interesting as it is stylistically different from the way the piano is usually employed in a rock and roll context. As a whole, I think this album is just a step below \\"Hunky Dory\\" and \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" in terms of songwriting. But if you liked those albums you'll definately like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgier than Ziggy Stardust, and with lots of great songs","review":"This follow-up to the Ziggy Stardust album is a lot less cohesive and also a lot rougher. I still can't really appreciate it as a whole, though there's a fair amount of brillant tracks. \\"Time\\" is one of my all time favourites and I really like \\"Lady grinning soul\\", \\"The prettiest star\\" and \\"Let's spend the night together\\" as well. I dig the more edgier instrumentation a lot too, but songs like \\"The Jean Genie\\" and \\"Alladdin Sane\\" just bore me; they sound more like a jam session, even though the former is a genuine Bowie classic. All in all, I'd say most of the songs are great, but played after each other they somehow seem to lose some of their strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cracked Actor","review":"The contribution of soi-disant avant garde jazz pianist, Mike Garson is immense on this classic Bowie album. The title track is underwritten by Garson's manic playing and Bowie is in fine fettle. This is a varied work, ranging from a Stones' cover (\\"Let's Spend The Night Together\\") to balladry (\\"Drive-In Saturday\\")and ending with the exquisite \\"Lady Grinning Soul\\". The opus \\"Time\\" is beautifully crafted replete with mid-song pause and Garson's magnificent sense of timing. Elsewhere, the grinding Panic in Detroit and the strong chorus line in Cracked Actor keep the album on a rock course.Thank you Mr.B"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aladdin Sane","review":"A delicious surprise whenever purchasing an album is that the hit songs are not always what end up lingering on in your mind. As with this body of work, David Bowie delights us with gentle rifts and long breathes like the ones in \\"Lady Grinning Soul\\" and great hunting piano sounds as with \\"Aladdin Sane\\" and then to his earlier melodic pop sounds with \\"Prettiest Star\\" where his friend Marc Bolan made his contribution.This has a little bit of everything sure to please any Bowie fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pointless book; save your money!","review":"This book is dire! A mixture of supposed \\"real\\" conversations between cross cultural couples which enforce every stereotype you have ever come across! The dialogue is tedious and wooden and reads as though it has been translated from a 1970's teen magazine by a robot. There are some useful phrases but you can find them in other, more useful books such as Philip Yungkin Lee's \\"Listening to Canotonese Basic Skills\\"Such a shame after the useful \\"No Sweat Cantonese\\" book. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wild West revealed.","review":"The Tenderfoot, indeed the whole Lucky Luke series, does for the Wild West, what Asterix did for the Roman Empire. Like Asterix, the stories are related in comic book form.The story is set around the adventures of a fast shootin', laid back cowboy named Lucky Luke, and his faithful horse, Jolly Jumper. This particular story revolves around a well dressed, educated Briton (or 'Tenderfoot') coming out to the Wild West.Like the rest of the Lucky Luke series, Rene Goscinny's great sense of humour shines through in the dialogue and set-ups. In particular, watch for the gun duel involving the Briton.The artwork is great, and really captures the time-period. Both in the story and the illustration, it is clear that research of the time period has been undertaken, and often, at the end of the book there will be information on historical references, which can in itself make for one of the most enjoyable history lessons children of all ages could hope to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the worst I've read.","review":"I make candles and export them for a living.

I feel your money would be better spent on another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can spend your money better elsewhere.","review":"I was expecting more detailed step by step instructions & full of color photos with lots of inspirations.

When I received it, it lists only \\"C.C. Productions\\" for credits. No vocalists, no orchestra, no other information! And the music and the vocals are both just terrible! I have seen \\"Phantom\\" live on Broadway at the Majestic twice and listened to the REAL soundtrack (which unfortunately I don't own but will purchase now!) and this is barely even recognizable. Retailers should be ashamed to even stock this poor version of \\"Phantom\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"i guess it's ok...","review":"I own the Original London Cast version of The Phantom of the Opera and I've seen the musical many times, and this is only my opinion, but I think the singer who sings as the phantom on this CD sings like he's getting choked by someone while he sings, and it also does not include the \\"Music of the Night\\" which is one of the main songs on the musical, so I wouldn't call this CD the HIGHLIGHTS from the Phantom of the Opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another foreign stereotype","review":"David Alan Harvey yet again follows in the venerable western tradition of essentializing a culture that is not his own and that he does not understand. Could this book be called \\"Poverty postcards from the edge\\"? Or perhaps \\"Fantasy visions of a people time forgot\\"? No, I've got it, \\"Women who won't talk to me but I'll photograph in their bikinis on the beach\\". But that is also a little of his current Brazil work. I've got a message for you Harvey, the US Census 2010 shows non-white births out-number white births. Before you know it other voices of the non-white are going to have harsh words for your Orientalist fantasies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to Cubans","review":"This book should have been called \\"Two Gringos Go to Cuba\\". It is insulting to Cuban people everywhere, whether they live in Cuba now or other places. The book seems to say that poverty is something that is fun to look at it and should be photographed. Most of the photographs are too dark or out of focus anyhow. If you want to buy a book about Cuba, get one written by a Cuban."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jefferson and Religion","review":"This book is really good for those wanting to know Thomas Jefferson's view on Christianity. He was not a man who just accepted ideas as fact and over the years weighed the merits of Christianity. He may have not accepted the divinity of the Holy Trinity but Jefferson obviously thought the teachings of Jesus were important for people to learn and follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic score.","review":"It's hard to believe the budget was small for this, considering how big and epic the score sounds. Excellent action cues and perfect sound quality make this a must-buy for action/horror music fans. Mr. Salvay needs more work. It's hard to believe this is the man who gave us the themes to \\"Full House\\" and \\"Family Matters.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This book provides nothing more than a simple overview of what every person involved in a business (from entry-level to executive) should already know. The book provides no additional insight into actually surviving in a fast-paced, competitive and difficult marketplace than you should already have.The book has no solid foundation nor does it provide anything outside of standard, common, well-known, proven practices for building one of your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Borrowed reviews","review":"To borrow from other reviewers I found this book to be \\"engrossing\\" and \\"not overly exciting\\" and \\"a bit slow\\".I enjoyed it enough to give it 4 stars though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I will admit, up front, that my typical reading material is niether historical nor supernatural. And the name \\"Gudrun\\" did not inspire me. Had I not been encouraged by an aquaintence to read this, I would have truly missed out on an exceptional book.Like the work of art for which the book is named, Gudrun's Tapestry is a brilliantly woven masterpiece. Ms. Schweighardt has penned a wonderfully enchanting tale that captures the reader all the way to the last page (and the ironic ending).Five stars really does not do this book justice. I cannot wait to read the rest of Ms. Schweighardt's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUX!!!","review":"She should have left this song alone! Brenda K.

You go girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE CANT SING THIS SONG","review":"This is a beautiful song and was sang beautifully by Brenda K. Starr. Mariah sounds like her voice is straining or she has strep throat or something. She can't hit the notes. That \\"breathy\\" singing style she has isn't working here. The song sounds 10 times better by Brenda K. Starr. Mariah's version sounds like s**t. She should have left this song alone. Also, to those of you who think she is beautiful...get some glasses or a corneal transplant. She's thick waisted with scrawny legs, a flat ass, no hips, a big ass nose and no lips. She looks like the horse in her \\"Butterfly\\" video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah The Most Amazin woman in the universe","review":"Mariah Carey is the only woman in the world that can take my heart with a song.

And I hope you will ever like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still believe that Mariah is still the BEST!","review":"Mariah Carey's star can never be outshone. This single proves again and again that, even with mixed debuts and reviews, she still has the voice to come out fighting. And winning the battle. I loved the song and any other songs she has on offer. All her songs surpass anybody elses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah Sounds Annoying","review":"I usually love Mariah's voice but she sounds really annoying on this song, like she needs to clear her throat or something. Also, you can tell Ms. Carey didn't write this song herself (it's a Brenda K. Starr cover) because the lyrics aren't up to her usual standard. They're boring and not particuarly meaningful. But Mariah's worst is better than some other artists' best, so it's still a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah is the best singer!!","review":"I LOVE HER MUSIC!!

They are all the SAME. They fall on your nerves. In the video of \\"I still believe\\" she tries to be so sexy but you don't get sexy if you try so hard. This all seems to be so artificial and superficial.

The remixes aren't much better, especially the way \\"The King's Mix\\" (available on this CD, but not listed on Amazon's track list) ruins what Mariah managed to make tolerable.The \\"Clean\\" remix is dumb, the \\"Morales classic club\\" is horrendous, and the best thing on here is the \\"Pure Imagination\\" mix, which Mariah seems very well backed up by Da Brat and Krayzie Bone, while still finally holding her own and being GOOD. Thank God she was convinced to do that remix because this cd would've been left with no stars at all otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah has done it again!!!!!!","review":"The album version is amazing, and the remixes are even better!!!!

This song is more beautiful than before, I suggest you buy this Cd just for this song, its incredible. 5. The Kings Mix. Mariah does about 6 minutes worth of what sounds like vocal training. Its pretty decent if you fast forward to where she begins singing. All and all if you're a collector, or just a fan, buy this single, it has some of the best remixes she's done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better By The Song","review":"She gets better and better every song.Miss Mariah has proved that she CAN sing whatever she wants!

The \\"UPC\\" codes in the book that the register is supposed to read do not work properly. My child must line up the arrows on top to get it to even say anything, and most of the time it says something different than what the code is supposed to be for. Another inconvienent thing about this is that there is no storage for all the upc code tags, so they get lost easily. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Save your money and buy a cheaper, less complicated one that kids can just play with without the aggrivation. All kids really want to do is scan things,hear the 'beep' noises, and play with the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Something Else!","review":"This toy does not work well. It doesn't scan the correct item half the time, and it's just not worth the $40 dollars I paid for it. My girls have enjoyed it, but probably only because it talks and sounds like Dora. I usually like to read reviews before I purchase something like this, but I took my 3 year old out on her birthday and this is what we came home with. Please do not support this item and maybe they will revisit and fix it. It has good concepts, but just isn't made well. Read the other reviews about what is wrong with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misile Flush (Oooh, I'm funnie!)","review":"I found this album to be a bit more than one of Boston's gothy, pretensious cries for help, and a bit less than say, a decent Fuzz-guitar rock and rollish groove mixer album. I would not recommend playing at a party, for example unless you wanted lots and lots of people to run away. Some Poet, though pretty, lacks the dynamic it seems to be begging for. The Honey Trip is actually a very nice song - rich and full, yet not long enough. Vanity, the singster is known for her strength, but it is the rest of the band members that really need to be commended on this one. You can really smell the effort on this one. Aside from the melodramatic screeching, these guys really have something going for them. Their subsequent records are a huge improvement, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the two best albums ever.","review":"I love every single on this album: not just the songs themselves, but the unplugged rendition. \\"Like the Weather,\\" \\"What's the Matter Here?\\" and \\"Trouble Me\\" are repeat-winners, songs that could inhabit in my stereo forever. Never has there been an album in which the total product is superb, each song worth the buying the album alone, with the exception to Sarah McLachlan's \\"Surfacing.\\" Natalie Merchant knows how to give a live performance that is even better than the studio. No wonder I had an absolute blast at Lilith Fair this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit flat, but still a great collection","review":"I remember watching the original shortened broadcast of MTV Unplugged on TV before the album was released, and my first thought was that Natalie Merchant sounded tired during this performance. It's understandable, as the Maniacs were playing many dates in late '92 and early '93, but her last album with the Maniacs is also probably the worst. However, worse doesn't always mean \\"bad.\\" This is a nice reworking of some of their back catalog, as well as the surprise hit, a cover of \\"Because the Night,\\" that was worn out by excessive radio play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natalie Merchant and 10.000 Maniacs are SUPERB","review":"As the last CD and video of the 10,000 Maniacs, with Natalie Merchant as their vocalist, she knew how to say 'good bye'. From the very beginning of the video she captures you with her voice. In this video you will hear and see the best of 10.000 Maniacs, until 1992, and you will enjoy the charm and passion of Natalie singing \\"Don't Talk\\", \\"These are Days\\" and what they called the 'stand up song': \\"Stockton Gala Days\\". To see this video is way best than just hear the CD, even though the camera work is not so brilliant. I highly recommend \\"Eat for Two\\", \\"Candy Everybody Wants\\", \\"Trouble Me\\" and \\"Because the Night\\", after that, you will run and buy Natalie's \\"Ophelia\\" and \\"Live in NY\\" videos. Don't miss this opportunity to be delighted with good music. For me was not so easy to have this video, but if you are a truly 10.000 Maniacs fan, this MUST be in your collection, is never too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential CD, you have to own it","review":"This is just a great CD. All of my favorite Maniacs songs are on this CD. I own a number of Maniacs CDs, and this is by far my favorite.A lot of times artists will play around a lot when they play live with the rhythms and sound, and it totally changes the way the songs sound.

This book, as I said previously, would be a good primer for new graduates in what to expect from a workplace other than all the technical why's and where-for's that have been jammed into their heads by theoretical lecturers.Unfortunately not a good resource for someone looking to improve their knowledge base when going for a promotion, and definitely not for those of you freshly promoted and foundering in a sea of paperwork and qc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shape","review":"I received this book promptly and it was in good shape as discribed.

There are some heavy-hitters on board like the Russian Easter Overture and Francesca da Rimini. And, then there are some light-weight pieces like the Overture to Russlan and Ludmilla and the Caucasian Sketches. Other than that, this is an extremely enjoyable disc. Zinman's Russian Easter Overture is OUTSTANDING! It is probably the highlight of the disc. But, Francesca da Rimini rivals it for its display of dark, brooding passions. My only complaint with this disc are the two bookend selections. The opening Overture to Russlan and Ludmilla is torrid but slightly vapid and devoid of depth. The closing Polonaise from Eugene Onegin is bold and stately but missing an element of sweeping elegance. Sound is terrific. A good Russian Grab-bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound clips wrong!","review":"Hey!... sound clips for the Caucasian Sketches by Ippolitov-Ivanov are wrong!In any case, I like the Caucasian Sketches, especially #2 because it is the ending song in the movie Akira Kurosawa's Dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"Sleeves too narrow, flimsy material.

Confidential but it crafts quite a successful film on the same theme of crooked officials, bent cops, and decay beneath the glossy veneer of Los Angeles; the movie runs out of steam a little when it can't find a way to conclude the story, but if you enjoyed the films mentioned above you owe it to yourself to see Eastwood's capable take on this interesting true story.3.5/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut-Wrenching Beauty","review":"All I can say is this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

The story kept me interested and *needing* to know what happened next. Angelina's heartfelt emotions make it easy for the audience to empathize with her plight. The sets and costumes are amazing, the acting superb. All in all another wonderful movie from Eastwood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painful to watch but powerful.","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect form this movie.I really didn't know what it was about.The story is set in the early 1900's.Angelina Jolie is a single mother who comes back home from work one day to discover her child is missing.What follows is heartbreaking and painful.The police give her the wrong kid back.Then the smear campaign against her that follows is simply tragic.I won't give away any more of the story but there is a secondary story that ties in with this one that disturbed me the most.Incredible acting.Brilliant direction.Beautiful score.I really recommend this movie.Sensitive viewers may want to skip this one.It's a powerful movie but incredibly disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"This was a very moving film, i thought it was great. from the opening scenes i loved the realistic looking 1920's LA (not that i was there to see what LA looked like back then..) I'm not a big Jolie fan, but i really think she did an outstanding job in the movie. This is one of the few movies she stars in that i own. This movie is well written & directed, you fall deeply into the story and for me as a mother of two small children i definatly got emotionally involved with the main charecter. All around this is a 5 star buy...the price on amazon is unbeatable, the blu ray quality picture and sound is amazing, and the story/acting ect is awsome. definatly reccommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Changeling'","review":"This is the type of movie that you come away from the cinema and can't stop thinking about.

Highly recommended, the performances are outstanding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Audio Output Form Blu-ray Version","review":"Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Over the Top","review":"I walked out of this film in the theatre.

The worst service I've recieved on amazon!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saint Angelina Is Boring in Melodrama","review":"Angelina's acting is terrible in this film. The role is poorly written to begin with (victimized, saintly mom) but her acting is flat and dead, as if all her real-life kids have drained her energy away. She is dull, listless and her face looks like a wax mannequin's (even before the kid disappeared!) Now that she's famous as a mother, adopting kids from everywhere, Hollywood can't resist trading on her image as Super Mom. Please! Bring back the old Angelina, the wild rebel, the bad girl. Did motherhood ruin her? The story held my interest only because of the real facts of the case are painful to hear. John Malkovich is also totally wasted in this film. Two formerly edgy and risk-taking actors are reduced her to mouthing cliches and indulging in self-righteous poses. What a waste of talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised....","review":"This was better than I expected. I'm not sure why....could be because it is an Eastwood film. He is better behind the camera than he is in front of it. John Malkovich is good as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part Good, part ugly, Jolie bad","review":"Jolie seemed to sleepwalk through her part, a real downer that almost ruined the movie about a relentless mother in a desperate and heart-wrenching search for her missing son. Perhaps she was miscast or just can't act. The story was decent if slow in parts and without much conflict or surprise. Dark and foreboding light had been falling asleep at times. Good try, Clint, but this one didn't quite work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of Lengthy but Good","review":"A long and meaty film that satisfies. Hard to believe it really happened. Highly recommended for an evening's entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infuriating, but true","review":"Pitch-perfect period drama set in 1930s Los Angeles. Angelina Jolie is fantastic and understated as a mother whose son is kidnapped, then law enforcement officials say they've \\"Solved\\" the case and try to get her to accept a different kid as her own.It was so infuriating and implausible (Nobody would do that!) that I had to keep reminding myself, as we are told at the beginning of the movie, that it is based on a true story!This is an old-fashioned \\"movie movie,\\" when movies had stories and plots and characters you care deeply about. Of course, it is a Clint Eastwood joint. We expect nothing less from Mr. Eastwood.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely a great movie!","review":"This was hands down a wonderful movie from the beginning to the end. Every single actor in this movie was superb! Without giving away the story, it saddens me to have seen how easily it was to place someone into a mental institution without a valid reason back then. Without the help of people around you back then or ones who really knew you, you were a target for anyone who had a point to make. In this story the easiest thing to do was to give up, give in and not believe in yourself. The fight was not in everyone back then. This lady fought. I mean ..REALLY FOUGHT HARD! She fought hard for everything she believed in until she got it. I admire the movie makers of this film for stepping out on faith to retell it. It is definitely inspiring and challenges people today to believe and never ever give up. Great movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Changelling in todays world","review":"After watching the Changeling I could not stop and think about what I saw in the movie is what is happening in todays society. Although we do not have the type of ego getters, such as the detective protrayed in the movie, we do have a few detectives who want to take all the glory. Since this country has a missing child alert posted across the country, it takes less time to find a missing child. What happen to the child in this movie still could happen today. As the President of a youth assistance program in Michigan, I have asked everyone that I talk to about the movie to rent it and let me know their thoughts. I thought the movie was realistic in the story line. I give this movie five stars for its content and story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful","review":"This movie was better than I first thought and my hats off to Clint Eastwood and Ron Howard.The movie exposed corruption in the police department in Los Angeles.The corruption is not only still there but in a lot of police departments.The cops who knew about the kidnappings and murders should have received the death penalty themselves.The way Angelie Jolie's character and the women in the mental institution was treated in this movie made me mad.No wonder many people in our country have a hatred towards law enforcement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, Well Acted","review":"I really liked this movie. I am not usually a fan of Jolie, however she did a good job with this. Based on a true story, it is amazing that so much corruption was rampant back in the 1920's.Worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew?","review":"I had wanted to see this film because it was a true story from the late 20's. All I knew it was about a missing child. What I didnt know was how corrupt the LA police force was back then, nor did I know the story about Gordon Stuart Northcott. After watching this film I wanted to know more about Northcott, so I read the book \\"Nothing Is Strange With You\\".I think many folks will be surprised if they look into Northcotts life, and realize that he was not the \\"monster\\" as shown in \\"Changeling\\", but rather just a spoiled, mixed up 20 yr old kid. Its a strange case that few have ever heard of till now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What a shame. They took a really interesting true story and made a lousy movie out of it. By the end of this disappointing film I was so tired of seeing Angelina Jolie in that hat pulled down over her eyes. It's really hard to judge her acting by seeing only her mouth, but in this case, I guess it really doesn't matter. It's not even worth the $3.88 they're charging for it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"I lasted 30 minutes with this mess. The minute she took \\"the boy\\" home I should have turned it off. The minute she saw he was circumcised and kept him anyway I should have turned it off. The minute she was being told by a doctor that kids shrink when they are under stress I DID turn it off.I have to agree with the low reviews that the \\"period\\" seems more like a distraction and a reason for Angelie to play \\"dress up\\" than having any real impact on anything...If this movie is based on a True Story as it says, this mother IMO was too dense to even have a kid, it should have been taken.The script was bad enough but the acting was appalling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jolie is overrated; scenes of graphic child-abuse horrifying","review":"I saw this movie with high expectations, having seen Angelina Jolie in other memorable roles. She under-acts throughout \\"Changeling,\\" and is unconvincing in this true story. She plays a 1920s woman in Los Angeles, Christine Collins, whose nine-year-old son goes missing. Now, I would expect her to be out of her mind with fear, but instead, Jolie whimpers and gets teary-eyed, as if she just suffered a minor scrape. I don't understand director Clint Eastwood's motivation for the graphic depiction of the torture and murder of nine-year-old boys by a sadistic serial killer. Those scenes were horrifying and excessive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again","review":"So this movie was very well written, and seemed to have a really good story behind it. So you ask how do I manage only two stars? Acting my friends or lack there of. This movie is attempting to tell an emotional story that is trying to draw you in. It's like doing The Godfather with Big Bird as Don Corleone. You just can not but into it. I tried to enjoy this because of the story, and the well written movie, but I could not get past the acting. Its just bad, scenes where you are supposed to be drawn to tears, end up have you laughing, or scenes where you are supposed to be enraged, once again laughing, and not as so often put \\"funny ha ha\\" but instead \\"funny oh no\\". I highly reccomend that if you feel you must see this movie for the story, rent it, or get it on demand, but do not buy this, you will be sorry if you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"This was a terrific flick with mystery, police corruption, lost children, and historical accuracy.You will truly feel for the mother in this book, crying along with her as the police ruin her life, which has already been wrecked by her son going missing. This movie accurately shows the attitudes toward women in that time period. Women were considered unstable and to emotional to be of any real value. The corrupt police department preyed on that viewpoint.There are scenes that will make you gasp, ones that will make you cry, and others that will make you want to cheer.Incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mother knows best","review":"I'm surprised I've never heard of this story before being that I'm from california. Angelina Jolie playing the mother role has determined her son is missing, during a time of corruption in the police department a boy resembling her son is returned to her. She immediately recongizes that this is not her son and fights to notify the world that her son is still missing. This movie inspired me to research the story online and it is all completely true. I believe you would be very happy with the purchase of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"We got this book as a companion to 'Our Animal Friends at Maple Hill Farm'. I have to say, I love 'Our Animal Friends' best, but this is also a great book. I like it as a companion to Our Animal Friends. The book goes through the months of the year, and what happens with the animals in each month. Humorous and interresting for our 3 and 7 year olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"The year at mayple hill farm","review":"I had never read this book but the other title by the same authors tempted me to buy it as I loved it so much as a child. This has also proven to be an excellent book with lovely illustrations. The realistic approch to explaining what farm life is like is captivating and the pictures can have a child looking at the fine details for hours. Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond Dogs","review":"This CD holds sentimental memories of a slice in time of carefree teenage dreams threatened by an ominous and foreboding future.\\"We Are the Dead\\" becomes the expression of the culmination of these thoughts and anxious feelings perfectly executed by Bowie haunting lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blast","review":"This brings me right back...I loved this in high school. Still do on re-listen. If you like this album, get the 30th anniversary edition (5 stars) ...the second disc is full of fun goodies. Some of my favorite Bowie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked Awesome Bowie","review":"This is an excellent David Bowie album--dark, apocalyptic, complex. Explores a wide range of emotions and soars from highs to lows. My personal favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of delightful, adolescent, creative, pretentious music","review":"This is a great album but you have to accept it on its own terms. Bowie became obsessed with the novel, \\"1984\\" and wanted to do a musical about it (that is odd enough, isn't it?). The author's estate refused, so Bowie went ahead and did the music anyway and released it as this album. It is one of Bowie's best albums and sounds like a very talented, very creative 17 year old set loose in a recording studio with some great musicians and what he thought was an important piece of art destined to be revered for all the ages. It isn't that, of course-but most very good work is never completed without some degree of passion and self-delusion. Bowie had the passion down alright. This is a rocking, moody, scary album-and it is all great fun at the same time. Join him as he paints his apocalyptic landscape full of decay and totalitarianism. It is well worth the ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamonds are forever!!!","review":"\\"Diamond Dogs\\" is one of the most acomplished albuns of the 70's. It was intended to be a play also. When we listened to it we confirm that immediately.This album is tremendously theatrical and fortunately with no 15 minutes songs on it. It's still a song based album. No weak tracks in here. The only bad thing about this album is that tracks like \\"Diamond Dogs\\" and \\"Rebel Rebel\\" altough excelent rock n'roll numbers, don't fit quite well in here. But RCA (in 1974) wanted some singles so it's understandable. The highlights of this album are \\"Big Brother\\" and \\"1984\\". Musically Bowie was crossing the Atlantic. You can't miss this album, it's absolutely essential to understand his next 2 albuns \\"Young Americans\\" and \\"Station to Station\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"I remember the review header from Rolling Stone magazine was (to paraphrase) : \\" A F@#$ed-up album by a F$#@ed-up person \\". I liked it so much, I must have played it on a daily basis back then. What was yet another change in Bowie's act is in this album he plays ALL the instruments, with the exception of drums. Not being a world class guitarist can be the downfall of a musical work, but not here. The \\"cheapness\\" of the sound adds to the decadent nature of the album; after all, this is NOT a happy-go-lucky singalong. My feeling at the time was that this was Bowie's version of the broadway musical \\"Cabaret\\" - with Bowie singing about the world going down the toilet while giving us a sly wink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"It seems pointless to even read most of the other reviews of this album. Written by slobbering Bowie fans, the five star rating given to Diamond Dogs loses credibility. This album is MEDIOCRE. The last album in the line of Bowie's glam excursion leaves me feeling disappointed. The few tracks that I do like (Diamond Dogs, 1984) just don't stack up to his previous works, which I could listen to all the way through. Don't buy this album. Instead, get The Man Who Sold the World or Ziggy Stardust."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats...\\"","review":"Any day now...the year of the Daimond Dogs.Stange start to the Bowie classics Diamond Dogs, Future Legends speaks of apocalypse and genocide and a nod in the direction of Orwell's 1984. Welll, who could do a concept album like David Bowie? No one. Now the tracks don't exactly follow any predetermined path and the message gets a little garbled, but WTF? It's still Bowie around the height of his song-writing powers. Diamond Dogs is not Ziggy Stardust but it is a step up from Aladin Sane. The glam rocker is in full flight here. Standounts are the title track, Rebel Rebel, Sweet Thing, Canidate & my personal favorite 1984. Tight album with very few blemishes. This is classic Bowie.Dig it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars 4 the Dog Man!!!","review":"Diamond Dogs is perhaps the weirdest Bowie ablum I ever bought, but I love it and it's worth the money! Bowie dose great vocals and the instrumental bit is good too....and the weird imagrey on the cover and in the centerfold is fun to stare at and gose with the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent and disappointing","review":"Some of the songs are quite good, but some of them are weak and/or performed without much punch. Up to this point in Bowie's career, it had sounded like he was trying as hard as he could to deliver high quality, but this album sounds to me like he was putting out a rushed or half-hearted effort. The title song for example could have been an excellent Rolling Stones imitation, but deteriorates into messy excess and gets off track. This album just isn't all that good! It's not enjoyable to listen to all the way through, and that is not because it is challenging or avant garde in some way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second time I buy it","review":"This is a video that I share with friends and family over and over again.

Due to time limitations, and its broad subject, it lacks some scholarly depth. I could have done without the sensationalistic \\"end of days\\" stuff and the spooky music - at times it was reminiscent of the old \\"In Search Of\\" show with Leonard Nimoy. Nevertheless, the scholarship seems solid and the conclusions range from the merely interesting to the truly amazing (and maybe a little disconcerting).Definitely worth a viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well done.","review":"Not a basketful of unsupported and outrageous claims, but Biblically based assertions that the orator acknowledges may not be the only explanation. A person can follow along in the Old Testament and cross-reference with secular history documents, to see that there are spine-tingling correlations here, especially with regard to members of the lost tribes returning to Israel as foretold in prophecy as a prelude to end-time events. Are all the assertions correct? Maybe, maybe not. But this video is worth your time and research if you are a student of Biblical prophecy.

This CD is not what I would call quality music for my daughter. The girls can't sing. Most girls are able to sing off-key renditions of their favorite songs on their own. Another problem is the girls themselves. I would not call shoving someone into a pre-packaged cliche encouraging independence. And why is there not a Smart Girl among the bunch? Or even a black girl?

Although I enjoy the Tchaikovsky, especially the final movement, his playing of the Saint-Saens is utterly incredible. From the first to the last notes, it is one of the most captivating recordings.

It's still a very important work that must be collected and listened to if you are a true fan of the man who likes to call himself, The Little Idiot. It represents Moby at his finest in techno and in ambient. Move is a great techno song and the remix may be better than the original. All That I Need Is To Be Loved which would be on his Everything Is Wrong CD as a hard/punk rock track gets an electric techno mix to it (I love this version instead of the one on EIW). The Rain Falls and the Sky Shudders is a great ambient track that is only rivaled by God Moving Over the Face of the Waters when it comes to his ambient pieces. Yea, maybe there are only 6 tracks on this EP, but with 4 of them being unbelievable tracks that only Moby can do, you owe it to yourself, especially if you are a fan of the techno/electronica/trance genre, to pick up this diamond in the rough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Past Times","review":"This has to be the best work that moby has ever done.I remember in my band a few years back, moby was the one musician that got our lazy buts up and recording.Ive been trying for 4 years to find this album (name) and I have finally found it.This will deffinetly be listen to repeditevly for years to come.Everyone in america should have this album, because it brings on a type of spirituality that not many other bands can give."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyler Travis \\"Moby-Move\\"","review":"I just got this today and I'm already in love.

This was arguably the most dull and boaring performance of this masterpiece I've ever heard. And I've heard this piece of music countless times. The only reason I listened to it to completion was to find out who had done such an extraordinary job in destroying it. If there's one thing Wagner fans will all agree on it's that his music needs to sound spectacular. Certainly that's what Wagner expected. And with terrific performances by Solti ( Chicago symphony) and Barenboim (Chicago Symphony and Berlin Phil)and Tennstedt ( Berlin Phil) living up to Wagner's standard, it is easy by comparison to hear what a disaster this Lopez-Cobos performance is. It is certainly not the fault of the excellent Cincinnati Orchestra. This dud can be laid solidly at the feet of the conductor.For Wagner as it should be heard, get any of the recordings I mention above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had been told how good these vacuum cleaners were. I purchased one for my wife 2 years ago. They included a small hand held vacuum at no charge. The XL upright is very noisy, hard to push on average carpet with no height adjustment. I had a free tune up at the dealer the first year and the parts cost more than a new Hoover. The hand held vacuum is advertised to have so much suction it will hold a bowling ball. Before the first bag was full, it wouldn't pick up anything - almost no suction. I changed bags and checked to make sure nothing was plugging up the hose, but there was little improvement. The canister is worthless. On the positive side, there is no dust smell when vacuuming with this machine.

In the meantime she had met Waldo Roderick DeHammersmith who was a pimp. He made her promises of getting her name up in lights but instead got her hooked on dope and working the ho strolls of Hollywood. Michael still loved her and searched for her. Alas it was too late she had O'Ded and he and Roederick shook hands over her grave. Some of these songs were on the original album but I want the first one with the songs Charlotte and Waldo Roderick Dehammersmith on it.

I had the pleasure of meeting and interviewing Rory after a show at Toad's Place near Yale U in the late 70s, on the \\"Top Priority\\" tour, absolutely smoking performance.

Beau Bridges portrayed the adult PT Barnum in the movie, which also was an attraction for me. The film itself, starts out with the young PT, teenaged working in a small store. His entrepreneurship was evident even then, and the character was an engaging one. As I became attached to him, and his experiences, I began to see how closely his movements and actions resembled Beau Bridges, and thought to myself \\"this'll be a wonderful transition to adulthood\\". Of course, as you might have guessed by now, it was indeed another Bridges, I'm guessing the son of Beau. Beyond the acting, learning the story of the builder of Madison Square Garden, The Greatest Show on Earth, and innumerable other oddities and phrases, made this a most engaging film.

I like the Fratres series because it they have a serene but though penetrating harmony, It's just like instrumental choir music with an immense polyphony. P?rt throws with voices in this piece. It's also a prove of his faboulous tintinabully-composing style. Together with the other pieces, P?rt delivers us a freezing album which has an enormous impact on you in silent moments of your life.

(Mostly on minor details like dates.) Law offers a few terse observations and insights of the man's life, but not really until the very last 10 pages of the book. The most glaring and offensive thing about this book is how poorly it is edited: simple mistakes (like spelling \\"Ursula\\" \\"Ursual\\" or \\"their\\" instead of \\"there\\") dot almost every single page, making this book seem even more amateurish. I suggest picking up Castle's memoirs instead... they're much more entertaining and better written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy Castle Tribute","review":"The author's obvious love of Castle's horror work comes through. While the book doesnt offer great detail of Castle's other works, his horror classics are well detailed.

The book also has some rare photos and is a great option since Castle's own autobiography hasnt been in print for years. In fact, this is actually the only biography ever done on Castle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"Even though this entire book is available online, I find it useful to own it.

Tangible images for movement like the \\"horse\\" posture and \\"picking up a baby\\" give readers something to latch onto that will help them mentally and physically integrate the movement. The disease in question, elements that can cure it, and the dynamics of how patients cope with it are incredibly complex - yet Argue manages to deliver beneficial commentary on all three consisely, compellingly, and even joyfully. In addition, the hope in his tone is just as important for patients in healing as the exercises he delivers. For all of these reasons I highly recommend this text for any Parkinson's Disease patient or carer seeking alternative, yet conclusively effective, methods for stemming the progression of this disease."},{"rating":"1","title":"First song was great, but what happend then???","review":"The Femmes kick this album off right, with \\"Don't Start Me on the Liquor\\". A catchy, up-tempo song with that same vintage Femmes sound that we all know and love from their self-titled debut. This track also showcases the remarkable bass playing abilities of Mr. Brian Ritchie. (Possibly one of the most under-rated bass players in rock music!) Unfortunately I was a bit let down after that song, because the album takes on a completely different direction. It's a new wave kind of vibe featuring synthesizers and some other obscure instruments. I wonder if the lead off track was an older song that they had never released, and then just decided to put it out then since they were doing another record. As a fan of the band I can respect that they were trying something new, but unfortunately it didn't work well on this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly, UGLY, UGLY!","review":"This is an absolutely useless CD, like most fo their albums after 3.

You seriously sweat a bunch, she knows what she is talking about. It boosts your metabolism and you seriously burn a bunch of fat. Although after doing this video for quiet sometime it gets boring to do 5 days a week, but once you start working out you won't want to stop. I've even had some struggles and would pig out late at night but still did the workout and STILL lost weight or maintained it. After doing this video your just one step closer to getting to your goal weight and after doing it you feel so relieved. Seriously Jillian Michaels is amazing and this DVD makes me drip sweat and that rarely happens for me during other workouts. Please get this DVD you will not be sorry! But you cannot give up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Workout","review":"This is a wonderful workout and a great addition to my exercise DVD collection. I have been doing the Jillian Michaels Shred DVD but since it is only 20 minutes I would also do another exercise video or go for a run. This workout is longer in length and still high energy. I keep coming back to this DVD as I don't get bored with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WORKOUT!","review":"This is a great Jillian workout. I have this set of her DVDs and I can see results. I have lost 18 pounds in less than two months. Twenty more pounds and I will be at my goal.I thought I read somewhere in a review that a 'step' is required-it is not. All you need for this set of three DVDs are hand weights and a mat if you are on a hard surface, however the hand weights are not required for this DVD.I never really thought I would be able to get these results, but with Jillian's meal plan and these DVDs I can actually lose weight (and it really isn't even that hard)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working toward a goal","review":"This video is for a fairly fit person who likes to do an old school calisthenic workout.

I list weight immediately and toned up too ! VerySimple, yet i was sweating, it works your whole body !"},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout","review":"First time buying an exercise DVD. Good choice. Hard workout (but not too hard for anyone who regularly works out at gym classes.) Suggestions: remember you can modify any moves (harder or easier). If you're a beginner: don't hesitate to hold on to a chair back, when needed. Cool Down: stretching is very important, especially as you get older. I prefer to do my own version of a cool down, which takes a little longer & is more thorough than what's on this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good home workout","review":"This is a great video if you like to mix up your workouts.

OH MAN i did that earlier today for the first time and it put me in my place REAL FAST. i thought i was doing pretty great because Level 2 of the 30 Day Shred wasnt having the same sweating effects on me anymore and when i tried Level 3 for the first time- it wasnt as bad as i thought... so i pop in Banish Fat and oooooh by the end of the 40 min video my legs were shaking and my world was spinning. I was literally laying on the hard tile floor wondering if i would even bother doing this again. i did the whole video but i did not like it one bit. BUT I know what i want. I want to have endurance and a great body. so now i have the tools to get there, and i am going to use them. THIS IS A HARDCORE 'GET THE BEST BODY U COULD EVER IMAGINE' DVD! so i leave with this:I LOVE AND HATE YOU JILLIAN MICHAELS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-jessica"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video for advanced exercisers","review":"I loooove this video! Jillian's workouts are so challenging, I feel my heart rate monitor is going to explode!The best part about this dvd is that I find it is slightly low impact, while still managing to keep my heart rate up. There isn't as much bouncing, jumping, etc but I am still working out strong, which I cannot claim for a lot of low impact dvd's.The only concern I have is about the overuse of certain muscles. Both this dvd and the 30 day shred have a lot of exercises that involve bearing your weight on your arms (like mountain climbers.) For me, I develop forearm pain from the strain of doing too many of these exercises, no matter how much I try to strengthen this area. So, if this is a weakness for you too, try substituting some of these exercises with ones you can do standing, like jumping jacks for example. This seems to help me with the risk of overusing my forearms.But all in all, great workout, this one is definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for New Moms.","review":"I have tried a few of Jillian Michaels DVDs in the past but this one is by far my favourite. I have a young baby at home and love the options to either do the full work out or choose circuits. I have weak ankles and fairly bad knees and yet this DVD doesn't affect them at all, some of her others have left me unable to walk. I am not overweight but I am unfit, so I find this is just the right amount of push to get me sweaty and burn some extra calories. I also see a difference in my tummy just after a week of use. I feel pumped and motivated. I do find her back-up girls a bit irritating, but I generally try to ignore them and stick with Jillian. I also find Jillian is less grating in this DVD than she is in others. She feels more supportive and less nagging, ha ha. I would recommend this DVD to anyone just starting out who doesn't have time or money to hit the gym, or for those who fear the gym. No extra equipment needed and you don't need a lot of space to move. Perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to it's title","review":"I own several workout and kickboxing videos.

But, Lord, help me! This was one tough workout. It felt great. I thought perhaps I would not be able to move the day after, but I was fine. I have not sweated this hard in a long time. I would have given this 5 stars but Jillian says on the video, \\"this is not your mother's workout...\\" HA! Little does she know, this grandma was doing it! I had to march in place in some spots but for the most part I managed. I am looking forward to doing it until I CAN DO the whole thing! Thanks Jillian, you are one tough mutha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice and strong workout","review":"I really loved it is very complete, in 40 minutes you get to exercise your whole body. The only thing to take into account is that in my personal experience in one of the circuits the exercises are way too dificult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cardio Workout","review":"I just got this video to supplement my other two Jillian videos (Banish Fat and 30 Day Shred w/ weights). I typically take classes at my local Y but being a busy working mom, I can't seem to get there lately. I would give this video about a 'medium' intensity level compared to the classes that I have taken at the Y. I love the middle part where she is doing burpees and mountain climbers (they are killer and I can't do the whole thing), but I think that it starts out a little slow. The end is good too where you do the floor exercises - my arms are pretty sore the next day. I would say that if you are used to hour long cardio/strength classes at your local gym, then you may find this video a little short on the length of intensity. I would just up the intensity by adding light weights during some of the circuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout","review":"I have had this workout for about three weeks. I work out in the morning so on weekdays I don't have time to do a whole 55 minutes. So I do 30 day shred on weekdays amd this on the weekends. I think the moves are tough and it definitely is a butt kicker. I miss the weights and although the moves are familiar, she has confuses me by changing the names of some of the exercises. Not a big deal though. I like the toughness of the workout and Jillian's attitude about exercise. Direct without mincing works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still burning!","review":"I started the program yesterday and I have to tell you that I'm still feeling the effects.

It totally kicks butt, gets me sweating and she doesn't repeat moves over and over which is one of the most important things in a workout. I plan on trying more of her DVDs in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout!","review":"if you are a jillian fan, you'll love this workout; it doesn't disappoint on delivering a great cardio workout that's varied and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"great exercises","review":"I started this dvd after finishing the 30 day shred. I like the exercises a little bit of kick boxing. A little bit of this and that. Uggghhh I hate the burpees. Anyway if you are intermediate level I say get this. I prefer the girls from 30 day shred over the girls in this dvd personality wise. I started doing only 30 min. of this dvd and then when I was ready would add doing it for 40 min. since I was used to the 25min. from 30 day shred. I'm pretty sure this workout goes longer than what it says I've timed it and Jillian just keeps going with her exercises. One thing I noticed is she doesn't have you using any handweights for this dvd which I was used to from the 30 day shred. So I implemented them myself not wanting to lose any muscle. Overall I am happy with the dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"ive been working out to this for two weeks now i needed it on DVD cause my cable company is like way to expensive it came at the time it said it would i love UPS and i might buy more of her dvds i like how shes like come on push it out i like being yelled at by beautiful women i love the torcher"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"This is a really good workout. I have done Insanity and a couple of the circuits in this workout do Insanity moves. Very hard for a beginner...I don't consider myself a beginner and it is still difficult for me to get through the whole thing without taking a break or two. Doesnt get boring. Love it...love Jillian! It is almost an hour so after this I feel like I've done a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"At 51 who would have thought!","review":"that I could even attempt to do this. Had it been any other instructor I would have quit -- but Jillian just pushes me like no other video (DVD) instructor does (hate her)...... my endorance, focus, whatever is ten fold ------ yes this is like her others but if Jillian can motovate you it does not matter what DVD you pick she will push your buttons (if she is the one you need now) -- If I do several weeks of her DVD's ( and I have several) I blow through some of my tried an trues ----- without working out a sweat. Don't get me wrong my tried and trues still can get the heart rate up! LOL but not for nothing I can tell the difference. Funny if I take a week or two off (yes I know at my age that is such a big no no) I can not just pop this in and bang through it ---- no way I have to have my endorance up before I plug this in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Butt-kicking cardio","review":"I already had the 30 Day Shred DVD, but I really wanted a workout that was entirely cardio. Thankfully, Jillian delivers a heart-pounding aerobic workout in only 40 minutes. Before this DVD, I considered myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser; I workout 5-6 days a week, including weightlifting, cardio, and rock climbing. But I have always hated cardio and find it too boring to really challenge myself.Compared to the 30 Day Shred, Jillian has a much more developed style. She gives better cues and more fully explains why the exercises are paired. Jillian is also really engaging, but after the first 2 circuits I had to stop and catch my breath. I think there are few people out there who will not be challenged by this workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready to work!","review":"I have the 30 Day Shred and the No More Trouble Zones and alternate them with this video. I call this the harder one of the three. I have tried to loose weight before and by alternating Jillian's workout DVD's I am finally seeing results. I've recommended these to other people and they too have seen results. Look for my other reviews on Jillian's products. She rocks and so do her workouts!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Mom's Workout","review":"Jillian does an amazing job with this workout, although I agree with others who say that she talks too much. The music is a little \\"blah\\" too, so I mute her and play my own music.I did 30 Day Shred for 30 days before starting this workout, and know that there is NO way in the world that I could have gone from sitting on the couch to completing this workout in one day. However, now that I am moderately fit I find the workout challenging and doable.For 60 days I have been eating well and doing Jillian Michaels workouts, and my body is completely transformed. This DVD is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG fabulous workout!!!!","review":"Okay, I have never really been into the Biggest Loser or even the 30 day shred video. I have tried them but I never could figure out what the hype was about but this workout Boost Metabolism definitely was AWESOME! I actually found it on Exercise TV and my kids (age 8 and 5) even loved it. They did almost all of it with me and that NEVER happens. I also tried No More Trouble Zones yesterday and it was also really good. I am sore everywhere today. I burned 350 calories with No More Trouble Zones and 425 calories with Boost Metabolism. I will definitely be purchasing these. I LOVE these workouts and I am highly impressed and I look forward to doing them again and again.

I wouldn't say it's toooo terrible but if you have any weakness in your joints you should be really cautious with this workout. There is a LOT, a LOT LOT LOT of jumping, very high impact exercise. One circuit is 100% jumping which is very hard on your knees and ankles. I stopped using this DVD after developing cysts in my knees. They went away in about a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great way to injure yourself","review":"Every time I used this video, I either flared up an old ankle injury or end up injuring a knee-there's lots of jumps and spins. I don't mean just jumping jacks or running in place, which is fantastic, I means crazy jumps where you spin around or click your heels together. There are parts of the work-out that I love because it's cardio-heaven, but that's only about half."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT workout!","review":"I've been using the 30-Day Shred (as part of my larger overall workout routine) for a few months. I absolutely LOVE it and LOVE Jillian, so I was excited to hear about the new DVDs. I ordered this one, as well as 'No More Trouble Zones.' I should have them in a day or two. I found 'Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism' on Exercise TV last night and tried it. Wow! A GREAT workout! I love Jillian's 'Personal Trainer' style. I much prefer her style of workout over the more 'dancy' stuff that's out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Work Out","review":"I purchased Jillian's DVD after reading her book \\"Making the Cut\\". I wanted to see how to do some of the excercises described in the book. What I like most is, she explains why you are doing the excercise, demonstrates the proper way to do it and tells you what you should be feeling. It is like having a personal trainer, working with you. Believe me I have had a personal trainer, so this is me much better. The workout will make you sweat and you will get results, if you are willing to follow. I have purchased 3 of her DVD's for some variety and gave one to a friend. My friend absolutley loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michaels kicks butt!!","review":"Amazing video! I didnt get bored with this one as easy as the 30 day shred. She switches it up frequently and keeps me going"},{"rating":"2","title":"love love love it!!","review":"Amazing workout! You will sweat like no other! The only thing is that it has quite a bit of jump training and high impact moves, so it's not for someone who has lower body injuries. But, if you want something to work you until you can't work anymore, buy this DVD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"User Friendly But Killer Cardio - No Equipment Necessary","review":"Finally, a workout video that requires only you, comfortable workout clothes, and a great pair of sneakers, and determination. It is a 40-mins workout consisting of 7 6-minute circuits. Don't let the easy to follow routines fool you, this workout burns!! And it works. Stay consistent (at least 4-5 days a week) and you'll see an improvement as I have, with the proper diet (see Jillian's website). For beginners I recommend pacing yourself & doing a few circuits at a time until you are able to do all the routines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Advanced Workout","review":"If you can make it through the whole 60 minute workout congratulations you're awesome!Let me put it this way for you...If I did this workout everyday for a week I swear I would lose every single unwanted pound...I'd be dead of course...but at least I would look outstanding for my funeral.This workout is not for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much jumping","review":"With this video, you jump around so much, I can't do it while my husband is sleeping - I wake him up! I can't even imagine doing this in an apartment building - you're neighbors would hate you! This video is also really bad for anyone who has any knee issues - you simply jump too much.Also - I am not a novice exerciser. I work out every morning before work for about 1 hour - jogging, yoga or exercise videos. I do the 30-day shred videos when I am short on time and I like those- but one hour of that die-hard intensity is too much for a regular workout several days a week. It is great if you want a video to really kick up the notch of your exercise occasionally - but on a regular basis I think it is just too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yogamama","review":"LOVE JILLIAN and this workout was really fun and really hard.

Definitely may be for the more advanced...although she does provide alternative moves for beginners...Great workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"This video is great for a cardio workout that beats the boring gym routine. I wish it were a little more intense. After the third time I felt I could be pushed harder. I work out pretty regularly, though, so that may be why I need more intensity. Otherwise, I like the way the cardio routimes are broken down into sections and I like Jillian. She's really motivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will change your body!","review":"I love Jillian and her workouts! I did 30 Day Shred before ordering this. This has some of the same moves as 30 Day Shred. You are constantly moving for the entire 40 minutes, and the exercises are all different. It isn't something I would have thought of doing before watching. If you've heard of P90X and their muscle confusion technique, this is similar. You don't use weights at all in this DVD. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Butt kicking","review":"I always knew Jillian Michaels could deliver results, but I can attest to it personally now.

THIS workout, on the other hand, is really tough (in a good way)! Be prepared, there's a lot of high impact moves, squatting and jumping, so beginners may find this a little too challenging. But if you're looking for a workout that will really kick your butt in the cardio department, this is it! I also like that there's the option of doing the workout without her instruction, just music, so once you've learned the routine you can do it without the chatter. One weird thing, in the \\"bonus\\" section of the DVD, Jillian is hawking Oral B toothbrushes. It's definitely strange, and the video would be better without it. That said, it's not as if you have to watch it (or I ever have to watch it again), so it's not a reason not to buy the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great butt kicker","review":"This is the cardio sister of no more trouble zones. This workout runs a little over 50 minutes. This video requires no weights and is largely targeted at cardio conditioning and body toning. I have used this video for months and it continues to be one of my favorites because it is a fabulous workout for those of us in pretty decent physical shape. The workout is based on 6 minute circuits that each center on different sections of the body. This one will make you sweat and feel fantastic at the end. There are modifications for beginners through advanced.Its hard to find workouts that are not too easy and boring. If you are looking for a more challenging video, this is a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, calorie burning workout!","review":"Just did this DVD for the first time and I am drenched in sweat! I am a long time fan of Jillian, and she outdid herself with this.I am a regular exerciser, working out 5 days a week both cardio and weights. I wear a heart rate monitor when I workout to monitor the number of calories I burn, and during the 50 minute Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism workout, I burned over 400 calories.Jillian keeps your heart pumping for the entire 50 minutes through a series of kickboxing, old-school calesthenics and some core work. I travel frequently for my job, and was also able to complete this DVD in my hotel room and without any equipment other than my own body weight.I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for heart pumping, calorie burning workout they can complete with no equipment and in a small space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Approach with caution","review":"This video has great exercises in it, however, there are several that can be hard on your knees and joints if you are not in great shape to begin with. Jillian does not show low-impact versions of these. Other than that, it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"This is by far the best workout dvd I've tried. I've used this with my heart rate monitor on and when I do the entire work out I can burn up to 600 calories. It is tough to get through the first few times but the good this is they break it up into chapters so if you only want to do 20 or 30 minutes that day it's easy.My only issue is there are a lot of jumping exercises and as a person with a knee problem I cannot use this everyday without injury. So my advice to anyone with knee of leg issues is to give yourself a day of rest in between or modify the exercises to do squats instead of jumps (which Jillian actually suggests). Other than they it's great. My endurance has improved 90% since starting this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butt-kicker","review":"Just adding my two cents this workout will kick your butt and make you sweat. I did this for the first-time today and got through the entire workout, but was more at the beginner level with some of the moves (like scissor kicks). I also had to stop a couple of times, thought I'd pass out. I've also tried Jillian's 30-day Shred, awesome workout and next workout to do is No More Trouble Zones. I really like Jillian. She's a little gruff, but you'll get results if you stick with her! I've got about 10 lbs to lose and will update with my results. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome cardio workout","review":"I regularly do Ripped in 30 and 30 DS, but those are my \\"workday\\" workouts when I don't have much time. BFBM, along with No More Trouble Zones, are the workouts I do when I have the luxury of more than 30 minutes. Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism is mostly cardio - no weights needed and just one circuit of ab work. Other reviews have said that Circuit 2 is the hardest, but I find Circuit 6 to be the killer, maybe because it's so far into the workout and I've been working so hard for so long by that point! Jillian is much easier to listen to in this one, not so brash (even though I don't mind that on her other videos). I like that the red-headed backup exerciser actually sweats! Like me! This is a great workout that you won't regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT! Jillian is my new favorite!","review":"I am an avid excerciser and I workout 6-7 days a week. I had finished my second round of Turbo Fire which is nothing but cardio when I got bored and decided that I needed something new. I had this DVD in my collection so I busted it out and even after feeling like I was in good shape, this DVD made me feel like I had never worked out before. It was so challenging in a good way and now I am hooked! I started rotating this one with No More trouble Zones and I immediatley started seeing changes in my body. I would wake up in the morning more toned! It is amazing. Get it, Do it, You will love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cardio workout","review":"After a disappointing experience with No More Trouble Zones on Monday, I wasn't holding my breath for this one. I was relieved when I felt like I was getting a good workout with this DVD.Things I like about this DVD:1. Fairly easy to modify the moves.2. Music was tolerable to okay.3. Heart was pumping the entire time.Things I didn't like:1. Still rough on the knees, but I've done enough Jillian workouts to have figured out heart pumping substitutes or modifications.I still prefer 30DS, but I'll keep this DVD in rotation for days that I'm not running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workout!","review":"I'm in good shape/healthy weight and am a runner training for a half marathon in the spring. I got this for cross training and to help build muscle and tone up further. Woo boy! You'll definitely sweat and get your heart rate up there. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good workout, not too hard","review":"A good solid workout you can do in segments, or the full 40 minutes, and they recommend it 2 x per week. I did not find them that challenging, I liked the music, and the set was very plain, the filming too. I would have thought she would be a bit more motivating is my only complaint.The commentary did not really add that much to it--you can work out with a version with it turned off. A solid DVD to change up your workout if you want some deep training with supersets, low impact, you can do any time without rupturing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Workout!!","review":"This workout is great! I have been trying to work on heart rate interval training to lose those last post baby pounds and this had me in zones 2 and 3 the whole time. The best part about this workout is that there is not a weight in sight. You use your own body weight which is very effective! I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I love Jillian, and I am an avid follower of hers. I own the 30 Day Shred, and I am a member of her website. I must say, though, I was completely dissappointed by these two new DVDs. This one in particular. I did not feel like this was much of a workout comapared to what she usually does. I feel like the segments were too slow to really make a difference. After I did this video, I went for a run just to finish my workout, however, after the 30 Day Shred Video, I am dead! I think that if you want a longer workout, it would be more beneficial to do two circuits of the 30 day shred rather than this video. I was not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for beginners/intermediates","review":"Jillian Michaels is great at motivating. She does a great job at grading the exercises too. It's nice to see her occasionally have to take a break or comment that even she cramps with some of the movements!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome way to work out with your wife!","review":"This is the best way to work out and get close to your wife at the same time. It's hard but it's worth it. If you follow it to the T it works. Just don't give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"If you stick with the video, it does make you sweat, but it is so boring I am not motivated to punish myself through the workout again. I like videos that make me sweat and challenge both my cardiovascular endurance and muscular endurance... But I want the video to be fun and engaging so I don't dread coming back to the workout again... This video is one that I would dread coming back to. It is challenging, but not much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, well rounded workout","review":"Good, efficient workout that includes arms, legs and core...and gets the heart really pumping!! The music is pretty bad, as others have reported. Do it a few times with the sound, so you can get the instruction. Then, mute the tv and use your ipod - much better! The workout is good enough, however, that i would recommend it even with the bad music. If you are a beginner, the moves can be modified until you build more endurance and strength. This one will make you sweat!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this was HUMBLING!!!","review":"Let me say this...I have been steadily exercising for a few years now, but over the holidays I have been feeling a little sluggish. I bought this DVD and thought it would be a 'nice' addition to my workout routine. There's nothing 'nice' about this DVD...this kicked my BUTT! I was huffing and puffing by the first 20 minutes - and soaked! I was very impressed and I know I'll be super-sore tomorrow. My sister and I are planning on starting the 30 Day Shred on Sunday, but I might alternate every other day with this DVD. I'll continue doing this throughout the rest of the week. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WORKOUT!","review":"This workout is absolutely great!!! Jillian knows her business very well! The only bad thing about this workout is that some circuits have a lot of jumps... my knees complain about it a bit, but that's ok. Still a wonderful exercise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unpleasant","review":"The video is of low production quality. The whole scene is set up in the corner of some random gym room. The photography is poor. There is no background music.

This and Pericoli's \\"The City Out My Window\\" are just the ticket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes Straight to DVD doesn't mean its ab bad movie","review":"I watched this movie because I had a free code for Redbox; I was scanning videos and I thought that this was a good premise for a movie. I agree with another reviewer that the ending was somehow less than what I expected, however, it also was one of those endings that leads the viewer to come to their own conclusion. You have nine people in a room and the truth is that they know each other, but they don't know how they know each other. On the surface, this is a suspenseful movie; underneath that, its a lesson about how the choices we make in life, affect the lives of others. Great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great thriller --- without an ending","review":"This movie is one of the best thrillers I have seen in years. Tight, fast moving, intense drama. The film makers only made one critical error --- they left out the ending. It's like they ran out of money or something and simply said 'okay, that's a wrap'.With an ending, ANY ending, I would have given this film a 5 star rating. Alas, I can only give it 1 star for being one of the most frustrating films I have ever wasted 2 hours of my life on.Give this one a miss ... if you're not into frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the eff was the ending?","review":"Ok, film makers, I know you read these reviews:Where was the ending? That was lame as hell.The movie was good but you ruined it with no ending.How can I recommend a movie to anyone when it just ends?Weak as hell. You should be ashamed.Would have been a solid three stars (and a recommendation) with an ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure, it's a bit of a Saw clone...","review":"but without the grisliness and without most of the characters knowing they did anything wrong in the situation. I didn't like the fact that at least one of the kidnapped parties had no real connection to the death, but the relationship he had with another certainly created some drama, so I can excuse that. The complaint that the kidnapper couldn't possibly have known how these people were related, either, seems pointless to me, because you don't think about that while you're watching it, or if you do, you're probably watching movies for the wrong reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this","review":"Save your money. Go get Netflix. This movie is available there as a Watch Instantly title. It's worth watching, but be prepared for a colossal disappointment in the abrupt ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative but interesting except the ending was a total fail!","review":"First, I see a lot of people comparing this to Saw and other movies within the last 5-10 years. I'm going to show my age and compare it to Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None or Ten Little Indians, which is where Saw comes from IMO. But since I knew going in that this was a new version of an old story, that didn't bug me too much. It was an interesting story up to a point, putting the woman who couldn't speak English in was silly to me, how can she participate to save her life when she can't understand anyone and no one can understand her? Despite that, I have to admit that the story did keep me interested, but the ending IMO totally sucked, i.e. the last 30 seconds or so. Up until that point, I thought the movie derivative but decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valet","review":"I was just what I was looking for so that small items don't roll around in the draw.My husband liked it very much"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect size","review":"This Bead Profile Exterior Door Rail And Stile Shaper Cutter Set does not fit 1 3/4\\" doors.

'Station to Station' ditches the Philly Soul of 'Young Americans' in favor of a mix of electronics, soul, rock, and pop material. The title track manages to mix them all together, and though it lasts too long, it was a daring choice to begin an album. \\"Golden Years\\" and \\"TVC15\\" work excellently as well, and were the singles here, but \\"Stay\\" and \\"Word On a Wing\\" (a wonderful, heartfelt plea to God) are just as great. There is also a cover in \\"Wild is the Wind.\\" Though it was a transitional album and not as well developed in its ideas, 'Station to Station' remains an excellent album, and marks the point where Bowie realized once again his talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowie's ONLY Complete Materpiece","review":"I think he's had some better individual songs but this thing is his only truely killer album.

And it really is his greatest song you know..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of late 70s rock","review":"This is one of the greatest Bowie albums. And yes, he was on drugs, making this album all the more remarkable. A hard rock funk creation that bridged Bowie's glam era with his new age art rock period, Station to Station grinds into the rock pantheon. The soaring, epic title track, the still-popular \\"Golden Years\\", awesome \\"Stay\\", every track on this album is a gem to behold. The two ballads, in particular, showcase the extent of Bowie's vocal talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Step Closer To Sobriety..","review":"\\"Young Americans\\" wasn't a good album. He gets credit for venturing into soul, but for me it didn't work. On this album, though, he has a lot of R&B elements, but they somewhat echo his future works with Brian Eno and the \\"Berlin Trilogy.\\"The songs are very catchy, and some of them are even eerie (but we haven't gotten to Warszawa yet), but sometimes it is a challenge to sit through this record in one sitting. \\"TVC15\\" is my least favorite song on the album, and sometimes his crooning on \\"Word On A Wing\\" is something of an acquired taste, but it is a very rewarding listen overall, and after releasing this album, Bowie got clean for good. After the misstep of Young Americans, Station to Station is a very worthy comeback."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATNESS OF BOWIE","review":"One of my favorite Bowie discs, with one of his best tracks in 'Station to Station'. Mixed in with the style of 'Golden Years', the funky 'Stay' with its contagious chorus, the melancholy 'Wild is the Wind' and erratic 'TVC 15', this CD is great! He had a tight band at the time, vocal delivery is excellent and the whole thing comes together nicely. The re master sounds excellent as well. I love this stage of Bowie. Along with Low and Lodger, the late mid-late 70's were very creative for himWhy 4 stars then? - I just hate the fact that there are only 6 tracks. Always have hated that. But all of them are quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throwing darts in lovers...","review":"1976 was the one of the major highlights featuring David Bowie music. He managed to create some great songs on this album; including the overlong but powerful Station to Station, the Greatest Hits song Golden Years, TVC15, and the light disco of Stay. Plus, Wild Is the Wind was on Changesbowietwo, the second Greatest Hits album. The least popular song is Word On A Wing, starting out good, but a little too uneeded. All in all it's a great album that will shake the boots of most Bowie fans, as the Thin White Duke sings one of his most unspespected kind of album, a one that reveals his talents as a songwriter/performer. Notice the cover of Station to Station (and Low) is a part from 1976's The Man That Fell To Earth (also starring Bowie as an alien)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit weird","review":"A little bit of a funny album. sounds like he's on drugs or drunk or something. not a patch on let's dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Say Yes......","review":"Just say yes to this album, and its brother show, however go for Show [UK], which includes all tracks except for the encore; which I wish so much had been included. I highly recommend you purchase the video versions of both; hearing The Cure live is itself excellent, but seeing it simotaneously is brilliant. I personally do not agree with the editorial provided by this site, Show and Paris are both equally good albums, mere differnet selections. Paris gathering up the older Cure classics while Show endulges us into the bands second phase which grew out of Head on the Door. Let us not forget Show does give us its share of old favorites: Boys Don't Cry, Inbetween Days, A Forest, Primary, not to mention it was the 'Wish' tour.So..my friends, if you want satisfaction of a purchase, take my assurance, from one of the biggest Cure fans you'll find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, easy intro","review":"I am now much more well read concerning the Pacific theater of WWII, but if you are not, this is a great introduction that also helps the reader understand the perspective of Japan and why its leaders were willing to take such risks to solve its strategic dilemmas.

Unless you are a dyed in the wool fundamentalist, every man and woman you would hope would have the free will to think and interpret what they read in the Bible, and specifically the King James Version. For example the Bible is ambiguous on slavery, yet many emancipationists were heartily christian.The language in this version sounds like a spoof from the Daily Mail (for non-UK readers this is a fairly unthinking right wing newspaper with stories like \\"lesbian refugees demand right to adopt babies\\" - I am exaggerating slightly but you get my drift).

However, they are always 4 degrees off from each other, so at least they are both consistent. Now I just subtract 4 degrees when looking at the one in the other room with the higher temperature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat it for the price","review":"Just purchased a new refrigerator so I bought two of these thermometers.

I tested the accuracy by putting them both in at once at the same height, and they both registered the same numbers. Then I put one higher and lower in the fridge, naturally, the lower one was a bit cooler. I tried them in all my fridges and freezers this way, and each time got readings that were helpful to know. In one fridge it wasn't cool enough, in the danger zone of 0ver 40 degrees, so I adjusted the dial and the next day saw it was where it needed to be. That's the whole story. They work.

The Taylor \\"food\\" thermometer was accurate.I then compared the calibrated food thermometer to this freezer-refrigerator thermometer, at refrigeration temperatures (38 degrees). This freezer-refrigerator thermometer reads 8 degrees low. This is a potential safety hazard since a refrigerator at 50 degrees would read at a safe level of 42 degrees.I expected better accuracy, especially since this product bears the NSF logo.

So I ordered 2 of this model. While nice in appearance, I found 2 disconcerting issues: They are not made in the US, and; they differed in temperature readings by almost 5 degrees. Not very reassuring when the ideal refrigerator temperature range is between 32 & 40 degrees - a range of 8 degrees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Inaccurate","review":"I bought two of these thermometers. They arrived but the displayed temperatures do not agree at all. They are 5 degrees off. At least one is inaccurate but I have no confidence that the other one is accurate either. I do not know if 5 degrees is important or not. There is no calibration knob on the thermometer or a procedure for figuring out if the thermometer is accurate. Then I checked the Taylor website and they do not even have any specifications for the thermometer's accuracy. (No specification like +/- 1 degree or 2 degrees or whatever.) I guess you just pay for it and \\"believe\\" that it is accurate. But, as I said, I bought two of them so I know at least one is off base. I guess I will be sending both back and will try a different brand product. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accuracy Not Good","review":"If you buy this thermometer, you better check it against a known, accurate unit. I placed this in my refrigerator and it registered in the mid 40's most days. Thinking I had a problem, I paid for a service call. After the tech checked out the refrigerator, we checked the temperature using another thermometer - the Taylor unit was reading around 6 degrees high - so I paid $75 for that service!!! I put another thermometer on the same shelf and have been tracking the differneces now for several weeks. The Taylor unit is not consistant - it generally reads warmer, but anywhere from 1 to about 8 degrees difference.

Karl Dent can hardly be heard above the ensemble and the chorus' flawless diction is muddy. Renee Fleming's ravishing solo work is best heard through headphones because on speakers, the orchestra predominates. It is the miking at time of performance or something else that makes me wish this recording were reissued and remixed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Nostalgic value","review":"This album covers Howard Jone's singles from 1983-1993. It would have been a better album if it had stopped at 1989. The album does have some nostalgic value (at least it does for me) and a couple of great singles, like What is Love?, Things Can Only Get Better, Life In One Day, You Know I love you, Noone is to Blame, Everlasting love, and Like to Get to Know You Well. Beyond those singles, the rest of the album is pretty weak, in my opinion.I was a big fan of New Wave in the 80's and there is no doubt that Howard Jones was a piece of the puzzle that was 80's synth-pop. If you are looking to recapture a piece of your past and Howard Jones was part of it, by all means buy this album. It is worth it for the memories that the handful of good songs on it resurrect. If you already have Dream Into Action, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection","review":"To be honest, I was only familiar with a couple of Howard's songs, but I thoroughly enjoyed this album, including his version of Steely Dan's \\"What a Beautiful World.\\" Yay, Howard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Collection Of Hits","review":"If you're new to the music of Howard Jones and would like to know what to buy first, this greatest hits package is a good place to start.

I was so excited because it has Joanna Lumley who I love from AbFab. And I think Jennifer Tilly is adorable. But the movie in whole was a disapointment. I agree with a previous review, that the relationship between Kirsten Dunst and that old man wasnt convincing. I thought he was her father for the most part, partly because she called him daddy. All in all, I wouldnt recomend this to anyone, except maybe insomniacs who need help to get to sleep, because thats all this movie will do for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cat's litter box","review":"This movie was boring.

Despite the importance of the setting, you don't get the sense it is taking place on a boat at sea. It needed more than just some backgrounds of blue water. Where was the wind?

And though I despise him (both the real-life Hearst and the character based on him in this film), I couldn't help but feel bad for the pathetic scumbag for what he went through with Davies.If you've got friends with an interest in history (or at least historical scandal), this movie could get some interesting conversation(s) started."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cat's Meow","review":"Eddie Izzard in one of his best performances.

But as I was skipping ahead, I did not notice any significant change in the \\"plot\\" or \\"themes\\" (I use these terms very loosely). I am not shocked easily. However, I must say that I was shocked by this book. Shocked that an author can repeat the same mindless drivel, with no characterization, no plot, and hardly any development to speak of for as long as Sade managed to in Juliette. While initially titillating, I found the book to be ultimately exasperating, his nihilism juvenile, his philosophical cynicism infantile, his plotting sophomoric, and his point, well I must admit, I never found that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclever Pornography for Educated Idiots","review":"It's garbage that tries to convince the reader that there is no place for morals in the world, and that anyone who tries to live a moral life deserves horrid abuse. De Sade was an idiot who obsessed over the most vile acts possible - simply because they ARE possible. To him and his fans, the virtues of restraint and kindness toward others for a common peace and progress are completely unknown - because he and they, simply, are bratty idiots.De Sade knows how malleable the human mind fan be, those who he persuades with this cheap gore-porn trash are only identifying themselves as weak-minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those with Spare time.","review":"Do you know why De Sade made this book so long? I've listened too long to people talking about how De Sade is some misunderstood genius who was trying to get out everything he was thinking. The man was in Prison! It was either write or stare at the wall! Of course he made it so long. the plot of this book fills less than a sixth of the books length. The rest is filled with a list of sexual events that go past what even the most depraved minds would find arousing. It becomes disgusting to the point of giving you a bad taste in your mouth. Some times, the hideous acts don't even have anything to do with sex! they're simply hideous! And my words have nothing to do with morality. De Sade's sexual discribtions are like seeing road kill while jogging. No difference in it's ability to make one sick! Only the depraved could like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please","review":"I gotta say, I'm sitting here chuckling over the positive reviews of this book. There's really nothing positive to be said, and the work is utterly indefensible. The sex scenes are vomitous, and the philosophy puerile. It has endured this long not because of any literary merit, but as a morbid curiosity, an example of how low \\"literature\\" can sink. Don't get me wrong. I'm not an offended prude, a right-winger or a religious nut, I simply know crap when I read it. It's an Emperor's New Clothes deal, folks. That Sade spent time in prison for writing this stuff in a less enlightened time is regrettable. I don't suggest the book be banned or burned. Read it, if you want the experience of having done so. But let's not pretend it's something it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What badly put together dribble.... Sade CAN NOT write","review":"If you look at the book from 30,000 feet and just review it for writing style, cohesive storyline, knowledge of one's subject and some sort of skill at prose then this text is a dismal failure. Now let's throw in the story of Juliette corrupted at an early age and it goes down hill from there. I have never read such repetitive nonsense in my life. I guess Sade could get away with writing such inane dribble because people were just not aware of human anatomy and the consequences of a lot of what he writes about. A lot of the torture is not possible in the context he uses, it just won't work. If you can get past the unbelievable torture methods and just plain bad writing you have an unblievably boring story. I have to be honest and admit I started skipping pages this stuff was so dry. After awhile it doesn't disgust, it doesn't shock and it certainly never entertained. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's New Clothes--Again","review":"This book does more than push the envelope of propriety, it blows it away. And true to form, many a \\"liberal-minded\\" intellectual rushes to embrace it in lock step with his credo that any subject is warranted, as long as it is not moralistic, does not restrict THEIR freedom, and is treated with even the slightest literary flair.

However, as the book moved on, more and more extraneous side material creeps into each chapter, while at the same time it becomes less and less detail oriented. The result is that more and more topics are introduced but not well explained. I would have greatly preferred if fewer side topics were discussed and more detail was focused on the central issues. I ended up spending the latter 2/3s of the book feeling glazed over. I still feel that this is the best Bluetooth book on the market, but that's because most of the other books are so terrible. No matter what book you buy, you will have to read the Bluetooth spec in its entirety. This book will at least give you a broad overview that the spec is so sorely missing, though that could have been done with far fewer pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Disaster","review":"If you ever heard that the Matt Helm series was entertaining, believe me, it wasn't these two entries. They, especially \\"The Ambushers\\", are just plain bad. Funny thing is, the other two Helm movies, especially \\"The Wrecking Crew\\", offer fine entertainment. It had to do with the directors, as Henry Levin directed the two bombs, and the guy, who would go on to direct the classic \\"Walking Tall\\", the others. There is nothing whatsoever redeemable about the Ambushers, and Murderers' Row is noteworthy simply for the appearance of Ann Margeret and an over-the-top performance as Karl Malden as the villian. Neither makes much sense at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matt Helm makes Austin Powers look like Smiley","review":"Hopelessly cheeseball, sexist comedy, but entertaining in a creepy, pathological, what-were-they-thinking-back-then kind of way.

I think that Eileen Ivers may have tried to cover too many styles with this album, just to appeal to a larger audience. She was successful in this, but the album lacks the interest and tastefulness of some of her more traditional recordings. I feel that this project is very good from a musical standpoint, just not from an Irish music one. When listening to this cd, just keep in mind that this is not entirely representative of traditional music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant music by a brilliant band","review":"This is an excellent cd, very different from anything else out there.

They had true energy.Hearing of this new band which has members of Snot and Godsmack, also awesome groups, I was very excited. Pete is amazing as usual, but it's a shame that the rest of the band didn't pull through on their end.

Not only is the music good, but these guys put on a great live show. I've not been disapointed with any of the tracks on the cd, in fact I'd say the CD as a whole is great.

Since it is impossible to remember a puzzle's solution long after you've solved it, I thought that working these puzzles a second time would be as challenging as the first.

Her voice is sometimes sublime or sometimes passionate and always riviting, as on all her previous albums. The great instrumentals weave in and out of her extraordinary vocals. Every song gets five stars except one, \\"Body & Soul\\", which is ravishing and beyond catagory! The listener may hear reflections of Vaughan. In fact, Baker belongs to that exclusive group of female focalists with distinctive voices such as Sarah Vaughan, Nina Simone and Ella Fitzgarald. This is my #1 favorite vocal album by my #1 favorite vocalist. Was \\"diva girl\\" micheleann (below) listening to the same CD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensual and romantic musical experience.","review":"Anita Baker brings her smooth, sultry voice to a collection of songs that plumb the depths of feeling between a man and a woman. The opening title track sets the album's tone for this set of tunes that explore various cycles in the rhythm of love. Other standouts on the album include originals \\"Body and Soul,\\" which expresses the essence of a lover's longing, and \\"I Apologize,\\" the soulful lament over a lover's discussion gone bad. Three standards-Burt Bacharach's \\"The Look of Love,\\" Carly Simon's \\"You belong To Me,\\" and \\"My Funny Valentine\\"-get fresh, sexy treatments by Anita. But the original songs are the best ones on this album.Let Anita Baker take you on a sensual exploration of the \\"Rhythm of Love.\\" You'll love the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita is great, this cd, boring!","review":"I love Anita Baker, but this was music that lacked her usual bounce, wasnt able to get into this music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita","review":"Always good, always sultry, always professional and always beautiful!

Nonetheless, this CD just screams \\"formulaic.\\" I say take a few of the standard R & B, uninspired fare off and throw on more ballads that allow her misty voice to float on and on...My favorites include \\"Sometimes I Wonder Why\\" where she teases jazz fans, and does it well. She could have left \\"My Funny Valentine\\" alone, as it has been covered enough (!) and her version, frankly, wasn't one of the most memorable.But under the circumstances, let her enchant you with the likes of \\"The Look of Love\\" and \\"Only for a While.\\" My wish: Anita, live, jazz standards.

This book is horrible on so many levels. For starters, the typeface looks like it came straight from an inkjet printer and the obviously plagiarized graphics are often very pixilated (like what happens to satellite TV during a heavy thunderstorm). Next, regarding technical detail, it's lacking. Sure this book will give you a 30,000 foot view of the subject. After reading this book, you should be able to spell \\"smart card\\" but that's about it! However, I see no areas in the text which a competent project manager could use to help determine their needs and how the technology can help them. There's nothing a developer can use in this book to help them integrate smart card technology into their project. Unfortunately, this isn't the first IT book out there filled with hundreds of pages of nothing.

Then on on to the lack of funding for Swiss intelligence in the early years of the war. The exciting drama is the connection itself, which I haven't come to yet.

I love spicy jalapeno flavored snacks and was excited to find this at Walmart, but as soon as I opened the lid the powder fumes went up my nose and burned my sinuses. I persisted and sprinkled it on popcorn and again the fumes burned my lungs and breathing passages and made me cough like crazy. Not to be discouraged, I tried eating some but couldn't stop coughing long enough to enjoy it. It's truly toxic! If you can manage to eat without breathing, maybe it would be okay. Otherwise, forget it! This product should be recalled!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I'm not the only one!","review":"So for awhile I thought I was the only one who coughed and sneezed while trying to enjoy this seasoning because my husband can eat it on popcorn with no problem. First taste and I thought I was going to die. I immediately coughed and half chewed popcorn flew everywhere, even though I tried to cover my mouth. I can't even be near it because it gets in my nose and makes me sneeze. The flavor wasn't bad so if you aren't bothered by a fine powder scratching the back of your throat and nose then enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as delicious as other forms of fake cheese","review":"I ordered this because I bought a popcorn maker and decided investing in popcorn related accessories made sense at this time in my life.

The good part is that it does indeed taste decent. However, the seasoning is so fine that it makes me cough whenever I try to breath; it gets into my nose and also makes me sneeze.

However the last time I ordered it I got Cheesy Jalepeno instead.

Needless to say, I won't be purchasing it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Did no one in R&D or marketing try this before sending it out to the market?

For one thing, there is utterly no mention anywhere on the cover or interior that it's another installment of a published series. Since this is critical to the story, this omission, deliberate or accidental, is unforgivable.Pushed as a 'romance,' there is little to none in this story in the popular definition of historical romance novels. There is little history, either. Instead, the author uses the second half of the novel to 'prove' the stories of the bible are literal and true, one after another, in quick succession. And the heroine is pivotal to all of them. If the aim was to promote spirituality and pseudo-history, the author should have been a bit less devious about luring unsuspecting readers with this tripe.When the heroine is finally reunited with her husband, we discover they have no chemistry. If they do, it certainly isn't evident in the narrative. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunrise on the Mediterranean","review":"When I finished Reflections on the Nile I did not know there were more as I never searched for them.

Only the excellent Red Money dares to venture into a unique soundscape.The first single - Boys Keep Swinging - is as bland as DJ - the follow-up 45 rpm - is energetic. The solid Look Back In Anger remains a Bowie gem that gets lost in the shuffle of his vast discography.This was grand potential probably lost by a lack of new studio ideas and boredom. Too bad the rent came due much too soon for Bowieno."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will disappoint most listeners","review":"Lodger was a stumble for Bowie after the incredibly well written and performed music of Station to Station, Low, and Heroes.

However I put it on again a few weeks ago to try it again, and I haven't been able to take it off. This album is outstanding and shows an artist at the height of his powers. Listen to the innovation here, these tunes are serious. To me this is the album that ended his run of great albums in the 70s. Try it again folks, and again and again !"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Lets Dance.","review":"Wonderful recording of quirky and interesting pop music. Many disregard it for it's pop appeal and many others disregard it for it's experimental reach, and there are those who think it sounds dated. Man, Chuck Berry sounds dated, Hank Williams sounds dated, Early Clash sounds dated,, The Kinks sound dated, The Stooges sound dated and they all sound magical and magnificent. Lodger is how a lot of music sounded in the late 70's, but better and for me this particular recording echoes Iggy and Bowies collaborations on \\"The Idiot and \\"Lust For Life from the late 70's. Same vibe at times, same sound. It is both experimental and pop, much of it is not that different from the first half of Low, really. Great band, great songs, great production, great vision of smart pop for yesterday people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one track was of value","review":"Was recommended by a friend.

Some, frankly, may find little depth amongst these grandiose symphonic outpourings of supposed Brazilian \\"heart.\\" Perhaps this is the earmark of Villa-Lobos' style, and what is innately tiresome. Too much \\"matter\\" with inconsequential substance; in other words, simple Brazilian musical dance idioms enlarged to complex orchestral forms--- for the sake of show.

The example problems, the heart of a text on engineering, leave MUCH to be desired. More than once the authors have decided to reveal new, and consequently unexplained concepts in the first problems at the chapter's end. That coupled with the fact that the instructor's solution manual contains few actual solutions is unforgivable. Repeatedly I've been forced to guess or assume reasons for the existance of certain calculations. Rarely do the authors explain their reasoning for doing certain things and if they do explain something it's not easily understandable from the text. I wouldn't recommend this text to anyone!

Almost half the recipes for dim sum involved DEEP-FRYING. For anyone who has actually experienced the traditional brunch menu in chinatown, you'll know the vast majority of dishes are STEAMED. Except for the a scant handful of the basics (i.e., pork buns, shrimp dumplings, etc.), i didn't recognize ANY of these recipes! somewhat of an oddity, given the fact that i am actually chinese. it was particularly galling to see someone try to pawn a glossy, overly westernized 'chinese' cookbook as an authentic representation of dim sum.while it's understandable that most people who buy this book will not be chinese, this is NOT the book to get if you want to duplicate the dishes you've tasted before.And why did i give it 1 star instead of the 0 it deserved? it has nice pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a pretty picture book...","review":"I didn't buy this book. I actually borrowed it from the library. The glossy pictures attracted me and I was convinced to buy it here on amazon.com. Then I flipped through it and I'mglad I didn't buy it! Only some of these recipes are the traditional chinese dim sum you'd find in chinatown. The rest seem to be gourmet style dim sum; like maybe something in a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. Anyhow, if you want authentic chinese dim sum...look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very authentic","review":"Truth is, the pictures are quite nice and it makes for a nice cofeetable book but I think several reviewers here pointed out correctly that this is not an authentic chinese dim sum book. The recipes have incorrect ingredients (fish sauce in chinese cooking?) and the few recipes I tried didnt have complete lists of ingredients and lacked in flavor. This is made for an uneducated, simplified western audience. With more and more people dining in dim sum establishment nowadays, our palates are more discriminating.

I had borrowed one from a friend of mine and decided that she couldn't have it back. I had to buy a new copy to get one back to her. The recipes are a good sampling of and introduction to authentic Chinese Dim Sum. A beginner can follow these recipes and get authentic results. ... some recipes could/should have been included, but I feel that a book like this is an introductory level and stands well on its own. I also felt that the recipes were not very Americanized. The Chinese restaurants near here (O.K. It IS Vermont) typically have steak teriaki and egg rolls as appetisers and nothing that even comes close to the recipes in this book. The ingredients are relatively easy to obtain in an American market or in an Asian market in American cities. The beginning of the book shows a great lesson in some of the techniques and some ingredients. As an American trying to learn more authentic Chinese recipes, I found this book most useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST DIM SUM BOOK AVAILABLE","review":"I have made almost every recipe in this book and every one is great!

Even though I have had my horse at several riding clinics, nobody ever pointed out that my horse was overbitted. By just following the advice on bitting, my horse is now much more responsive and has not balked even once when out trail riding. I have also learned to hold the reins with a much gentler hand. All in all, I feel I have not only helped myself, but I have also helped my horse as well. As another reviewer mentioned, I think every horse should come equipped with this book. Instead of teaching you to train your horse, this book teaches you to understand your horse so that the training becomes a learning/understanding process for both you and your horse."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love horses, read this!","review":"This book should be read by anyone who really wants to learn what it takes to have a gift, or a way, with horses. The Horse's Choice gives you an understanding of how horses think and learn, so that you can in turn be more sympathetic, learning to do things with the horse, not TO the horse, so that the horse can be a willing and happy partner and enjoy your company. The content is very informative and the photography is done well too. I think this book should accompany every horse sold, actually.

The plot is fully there, and while it perhaps starts out as \\"That's your plot? Ah hah hah!\\" turns into... \\"I.. love this movie!\\" Anime fans of romantic anime or the \\"ordinary life\\" anime series etc won't particularly like Fatal Fury, but Fatal Fury is fighting anime, and it does that well.

I found this book lacking in answering any questions I had about C++. I was jumping into an existing C++ application and needed to know how to implement my ideas using C++ syntax, and understand the code I was expected to fix. It did not cover:- parameter passing (reference, pointers, or value types)- over-riding methods- abstract class (virtual methods, pure virtual methods)- how to create objects, variable name, class name. All new to Java developers that put everything on the heap.It would be nice to cover project layout as well. Java has only a few structures and C++ seems to be the wild west. The fact that implementations can be in multiple source files and/or multiple libraries was not covered at all. This was a very new and confusing concept to a long time Java developer. Maybe this is more of a review for C++ developers coming back to the fold."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will help you to clarify the differences of the similarities of C++ and Java.","review":"I'm not a student, but a professional developer and this book (or textbook) was my ticket to cross my mind from Java to C++. I used to program C++ thinking in Java. Professor Weiss described the differences of very similar topics of the languages. For example, Since Java constructors are very similar to the ones in C++, I felt that I new everything about constructors specifically single parameter constructors until I read about the keyword \\"explicit\\". Another \\"AHA\\" moment for me was object slicing. It also helped me to realize that C++ is not \\"just another language\\". You really have to spend a few years studying the language in order to master it.Also, I submitted a small error and Professor Weiss updated the errata much faster that what I was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"i want to learn how to raise lovebirds and know them.","review":"hi, my name is Bassam. how are u? i want to buy that book of yours, i hope i will know everything about lovebirds. i got two love birds in my house, a male and a female. so i want to learn their behaviors and how they breed etc...so please i want to order u're bookbuy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way","review":"Cute pictures and thats all.

The music here is driving and heavy with memorable guitar work and washes of baked psychedelia. It's late afternoon and even the scorpions are seeking shelter from the hot desert sun as \\"Welcome to Sky Valley\\" surges through your stereo speakers as you fly down the highway. This album reminds me of \\"Badmotorfinger\\" by Soundgarden, where it is equally raw and heavy, but with dynamic songcraft. The lead vocalist is nowhere near the level of Chris Cornell, but after hearing this album as many times as I have, I couldn't imagine them having a different singer. The only other slight criticism is that once in a while a couple of the songs lose focus, meandering from superb Metal grooves into funk or off into space rock. Overall, however, this is a must for anyone who was a fan of Soundgarden back in 1992 when they released the magnificent \\"Badmotorfinger.\\" This has a similar style in the Stoner Rock vein.

The whole Cd amazed me. The rhythmic drum beats, the distorted guitar, and the standout vocals just came together into one great experience. Part I (tracks 1-3) shows you three different styles of what this band is capable of. Part II (4-6) starts off heavy and pounding with \\"100 Degrees\\", but then switches it up into \\"Space Cadet\\", and finishes it off with my personal favorite, \\"Demon Cleaner\\". Part III finishes off the Cd strong, especially with \\"Odyssey\\" and \\"N.O.\\". And \\"Whitewhiter\\" is a quite humorous, yet perfect way to end a perfect Cd. 10 out of 10. Five stars.

Kyuss have created in Welcome to Sky Valley a lumbering masterpiece that combines the sludgy aesthetic of 70s metal with psychedelic instrumental interludes. The epic three and four part songs give Kyuss the room for their songs to breathe. Its easy to see how stoner rock gets applied to this, but the music more often makes me think of the red sandy expenses of the Arizona desert...this is a musical world to be lost into.

This guide was written--reluctantly--to lessen some of that frustration. Reluctantly, because, while the authors wish to indroduce the owl to new generations of birders, at the same time they are very concerned about adverse influence that birders can have on owls. The book consists of two parts: an introduction to birding for owls, and the owls of North America. In the latter, each species that is found in North America is discussed to some degree. While the Whiskered Screech Owl, which only occurs near the Mexican-American border in southern Arizon, only has two paragraphs devoted to it, other species are covered by a number of pages. Information is largely anecdotal and easy to read. At least one photograph of most species is included, the quality of which is usually excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was a double package deal","review":"I received only one of the books that I ordered close to two to three months ago.

Pages detailing where a gentleman should position bumper stickers on his car would be better spent discussing tips on how to better oneself in the workplace or find a quality dry-cleaner. To their credit, the authors are true poets, with an impressive vocabulary, but the purpose of the book seems to be more of a vernacular romp than a useful field guide.

It seems as though a thesaurous and a rhyming dictionary were always at hand in an attempt to bluff one's way into dispensing advice. Although the authors seem to have found a demand for said advice, the soundness of that advice is questionable. As others have said, this book might provide some entertainment, perhaps as bathroom reading material. In essence, however, \\"The Modern Gentleman\\" is a misnomer.

Big mistake. The book could best be described as a period piece that, while charmingly illustrated, goes to lengths to show the inherent cruelty of prejudice. Lyle encounters a girl who hates him and leaves him vicious hate mail. In the end, Lyle saves her life and she grows to understand and love him. My problem with the book is two-fold: First, the hatred she feels for Lyle is way over the top for my son to hear. It's just way too ugly for him to comprehend at this age. Second, I have a problem with the victim having to prove himself to the hater. It seems to me that the victim shouldn't have to redeem himself or prove his worth in any way. The entire premise is that people who are hated need to find a way to be loved and that's just wrong. It's the haters who need to change.

Some of the children too become teary eyed the first time through. But ... Claude the Dog quickly becomes a classroom favorite they ask to hear over and over again because they love to hear and see the compassion and love that's shown throughout the book.

That was pretty gosh darn smart; contemplating an artist's evolution is one of the most interesting topics in musical criticism. Buy this CD; unsurprisingly it is eminently UNforgettable. I was expecting some interesting rock and clever lyrics, and that's exactly what I got. Black is a post-modern master with a completely unique style- both lyrically and musically. Find someone else with a comparable style and they will undoubtedly be a Frank Black rip off.If you can't sing along with something, why not listen to it again and try to grasp it's subtlety?

There are some all-out rockers, but there are a lot of catchy pop numbers, too, like the aforementioned \\"Headache\\", or the quiet (dare I say romantic, even), \\"Sir Rockabye\\".If you like the Pixies, or even if you don't (which I don't see being possible, but... whatever), this is the album that will prove just how good Frank Black can be on his own.

They have an excellent mastery of the instraments that they play, more so than many other bands out there. They are the biggest band out of Austrailia since AC/DC, and they're just as good or better. I was never a fan of hard rock and punck music but this band is an exception. They are original and refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Enjoyed It","review":"Despite the fact that many people aparently did not enjoy this disc, I enjoyed it to peices. It may not be in the same style as some of his older recordings (which may be good, or may be bad), but I felt that it was different, and ... very well done. It may not be the best CD ever, but it was worth the money that I paid for it ^_^*. Time Will Crawl was probably one of my favorites from the entire disc. I'm going to make a wild guess, and say that those who enjoyed the movie Labyrinth would enjoy this album. It's in near the same style, and around the same year. (Let me just add that there is much, *much* more to David Bowie than the movie Labyrinth, despite what some people may believe.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah, but you did!","review":"One of Bowie's weakest recordings, Never Let Me Down is a an album with no direction. The songs don't seem to mesh in any discernible fashion and often seem like throwaways. Bowie's voice is at best disinterested and the music seems to have been recorded in a tunnel. Because it is Bowie, there are still a few songs that are worthwhile but only for completists is this set a neccessity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it is that bad","review":"Sometimes I think critics like to pile on and slam the latest album by an aging star without really listening to it. However, the critics were right about this one. Don't listen to all the Bowie-heads out there. This one blows.I'd be hard pressed to find a record in my collection (over 600 cds) that is worse than this. There is not a single great or even good song on this album. The title track and \\"Time Will Crawl\\" are okay, and \\"Day In Day Out\\" is listenable. The rest of the album doesn't even meet that minimal standard. And ignore that other guy--\\"Too Dizzy\\" sucks, too.If there is one thing this site proves, its that no matter how unquestionably bad a record is (and , yes, sometimes a record is so unquestionably bad that no allowances can be made for \\"matters of taste\\"), there are people out there who will like it.For the Bowie completist only."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOWIE LETS HIMSELF DOWN","review":"This is probably Bowie's worst album, where he hit, for me at least, creative rock bottom. The 80s and image of success had absolutely, nearly ruined Bowie as a serious artist. This album doesn't help whatsoever. I recall the Day in Day out Video with Bowie singing on rollerblades and poofed up hair. The songwriting is vapid, and Bowie's sensibilities had shifted so much, I'm sure many of his original fans couldn't really relate to this. Apart from the naff Glass Spider Tour, which I watched in Pontiac, Michigan way back when - and which is available on video - about the only good things out of this album were the cover of Iggy Pop's \\"Bang Bang\\" - a great live addition for Bowie's repertoire and \\"Zeroes\\" - an underrated song that never got much airplay. Bowie can, I believe, churn out commercial songs at will - but I'm not convinced his heart was in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"I don't know what he was thinking when he produced this one. This is a good example of Bowie departing to a new style, unfortunately it's a bad one. One is much better off sticking with Hunky Dory, Low, basically anything else in his collection, this one is a stinker..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowie in an identity crisis!!!","review":"It's true!! It's Bowie's worst album along with \\"Tonight\\". The songs are flat and uninspired. Bowie wasn't much envolved with the recording of \\"Never Let me Down\\". He even left others arrange his own songs. Bowie was definetly divorcing from the cutting edge. But it's not a totally avoidable album. For example \\"Time will crawl\\" is only one of his best songs from the 80's, i can't believe this song wasn't a big hit. \\"Glass Spider\\" is another song that deserves some attention. It sounds like something off the \\"Diamond Dogs\\" era. \\"Never Let me Down\\" is a simple ballad with a great melody. And finally \\"The beat of your drum\\" the catchiest song of this set. This track would fit very well in the \\"Let's Dance\\" album. The rest is easily forgetable unless you're a Phil Collins or Chris de Burgh fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just awesome...and overloooked.","review":"I LOVE Bowie as much as the next. Maybe it's my age (this album came out when I was a kid), but I love the overall feel of this album. It's continued proof of \\"the Chameleon's\\" skills to completely re-modify his style (with the times) and continue to put out quality work. Not his best album, but just a fantastic effort into these tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really wish I never bought this, at any price","review":"All you need to do is look at the cover, in which David looks like one of the Thompson Twins, to get an idea of what this album sounds like: Bowie imitating \`80s Bowie imitators. This is, by far, the worst Bowie album aside from maybe David Bowie (1969), which at least didn't sell many copies. Even Tin Machine, which has been almost equally dissed, has a few potentially good songs. By regular \`80s pop standards, this is a lackluster album; compared to his \`70s albums, or even his first mainstream \`80s album, Let's Dance, it's embarrassing. David himself has admitted in several interviews (including one David Buckley included in his Bowie biography) that he wasn't very connected with his music at the time, and it comes through.You'd be better off buying almost ANYTHING else in his catalog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure","review":"Apparently Bowie regrets ever making this album. It's easy to see why. Never let me down is overly ambitious, but most of the time just sounds horribly silly. That's not to say there's not at least one good song on NLMD, there is: the title track. There's also a good deal of strong melodies, and Bowie does seem to enjoy himself. But with songs like Day in day out, and Mickey Rourke on guest vocals (delivering a \\"rap\\")it's asking for trouble. To me Never let me down is not unlistenable, and it occasionally can be quite fun to put on, but I thank god Bowie has made other, and better albums since then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of nostalgia value","review":"I'm a long-time Bowie fan and certainly won't argue that this is David's best work. However, this was the first Bowie album I ever bought, and this, folks, is what got me hooked on his music. In its own way, this is an amazing little album. Although it does have a lot of filler, it's not without some artistic high points (Time Will Crawl, Beat of Your Drum) -- so, give it a chance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobbly","review":"I bought the item when it was over $1,000 about two years ago. It arrived with broken parts and parts that were not lined up properly. The final piece put together is a wobbly mess. It is not square and it constantly needs pushed back in alignment. The doors do not shut properly since it is not appropriately lined up. The drawer for the keyboard does not roll in and out because the ball barrings began falling out of the tracks before it was out of the box. Out of the four door knobs, only three are the same, one looks completely different than the others.I am not sure if this is the same seller as when I bought it, but they did replace broken parts easily, except they would not replace the keyboard drawer hardware.Some day, I will have to take it all apart and use metal L brackets to strengthen the structure.

But instead of truly researching the person of Tsar Nicholas II, the Geographic people were content to simply regurgitate what the party-line of the Soviet Union had been in regards to the Tsar. Obviously this information is very biased. Unfortunately, since most information about the Tsar that we have today was written after the Revolution, either by the Soviets or by people who had the Soviets as their sole source of information, one really cannot find a non-biased source. There is, of course, the Russian Orthodox Church, but scholars seem to view them as being an even more biased source than the Soviets were.

Anyway, having really not kept up with the Allmans or Derek in recent years, I was completely blown away after buying this release on a whim after reading a couple of reviews.If you like the Allman Brothers, Santana through about 1977 with maybe a little Headhunters-era Herbie Hancock thrown in, then you will love this album! While vocalist Mike Mattison belts it out impressively on many of the tracks, the real focus here is on the musicianship. I don't know if I've ever heard slide guitar playing this good and the other band members are no slouches, either. This album is just an impressive creation and I was very moved listening to it, something I relish even more in that it was so unexpected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Derek is the MOST talented player alive... got to hear it","review":"If you have never enjoyed the music of Mr Trucks you are missing a worldly experience. I have played for 30 years, followed his carrer as a 12 year old on. To see him play with the Allman Brother's Band night after night and it's never the same, some flavor here, some sauce there, it's amazing where he is as a musician at his age. His uncle's \\"Brother\\" Duanne Allman would be so proud and I believe awestruck! Now we have the Derek Trucks Band which is a gumbo of worldly stews and the latest offering Songlines is the best yet. Buy i if you love guitar and great beats you will dig this record. Now our fair haired son of the South is on tour with Slow Hand Eric Clapton and wowing audiences nightly on that world tour. Do yourself and your soul a BIG favor jump on board this kid's music. He is the best there is. Must hear to believe, must se to really believe. RedTail Wolf"},{"rating":"2","title":"He doesn't make the same CD twice","review":"Derek Trucks keeps growing and evolving in his musical style and his material. This CD does contain some songs he's been doing on the road for the past few years.The biggest difference between this one and previous studio work is the presence of new lead singer Mike Mattison. He is a soulful singer who even does some falsettos and fans of Derk's earlier work may or may not like the new lead singer. The other difference is less guitar solos and more concise solos (BOO). You will get less guitar work here than when you see Derek live with his band or with Allman Brothers.That said, this is still a fine CD with a nice mix of styles and a couple nice instrumentals. Maybe not his best but still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"hey people","review":"this is the real thing. get on board. they dont make it like this anymore. this band is so tight and yet relaxed in the groove, its sinful. get off your fat asses and pick this one up. an organic jumbo beast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Different Indeed","review":"This is a story of a deaf mute girl who is raised unloved by anyone.

But on its own, as an album its really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Document of its time","review":"This is generally considered to be one of bowie's worst albums, and for good reasons. That isn't to say there's nothing enjoyable on \\"Tonight\\". There's the fine opener \\"Loving the alien\\", the flawless pop of \\"Blue jean\\", and the rocking (albeit in a 80-ish fashion) \\"Neighborhood threat\\". But the album suffers heavily of a overall lack of inspiration; in production, songwriting, and instrumentation. It almost completely consists of recycled Iggy Pop collaborations(eg.,the earlier mentioned \\"Neighboorhood Threat\\")and covers (eg.,an absolutely horrifying version of \\"God only knows\\"),all done in that typical eighties synth-pop way. But since every album is a document of its time, for a truly comlete reconstruction of Bowie's career even \\"Tonight\\" is a necessity. Just don't expect to find more than (very)vague hints of Bowie's genius as a songwriter and singer on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the next album, though that's not saying much...","review":"When I first borrowed this album on vinyl, it got off to a pretty promising start. \\"Loving the Alien\\" is more \\"Bowie\\" than a good deal of the stuff on Let's Dance (though that album is still a good pop album). \\"Blue Jean\\" is the only other decent song on this album; the rest, unfortunately, is incredibly bland. It IS better than Never Let Me Down, the album that followed it, but that's not saying much....if you do want to buy it, get it used for a decent price (under $10). If you're not too keen on \`80s Bowie and don't want to buy the entire album, find a US copy of the Rykodisk Singles set (it's not in print anymore)--it includes \\"Blue Jean,\\" the special single version of \\"Loving the Alien,\\" and some other singles-only songs that are well worth getting (plus, of course, tons of \`70s singles, though they sound tinny compared to the more recent Virgin/BMI remasters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two and a half stars","review":"Bowie hits his first slump on this album. 'Blue Jean' , along with a couple of other tracks are good pop songs, but it's just padded out with too much filler. Even its high points don't match Let's Dance's, but on the plus side (or should that be down side?), this album is at least a bit longer. You have to accept that Bowie is no longer the avant garde enigma he once was, and just try to enjoy what's left. Which isn't much. 'Tumble and Twirl' is given a brisk, funky backing, and it's good fun, too.Yet half the album is made up of, at times embarrassing, filler. I especially don't want to hear Bowie singing about 'Old Rudy' in a cod-Jamaican accent ('Don't Look Down'), and the inclusion of a Beach Boys cover is the sound of a man without ideas, trying to get by as a crooner. I'd pick this up on Marketplace if you see it for a couple of quid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the eighties","review":"This is my favorite cd out of the ones bowie did in the 80's. Even though it has a bunch of remakes of older songs and it doesn't break any new ground, most of it has a nice feeling too it. It does have some tracks that don't really meet his standard but it is worth it for the remake of god only knows. P.s. Bowie released a statement over a year before these reissues were released asking that they don't have the bonus tracks because it takes away from the original work. SO THERE WERE NO PROMISES MADE ON BONUS TRACKS. That reviewer made up those promises in his own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not very good...","review":"Well this was a massive disappointment. Having loved 'Loving The Alien' and thinking 'Blue Jean' was quite good, I bought this album, thinking all the reviews previously were exaggerating the quality of the album. Unfortunately, I was Wrong.The title track is horrible, just 80s pop at its worst, although i quite like the soft-reggae 'Don't Look Down', and the cover of the Beach Boys classic isnt as bad as you would think. For the second half of the album, things take a definite turn for the worse, although there is a nice brass accompliment for a couple of the songs. The last 3 tracks are terrible by Bowies standards and completlely unmemorable, im listening to Dancing With The Big Boys now, and I cant pick out a chorus at all.Overall, a pretty bad album, the only songs i would listen to out of choice are Loving the alien, God only knows and Blue Jean, 2 of which are on the Best of Bowie album. AVOID."},{"rating":"1","title":"beavis was wrong. you can polish a turd","review":"As many of the other reviewers i am a long time bowie fan. i saw him on the sound + vision, outside, and current reality tours. i have every scrap he has ever released commercially (and a few bootlegs as well.) this album along with never let me down are the nadir of his career. he admits that he wasn't very into making music in the mid 80s and it shows. this album suffers from the 80s synth-pop gloss and very uninspired songwriting. i must admit a guilty affection for the cover of \\"god only knows.\\" other than \\"blue jean\\" the rest of the album is unlistenable to me. i never replaced my cassette copy and doubt that i ever will."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - NO PROMISED BONUS TRACKS!!!!!","review":"I was reading up on David Bowie and where to find some of the more rare tracks that he had placed on soundtracks for films through the 80's.

It's not \\"Ziggy\\", nor is it \\"Heathen,\\" but who cares? It's Bowie having fun, giving us great music. I'm so in love with his voice that just about anything he sings I'll enjoy, truth be told. But tracks on here, especially Neighborhood Threat and Tumble and Twirl, are really infectious and never really get stale because of their uniqueness. Why does everyone hate God Only Knows on the the album, by the way? Sure, maybe it's not the original. But why do you feel the need to compare disparate things? Bowie is a whole animal unto himself. Appreciate him for the true artist he is, and buy some of his music (rather than simply lazily downloading his past stuff illegally).PS: the following album, \\"Never Let Me Down,\\" is also not so bad either, especially the very catchy title track.

If one wants to hear spoken sections on an album, that's OK, and yes, it's atmospheric, but I personally prefer to listen to MUSIC instead. The song \\"O seasons\\", \\"Partisan\\" and \\"Franklin\\" are stunning indeed but the rest is sometimes way too jazzy or simply irritating for me (Katell's vioce is at times even frightening - while listening to \\"Burden\\" one can really FEEL THE BURDEN of the act of listening to such a song). Overall, this purchase was a great disappointment, because I really thought it was gonna be something at least as good as Natalie Merchant.

Her songs are like wonderful poems or short stories, each one tells a story that is both personal and universal. The language she uses is just mesmerisingly beautiful. I love this album and her second, Jet, and am just sorry she hasn't made any more. I think KK is better than any other female singer/songwriter out there -- even my other faves, Tori Amos, Kate Bush and Joan Osborne pale in comparison.

Her willingness to allow us into \\"her world\\" of frustration and exhaustion in her quest for peace is what makes the things she says so believeable. It's comforting to know that someone has struggled through the same areas in life and has perservered and found victory! It's easy to tell someone what to do if you haven't walked in their shoes.

I had my doubts that it would be any better than the Belkin it was replacing. Unless your vehicle's sound system has a cassette player, or is iPod compatible, there is no other alternative than going the FM converter route. I was pleasantly surprised with both the ease of use and the sound quality. I have not experienced any of the static mentioned in some of the other reviews. Audiophiles beware - although the sound quality is very acceptable, do not expect perfection. You are converting digital to analog and some degradation is to be expected"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!","review":"I initially bought a Griffin iTrip mini for use in London, UK and it was awful. Someone recommended this to me and it is absolutely brilliant.

The connector has never been mistreated or stepped on. It still works, but to use it would leave exposed wires etc out and it won't lock into the iPod without the connector shell piece.I'll probably replace with a new model of Monster's transmitter since it did work well.So for this one I'd have to give Monster 2 stars (4-5 stars for the function of FM transmitter and 1 star for the lack of quality of the cable connector)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorted Out","review":"Worked fine for a little while.

For starters, it has eight pre-programmed stations to choose from and that's it. I live in San Diego and 6 of the 8 pre-programmed stations already have permanent broadcasting on them, so you can rule them. Therefore, we are left with two viable options for stations to attempt to broadcast your iPod onto.

After a few months of use i noticed some static every time i picked up my iPod to change a song/whatever. This was due to faulty wiring within the iCarPlay cable. a month later it stopped connecting my iPod altogether and was a $60 waste of money. No only is it overpriced to begin with, but if you're charging people that much for <$1 worth of components, at least put it together somewhat decently so it lasts a few years.

My Ipod just says that this accessory is not compatible for charging. (and this was the whole reason I bought the device. I was tired of my Ipod battery dying while riding in the car, and thought this would be the best solution)The plus sides?

In fact, this unit is so strong, that you can broadcast over a station that has faint music, something I found the I-trip, the I-tunes, and a whole host of other units couldn't do. Remember though, it still won't be as good as CD quality.

Wonderful.I understand that a direct link into the system with an AUX input, or even a cassette adapter sounds better (and you don't have to worry about radio station interference, either), but I thought this sounded great, and changing the stations when needed was easy to do, and I haven't had to do it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literally - Plug and Play","review":"I was in a hurry when I received this item from Amazon -- and had just enough time to open the package, grab the item & run to the car so I could get to work on time.

The iTrip, at half the cost, was a much better, clearer sounding unit than the Monster one. The nice thing about the Monster one is that it has a built-in charger, but that is about the only thing. The 8 presets that allow you to tune in for wireless aren't very good, seeing that here in my area, 89.5 is a fairly strong radio station so the frequencies around it get bleed out from it. Only one of the 8 frequencies that you can choose from worked, but still, alot of static. This was tested with the car not moving, so I can't verify what the quality is like while driving.

I'm convinced that this is the best valued of these transmitters because it works well with near CD quality and you can get it for under $50. I took a 6 hour car trip right after buying this product and it worked beautifully. I had to change stations a couple of times during the trip, but never had a problem finding a clear station to use. It's also easy to use and it charges my iPod quickly. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is because of occasional static in a very radio station busy Washington D.C. area.

I am not sure what is in it now, but increaseing the capacity a milliamp or two could really boost performance.It is really easy to use, and I love the fact that I can keep my iPod charged all at the same time, It is really beneficial on a long road trip. Sure, the battery life says 12 hours, but that is without backlight functionality, and changing the songs frequently. Also, I do not have to bring my AC adapter on vacation... one less thing to leave in a hotel room.Plus... more and more cars are coming out without a tape deck.

I'm returning the iCarPlay, and springing for a deck with an auxiliary input for my iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"Had I written this review in the first 2-3 weeks of owning this iCarPlay, I would have given it full stars. HOWEVER, 4 weeks into it, this Monster Monstrocity has deceided that it will only play for about 15-20 minutes at a time. The light in the power plug end remains lit, but all lights on the transmitter itself go out along with the sound. It must rest for awhile before it feels ready to work again. It must have a union contract!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Monster has no clothes","review":"This device works to an extent, but there is lots of static and sometimes it switches to the radio station. Sometimes you lose the signal entirely depending on where you are driving. It sucks. I am bringing it back and getting the tape deck device.

Beware of retailers or manufacturers submitting reviews. I live in the NY area. Every possible bandwith is occupied. This solution does not and cannot work. Even in a rural area, where a response is possible, the sound is brutal! Worse than AM radio. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS. I'm bringing mine back.

That's all there is to it. Great idea, but unless you are in an area with very few occupied stations, my bet is the sound quality will be very unsatisfactory.

On the good side, it is a nice compact, integrated design that keeps your iPod charged while in the car. On the bad side, it only has eight FM frequencies to choose from, and here in LA and Orange Counties, that's just not enough. I travel from Irvine to the South Bay to Santa Monica, and I would constantly hear a hiss or other annoying interference. Worse, as I move from one part of two to another, I have to fumble with the iCarPlay and my car radio to switch them to a new frequency. And this doesn't seem to be a problem just here in LA and Orange County; the interference is prevalent at nearly all times when traveling down I-5 to San Diego. So, for populated areas, I cannot recommend the iCarPlay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable and lots of static - other channels seem to always cut in.","review":"I tried this in several different cars and in several different locations. Urban settings, it's nearly useless as every other radio signal within 60 miles is going to be stronger. Not bad on the turnpikes when you get away from cities. And best if you're in the absolute middle of no where (north woods Wisconsin, extremely isolated)...but even then it still has a lot more static than described. I wouldn't buy this again. I'd try to figure something out with either a headphone jack, a usb, or if your car's on the older side, one of those cassette adapter things that you plug in and it plays off your cassette player. This item just doesn't work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my second unit in 8 years","review":"The unit works as advertised.

Of the 8 possible frequencies, the Nashville area has stations on 6 of them. The two remaining frequencies sound like very distant FM stations... or possibly pretty good AM stations. AM quality is not what I was expecting. If you can pick up more than a couple of stations between 88.1 and 89.5, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"monster i cable play pluss transmitter for ipod","review":"This item is great but make sure you get the correct one as Amazon does not do a very good job with there ad there are two models the better one is called ''pluss''and amazon does not put that in there ad you can programe your own radio stations with pluss. The other has eight presets. Sorry Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rarely Works","review":"In the few areas where one of the FM Bands is open it woks great.

I bought a cheap cassette adapter and it works infinitely better. The iCarPlay now just keeps my iPod charged on long trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"H20music","review":"If you like the sound Quality of your ipod degraded 30 to 40 %, then this is the item for you.

There are no such stories on this disc. They are the 1920s and 30s, black and white, silent cartoons (music and sound effects dubbed in). The heading for some of them is Aesop's Fables (songs) and the title of the cartoon is Circus Calamities (or some such). Others are headed Looney Toons and star Bosko and the other early characters.

Maybe being published by MTV has something to do with it. But as a result, a lot of the skateboard graphics shown in here already look a bit played out.There are only a few companies represented, Girl being the best of them. I have a suspicion that the author only displayed decks from companies that he could get image sources from. All the boards are only from the last couple of years, some of it good, some of it rather insignificant.There is another book out there with the same theme that I would rather recommend, it's called \\"Board: Surf/Skate/Snow Graphics\\".

Sure it may not be the most comprehensive of ALL books EVERYWHERE in terms of skateboarding, skate history, etc. But it does a good job at showing what it's got. The shots and art in this book are beautiful. I've always been a fan of aesthetics, \\"eye candy\\" you know? Which is one of the reasons I think our skateboard shop online does so well ( <a href=\\"www.myboardshop.com\\">www.myboardshop.com</a> ), the gear and clothing we sell is pleasing to the eye.

I was really impressed by their stage presence -- of course the intimate environment helped -- and their multiple encore's. They played for like 3+ hours ... They clearly love performing their tunes as much as writing them. What really turned me on was the interesting divergence from the typical pop dujour of the day. The tunes are clever and the lyrics interesting enough to make you want to play the tune over again, and again... there are phrases here (music and lyric) that I still find my self humming.

Hynes skewers academia so piercingly that I laughed out loud while reading his novellas. Some of the characters--especially characters in the first and third novellas--are loathsome, and it was fun to see them get their comeuppance. Hynes portrayal of academic conferences is so on-target that those in the academy should squirm. His twist on Poe's stories was clever, especially the riff on The Black Cat. The Cask of Amontillado is hinted at in spots of the second novella, but the allusions are weaker. Good summertime reading for anyone missing life in the university."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghosts in the Academy","review":"I received Hynes' book as a Christmas gift and initially thought it contained true horror stories from the academic world. I enjoyed the author's ability to mix the professor's world with the supernatural. I especially enjoyed the first and third stories because they were more clearly based in a college setting. The second story was somewhat obtuse and loaded with details I didn't find interesting. I agree with other reviewers who said the stories were somewhat predictable. I liked the blending of mystery, ghosts, and academic references. Hynes is a talented writer who engaged me completely in his plots. I will look for more work from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for.","review":"I found the characters in the book to be caricatures; and not very entertaining ones at that. The stories all smack of male mid-life crisis, a theme that rapidly becomes predictable.

Suspenseful and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"painfully predictable","review":"Was Poe ever this obvious?Publish and Perish kept me entertained, but with cartoon-comic amusement, as each dropped hint landed like a lead anvil. Long before the last chapter of each story, the ending is apparent, with few, if any, twists along the way.The themes are clever, and the tales themselves clear, concise, and precisely painted. But the stories are populated with easy stereotypes who, in the end, are too blase about their fate. Half the fun of the Cask of Amontillado was savoring Fortunado's screams, wasn't it?Amusing enough for academics with tenure angst, but none of Poe's eerie, elegant, lingering evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute is great in some games","review":"When deciding to purchase this game, i came here, and read the reviews. All i can say is don't let the \\"cuteness\\" of this game fool you. It is an excellent adventure game, with challenging levels to test your skills.Of course, it doesn't hurt that the game really does exude cute, from Parin(the main character), to all her friends in the game. They are all well thought out, and the storyline isn't all that bad, either, considering how many of it's type have come out before.I judge games by how long i play them when i put them in, and considering i didn't put it down until i had to, this game is worth the playing to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic game from beginning to end.","review":"As another review states, don't let the cuteness put you off. This is truly an awesome game, great adventure, some difficult bosses to kill, each level is fun. Also it is quite a long game, so will keep you entertained for hours.After completing it I am truly surprised this game is not more well known. It is like medievil, one of the best psp games out there but so few know about it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Bonny: A Non-historical Portrayal","review":"Very fast read with pretty much no historical accuracy whatsoever associated with the female pirate Anne Bonny.

Sometimes influenced by Jack Johnson (a buddy of Donavon), but leaning more towards soul and ballads. The guy has a pleasing voice, and could use his guitar skills more (check his tasty solo on the latest g love CD \\"lemonade\\"). Songs are pretty good, although no one really stands out as a killer tune. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Enjoyable","review":"Heavily influenced by Jack Johnson, (maybe because Jack appears on one track and produced the album), this cd is great to just chill and listen to. It's so easy-going how could you not like it. if you like jack johnson, you'll like donavon alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"If you like Jack Johnson you won't be diappointed with this CD. Go ahead and buy it and tell your fellow Jack Johnson music lovers about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Johnson? No, not at all.","review":"Although both Jack and Donavon share in the laid back surf culture style of music, and dispite that Jack produced this album and plays in some of the tracks, Donavon definately has a style that makes him a unique artist. This is an amazing album and is worth every penny it cost me to get it up here in Canada ($38.99 CDN). Plus, he has a moustache... bold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music from the Mango Tree","review":"If you have read any of the other reviews, you know what you are getting with this one. This album is pretty much a Jack Johnson clone, with a bit more production. It was recorded at Jack's studio \\"The Mango Tree\\" in Oahu and produced by him as well so it should come as no surprise that the album has that surfer/sunshine vibe. Great summer listening here, you won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, deliberate, and just tries too hard.........","review":"You dont really need to listen to this album to know what to expect. You have a retro-seventies album cover and a wanna-be throwback. I admire Donavon as a surfer, but just because you surf doesnt mean you can be just as creative musically.Most of these tracks have one single common denominator, they are contrived, deliberate and boring. Musically, they have been done before and you can name a band from the 60's or 70's that influenced that song. Why not do a Scott Walker song cover? That may break up the boredom on this album. It may be mellow- but it has no soul. The music sounds forced and the lyrics dont flow well. I think being star struck is what has given him great reviews. Keep surfing Donavon and tell your sponsors it just a side gig. Look for this one in your favorite used CD section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun and sun music","review":"Nice easy album to listen to. With the summer coming up I have taken this album out after not listening to it for a while. \\"It Don't Matter\\" is my favorite song on this cd, although the whole album is really good. While I am on this subject I will also dust off my Jack Johnson cd as well. This is the perfect album for relaxing or enjoying some fun in the sun. I am going to load this in my iPod and make for the sun as soon as I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even baby loves it!","review":"This is a great CD, very mellow and relaxing. It would be really great in the summer time when the weather is warm and sunny. It definitly inspires a margarita and a tan.I bought this CD shortly after my daughter was born and it's one of the few things that calm her and put her to sleep (she's got great taste in music at only 2 months old!).Unfortunatly, this album was much better before I was listening to it 4-5 times a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"I heard \\"Free\\" and really liked it, so I bought the CD. Unfortunately, the songs all sound pretty much the same to me. So it's good on shuffle, but not played straight through. I'm really into good lyrics too, and this one doesn't cut it in that department. He seems like a laid back, cool guy though, so I don't mind him getting my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! Another Jack Johnson!","review":"I'm sure Donovan hates being compared to Jack Johnson, but his music is like another Jack Johnson CD whom I can't get enough of. This is the kind of music that makes me want to move to Hawaii, sell everything I own, get a hammock and just hang out. The acoustic rhythms and excellent vocals, make for a fun, easy-going album. I really love it, and if you're a fan of Jack, it's a must have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent album","review":"I can't help but notice that people think donavon and jack sound so similar...it could be that they have been lifelong friends and learned to play the guitar together. Neither one of them is trying to sound like the other...but they do both have a similar sound. Donavon is one of the better non-competition surfers out there...plus he plays good music, what more could you want? The album is slightly more repetitive and the lyrics fall a little short from jack's...but then again jack has sold about 5 million albums and made a few great surf films ( I HIGHLY reccomend buying \\"Thicker than Water\\"}.I'd reccomend buying this album if you have heard jack johnson's music and like it...but be forewarned, it is repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good classic basis repeated in many books","review":"Prandtl was a pioneer in wing theory.

I bought it, played it, and it was the same as the original. The song length is actually shorter than the original(according to the liner notes).I later went back to Styxworld.com and the statement was removed from TS's notes.Now that DDY is gone, they have to resort to this type of Tom-Foolery to sell records.I could have made a mix from the original Styx albums I already own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh . . . why.","review":"Ok, I've never been a big fan of \\"greatest hits\\" albums. They're usually little more than record labels cashing in on fans by reselling them music that they already have . . plus one, perhaps two new tracks. They also usually sell to the one or two casual fans that are just waiting for that one disc to get all their favourite tracks in one place.This disc does neither. It has to be the most useless, irrelevant, and pointless compilation ever released. More irrelevant even than those wretched \\"20th Century Masters\\" discs. This isn't even a \\"hits\\" album. Midnight Ride, Shooz, and Little Suzie are hardly the sort of tracks that landed Styx in the rock history books. Why does this compilation exist?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, Do we need this?","review":"Not a bad song on this record. Nice to see some recognition of Shooz. This is a great song. Midnight Ride rocks as well. But, really, do we need Renegade, Blue Collar Man, and Miss America on another collection? What about Half Penny Two Penny, or even Eddie? Born For Adventure is a great rocking song.... oh wait, Dennis sang and wrote that. Ya get my point? I posted once before a theory that the current Styx keeps putting out new collections of songs that cut Dennis out of the royalties. This collection helps prove my point. I know that DDY co-wrote some of these songs, but this is getting a bit petty. Eventually, there will be enough collections out that allow a fan to purchase all of Tommy's and JY's stuff without buying any of Dennis's. They might as well put out a 3 CD set called \\"All Stuff We Wrote, and None of the Stuff He Wrote.\\" By the way, I still love Styx, and I love Cyclorama. I just don't love the politics.

While I like the music of the current band, I think it's criminal to credit this music to the current lineup. Completly and intentionally omitting a founding member his due credit by plastering a photo and credits of the new band only shows the level of immaturity that still remains here. My suggestion is that you stop making your bitterness so obvious and take the high road like the abandoned member. If you can't count him as part of your history then stop trying to push the altered version on us. Hopefully most of the fans are to smart to buy into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it Up Styx!!","review":"Why in the world is Styx releasing an album of old substandard songs called \\"Rockers\\"? Except for Blue Collar Man, Renegade, Crystal Ball, and Miss America, which you can get on other Styx compilation albums out there (and Lord knows there are enough Styx compilation albums and greatest hits albums), the rest of this album is pure junk. The songs are obnoxious and awful. If you like James Young screeching and screaming at the top of his lungs on songs like Midnight Ride and Heavy Metal Poisoning and Tommy Shaw's obnoxious vocals and juvenile lyrics on Shooz, then maybe this album is for you. Otherwise, consider it B-sides at best and a lame attempt by the current members of Styx to re-create an image that does not include original lead singer and balladeer Dennis DeYoung. This is Styx trying to be \\"heavy metal\\" - the problem is that Styx never did hard rock very well, and this only goes to prove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Ridiculous Can You Get?","review":"This silly bit of nonsense is, to use an expression I read, a childish temper tantrum thrown by Tommy Shaw and James Young in a ridiculous attempt to erase Dennis DeYoung from their history.They have left off many of their best rocking numbers for one reason only -- they were written and sung by Dennis DeYoung.So included are such non-essential Styx songs as Shooz and Little Suzie. And since WHEN is Crystal Ball a \\"rocker\\"????And not included are classic Styx rockers like Rockin' the Paradise, Born for Adventure, Borrowed Time and Lorelei.If you want Styx Rockers, buy the two Greatest Hits CD's and/or their classic works such as Equinox, Grand Illusion, Paradise Theater....you get my point.Hope this thing dies a quick death and Shaw/Young make nothing off of their attempt to deny their past history of greatness when Dennis DeYoung was the creative force behind this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's Kidding Who?","review":"Kind of lame.

There are other (short) portions of the book which seem to be entirely fictional, such as the highly detailed account of Miss Harrison's escape from the convent.Apart from these qualms, the book is for the most part well researched.

(I wasn't really a fan of \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes,\\" but that's just me). He started out in the Mod scene, then psychedelic, on to glam, Motown/disco, ambient, dance, new wave, pop, then singing lead in the brilliant adult contemporary rock band, Tin Machine.This is, in my opinion, his underrated climax. There's not one track on this album that doesn't satisfy. It's a shame the band only recorded two albums (the second of which is not even currently available, to my knowledge), and only lasted a couple years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swedish Dance Band Music","review":"Vikingarna is a Swedish Dance Band founded in 1964.

But this particular dice game wasn't worth buying. I played the game 1 time and all the letters and dots all came off. Within just a few hands of rolling the dice you couldn't see any letters or dots on the dice just black smudges. I would not recommend this brand of the game to anyone. I purchased( at Wal-Mart) the same game in a different brand and we love playing the game.I contacted the manufacturer of the game thatI bought from amazon.com they informed me to contact amazon.com. I did, they wanted me to mail the games back,( at my cost ) but it would have cost me more to mail them back than what they cost when purchased, so they were throwed into the trash, and I chalked it up to my lose!!!! I had purchased 3 of the bad games. One for myself and two for some friends. Needless to say it was very embarassing to me when the games were played they were DUDS!!!!!Left Center Right Collector's Tin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Center Right Collector's Tin","review":"I have been looking for this game ever since a friend introduced us to it.It is a fun game that is so simple the youngest can play along.HOWEVER, this particular set of dice is inferior. By the third game played, the dots had worn off. So, in the trash they will go. Very disappointed in this brand of dice. The symbols need to be etched into the dice, not merely stamped on. I would ask for a refund if the shipping was not such trouble!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected delight.","review":"I bought this CD back in '96, a year or so after it was released, and delayed my purchase because I thought it wasn't a good Sanborn release. Unexpectedly, this CD really gives you some regular 'Sanborn-type' compositions, especially after the free formed and conceptual 'Another Hand', and the laid-back/ballads 'Pearls'. It was 'Another Hand's' disappointment which really kept me off 'Hearsay'. Upon my first listen, I realized that Sanborn was making a strong effort to regain his old audience with some upbeat tunes along with the production help again of Marcus Miller. 'Jaws' really lights up the joint and 'Long Goodbye', 'Little Face', and 'Back to Memphis', all have a strong blues influence which works really well. This one is worth a strong listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"One man's pleasure is another's pain","review":"Contrasting an earlier reviewer, I find this entry from sax wizard David Sanborn to be a highly enjoyable musical experience. Sanborn weaves a varied listening tapestry with slow jams to mid-tempo gems to downright funky scorchers. His reworking of Marvin Gaye's \\"Got to Give It Up\\" pays homage to the original party song, which in itself was more of an instrumental (with Gaye's voice serving as the \\"horn\\"). Other strong highlights are the African-influenced \\"Ojiji\\" and the down-home sound of \\"Back to Memphis.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"This is not a very good effort from David. The music has no soul, its boring and overall play is just plain. I have played this album maybe twice in ten years... and that\`s a lot.

Most of the songs sound like the musical version of a kid doing his homework while watching TV--a half-hearted effort by someone whose attitude is, \\"Well I know I have to write SOMETHING, so here goes...\\" The result is an album full of tunes that could well have been written and performed by a garage jazz band--but definitely NOT what you would expect from an accomplished musician. The one redeeming feature of this CD is that it makes an interesting and decorative (although expensive) coaster. Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of baroque","review":"If you are a lover of the baroque era, then this 2-CD collection performed by Boston Baroque is as good as it gets. The recordings have a faster tempi which sounds very good on most of these concertos and they are crisp and clear.

This is a collection that I had been looking for a long time and finally managed to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Sound, Timeless Music","review":"Boston Baroque is a chamber group that plays these venerable Bach pieces on original instruments. The interpretations seem to strike a middle ground between sounding academic and sounding expressive. Some original instrument productions feature sound that is harsh and dry, but Telarc has captured these instruments in a warm acoustic setting that seems just right for the music. To put my thoughts on these two fine disks in a nutshell, I'd have to say that what we have here are old instruments, new sound, and timeless music."},{"rating":"2","title":"nobody tops Boston Baroque","review":"I am just knocked out by Boston Baroque's performances and the technical perfection of their recordings.

The Boston Baroque makes the best performance I have ever heard of the Six Concertos.

The characters - some of whom are half-altered because of \\"Alien Influence\\" - never really convince the reader they are all good or all bad - in other words, they are quite human.

Unfortunately, Antonio Damasio is not Oliver Sacks when it comes to writing clearly and engagingly. Half way through the book I simply started skimming it....the writing style was just too annoying at that point to warrant a thorough and systematic read.

But those searching for new ideas about how all of this comes together in the mind will need to look elsewhere. If nothing else, this book shows the limits of neuroscience. While neuroscience can explain how our brains receive sensory input from the environment (how the brain works), it is unable to explain how we have thoughts and opinions about the environment or where we get the motivation to study and change the environment (how the mind works). Neuroscientists like Damasio, who believe that scientific techniques will eventually explain the mind, show that the real error in the mind-brain debate may belong to the neuroscientists and not to Descartes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much speculation","review":"If you want to read about scientific facts this is not the book for you.

Without a background in neuroscience it is difficult to evaluate his ideas in a serious way, and anyway he asks for introspection (a la William James) from the reader more than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to love it but its poorly written.","review":"I read lots of these kinds of books by neuroscientists. I expect books like this to hold my attention. This one is so poorly written, I can hardly finish it. Sentences are not tight enough, the subjects keep shifting all over the place, the thesis is lost in the extraneous information. It's frustrating to not be sure if he's hiding the ball, waiting to reveal what was Descarte's Error or if he has already revealed it and is going to simply further drive home the point at the end. That should say it all, if you're not sure he's actually revealed what was Descarte's Error after he has actually hinted at it several times. Far from being too scientific, his writing style seems rambling. He might have great ideas, but he's not the best writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money and time","review":"It is interesting to hear a scientist talk about emotions having value. This is good approach to complex issue that may never be resolved. Question will always remain, what lies beneath the facts, and can we ever be sure that we didn't alter reality by studying it.

As an antidote, read the works of Raymond Tallis (especially his \\"The Explicit Animal\\", and \\"On the Edge of Certainty\\"), a British physician who is not only a crack neurologist (he writes textbooks on this subject) but also a savvy philosopher who understands the severe limitations of what he calls the \\"neurophilosophies\\" such as the type espoused by Damasio.

This book gives a great guide to rational thinking and the effect of frontal lobe damage (think Phineas Gage), but its coverage of emotions and the psychoneurology of them is weak, at best. His somatic markers theory suggests that parts of the body elicit an emotional reaction which interfaces with the amygdala and limbic system, but provides very little real evidence. As such, it is often quoted as a brief footnote in introductory psychology texts, but very little more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly deserving X factor winner!!!","review":"His voice is so refreshing, typical of the British \\"blue-eyed soul\\" performers.

Painful because folks who have been Christians for many years are finding themselves wrestling -- many for the first time in their lives -- with the idea of the sovereignty of God. Powerful because Jerry dares to declare the truth of the Bible: that God is indeed sovereign and yet we are still 100% responsible.

I think it was about about a month and a half later when I woke up and had buckwheat hulls all over the place. The pillow had split apart along one of the seams and leaked hulls into the pillow case. The pillow did not split at the sewn seam like I would expect, but tore right NEXT to the seam. The tear was a surprise because the pillow case seems to be pretty good quality. The plan is to take it my mother-in-law, who can sew the heck out of it. It won't be pretty, but functional.Now... defect aside... I liked the pillow. My preference was for a down pillow, but those are super expensive these days. This pillow is similar from the standpoint that you can shape it the way you want and it holds its shape - great for stomach sleepers. The support is very firm though. I took a fair amount of hulls out and put them in a Zip-Lock bag - that made the pillow work better for me. I found the smell pleasant - sort of like cedar, maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"This pillow took a night or two to get used to.

The item is as described, appears to be of good quality and provides a generous amount of filling, hence the 4 stars. But as far as the pillow having some magical effect on my sleeping habits, this has not been the case for me. I recently emptied out a significant amount of the filling as the pillow was too high and firm otherwise, but that didn't make much difference. So for me, I don't seem to benefit from the advantages that this type of pillow is supposed to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I really hoped for something better after reading some of the praising reviews.

No matter how expensive they were, they only last firm and supportive one month the most. Then after research, I gave this one a try. It has been three years and this is still the best pillow in my life. All I do is bought some refills to replace the old breaking buckwheat after two years using, and per instruction, I only do it once and it will last. Great pillow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome pillow!","review":"Finally I can get the rest I need. I was contemplating on what type of pillow to buy to help alleviate my neck and back pain. I have to say my search is over. This pillow may weigh a few pounds a smell a little funny but it is by far the most comforting. They way it conforms to my head wether I'm laying on my side or back is just right. I am definitely satisfied with my purchase and I'm actually sleeping a lot longer without getting up throughout the night tossing and turning. Oh and one last thing, this pillow actually stays cool even during the day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Pillow","review":"This is an excellent pillow. I had used a Tempur-Pedic Cloud pillow for the past year, but for some reason began to have upper back and neck spasms. It definitely seemed related to my head position on the pillow. After reading the reviews, I decided to try this buckwheat pillow instead. I haven't had a back spasm since. I'm sleeping so much better than I ever have. My only issues with the buckwheat pillow are that it is very heavy and it is loud. There is a fair amount of noise when you move your head on the pillow. If you are a light sleeper, this might bother you a little bit. Overall, very satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pillows","review":"My husband and I were watching TV one night and an info-mercial came on about the Japanese Sobakawa pillows. My hubby's been to Japan numerous times and said he loved the pillows there and would like to buy some. Being the good wife that I am, I decided to buy the pillows for him (and myself, of course) for xmas. When I looked up sobakawa on the interent, organic buckwheat pillows popped up, so I decided to investigate buckwheat pillows as an alternative. The reviews were fantastic! So, I took a gamble and ordered the buckwheat pillows. We've been sleeping on them since xmas night, they're great! The buckwheat hulls can be moved around inside the case to wherever you need them and they provide just the right support. So, no matter what your sleeping position, side, back, tummy, you'll be comfortable. It's not a soft, fluffy kind of pillow, and might take some getting used to but we adapted to them right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. Sleep on a rock.","review":"I read the reviews and people stated that the pillow was hard but try it because it's wonderful. Well it's not. It IS hard. Like concrete. And though I read that if I gave it a try it would bring me relief, it did not. I tried taking out about a third of the filling and it still did not help. I still wake up with the usual headache and neck pain, but now I also have back pain and I'm tired from continually waking up because I'm uncomfortable. If you are used to a firm pillow you might be able to adjust to this but if you like your pillow even a little soft, save your money. These things are WAY too expensive and I'm sorry that I let my desperation for relief convince me to try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"buckwheat pillow","review":"I have a severe sensitivity to odors. They trigger my asthma. In all the write ups about buckwheat pillows, I never saw reference to the fact that buckwheat hulls have quite a strong smell to them. Therefore, I was never able to use the pillow. When I inquired about returning it, there was such a large fee involved that it really was not worthwhile packing it up and shipping it back. The advice I got was to empty out the hulls and let them air out. I had already done this....it has been several months since I started airing them out and the smell is still too strong for me to tolerate. I'll give it some more time, but had I known about the odor, I certainly would never have ordered the pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugs!!!","review":"I am a buckwheat pillow user-- they cradle my head, keep it cool and my neck never hurts. When I bought my first one, it was hell getting used to for the first week, but then it was great everafter; I have a hard time sleeping on anything else. My big issue is that these particular pillows have bugs. I ordered them some months back and everything was sealed in original packaging and the house is very bug-free. I saw some other reviews saying their pillows had insects as well, so I am not impressed by the company's sterilization methods. I have just written to them, so have not heard from customer yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infested with bugs! Do NOT buy.","review":"I bought a buckwheat pillow figuring I would try it out. However, I soon after found other pillows I liked, so I not only never used the buckwheat pillow but I never even opened it. Thank god for that because when I took it out of the closet today, the pillow was infested with tons of tiny bugs, all crawling around pillow and the inside of the, hopefully still sealed, plastic bag. I'm hoping none of these disgusting bugs escaped and needless to say the pillow is already in the garbage. I saw another review here about bug infestations with these pillows. This is completely irresponsible of this company to sell bug infested pillows and they should be put out of business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent idea, but smells","review":"On the upside, delivery was fast and the pillowcase seems like its pretty good quality. I appreciated the instructions that accompanied the pillow. Overall, I had high expectations for this pillow, but it smells. I've tried leaving it to air out with the zipper open as well as out in the sun for about two weeks. I finally tried sleeping with it and I've had headaches everyday since. I finally gave up last night when I woke up with a headache ... I'll try airing it out in a separate part of the house, hopefully the odor goes away and I'll try again in a couple of months, but its a little frustrating. I wish the hulls were aired out for quite awhile before they were added to the pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these","review":"Ever buy a fluffy pillow and a month later it is flat and lumpy and you can't get comfortable on it ever again? You won't have that problem with these. This pillow is for people who like FIRM. I like a very firm mattress and a very firm pillow. I have had almost NO NECK PROBLEMS since using buckwheat pillows. I've been using them for 5 years. I purchased more buckwheat to fill the pillows more, but most people seems to like them (what I consider) half empty.I do not understand people who say they are loud. There is a gentle sound when you move the pillow, but I've never noticed it while sleeping. I also do not understand people complaining about the smell. I have a very sensitive nose, and I have never noticed a smell except when emptying the cases to wash them. I do notice a VERY SLIGHT grain scent. Although I love natural scents, so I would probably enjoy that smell even if I smelled it at night, which I do not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable to sleep on","review":"I am surprised at the good reviews!

Mine did. The pillow comes in plastic casing. The bugs were crawling inside of the casing on the pillow itself, which makes me think it's an issue with the manufacturer rather than Amazon's warehouse, where the order came from last.In other news, the item came in a large box that was dented on the side and sealed up haphazardly with tape. I've never had this happen before with Amazon. It's bizarre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable pillow","review":"I had high expectations for this pillow after reading all the reviews. Unfortunately, I just couldn't find a comfortable position to sleep on this thing. It gave me neck and ear pains most mornings when I woke up. I really dislike that the buckwheat hulls form a very hard surface to sleep on and they do not give. It felt like I was sleeping on a giant bag of rice. To have a contoured spot for my head to rest on (instead of just a flat surface) I basically had to carve a spot out of the pillow with my hands, lay my head in it and then lift the sides of the pillow up to form the hulls around my head. I tried to make it work for about five months, but it just wasn't the one for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pillow, but go with the traditional size.","review":"I live in the deep South where nights can be very warm. Regular pillows were too hot and often don't provide enough support. The buckwheat pillow is much cooler and gives very good support without feeling \\"hard\\". My child and mother have both tried it and liked it, so much so that they'll find one under the tree this Christmas. There are two considerations a potential purchaser should understand. 1) Buckwheat pillows are heavier compared to any other pillow I've had, so it is not suitable for camping or hauling around. 2) I found that the \\"twin/standard\\" I got was really larger than necessary. I intend to get the smaller size as gifts, and recommend that others get the traditional smaller Japanese sized pillow as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buckwheat pillow","review":"The product arrived very quickly. It's heavy! An 11 lbs. pillow took some getting used to, but I'm now very happy with its support and how it treats my neck. After fluffing the pillow, I suggest rolling your head on it a little bit to hollow out a space for your head with a raised bit under your neck.Since it is a very heavy pillow, be very careful when you lift it. The seams on the cloth can give if you pick it up wrong, though thankfully it was very easy to repair when it did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money...","review":"I read the reviews online and decided to give this pillow a try.

Perhaps it's because each time through, I seem to find something new to like about it. Johnston's tales of love and loss, abuse, and suicide quickly pull you in, and often leave you with a very uneasy feeling. But despite the darker storylines, Johnston manages to incorporate a nice mix of melodies into a musical backdrop that is as fresh today as it was back in 1994. My personal favorites are the album's title track and \\"Cold Again\\", two of the more melancholy tunes about an absent father attempting reconciliation and homelessness. Easily deserves 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must\\" For a Doctor Who Collector","review":"Doctor Who: Aliens and Enemies is considered a paperback.

The pictures are not only in color, but describe different aspects of the creatures. Some of the creatures are described in depth (such as the Clockwork Robots from the \\"Girl in the Fireplace\\" episode). Another episode that is described in depth is \\"The Christmas Invasion\\", which shows how the Sycorax were created showing their bone-like face. Although there is more information regarding the ninth and tenth doctors than there is with the others, this is still a good reference tool for the serious Doctor Who collector. Some of these pages are also included in \\"Doctor Who: The Ultimate Monster Guide\\", 2009."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great behind the scenes look...","review":"The book offers a fun, interesting look at the various aliens and monsters of the modern Doctor Who's second series, including design sketches and make-up processes.

Too bad this record got obscured by the onslaught of records by Puffy's Bad Boy and Suge's Death Row as they started their rise to marketshare dominance in the mid 90s. Pete Rock's beats are unparallelled in its crisp, jazzy, musically layered production and CL definitely has one of the smoothest flows in the game. Its a shame CL is in the DL right now. But till this day, I'm amazed that this record still sounds tight as it did when I first heard it back in the 95. \\"Searchin\\" could have blown up in the radio while still maintaining its cred. \\"In the Flesh\\" is straight up one of the illest jazzy beats the PR ever created. Don't get me wrong, each track stands in its own and there is no filler. If you are into jazzy production, and clever lyrics from one of the greatest duo's that was overlooked, this album is the must have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is educating.","review":"I listened to the whole album and it is so unique.The work put down by these brothers can not be compared.A lot of rappers come out with very common stuff and just like fashion.But with the main ingredient it is a whole lot different thing.The tracks are not all about party but explore on important issues in life.This is an album one can listen for the rest of their lives.Very soul touching and for real they are the soul brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album for a Road Trip","review":"I grew up on hip hop, but I rarely listen to new stuff. A friend recommended this old-school album and it did not disappoint. Although no single track stands out for me as a legendary song, this is a fantastic album to listen to straight through. No songs should be skipped. Great album for a road trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Widely overlooked gem from \\"94\\". Classic","review":"Widely overlooked gem from \\"94\\". This album was unfortunately released around the same time that Nas, Biggie, Keith Murray, Craig Mack and Murder was the case dropped, which meant no airplay. Since I was a Pete and CL fiend I was up on this release. Musically this cd delivers the goods. CL still has the complex metaphors and Pete is still nice less horns though.Favorites are Main Ingredient, Take you there, WorldWide(The beat is outcold, sounds like a xylophone. RobO rips),It's on you, All the places, Carmel City, Check it out, and Searching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Deal","review":"This (as well as their first album, Mecca and the Soul Brother) is the \\"Real Deal\\". I honestly can not think of any artists whose albums are as complete and enjoyable. The beats jump and the production is tight. The lyrics and CL's delivery is distinct as Biggie and clever as Q-Tip. Maybe they haven't had commercial success because they don't make the garbage that put the \\"Puff\\" into Daddy. When they look back, this duo will stand out like great artists who were not appreciated in their own time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what happens when a Hip Hop album comes together","review":"Like they were born out of the same womb, Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth blend beats and flows together like a fine wine. It is well known that Pete Rock is one of the best producers in hip hop, and if you are wondering why, this album is exibit A. Every track on this album will make your head bob, while C.L. smooth rhymes like he is drunk on style. There are so many goods beats on this album, Pete Rock has extras leaking out of the ends of tracks, just tempting you will his unbelievably delicious recipes. Smooth compliments him so well, you are almost depressed when the album ends. It is truly music at its most perfect state, simmering on the stove, bubbling with flavor. This is delicious hip hop, one for every hip hop fans pantry. The \\"Main Ingredient\\" is as tasty as music gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly sub-par lyricism","review":"I loved this album as a pre-teen in the early noughties, but it doesn't hold up. He calls himself CL the 'sextified', over and over - and that sums up the tone of this album. I don't know what happened but C.L. smooth fell off so hard on this album. He's just sex-obsessed on this, it makes most of the tracks awkward and unlistenable and off-putting. He's trying to play an LL Cool J ladies-man role, and it is just not working at all. And that's a damn shame because this is some of Pete Rock's best production (that is, when he doesn't simply xerox the samples from Donald Byrd) perhaps some of the best production of the era period. If only there were someone else on the mic riding these beats, this record would be mentioned alongside Illmatic and Ready to Die as the genre's most beloved classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"genuwine hip hop","review":"I just heard this album almost a decade after its release, i only knew few tracks from this Rap duet, and TROY was the best.simply speaking, the album took me back to hip hop's golden era when both music production and the lyrics where at the peaks of depth and innovation. CL's flow is amazing and Pete Rock's production is very catchy. this album as well as Soul Brothers (return of the mecca) are certainly worth listening to any hip hop fan, and i mean the real 90's hip hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as described","review":"Just as described.

Unfortunately, the DVD only incorporates \\"creation\\" in varying segments throughout the DVD, which creates a logistical problem for a classroom setting where we have only a limited time period and can't spend a lot of time fast-forwarding the DVD.

The piano here is like a sumo-wrestler getting punched by Olive Oyl - absorbing all it all in a bland half-asleep manner.I own dozens of sets of the Beethoven Piano Sonatas - to the great dismay of my poor visa-card - that's how much I love them!

I didn't know who the pianist was and was struck by how unimaginative and dull the performance was. Having grown up listening to recordings of Arrau, Richter, Kempf, and Brendel in this repetoire I was bemused that such a dull performance as the one I was hearing would be broadcast nationally. Beethoven should never be uninteresting!!! It's such great music! Well, the pianist I was listening to turned out to be John O'Coner.

It is packed full of feminist, anti-Christian garbage all written with a condescending, smarter-than-thou tone and all equally based upon an ignorant understanding of the world and an apparent complete lack of knowledge of either the history and dynamics of Western culture or of Christianity.

(I also use HSS knife systems for other profiles in solid woods). I do a lot of painted (lacquered) kitchen cabinet doors and that usually includes MDF raised panels for stability and cost containment. With the amount of wear that MDF places on my tooling, the replaceable knives for about thirty dollars a set, are a far cry better than getting the cutters sharpened or replaced. These cutters are fine, and offer the variety of several profiles for the doors. Since I use hardwood for the rails and stiles, I stick with the traditional cutters for those profiles.Amazon shipping has never let me down, and the speedy return policy is every bit worth the slightly higher price compared to other vendors's sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Wild Ride","review":"\\"Edwards' and Stephen's COMING CLEAN is an unflinching exploration of every dimension of human sexuality: the good, the slimy, and the grotesque.

The first is that I'm really keen on the Christie/Sayers/Rinehart/Tey-formula mysteries and contemporary material has never been my favorite. The second is that this work appears to be targeted more for female readers -- and, thus, not so much for me, although I read a lot of womens' reading that I much enjoy.That being said, I agree with other reviewers who said that there was no mystery here and I was also anticipating the \\"twist\\" at the end to pull it all out of the dump -- it didn't happen. Anticlimatic. I think a much better title would have been \\"An English Novel\\" and that way, one would get more of what one expected.There is some subtle psychology in the book which I credit with the second star but the alleged humor, stated on the dustcover, is about as funny as a sharp stick in the eye.I suppose this book was a-o-k for some folks but it was a big letdown for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Plots","review":"This is not a murder mystery; indeed, it is well nigh impossible to say what it is.

The prose is at times pompous and at other times simplistic.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and a Waste of Money","review":"One of the worst \\"mystery\\" books I have ever read.

I kept hoping the book would redeem itself with a clever ending. It didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decaying families and murder","review":"When murder happens, reporter Alison wonders if it will rocket her to fame, but she does little more than wonder. Indeed, it seems past the capability of anyone in this quirky and well written novel to act at all--except in sudden bursts of murder.The murdered couple were part of a disfunctional family unable to cope with their child and the problems they faced. Alison's family was similarly disfunctional, with results that mirrored the murdered couple.The back cover promises that AN ENGLISH MURDER is a different kind of murder. Indeed it is. The mystery becomes the smallest part of this investigation into a community made up of members each of which is so obsessed with their individual problems that they cannot raise their heads enough to see the larger troubles that surround them. It is high praise indeed to say that Louise Doughty actually pulls it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolving from a Two-Man Home Act Into A Full Band","review":"Even though this album put an end to TMBG's two-man act of using synthetic drum sets and keyboard wierdness, \\"John Henry\\"-The first of TMBG's full band era- is still a very good album. Infact, the full band is the only thing that has changed, because their clever and quirky lyrics are still in abundance. Between the alt. rock music, shades of goofy pre-band keyboards and such can still be heard. Songs like \\"Subliminal\\", \\"Extra Savoir-Faire\\" snd \\"O, Do Not Forsake Me\\" are like early TMBG, so the musical sound is not completely lost. Nonetheless, the rock music is still very good and well-performed. Even if you are a bigger fan of their earlier styles like me, you can still like this album. (Hey, they do a remake of the Nyquil Driver ad music on here, and if that isn't TMBG, I don't know what is.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"They Might Be Giants or maybe John Henry","review":"This CD does'nt fail the reputation that TMBG has earned from there previous albums. This album contains some real good solid songs along with there regular really weird songs but even those are great to listen to and are very entertaining.

I recommend songs 6, 16 , and a great weird one: 17.-Joseph C"},{"rating":"2","title":"From 'pop-alternative' to 'grunge?'...","review":"This CD is a departure from typical TMBG songs to a supposedly 'better,' more professional type of music philosophy in their schematics. In this 'grunge-type' album, they had more band members, so theoretically, they would sound more professional, than they would with their 'duo.' I don't necessarily think that their songs sounded any better instrumentally, because of this. Although, this is still reminiscent of TMBG: namely, cute, humorous, and full of creativity, I'm not a big fan of 'grunge,' and don't think this is one of TMBG best albums...though, it is, nonetheless, pretty cool and worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is awesome!","review":"I really liked 'Apollo 18' and 'Flood', so I began searching for another album I had heard about called 'John Henry'.

So, I was browsing through my fave alternative music hole-in-the-wall today, and WOW I came across 'John Henry' for only (drum roll) EIGHT BUCKS!! I have to say, it was definitely worth the wait.

However, I'd give Apollo 18 5 stars and this one only 4 because this one contains more filler. But I still like it more. My enjoyment is 5 stars, but the song quality is only 4. It's amazingly hard to understand.Anyway, what good shtuff do we have here? We have the utterly awesome album openers \\"Subliminal\\" and \\"Snail Shell,\\" we have the rockers \\"Destination Moon\\" and \\"I Should Be Allowed To Think,\\" and the interesting tunes like \\"The End Of The Tour,\\" \\"A Self Called Nowhere,\\" and \\"AKA Driver.\\"Only \\"O Do Not Forsake Me\\" and \\"Dirt Bike\\" come off to me as utterly unlistenable. It's a very good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is their hardest album yet","review":"You really get a full band feel throughout most of this album and they add horns to many of the tracks as well. The only problem with this album is that it is their longest and features the most amount of songs that are longer than their trademark of under 3 minutes, even 2 minutes. There are a number of songs on here that are longer than 4 and some that just feel longer. AT a certain point it just feels as if the album has stayed past its welcome. I'm not sure if it does. I like this album because it shows the influence of grunge on a few tracks while also staying true to the stylistic flipping from song to song that they are known for. You might not make it through the entire album in one sitting, but it's still high quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"JH is excellent, like all their albums","review":"This is They Might Be Giants' first album to feature a live band over the old Drum Machine.

I'll admit that the first few listens were tough, but like all Giants albums, you discover more as you go along. I don't think it's fair to say that their old stuff is better. Who really likes drum machines anyway? Don't get me wrong, early Giants material is amazing, but how much emotion and intensity can you really get from a computer?

I use to buy them and give them to some of my new friends in Christ and have been trying to find some for a long time both to give and to have it again to read myself.

On a recording it is difficult to judge the actual size of the voice, but here it sounds like it is of spinto weight singing primarily lyric repertoire. As another reviewer noted, the Pearl Fishers and Tosca arias are particularly effective and affecting.There are, however, two facts about this recital which disturb me: 1.) de la Mora is often out of tune when leaping down to notes and at the inception of held notes and 2.) after listening to him for twenty minutes or so my throat empathetically tightens. I hope his exciting vocal production and high-lying repertoire aren't being produced at the cost of his vocal health and career longevity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Musical Experience","review":"Listening to this marvelous voice makes me so happy that I am part of the musical world. Fernando de la Mora is truly a treasure. His interpretation of these beautiful arias is unique and filled with a passion and emotion very hard to find in the world of opera today.His rendition of \\"Je crois entendre encore\\" made me cry...this is such a difficult and delicate aria and he delivers with such intensity. The aria \\"E luccevan le stelle\\" from Tosca, as interpreted here, is the most beautiful version that I have ever heard.Fernando de la Mora's voice is a gift from God. I highly recommend this CD with a resounding bravississimo and hope that all of you in Amazon.comland make it a part of your prized music collection as I have made it a part of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"4GB USB Storage Drive","review":"Broke in less than a year and had only been used twice.

Flimsy and cheap--not even wire or rubber mesh, but string. For an investment of thirty bucks you can buy some heavy duty staking poles and cages at a hardware store and you could make enough for three or four earthboxes. outrageous price for the shipping and this piece of garbage. It does not deserve to have earthbox name affiliated with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I was skeptical about these staking systems until I bought my first one. These are very sturdy. Just to be able to have the wider base with the wheels is worth it because you can move the boxes around easier. In my case i have them on the grass, so when we mow i need to move them. The trellis part itself is plenty sturdy enough for all of the plants i have used so far and it helps to brace plants that you wouldn't use a trellis with. For example i have 16 stalks of corn in an earth box. with the trellis i can use the garden velcro to secure them and keep them upright. These will be reusable for years and are securely and very nicely attached to the box. I have since bought them for all of my boxes. You can also either buy the netting part yearly through earth box or make your own with garden twine found at your local home stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Volume 1","review":"Worth having this film that was recorded live on the European tour.

They do know that it is hard to find someone again doing this mistake. I looked at the book. This is $ 10 worth, not more. And impossible to sell again. I am a student. I do not have so much money to afford the required book. So I got really frustrated and faced losts of problems in the following weeks and spent a lot of time and energy to get the right book.

It was pure torture! Although there is learning value to this book, there are also many things that make you want to tear your hair out. My main issue is with the graphic illustrations. There are quite a few, but I have not found one that is useful in any form. Some graphs don't even label what is being shown, just a line usually. I wish my \\"favorite\\" graph could be explained in words.Like I said, this book does also teach you about the subject so it is not all bad, but I have used a different cost management text that was much better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected but good none the less","review":"Let me start off by saying this is a great book for a fan of the warhammer 40k universe. Now with that out of the way I'll tell you what it's not, it's not a book that will let you look inside the world of an Inquisitor. What you get instead is a glimpse into the shadows of the Imperium through the experiences of the Inquisitor Jaq Draco, and then down a most questionable path for an Inquisitor.Excellent book, I read it from start to finish in 2 days.

It was maybe good back then, when there was no WH40K novels, but now, out of 30 novels, the whole trilogy is at the bottom of the lines, they're is a few intersting part, but the story line change to much, without saying why, and nothing is never explained, you&#65533;re always why? what? when? And how long is that boring story going to last.The world is dead, and taste like ash, everything is dark, evil, it is hard to understand, even for a fan. The author change the story line like I change my hair style, without a reason, just for fun. It&#65533;s respectable for back then, and maybe worth reading for hardcore fan, but don&#65533;t expect too much.

It's a real shame, as the current lineup of this band (featuring Paul Kantner, Jack Casady, Marty Balin, and Diana Mangano among others) can be a stone killer in concert. It's also unfortunate that about half of this set repeats selections (though not performances) from their 1995 effort, \\"Deep Space, Virgin Sky.\\" Fans deserve much, much better quality, and the band isn't doing itself any favors by adding this sort of material to it's catalogue.

Peter Matthiessen engrossingly tells the life history of many of the North American species, including segmentation of habitat during the seasons, and wonders of migration. Along the way he introduces ecological principles as Bergman's Rule and evolutionary ideas of speciation (how did Western and Semipalmated sandpipers separate?).Since the initial publishing of this book and the forward (in 1994), the optimism of recovery of species may be diminished, as many are declining. The illustrations are all well done, and Matthiessen introduces each chapter with literary quotes, such as Shakespeare's \\"sometimes I'll get the young scamels (bar-tailed godwit) from the rock\\".

The book encourages a violent and creepy method of forced love. How are your children supposed to learn respect for others when this sadistic method of punishment (yes, it is punishment) is used in the home. It is a form of torture as far as I am concerned, breaking the child's will to fight and violating their right to.. i don't know.. not be smothered? It is an potentially abusive and pseudoscientific method that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children, including at least six documented child fatalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to abuse your autistic child ...","review":"Apparently this method was originally designed for autistic children. Not only is the purported justification of this - that autism stems from a failure in mother-child bonding - one which has been scientifically discredited since the sixties, but for many autistic people (who often have tactile hypersensitivity that makes physical contact uncomfortable if not painful) the forced holding advocated here is nothing short of torture: a form of \\"sensory rape\\".All forced holding can teach ANY child is that someone on whom you are completely dependent is prepared to ignore your screaming and struggling and physically overpower you. And then call it love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get a quack please!","review":"This book was written by a quack! It's blaming parents for their child's problems. In this day and age we should know better. AdHD and many other problems in children metioned in this book are chemical and biological. This is a cult group! Please take time out to see that, if someone told you you were in a cult at least investigate. This approch is out dated.

Theories, which claim that autism is caused by the parents, by a lack of \\"bonding.\\" These outrageous and extremely detrimental claims have since been disproved.While actually doing the \\"holdings\\" with your child I really do not believe to be detrimental, please also try some other more active approaches. Learn about you child. Try \\"The Me Book\\" by Dr. Lovaas, or \\"Handbook for Treatment of Attachment-Trauma Problems in Children\\" by Beverly James.

I was told the album was made when Dean and Gene locked themselves into a studio, got way high and started recording.

Yeah, they're funny, but I can make funny songs with a 4-track and my bong.

I wish I could distribute a record of me and my roommate doing the same thing and then have people praise me online. If this was a record made by, say, The Goo Goo Dolls, would y'all still lavish it with the same praise? P.S. I've decided to give \\"The Pod\\" another try.

I heard a reviewer say that they should have called it \\"Pain\\" and I think he's right. It is the kind of album which reminds me of being physically sick and in pain, though that may not sound like something you'd like to listen to. It's got Ween's characteristic humor still intact though, so there is some relief.

That is an idiotic and childish device because only a child would whine and make up excuses when caught out in gross misbehavior, a 31-yr old is definitely old enough to get over his father. I cannot myself say that I felt the least attraction towards Jack. As for Diana being jealous of his flirting with other women, I must paraphrase Georgette Heyer, in one of her books she wrote that only a child would be taken in by such behavior, any adult would only be disgusted by it.Loretta Chase's Lord of Scoundrels and Edith Layton's The Duke's Wager deal with much the same plot in a way that is much more mature and interesting.Unlike The Plumed Bonnet or the Famous Heroine, this book was definitely a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"a heap of rubbish with a diamond at its core","review":"This book is an insult to one's intelligence.

I have used Garmin a few times in rental cars and I didn't have to read user manuals. For the MIO I had to download the user manual (they don't supply it with the unit) but even then it isn't easy to use.Additionally, what prompted me to write this review is that it has inaccurate maps. I had trouble in Arlington, Mass (near Boston) yesterday when the map had a stream and kept asking me to take that and sent me in circles when the street didn't exist on the map.Also, there website is really basic and doesn't provide any good technical support. For example, one can't ask questions over email or get technical support. Can you beat that in today's age?Gaurav"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bang for the buck","review":"I won't waste time reiterating all the great features. Others have already pointed out the benefits of the SirF III chipset, iGO software, etc. I will say that 99% of the shortcomings on this unit are due to the TeleAtlas maps. Just because they are dated 2005 doesn't mean that they are accurate up to that time. I've found several errors/omissions in areas that have not changed in five years. Other features which changed little more than two years ago ARE correct. Go figure.It was initially rumored that the TeleAtlas updates scheduled for release in Spring 2007 would be free. It now appears that may not be true. Either way, I'll be getting the updates. The Mio C310x is a great value now.

It took me a little bit to figure out how to work the map but I didn't read the manual so what can I expect.The mp3 player is nice and works fine with or without headphones. I use it at work (I don't have an IPod or anything else)and can charge it on the computer using the USB cord when I step away. The random mode doesn't seem to be too random, it picks the same songs everytime unless you add or delete some songs...wierd but not terrible.Overall, great for the money,most navigation systems don't even offer the added mp3 player so that counts for something."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Customer Support","review":"The Mio Digiwalker product is ok but their support is non-existent.

It's a shame we have companies that will do everything to make it right and then ones like this one that just don't care.

I had a great one that lasted over 10 years and it was rubberized plastic. It put out a nice, fine almost mist spray -- great for spraying on hair products or water on plant leaves.This one was more expensive than the last one I had and a bit smaller. Also the spray is much heavier than I expected (not what I would call \\"micro\\") and the sprayer spits constantly, putting out bigger splotches of water. It doesn't matter how much or little water I use, or how much I pump it.Basically I was very disappointed. I have looked for some time to find a replacement for my beloved micro sprayer. But this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Witch\\" is a beauty!","review":"Steeped in historical ambiance, \\"The Witch from the Sea\\" provides a richly entertaining look at the arduous, yet strangely beautiful life of seafaring privateers in the nineteenth century. The heroine, Tory Lightfoot, is a hardy adventurer worthy of Anne Bonny and Grace O'Malley. Tory meets life with courage and grace, reveling in the demands of her chosen career, set on proving to herself and the world that there's more to her than meets the eye. To my mind, Lisa Jensen has a written an exemplary tale of courage and romance. A rare find, I look forward to the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact & Useful","review":"Bought this as a 3rd booster for my 4 year old.

The only problem is that he cannot bring the seatbelt down and buckle himself in. In his previous harness-based seat, he was able to buckle himself in - now he needs his parents to do it for him. On the plus side, he can unbuckle himself now, when he couldn't before.We are hoping that he can learn to bring the seatbelt down himself, but it takes some strength to do it so it may be a while.Otherwise, we've been very happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice seat","review":"I like that it has a back to it, and you can adjust the height as your child grows. It is lacking some padding on the seat, and for long trips we put a towel on it for more cushion.

Comfortable and Narrow for my car.","review":"I have been searching for a narrow booster seat that would fit in my Mercedes C350. The Graco booster was the narrowest I could find and it was still very, very tight. When I pulled out the Compass booster, it was very wide, but the back portion is narrow. It fits perfectly in my car with extra space for buckling! The kids also love them, they are good for napping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid seats","review":"I bought two of these in May 2009 for my kids, who were then 3 and 6. The seats fit perfectly in the second-row bucket seats in my van. I lifted the two plastic armrests up and let the car's armrests hold the seats securely in place. When empty, the seats do not move from left to right at all. The overall design is very solid, the back locks into position, and the seat cover never seems to get dirty. With the slightly curved sides, the seats are roomy and wide enough to seat a petite adult. My only concern is the seatbelt guides, which cause the seatbelts to come very close to my children's necks. I have recently purchased a pair of carseats from a different brand but still think these are of superior quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"very light, easy to fold and use","review":"This seat does what it's supposed to do: it's very light, folds up easily, and is extremely easy to carry. We bought it for traveling by air--not for use in the airplane (you can't use this seat on airplanes, or in any vehicle that does not have a shoulder belt in addition to the lap belt), but for the convenience of carrying the seat around through the airport with the rest of the luggage. We also use it as our regular booster seat for our 4-year-old when we're not traveling. It seems solid, it's comfortable without being too padded, and our son loves the fold-out cupholders and fold-up armrests.The only negative is that the shoulder belt routes under the headrest, which for our son (about 40 inches tall) means the shoulder belt has a tendency to ride up on his neck and bother him. We solved this with a standard seatbelt pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled","review":"I bought this car seat for my 4 year old son. He meets height/weight requirements for the seat. However, the seat slides around with him in it. I do NOT feel it's safe for him at this time. I just took it out of my car and re-installed his 5 point harness seat. He hates the old seat and is not happy, but I'd rather him be mad at me but safe! The booster is easy to use, using only the lap belt, but I feel I have sacrificed safety for ease of use. I reccomend keeping your child in their 5 point harness seat for as long as it is safe for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe: Seat belt lays across bottom of neck","review":"The seat belt lays too close to the neck. A safe booster seat should be set up in a way that the seat belt goes over the shoulder. I tried adjusting the headrest to see if the position of the belt would get better but it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, but crappy.","review":"I purchased this item so my daughter would have a car seat when we flew home to visit my folks. Amazon delevired, it was there when I needed it, no problem. However as for the seat itself, the design and shape is crappy. When the child falls asleep in the seat it is not designed to properly support them, also the way that the seat belt goes through this particular seat is badly planned and I belive it hurts the childs back during a drive of longer than say 20 minutes. The seat is rather inexpensive but even free it would not have been worth the price. I suggest that you find a different seat with a better support design than what is offered here."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS IT GREEN OR BLACK&RED??????

A glance at the rather slender bibliography indicates a strong religious bias; a more balanced view is required. There are the distortions typical of a single volume when complex events are condensed. The author would do well to consider Irish sources as Gaelic-speaking Scotland and Ireland were a single cultural entity for more than a millenium.

I'm part Filipina, so I was brought up to not be too concerned with SPF because I never burn, but now that I'm older and realize I should be taking care of my skin, its become a real concern for me. It goes on really smooth, just dab a few dots of it around your face and neck, then blend it in. The container is exactly the same as the L'Oreal makeup removers, so it will probably be an issue getting the product out when it gets low (also, you may have trouble controlling the amount that comes out), otherwise, I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"This product had a water texture and it is hands down one of the worst mositurizers I have ever come across.

This is okay but if you want to pick it up yourself in a store, you'll have a hard time finding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product horrible bottle design","review":"I would give this a five stars if it wasnt for the way the bottle is designed. The product itself is very light, moisturizing, and feels nice on the skin, which is all great. It doesnt smell and is a good value for the price. However, as nice as the bottle looks, it is difficult to handle. the bottle is so hard that you have to actually really press and put strength on it to squeeze the product out, even when it is full. as a result, you are usually left with more moisturizer than you need for your face, which is a waste.

This anime is only for people that have nothing to do but watch animated women. Anime like this, btw, insult women in general. No natural woman is built like that, but that's what most animes are. Just wanted to clarify that.The action scenes are very lame and even their pervy scenes are lame. Nothing great. This anime actually deserves a 2 or maybe 2.5 but I'm trying to balance the score out.

It offered a very satisfying pop cap and playable features, like massed firing by ranks(not availble in any RTS game, not even Cossacks) and Bayonet charges(which only Cossacks had also.) The game is more realistic with flagbearers and drummers. Officers are very powerful units in hand-to-hand fighting, and Cavalry are the only units that can defeat Unit formations of 196. All buildings are capable of shooting enemy units, except mines.

(For clearer truth in advertising, regarding the above title's use of \\"comic book,\\" there's no attempt at humor in the drawings, just informative, helpful illustrations.) The book's perspective is Muslim, thus respectful in treatment of Muhammad; Islam's history and contributions; it's authorities (Qur'an, Sunna, Hadith); and it's present discussion regarding the right path as regards socio-political identity. It is faithful to the Qur'an and Sunna and manifests the dominant Sunni perspective (80-85% of Islam), yet doesn't neglect mentioning minority sects, like Shi'a. Extremely basic, extremely clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better!","review":"Stella Dong's book on Shanghai, while interesting, is limited by Ms. Dong's mediocre and repetitive writing and sensationalist tone. Individual parts of the book can be very interesting, but are not organized into a well written and cohent whole. If your looking for a serious historical work with some good analysis this is not the book for you.On the other hand, it is a decent intoduction for someone planning to travel to Shanghai."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark, but has its positives","review":"I live in Shanghai part time and this book is interesting to me because I can walk around the city and imagine... but the book seems very biased and is more interested in sensationalizing the city then a true analysis of the wonder that is Shanghai. In a way I am saddened by her reflection because it runs down the same path as most 'Westernized' views of China; I realize that this sells books, but when will authors take the responsibilty of serious reflection about place and significance rather than feed the reader with exotic half-truths. Before I ramble more (my highscool grammar teacher will cry if she reads this), I would suggest that one decide what they want out of a this book before purchasing... If you want a decently engaging story - this is ok... If you want to know about Shanghai's 'essence' look elsewhere, Stella Dong misses the real story and the real city."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Muddy As the Whangpu","review":"Alas, despite the enticing title and initially engaging, gossipy style, this book bogs down in repetitive trivial details while failing to explore fasciniting topics to which it alludes (such as the international drug trade in the early 20th century and its links to Shanghai and to international arms trading after WWI). Little effort is made to identify individuals as they reappear in subsequent chapters or to present a coherent historical narrative. This is one of the very few books I have ever simply chosen to put down rather than finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I read this book while spending a few weeks in Shanghai recently, and it was torture to wade through Dong's turgid, overblown writing. What is most disappointing is that this could have been an absolutely fascinating book, but in Dong's inept hands, the history of Shanghai is rendered dull and academic. A truly dreadful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third rate nonsense.","review":"It's hard to say what is worse, Stella Dong's third rate prose or her weak grasp of Chinese history. Her explanation of the causes of the Opium war are nothing more than a condemnation of the West for exporting opium to China. Unfortunately she makes no mention of the fact that opium was also legal in Britain at the time, was legal in China at the time for medicinal purposes, and was actively traded and consumed by Chinese since roughly the 7th century AD. Not to mention the myriad non-opium related factors leading to the war such as anti-foreign riots and an insistence on foreign envoys prostrating themselves on the ground in front of the emperor. You should look into books by Jonathan Spence (who incidentally has an excellent writing style and is a Professor of History at Yale, unlike Dong, who is barely literate and posesses no noteworthy education) which also highlight the decadence of Chinese cities but on a much more sophisticated level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"I rarely encounter books that are so overblown it feels like running up-hill trying to get through them, but this book certainly made me feel this way. Stella Dong, I have come to discover, is a journalist and as such really loves to make inflated claims and quote people non-stop. Really I'm only reading this book right now because it's the only one I have to learn more about Shanghai. I use the term 'learn' very loosely and with a great deal of caution. Her writing is so sensationalist I have trouble trusting a lot of what she says. The search continues..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An offensive, inaccurate mass of hyperbolies","review":"Although her book was well researched, and the facts mostly accurate, Stella Dong takes the city and defaces it with far off statements and conclusions. Although I have no ties to Shanghai, the book jumped out as a complete farce on the history and the people -- comparing the city to an emperor's ugly daughter,with underlying implications of it being prostitute like is simply a ploy to sell books through a mystical perception of the east. Stella Dong is playing on the stereotypes of the Far East to sell a B-rated book. Stella, you should be ashamed of yourself for defacing such a city. Granted, Shanghai is not the most pristine or morally restrained city in the world, but there are several other cities with histories much more 'decadent' and morally corrupt.

When the package arrived (undamaged) I was shocked to open it and find that the mill was not wrapped in anything and was simply rolling around in the box. There are scratch marks around the top of the mill, a small round blemish, and scuff marks in several areas. It is in such bad shape, that it actually looks used...well used. Aside from having to return this product, the thing that disappoints me the most is that the box actually had the \\"air pillow\\" type packing in it. Pointless!!!

Alas, they think you've signed up for a Master's level course in electrical engineering.When you click the Help button in their software, it brings up boxes that say 'Paste the help text here.'

I for one disagree. This card has very short range. It is probably the driver but even after I upgraded the ROM and used the newest driver, I still only get about 15-20 feet of range. That's not even half of the size of my small townhouse. I know it is the card's problem because I had another Addtronics card that has significantly longer range (20-30 feet). I have the same setup but with the other card, I get longer range. The reason I say it could be the driver is that when I run Linux, it has longer range. The only problem when I run Linux is that the Linux driver only work with Ad-hoc mode not the Infrastructure mode with WEP enabled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with WinME","review":"This card will not work with WinME.

It doesn't get the advertised distances, but seems OK for my purposes (around a 50 foot radius from the router). Some people have said the netgear card is better, but I have had no problems. It is important to play around with the location of the router. A slightly different router spot will dramatically improve the range of the card.Overall, because of the range I'll have to give this 4 stars, but this is a very good product and works fine with Win 98."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! -- IF you have the right network","review":"I bought this item 6 months ago, along with a Linksys WAP11 wireless access point.

I have no complaints. The caveat is that Linksys doesn't provide much information about how to set up your network, so it may take some trial and error.

The protruding part of the card is the antenna, and it needs some clear space around it or it won't get any signal at all, i.e. the link light starts flashing if you bring a hand too close to it.

And I am only talking about a 20 foot hallway. The manufacturers / editors claim of 150 meters indoors is crazy. With only a few wood walls in the way, I am unable to get this thing to go more than 30 feet.If you will be using this card within the same room as your router, then you will be fine. Perhaps it is okay for going one floor up or down in a wood structure. But don't expect much more than that.According to Linksys, there is a new wpc11v25 (version 2.5) coming out soon.

My machine was the nearest to the router in the office - less than 2 metres -- and I regularly got link quality dropping below 50%!!!. Also there were occasional hangs. The other machines got worse.

However, the card has two critical faults: (1) the range is poor and (2) sometimes the card refuses to connect to the WAP.The second problem makes this card unusable in my opinion. The card either fails to find the WAP after booting or drops the connection mid-session and does not recover. I haven't found a solution to the problem, but I've seen several postings on the web about the same issue.I've had a great experience with other Linksys products (hubs, routers), but the WPC11 version 3.0 is junk.

It's strange, but it worked. I can now go outside with my laptop. In the house I can go anywhere, even in the basement where the access point was and get 86% or better.

As design, I plugged in and there it goes. I like the led on the little icon; it turns from green to yellow telling me the strength of the connection, and when I am far away. You will definitely have to stay away from 2.4 Ghz phone when you're using it far away from the access point.Great product I would recommend to anybody going wireless. The only tip i can advice to anyone going wireless is to stick with same manufacturing products in the beginning, from switch to card like I did, and then once everything works one can mix and match. The only negative side perhaps is the WEB encryption support. They claim they have it but I don't think is there yet, the switch doesn't have it yet so i couldn't confirm the encryption yet, Otherwise is a great!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance under XP using D-Link WAP","review":"I used this card under Windows 2000 accessing a D-LINK WAP. Installation, setup, configuration, and speed were excellent. I was averaging about 70-90% link quality and around 6Mbps transfer between PC's.

Performance has dropped to aroun 20-40% link quality and MAYBE 1Mbps data transfer. It's almost like being back to dial-up. The drivers released for XP .... I've tried reinstalling, using the config utility, not using the config utility, you name it. I have a small condo and I'm about 50 feet from the WAP as the crow flies.

My order came in great shape, quickly, and was exactly what I ordered. The book itself is a challenge to read as it is written in 1898 English verbage, long sentences and round about. The subject is fascinating though! The author has a way of twisting events in a wry sort of humor even simple things like running away from a charging lion. I am unimpressed with the unnecessary killing of animals for sport he reports about, but at the time that is what they did. I am hoping as they get further into Africa that they will stop doing that except for food. I attended a book reading by another author recently about this book so I sort of know how the story goes.

His magnifacent violin concerto is one of the most beautiful and expressive ever written, from the poignant sophistication of the first movement, to the moody Romanticism of the ravishingly gorgeous slow movement, right to the end of the percussive barn-burner of a finale.His ballet 'Souveneirs' is a comical satire on the era of silent movies and is a collection of popular dances, such as a waltz, tango, pas de deux, two step, etc. It is an attractively easy-going, somewhat jazzy work that just about anyone would like.The piano concerto is a very modernistic work, but Barber still doesn't stray to far from his romantic voice. Except in the ethereal middle movement, we are confronted with a restless violence that gives an unprepared listener little breathing room, but it is nonetheless a wholly accessible work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Surrender To Lukewarm R&B","review":"This CD has three decent songs on it and that's pretty much all it has. Kut Klose didn't have a distinctive sound, so I knew that there wouldn't be a follow-up album.

Yes they had a hit single \\"I Like\\" but the bad thing about it is that the song itself is very typical cookie cutter music and doesnt hold up as being remembered. I think Keith Sweat produced their album and most of the material here sound like his leftovers he gave to them. This group is nothing special vocally or lyrically. They have absolutely nothing to fall back on besides Keith Sweat who produced a bunch of average songs for them talking about the samething. There were so many 1 hit wonders around this time.

I originally purchased this book for the illustrations, as I am interested in art, but found, as an adult, the story to be very interesting and enjoyable. I would recommend this book to others who are interested in art, as well as anyone who does not have any insight into traditional Indian children's stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as Usual","review":"There seems to be no such thing as a less than fine Al Stewart album. The bonus track on this one is a real gem, \\"Helen and Cassandra\\", in which Stewart rivals Homer in retelling Greek mythology.PS: though I ordered a \\"new\\" CD, I received a \\"used\\" one (no problem with its condition)."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun instrument, horrible product","review":"got this in today, very fast shipping.. amazon has always been awesome. yeah its 7 dollars (or 8 whatever) but if you seriously want to learn this instrument pass the sweet potato up. in essence its two pieces of plastic molded together, mine had a few holes in the trim allowing this ocarina to sound like a dog dying. i will purchase the clay ocarina because i want to learn on something that sounds good, seriously the one i got, the 3 & 4 holes have no pitch difference. if a kid wants this they would probably be happy, again if your serious about learning pass the sweet potato up. the packaging looked like it had been in a dust warehouse for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy Ocariina","review":"The product is really just a toy, but it's priced appropriately so I have no complaints. Someone looking for a real musical instrument should expect to pay much more, and look for a wooden or ceramic version."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is blowing air","review":"Mine was blue not red and I did a double take when I examined it. It looks like 2 halves of the ocarina were hastily sonic welded together leaving a jagged seam full of air gaps. It leaked so much air it was difficult to produce any tones and it was inconsistent. Blowing into a coke bottle was more enjoyable, louder, and more musical than using this ocarina. Get one made of clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOY--don't expect much","review":"If you're looking for a windy sound (as opposed to crisp) with subtle pitch changes (instead of full) then this would be okay for you. It's cheap. It won't shatter if you drop it.Common sense says it's not going to sound good (at all), and it doesn't, but you CAN slightly make some tunes.A child's gift would be good if you have the rationale of, \\"I don't want to get little Johnny/Suzy something really expensive if s/he's only going to use it once... I'll go with a cheap one and see if s/he wants to stick with it before I upgrade to better quality.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"buy it, and evolve.","review":"It is a little known fact that Beethoven (and many of his peers) actually wrote the majority of their work specifically for this instrument. Tragically, the corrupt governments of the time viewed this behaviour as subversive insanity and ordered an extensive rewrite for the more socially acceptable 'orchestra'.This was a massive blow to our civilization, resulting in the modern world's shamefull ignorance of this majestic tool of art. I find it difficult to contain my outrage when some ill-educated neanderthal asks questions such as:\\"why sweet potato?\\"\\"diatonic ocarina, is'nt that a tool used in colonic irrigation?\\"\\"who's grover and why would I care?\\"The mind boggles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like real romance...","review":"Saves The Day's first real album is super heartfelt and well worth the money. Not as flashy or put together as more recent one's but all the feeling is there. The lyrics are definitely the best part, but listen close as this album is a little harder than the new ones. A must have for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saves the Day took music to the next level !!","review":"When they came through VA with Fastbreak & Farside they completely stole the show.

I constantly find myself driving down the highway chanting these anthems every time I'm in my car.From a very early age, lead singer Chris Conley has proven himself to be a wickedly talented songwriter, performer, guitarist, and lyricist. This album provides so many honest introspectives encapsulating raw, teenage emotion that (for me) still holds relevance today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy Boston Punk","review":"I was amazed when I heard Saves the Day. The guitar is heavier than traditional punk, and the vocals less nasal. They lyrics are great, and the songs don't get old....BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music and bad taste","review":"If you are one of the seething masses that have tribal tatoos and like your tatoos you like your music to mean nothing then i would not suggest this band for you. Not only do they capture the feelings of exilaration and dispaiur that acompany the trial that is growing up, they are very musically talented. An aexample of this would be there fast riffs that are suprisingly quick, yet are not jarring."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best band ever!","review":"Saves the Day is hte best band ever!

I really did. I enjoy emo music, but this just didn't do it for me. The Choke and Three Miles Down are both very good tracks, but beyond that, there's not much here. All of the rest of the songs sound about the same, and there's nothing that stands out about them. There are much better selections within this style of music. I would suggest The Get Up Kids' \\"Something to Write Home About\\". That is a much better investment that \\"Can't Slow Down\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":".......","review":"I heard their \\"At your funeral\\" single and I was impressed. I figured I would check out their older stuff. Stay away from this record. It's a rehashed, boring, 3-chord, NOFX, Blink182, YAWNFEST. This is like Blink182 but with no catchy hooks (i.e. NOFX). If you like boring 3-chord songs where the singer sings the exactly melody of the guitar then this record is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"If you're like me and you were stupid enough to buy this cd after hearing stay what you are you will be sadly mistaken. These two cds are completely opposite cd's. All of the songs on cant slow down sound the same and the songs are short, but not sweet.

Chris's vulnerable at times vocals and amazing lyrics can invade a person's head. It's impossibe to get sick of this cd. It's definately alot different then their second full lenght,it's alot heavier and doesn't feature the catchy hooks,that's alright it doesn't lack in any way.The band puts on an amazing live show and it's awe-inspiring to see how copassionately the kids in the crowd sing along. This band has changed my life,honestly,no joke at all. I'm Sorry I'm Leaving is a great folow up.

Fritz tells us why he broke with the third Reich and fled Nazi Germany. Although he doesn't give much if any detail about the amounts of his donations or really any information concerning them. He mainly just tells why he became disinfranchised and finally decided to flee."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Healing Powers of Art and Love","review":"A classic story of suffering and redemption, Sins and Needles offers a clear look at the tragedies of drug abuse and prision, and also gives a message of hope. The writing is direct and straightforward, driving the plot in a way that kept me turning the pages. In addition to a very moving story, many of the events are illustrated with the author's beautiful artwork to drive home the message. And the book has a great ending. I devoured the book in a day, and my wife did, too after I gave it to her. Bittersweet, uplifting, hopeful, and completely real. It will convince you that art and love can heal."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Artistic Genius Revealed","review":"Ray Materson was born with the gift of being an artist- a person highly sensitive to pain and to pleasure who could convey these feelings to others. Even when locked up in a jail cell, with nothing to work with, he created his own materials- ironically one of them being a needle (a paraphernalia of the drug trade) and sock threads to create incredible stunning detailed works of depth and beauty of a definite style, snapshots of memory overflowing with feeling. Fortunately an appreciator, who was to become his soulmate and wife, came along and tells his life story with its suffering and its pleasures.The glossy pages show the embroideries at their very best. This book is a MUST read for all interested in art as a whole, particularly in embroidery, \\"Outsider Art\\", \\"Raw Art\\", in teaching, and in realizing how important artistic expression is and how important it is to be there for others as an Appreciator."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one should be filed under \\"fiction\\" instead of bios","review":"This book is written by a \\"former\\" criminal, substance abuser, wife-beater, and dead-beat Dad, who claims that somehow through prison and his art, he supposedly reached some type of \\"spiritual healing\\", and is now a wonderful person. If you're looking for a bad guy redemption fairy tale, and aren't particular about whether it's well-written OR the fact that there is obviously so much more to the story that is not being told, you may enjoy this book. Otherwise, don't bother. This book is booooring, and totally unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Things","review":"\\"Sins and Needles\\" is a little book with a little story embellished with little pictures of Ray Materson's stichery. Although it's not big news that someone turns their life around and does a good thing, it's good to know it still happens. Perhaps it should have been called a journal of a man's prison experience because it is more like a journal when reading it. Surprising are the positive reviews because it's not all that amazing, not the writing, the art or the story. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Fiction","review":"My good sense tells me that writing this book made the Matersons feel better about themselves. My mind tells me to thank God I never went the way of abuse or criminal activity. My experience tells me we all have a life story to tell. Reading this book showed me most of us do not tell our story to make money or a movie. If the Matersons want money and fame here's some advice: try fiction or learn how to write without being so self-serving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"The book and the art pictured in the book are overpriced. It's a good thing the Matersons can sell this art because their first attempt at book writing is disappointing. The moral of this story is that while it's good to save oneself from being a criminal others are just not that interested. I suppose the poor sales of the book are due to the fact that either a bad reputation will come back to haunt you or your karma will. Now, that's a high price to pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!

Add it to the late-night, fireplace selections... (or summer grooves)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Elixer to Soothe Your Ancient Soul","review":"The music is soft and layered, the rhythms are mid-tempo to downbeat. This album sounds pastel - like a watercolor masterpeice painted with sound. This is not the thundering electronica of the Rave. Instead, it is more like a sunny day on a lonely beach, where life moves on at a more natural pace. The music compiled by Jose Padilla on this album represents the best that Ambient/Trip-Hop/Electronica has to offer. Melodic, entrancing and trippy. This collection is an absolute must if you are at all into this kind of music. If you aren't into this kind of music, you will be. This is my first Cafe Del Mar CD and it has inspired me to buy more. Heck, I'll probably get them all"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my absolute favourites","review":"Whereas the entire series of Caf�� del Mar CDs is very good, volume 5 is by far the best of all. Its soft tunes will transform anywhere you listen to it in a perfect chill out (even if you're hearing it on your diskman in the bus to work). Some of the songs are amazing (like Negresses Vertes' \\"Face a la mer\\"). If you can't manage to make it to a health spa, buy this record!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Preventing heel injuries with ProStretch","review":"I'm a 61-year old semi-competitive runner who usually forgets to stretch AFTER a brisk run. My physical therapist recommended ProStretch to prevent plantar fasciitis. I tried one and it really helps relieve my heel pains.I don't run 5k as fast as I did 25 years ago, but my times are improving again. Few 60+ runners show up so I usually compete with the 50-59 age group. ProStretch is helping fight the effects of aging. My best races may still be ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stretching equipment for reasonable price","review":"I used one of these Pro-stretch bi-lateral devices at my physical therapy location. It was a great way to stretch before and after using other equipment. However, I was able to hold onto a rail when mounting/dismounting. So - just a word of caution - before purchasing this for home use, make sure you have a rail, bar... something sturdy to hold onto while using and mounting/dismounting. I do not have anything like this is my apartment and have had to place my hands on a wall while using, and I am VERY careful when mounting/dismounting. The actual device is very good and reasonably priced!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Stretch Yet!","review":"I am an avid runner and it can be tough to get a good pre-work out stretch in and very difficult to get the leg muscles relaxed afterwards. I love the Pro-Stretch because it works so many muscles and I don't have to do much! I use it prior to running (an average of 6 miles) to loosen the calves and hamstrings. It really helps my legs to warm up faster. I use it after running to really deeply stretch my calves. Its the best feeling! I have struggled with being able to get a good quality stretch in and this product makes it very achievable!I just went out of town and brought it with me - that's how important it is to me and my running. I will not go without it...I use it so much my kids are trying to use it!Best Stretching Product I have used in a long time!

I can stretch just as well against a wall or using a conventional calf stretch. If anything, I feel that, with this, there is an increased risk of OVERSTRETCHING the ligaments in the ankle.I gave it two stars because it did stretch. I deducted three stars because it is overly expensive for what it is. It gives you a uni-lateral stretch -- just another fancy way of saying stretches your calf in ONE direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great relief for Plantar Fasciitis","review":"This was recommended by my physical therapist for plantar fasciitis pain relief. Been using it for a month, 3+ times a day, 3 reps of 30 sec stretch, 5 sec relax. And I am starting to feel the difference. Not completely cured yet, but finally I feel like it's going in the right direction.

My conclusion is that the pins are either too stiff or too long. I have no idea why no other reviewer encountered this problem.

Further, the cards are read 'right side up' unlike my desk top computer's face plate reader which has ruined several of my CF cards.

So I found that I was in need of a multi-card reader and this one looked like the best.This reader is simple and ready to use out of the box.

It plays well, and the amp is great for distortion, etc. although the cable, strap, pics, and strings are basically worthless. The pickups combined with the high gain on the amp make for great sounding power chords. although it is a bit hard to make this guitar sound good without it being uber distorted the cable gave out in about 1 week, the pics are really thick and not too good for strumming, and the strap broke easily. When you get this guitar, you may want to put some Ernie Ball strings on before you play it, or you will be breaking them easy. This is Strictly for a beginner though, so if you buy it, plan on replacing it in a year or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Customer Service -Item never delivered !!!","review":"It seems that I will never be able to find out if the product is good or bad.They kept on sending the order to wrong addresses and then kept on asking me to re order it again and again.They keep on sending automated messages, and there is no one to handle real problems.I would not recommend dealing with this vendor again.Stick to items that are in Amazon.com stock and keep away from other vendors.

I find the book's organization to be very intuitive. Each section (patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc.) has alphabetical definitions of the related terms. There are even examples of official correspondence.Although my main goal was to learn more about trademarks, I have learned a lot more about patent terms by reading the book. This book finally helped me understand continuations and divisionals.My only complaint is that the book tends to focus on U.S. filings and doesn't include a lot of foreign information. I know this would probably make the book longer, heavier, and more dense -- but I tend to have more foreign maintenance fee questions come up in my day-to-day job.Still, I'm very happy with the book and find it very useful and well-written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing the point...","review":"With all due respect to my fellow reviewers, I think at least some are missing the point; we can argue ad nauseum whether Brahms symphonies are better played with full or chamber orchestra...I say enjoy both, appreciate MacKerras's interpretations...besides, I think Brahms is sitting up there somewhere enjoying all this."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD BUT ....UNLESS YOUR FRO LOS ANGELES! 111","review":"Man I've been too a gang of concerts and car shows throughout the West, and like many other people I hate that trick Noreaga for disrespecting my home TOWN L.A. so no RESPECT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS A GOOD CD BUT..........................Ws?T Up, No Love","review":"Sorry dog, but I'M TRU too my set and my sid'.ANY CD WITH NOREAGA ON IT AUTOMATICALLY GETS NO RESPECT.......I'M A FAN THAT REMEMBERS L.A.

Interestingly, 5 of the songs are duplicated on Trio II, a collaboration with Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton. I didn't even realize it until someone pointed this out. I would get the Trio II album instead, as the versions there seem much better and include the additional voices that add richness.

The cable on my Canon 430 EX II flash has the cable sticking out on the shutter release side instead of the opposite side. It gets in the way and is cumbersome to maneuver when you are shooting fast paced sports.

Unfortunately, most of them don't live up to their reps. The new APC is quite good, but it's mired in such mediocrity that it cannot lift the album to even a two-star rating. I paid US$10 for this and it was about nine bucks too much.I suppose hardcore NIN fans might enjoy this album since Lohner had so much to do with it (he wrote, remixed and/or performed in many of the tracks, and he also produced the whole shebang). Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformed","review":"This gets a 2 because of APC and Dillinger Escape Plan.

I decided to give it a go again and suddenly remembered how I pretty much listened to it throughout all of '05, which was a pretty awesome year for me. Though it's a great soundtrack for the movie, it's also a great one for me personally. I mostly like the quieter songs like \\"Bring Me the Disco King\\" and \\"Rocket Collecting,\\" but overall it's fantastically atmospheric. I doubt any amount of personalizing will convince anyone else to give it a go, but I'm glad I did years ago.

There are times when you can almost see parts of the movie that fit with the songs! I highly recommend it to anyone who likes either today's music or the movie - or both. I would have given it 5 stars but for one thing I think could have been fixed - the songs weren't in the greatest order, particularly between songs 10 and 11 in which you suddenly go from a relatively quiet song to one that's very loud with lots of yelling - I think the transtition could have been better.

Although I think this is one of the best cd's, I would only recommend it to true Tool, and metal fans.

I just had to give up on them because I couldn't understand what they were saying and they couldn't understand me either.My advice- DO NOT UPGRADE!!! 2004 is still the best version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have never upgraded from 2000","review":"Every upgrade has been disappointment. The best version was 2000. I have spent thousands in IT support to \\"try\\" to get ACT to function properly. I got it to work on my new server until I tried to create a remote database for one of our laptops. That corrupted the whole installation. After un-installing ACT, we where unable to re-install it. The only work around after hours of research is to re-format our server which means hours.....That's it! After 10 years of using ACT I will change to something else!!I have written may e-mails to communicate my many frustrations over the years. It is all in vein. All I have ever gotten was an automated response. They do not care about the users, only about how to promote the sales of newer inferior versions.

I had to get a new CPU for one system for the Act 2007 to work on it. Then another system crashed and I had to buy a new one. This one has to have Vista on it because that's what they all come with now. So I get Act installed on the new Vista operating system and find out it doesn't work on Vista, so now, after 1 year of use, I have to upgrade to 2008 for the new system which won't sync with the other computers anymore...I don't understand why they pushed so hard for everyone to buy a system that won't work on any new computer and why they just can't do a fix for 2007! What a rip off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For the love of God, RUN!","review":"I run support for a company with 5 Act users. Since the upgrade to 2006, and subsequently 2007, I've come to the following conclusion. Act 2000 was decent enough -- it was at least kind enough not to trash your system just to run it. These latest versions are an assault on all that makes sense in software design. The formats are bloated, the program consumes resources like a fleet of Hummers, leaving the polluted, twitching remains of your hardware behind. If you value your sanity, or the speed at which you can accomplish anything on your computer, take it from a humble IT guy -- Do yourself a favor and find something else.We're not running this on slouch hardware either -- Core 2 Duo 1.8 Ghz, 2 GB Ram on Vista is reduced to a quivering mass of silicon. 3 GHZ desktop P4's with 1-2 GB RAM are reduced to doddering idiots.Please -- find something else, for your own sake.

It used to be by Symantec, then Best Software, now Sage! Sage tends to make very user unfriendly software and is unintuitive. You are almost forced to purchase a service plan with them because of their complicated software & bugs. This new version of ACT is no different! I waisted about 3 hours trying to install and get this program to work properly before giving up and going back to ACT! 2005 by Best Software which installed and worked fine in a matter of about 10 minutes. So unless your planning on waisting lots of time with this version by Sage & spending hours on the phone with Tech Support, then I would recommend purchasing an older version that is NOT released by Sage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't! buy!

Got fooled into buying 9.0 by their notice that it would not be supported.I've spent the last 2 days trying unsuccessfully to get back to where I was. Fortunatly, my old version and data are intact.Main complaint is that it is SLOW, and search function is unpredictable. (Search funcions are key to the way I use this in my biz). For example, in 6.0 I can keyword-search all contact fields with any number of digits to find a phone # . . . it will search 4000 records in about 1-2 seconds. With 9.0, it requires hyphens between AC, prefix and last 4. If you search on last 4, match is found, but last 5 will not find a match with or without hyphen. Last 6 thru 10 OK, so long as hyphens present. Very arbitrary. Plus search time is close to 10 seconds.Big step backwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined A Good Product","review":"Stay away from this software.

However, I also found (after 3 tech support calls) that if you want to use Act! for Palm, you need to upgrade to the new version if you want it to work with your other software. I reluctantly upgraded as I wanted these systems to work. After two days on the phone with Tech support it was determined that my machine would not install the program (even though the system was less than a year old and met all of the system requirements). It was suggested that I go and purchase a new machine. Unfortunately, now I will need to restore the older version! I wonder how long it will take to get that one working again!

I should have expected that they wouldn't be a safe material to have in the house as they are made in China, but sometimes you just can't avoid it.

I especially found the section on goldfish varieties helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible that such a good anime gets this packaging.","review":"I have all of the previous seasons of Galaxy Angel and enjoyed them. When I purchased this one I sadly did not pay attention to the running time.It has one 30 minute episode. For the current Amazon price 17.99 this is way overpriced.The episode itself is very good but sadly the company making this decided to cash in on the fans. I will wait for a season box set to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny, Undubbed, Unlikable","review":"Basically this is a new Galaxy Angel cast, with unlikable characters, unlikable stories, and pretty much everything that was good about Galaxy Angel before this series gone.I wonder what these people were thinking before they made Rune, the previous cast had lots of life left in them, they didn't need replacing.Anyway on to the facts- DVD contains 1 episode- Japanese audio audio, with Eng subs- No English dub- Is worthlessAnd lastly, Bandai Visual USA who had the license to this went out of business so really, you'd be buying this with no company to support except maybe Amazon or the seller who gets the money from you.Avoid this show if you love the previous Galaxy Angel shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"keith sweat is the BEST","review":"i love to listen to keith sweat he is just awesome. he reminds me of all the good times i have had while listening to his songs. yes, i just love keith sweat!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin This","review":"I'm lovin this CD!! It offers some really smooth tracks. 'Twisted', 'Just A Touch', and 'Nobody' are some of the best. I would reommend this CD!! PEACE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gonna Make You SWEAT, Babyy","review":"This is one of the best hip-hop flava'd soul albums to CHILL DOWN at nite. Also Keith Sweat's best album so far ( I don' t like his other albums as much as i do this one ).Simple, good, old-fashioned, horsesensed, musical stucture plus foreplay-oriented lyrics, sweet, beautiful melodies and Sweat' s laid-back, low- pitched trademark vocals are what this cool album is all about.Satisfaction guaranteed by two hit singles: Twisted & Nobody which are great choices for chilldown in the still of the nite. Also plain yet sweet and beautiful is the sounds of keyboard in the album.( To cut a long story short ) This album is the true gem and real charm of American black music.....Shin Handsome P. ( Michael )"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!","review":"This album is a collection of great songs by Keith Sweat. This CD is really good to play when your girlfriend/boyfriend is over for a night with just the two of you."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],x={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const L=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-0e840c15"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/7.md","filePath":"library/7.md"}'),P={name:"library/7.md"},j=Object.assign(P,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{H as __pageData,j as default};
