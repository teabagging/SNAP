In this, his second \\"coroner\\" book he assumes a consultant viewpoint of some famous and mysterious, unresolved deaths. Some of the more interesting ones are Elvis, the family members of Jeffrey McDonald, and even Jack the Ripper.

The first half of this one is interesting in depicting academy life. The bizarre gay references come out of 'left' field and don't belong. Furthermore I finally gave up a little past halfway because it completely dissolves itself into 'trannie' culture in New York and is just too unbelieveably stupid to have kept my interest.

His angst at his status as hero reminds me of my Silver Star winner relative. Thought it was just luck and never understood why people would do anything different or think it was special. Seafort is developed as a real warrior not a \\"John Wayne\\" stereotype. His problem of how to treat cadets is a classic problem. Like the Honor series of Weber it based on a 19th century version of Navy regs moved into space. The most difficult to believe aspect was that corporal punishment would still be in use in space.

The author's thorough knowledge of her subject shows through, but she needs to work on her teaching technique. I always felt like I had to read three pages for what could have been summed up and made less confusing in one page. I also think that the index left much to be desired -- most text books end up being used for reference, and what good is a reference with a lousy index? It was like having a jigsaw puzzle with many nice pieces, but no big picture to guide you in putting it all together. I'm planning on buying a VB book of my own choice this time -- if you have a choice I'd suggest the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Programming With Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0","review":"I'm using the book as a text in a college class, and while the content is good, one can follow it coherently only if one also obsessively tends to watch such things at MTV. The book is exceedingly fragmented, and I've found it very obnoxious to be reading a tutorial and all of a sudden hit two pages of examples before you can get back to the text. I don't enjoy studying that way. If someone else can then, by all means. I am not finding it to be a pleasant experience, however. The layout could have been a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"For absolute beginners only !","review":"As an intermediate programmer, i was very disappointed with the book. It covered only issues relevant for beginners and used approach suited for beginners (i.e. very detailed). The title should have been like introduction, for beginners, etc. to prevent us more advanced from buying the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended for beginners...","review":"This is a \\"from the ground up book\\" that introduces the extreme basics and takes you step by step through the lessons to the point where you can be writing simple programs within a few days or hours depending on how much time you spend at it. The review is missing a star because I was getting some what bored because it is so specific on so many things in the first half, but got better towards the end. The lessons force you to actually write the code and test and debug programs that accompany the book. You go to www.course.com and enter the ISBN number and download the student files. -The authors' approach to writing this book is unmatched. I also recommend \\"An Inroduction To Programming With C++\\" by the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great place to start learning VB","review":"Sure the book doesn't appeal to some, but that is always true. Diane Zak knows her topic and it shows throughout the book. Yes it does repeat quite a bit, but isn't that exactly how we learn, by repeatedly doing a task. If you want to learn VB6, this is a very good place to start. The book is used as a text in my district's community college, that is why I chose it in the first place. I have not been disappointed. I have been programming in other languages for years and I am generally self-taught. This book allows me to continue in that direction. But, hey, if you get a chance recommend it to your community college, I would!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever written on the subject of Visual Basic!","review":"This book is the worst book ever written on the subject of Visual Basic. It is very verbose and confusing to the students. A better choice would be,Visual Basic6, by Shelly & Cashman."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money","review":"Giving this book 1 star is generous. At best, it deserves 0 stars.The only circumstances under which you should buy this book is if it is the required text for a class.The fundamental problem is that this book is WAY too long (800+ pages) and at the end, it still hasn't gotten that far into VB. Why? Because every concept takes PAGES to explain.For the student, this may be useful - once! Then it makes it extremely difficult to use the book for reference, such as when needing a refresher later on for a topic introduced earlier (such as when going through the end of chapter exercises).If this book were less than 1/2 as long, it might be better. Might be.Also, I found the graphics style and general layout of the book annoying.Do I have a better recommendation? No.But unless you need to have your hand held each and every little step of the way, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bargain Price for a Good Sleeping Bag","review":"The Coleman Oversized Sleeping Bag is big, warm and comfortable.

He looks at various types of crime, the construction of gender, and in particular hegemonic masculinity.The chapters which I found to be most interesting were: 'Rethinking Feminist Theory' and 'The State and Gender Politics'.

I don't know how these actors find their way into a DVD when there are so many talented souls unemployed."},{"rating":"1","title":"HaHa I can't believe this got released...","review":"This is probably the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of scanning through. The performances are terrible and the scenes with actual firefighting are stock footage, (they cut from the porn-worthy acting to wide shots of actual firefighting and then back).

Each story is filled with real life stories about people that face the same problems as us teenagers. When reading this book, you realize that you are not the only one with problems. The story entitled \\"LOOSSING THE US,\\" I especially liked because it dealt with getting over the pain of loosing a loved one. This book is not only for teenagers. It contains many life long lessons that benefit everybody. Eor example, \\"A LONG WALK HOME,\\" deals with the issue of lieing and guilt. My mother also read this book and enjoyed it very much.

I thought it sounded really good, so I borrowed her book. I was reading it and I already started to like it! I couldn't put it down! This was the first book I ever read that actually made my feelings mixed! At some times I was laughing, crying, and smileing. I really liked the poem about someones best friend moving, and how hard and painful it was for the person to be leaving. I actually understood, and knew what the person was going through, because one of my best friends Erika moved a way. This book made me understand what eveyone goes through in life.

For me this book took me 3 days to read. My mom has realized a change in my attitude towards life since I began reading this book. It made me realize how good in life I have it and how much worse I could have it. I realized that life is more important than anything you can buy. I introduced this book to a friend who is going through hard times right now and this book has made her feel much better.

Everyone of my friends has gotten the book and they all love it too. All teenagers think that no one knows what they are going throught but the truth is that almost everyone has had simular experiences. Reading this book helped me to see that.

The book is also about teen love, friendship, sad poems and also some stories. The book helps other teenagers realize that they're not the only ones who go through rough times. It also tells teenagers to not take life for granted, and that there is only one life to live. I really enjoy reading Chicken Soup for the soul! It's like I can relate my life to most of the stories in this book. So far I've only read this one and two others, like Chicken soup for the teenage soul 2, but it is really good. One of my favorite stories is the Graduation Speech it really touched me because they're people out there who kill themselves because of lack of friendship. This story was very emotional it really did touch me."},{"rating":"2","title":"All teenagers shuold read this book for you soul.","review":"This was a great book and I think that you should read it.

In direct comparison to Dr. Scholl's moleskin- it's noticeably thinner when feeling between my fingers. Good adhesive - on par with Dr. Scholls. Not to be confused with thicker products like molefoam (also Dr. Scholl's) which is much thicker. Agree with other posts that for the money, could easily double it up, be thicker than moleskin and still save money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Petaling","review":"I got this to use for petaling around my daughter's body cast, it works great.

Just cut a couple of inches, peel and place it on your skin. Much more reasonable than the stores. Will stick thru a shower and lasts for a day of hard walking. Would really like it a little thicker, but still a great value. Will definitely reorder.UPDATE: I liked this so much, I ordered the 75 foot roll. It is thick enough, and does the job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the the hero and in the baby angle","review":"I'm not a prude, but I expect that when I read about a man who is trying to decide whether or not to take his final vows to be a priest that he will struggle at least a little with giving in to his sexual desires out of wedlock. The hero, Brendan, doesn't seem to give it a thought when he makes out with the Dani, the heroine. I felt like the story was just pieced together without much developement of the issues that the characters were supposedly struggling with. I also thought there would be a bit more about the relationship of the couple with the baby, the offspring of Brendan's unwed niece, but the baby seemed to be secondary to things, and ends up getting adopted by strangers at the end of the book. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeper of the Harvest","review":"Deals with hard decisions well, such as \\"Is God calling me to the mission field?\\" Book was instrumental in a difficult time, very inspirational.

But, I don't have to tell you that, as a fighting game pad, the standard Sega pad reeks. Therefore, we must obtain proper equipment elsewhere. Enter Agetec's arcade stick. Simply put, buying this joystick has increased my enjoyment of SNK's KOF Dream Match'99 exponentially. Now, if I screw up Kim Kaphwan's Phoenix Flail, it's MY fault. No more blaming the stick, time to blame my apparently elderly reflexes. So, if you wish to ever properly experience one of the DC's many quality fighting game titles, you owe it to yourself to obtain this arcade stick. It is top-notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a stick for Fighting Games","review":"People complaining about how this stick doesn't work with Sonic Adventure or Crazy Taxi are missing the point.

The box says this explicitly, why would you try to play NFL2K with it? Your wishful thinking of trying to manipulate the stick into other games is far beyond me. THIS joystick is awesome.

Let's all pay (...) so that someone can tell us to ask for something when we want it.

Not accurate advice","review":"...Very unrealistic. I tried his advice and just got laughs. We travel a lot and have learned that there is only one world in travel; you get what you pay for (or use legal upgrades).

Unfortunately, there is no content to focus on. Be nice to people, ask for upgrades, frequent the same airline, hotel chain, etc? How many miles did the author have to fly to figure that one out? It took me about 2 trips to realize the benefit of loyalty. What exactly do they teach at Pepperdine?I only wish Amazon would have some way to verify where the reviews are coming from. I am confident that the only thing left would be 1 star comments. Most of the positive reviews look quite similar, even where there are writing errors.The good news is, publishers must be desperate, so if you want to write a book on pretty much anything, I am confident you will get published.

It will be 2 pages long, then repeat itself for 148 more pages..."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are more practical ways","review":"I agree with most comments, it is disappointing and a let down from the expectations I had about this book.

As my fellow reviewers have pointed out, there are only a few pointers the author keeps stressing: be loyal to a few companies and try to get people to give you free upgrades. Frankly, though the author claims that everyone can practise what he proposes, if you don't fly often enough, no airline employee is going to hand you free stuff. Plus, I find it hard to believe that you can request upgrades all the time. If everyone does that, who is going to pay for first class? You have to have a thick skin to do this all the time. I think the airlines/hotels might even have a remark under your name: 'ask for requests all the time, better give him or he'll call someone else'. People are probably providing you good service for all the wrong reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been said in 2 pages!","review":"what a waste of time and money reading this book. basically the book says that you should be flexible, travel contrary to the heavy seasons, be loyal to your airlines and hotels, be vocal but polite in your requests for upgrades and that is that. reasonable advice BUT A BOOK IT IS NOT. these items are essentially repeated over and over and over in order to reach critical book mass.you now know everything you will learn from this book so don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fourth class information","review":"This book has TWO sentences of helpful information. Stick to your brands and be polite. Hey, is that just one? Obvious and counter- productive advice like, it's easier to get a first class upgrade when you take a red eye flight, does not qualify for either luxury advice or travel. The only luxury in this book is the 242 pages used to say one useful sentence. It is regretable that such a dependable and interesting series as Traveler's Tales would publish such a useless book. I find the 5 star reviews also suspect. Not one reviewer mentions some new concrete advice that helps them now enjoy luxury travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it 0 stars I would","review":"Save your time & money and stay away from this book. If you really want to know what is in it here goes1. Be nice2. Be loyal3. Ask for upgrades (yeah right)Gimme a break. This book is full of useless information that may be pertinent for the traveler in like the 1960's. Speaking of the 60's, this book was published in 1999, I had to consider that before buying, but even in 1999, a rate for Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons was more than $125 a night (as the author states). I believe that the positive reviews are friends of the author himself. He should be ashamed. What a waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to waste money before you travel.","review":"This has to qualify as one of the worst books ever written. The author wants to tell us all how successful he has been in charming travel industry employees into giving him upgrades while endlessly repeating the same stale phrases over and over and over.

Of course they're nice to someone who's flown 3 Million miles with them. What about the rest of us? Further, the author shamelessly shills for all the major airlines and outright bashes Southwest and other discounters. His plugs for Delta should win him free tickets for life.Save your money.

Heavy on the Global Warming philosophy.","review":"So incredibly sorry that I spent the money for this series. It is filled with nonsense and propaganda about Global Warming. The persistent hits about Global Warming were present in every story line.

It is exactly as I remember, tho' the eyes that behold it have changed.As for the product itself, there are 3 dolls, one large (approx. 21\\"), one small (6\\"),and one medium (aprox. 10 1/2\\"). The clothes, as been stated in another review, are casual, everyday clothes of a 1930s child. Honestly, these outfits don't look to my eyes any more extravagant than anything I've seen pictured in Sears catalogues of the same period.

As delivered, the external body was in like new condition with case. Most importantly, the drill made fast work of a number of 1/2 holes to a depth of 9 to 10 inches in concrete. I found it was best to use only moderate pressure to get the fastest drilling rate in the concrete - you can see the drill make visible progress into the hole. The drill gear box does get quite warm after 3 to 4 holes, so I let it cool down between sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demo Hammer","review":"Bought it reconditioned for about a 40% discount. This is good for use as hammer drill and light demo work only(tile removal pushes it to the edge) Not the right tool for hammering into slab concrete however. Tool stopped hammering on 3rd use.

They brag that Rick Hill is back because he is the original Deathstalker yet when you watch it you realise that its a way to save money buy littering the whole movie with clips from part 1 and a few from part 3. Some people like the firts movie best, some the 2nd and some the 3rd but nobody the 4th. I will say this however. Finaly the picture that Boris Vallejo drew for the movie is a seen in the movie(with the exception that Rick Hill has blonde hair). But if your a fan and you have to see it whynot. Okay I admit it is nice to see the original (almost evil himself) Deathstalker return to kill more wizards.

While Hill is looking remarkably fit for a middle-aged man, his performance is so lethargic it's a wonder why he even agreed to do it at all. Add the incredibly bad Maria Ford and others, and you get a really bad sword and sorceror flick that makes little if any sense. Only Brett Clark as the doofus hunk and Michelle Moffett as the evil queen come out with any semblance of acting ability.

Juicy Fruit is a strong contender for the lamest song, ever, in the history of the universe. Even from the introduction, you know you're in for a really bad 6 minutes...so bad, it's good.From the retarded drumbeat, to the schizophrenic baseline, to the half-cooked lyrics (juicyyyyyyyyy!), this is by far one of the worst songs I've ever heard. It makes me go into hysterics every time I hear it. You know what? I think everyone should go and listen to this song, it's beyond hilarious.Best appreciated while stoned. Love, the great big green pony in the sky."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Pleasant *Funk* Album","review":"I think \\"Juicy Fruit\\" so dominates over the rest of the album that many people would be dissapointed if they expect songs of similar flavor; I know I was one of them. While \\"Juicy Fruit\\" is very chic, shophisticated track, the rest of the cuts are very funky all the way. Now that I have developed an appreciation for funk music, however, the rest of tracks became also very listenable to me. There are a bunch of above-average electronic funk of early-'80s in this album.Having said that, nothing really comes close to \\"Juicy Fruit,\\" not because the rest sucks but because \\"Juicy Fruit\\" is one of those special songs that can totally convey the color and flavor of the musical style in the specific period in time.If you are not interested in electronic funk of early-'80s, pass up this album; \\"Juicy Fruit\\" can be heard elsewhere in compilation albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"23.76 are you kidding me?!!!","review":"What a rip.

His reviews of Barnett Newman and Jean Michel Basquiat have to be read to be laughed-at. Who would think that a TIME magazine art critic could write so many books and even get his own tv series?

I don't know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.\\" - Jean Michele BasquiatFor anyone who doesn't know, the profession of \\"art critic\\" is obsolete. That's why this book gets one star. I picked it up because I was made to believe it was an article of history, or fact if you will; instead what I got was someone trying to tell me what to believe about other people's work. I dictate my own feelings. Hughes' only way of making art is to criticize that of others, yet the very people he criticize, such as Arthur Rimbaud and Jean Basquiat will always have something Hughes will never comprehend, originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!","review":"Well, it's not surprising that the author of this book chose to belittle the work of on of America's Great Afro/Latino artists.

There's somewhat of resistance on the wheel, but I prefer a smoother wheel because it is very difficult to steer sometimes.

The silicone skin is pretty much exactly what you would think. It fits my Sansa like a glove, allows access to all of the ports, and doesn't impede the use of any of the controls. If anything the buttons are easier to push with the cover. The screen protector was a pleasant surprise. A thin piece of clear plastic that actually sticks to the face of my Sansa, I think it will really prolong the useful life of the screen. The belt clip seems pretty unreliable, but the armband looks ok (it's just an elastic band).On thing many reviews don't mention is what vendor they chose so I wanted to share that as well. I ended up deciding on Nextweb Sales, and had a great experience. I ordered the product, and received it in 2 days! Shipping was a lot, but the product was only 99 cents so it I kind of expect that.

I called Sony and the guy said that some of the earlier PS2 systems could not read some the games that were formatted with the blue backing. He mentioned that these games were originally formatted to the original PS system. I was told that I would have to send my PS2 system to Sony and for $45 they would send me a refirbished unit within 7-10 days of receipt. All of our other games work fine so we decided to return the two video games and purchase something else. I wish the companies would indicate the \\"blue backing\\" or mention that some games might not work with all gaming system models (mine is the earlier model).

I have used it for almost 2 years and the quality is always consistent.I find the manufacturer's recommendation of 2 1/2 T concentrate to one glass of water is much too strong for my taste buds and this is true of all of their flavors. I use about half that amount. Still, I recommend all of the Dynamic Health concentrates. The sweeter ones, like blueberry, make fantastic natural, healthy pancake syrup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I am used to","review":"I was very excited to purchase this Dynamic Health Cranberry juice concentrate, because the price was much better than what I had been paying. I have been using the Tree of Life brand and it is about twice as expensive as this brand. Unfortunately, this brand seems to be about 1/2 as concentrated and they must use some different process to make this product, as it tasted different as well. This brand reminded me more of a syrup. It doesn't have any added sugars or anything, but it is a lot less bitter than what I have come to expect (and like) from cranberry concentrate. I use cranberry concentrate to make cranwater for the fat flush diet plan and I didn't even finish the bottle of Dynamic Health brand. I recommend the Tree of Life brand if used for cranwater, or if you like the tangy bitterness of concentrated cranberries. This brand would be delicious over icecream."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUCCESSFUL PURCHASE","review":"Pure cranberry juice concentrate can be difficult to find, and expensive to purchase.This product is well priced, good quality.

Now these old classics are quite valuable and require special care and understanding during any rebuilding process. The example of workmanship shown in this video is very poor and takes more of a novice 'backyard' approach to engine rebuilding. The camera work and narration was uneven and tends to jump around.

One of Disney's major resort hotels isn't even named properly in the book. There is a big difference between Coronado Springs (correct) and Colorado Springs (wrong). Anyone who has even briefly visited the hotel can pick up on the southwest/Mayan/Aztec theme and should realize that the name Colorado Springs wouldn't make sense. I think if an author is claiming to be enough of an expert on something to write a guidebook, the basic facts should be right, which they are not.

If I do happen to get it to stick on 3, by the time I get where I'm going and take my daughter out, it's back down on 1 again. This makes the base too loose and makes baby tilt too far forward.The stroller is okay, had no trouble with the one-handed fold down. But the seat reclines back too far and she can't sit all the way up, she gets frustrated easily (7 1/2 months) by this because she likes to look around and can't because of the semi-recline position she has to be in. The cup holders are nice and so is the large storage area. Kinda hard to steer though.I wouldn't buy this one again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS SYSTEM","review":"This travel system is horrible!Not only is the base and infant carrier designed to sit too upright with little recline, the infant carrier is cheap and wears down over time.The locking mechanism on the handle completely broke within 5 months and the stroller is too big and awkward and hard to fold down.Don't waste your money on this cheap, poorly made system!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Read before you buy","review":"I have many Even Flo products and have actually been a fan. Until I bought the Embrace 5 Travel System (similar to the Aura). First of all the infant carrier started to show white stress marks in the gray handle before my son reached 15 lbs. It also tends to sit a bit upright in the car. Secondly the Stroller! If you have more than 9 lbs in it the wheels get stuck due to poor design. When I called the company to ask what to do. They said it wasn't a safety issue. I nearly knocked over the stroller several times while trying to walk on a sidewalk. The wheels get stuck and comes to a complete stop or goes to the side. I am very disappointed in Even Flo. BEWARE BEFORE YOU EVEN FLO INFANT CARRIES OR TRAVEL SYSTEMS. Please make sure you put at least 20 lbs of weight in a stroller and push it around before you buy. I wouldn't give mine away its going in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and Fun","review":"This toy is durable, sturdy and fun. I like it because it makes noise, but not annoying electronic sounds or electronic loud music. Baby makes noise the old fashioned way, by actually moving the toy around or shaking the toy him/herself. It also makes a great teether on the handle side, which is thick ridged plastic. A great stroller toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daddy did good","review":"Well I gave my husband a lot of slack for getting this toy. when I saw what he got I thought he had spent $20 (including shipping) on a glorified rattle. Well it came an it was an instant hit. My daughter played with this for 45 min. I am lucky if she play with a toy over 10 min. It is really neat that you can lock them together, or have them seperate. This toy is very durable, solid bright colors and will surely entertain you child. She is 7 months now and she still goes for this everyday. I think she will continue to enjoy it as she gets older. The price is a bit high if you figure in shipping. That is why i gave it a 4, but if I new how much my child would like this I would by it all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds kind of tinny","review":"The sound quality is pretty thin and tinny on these, but not bad for the price, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice little case","review":"works and looks good and it says Orion on it. solid case I have 4 lens and a shorty barlow and I still have room for 2-3 more things. almost wish I would have got the med size as this one is kinda small but it it all I need.

They had booted Hafdis Huld out for what appears to be no good reason, and the latest singles seemed a little commercial. After hearing the entire album, I realized that it isn't a sell-out, a commercial cookie-cutter work, but rather it has the clear production available usually only to big-name acts. The songs are brighter and more interesting than on \\"Polydistortion,\\" and as upset as I am about their sad treatment of Hafdis, I think that the band is entering a new stage of awesome beats and solid songwriting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album!","review":"Okay, so why has no one ever heard of this band before? They are amazing! There are so many people in this band that every song on the album is different. Can we say variety! If you like Air, Disco-club music, tantilizing lyrics and rockin' beats then you'll die over this album. Seriously, I liked it so much that I generously made a sample copy of it for all of my friends so they would go out and buy it. If anything you're bound to recognize the first track. It's been used in countless movies and TV commercials, but, the good thing is that it's not even the best song on the album! It just keeps getting better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Normal, it is.","review":"I really wanted to love this CD, but no. I like it. It's good. But it's way too normal for what Gusgus stand for.

But don't buy it just because you like \\"Ladyshave.\\" Just get the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed...","review":"This CD comes across as so 'light' that it never really seems to register. It's like the tracks are always on the verge of turning into big dancefloor stompers yet they never tip the scales. 'Believe' was a great track featured on the Northern Exposure II compelation, I expected to find more of the same on this album but unfortunatly I was sorely disapointed. Credit should be due for the range of styles that they've drawn on, if only they could have blended them together a bit smoother. Unfortunatly the craks show. Other people's cup of tea perhaps, but not mine, sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too normal","review":"Although the group is full of good ideas they lack the skill to turn them into good music. So in the end it's just normal dance music that you can listen to at a party or while you do your housework but you will soon forget it and start dancing to something else. But that's the problem with almost all pop music today. On the other hand, some artist manage to rise above all that and become unique, I'm afraid that gus gus doesn't have what it takes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this Normal ? Well...don't know but it's sure *GREAT* !!!","review":"Well first of all, I'll be honest with you, I don't own the CD as of today but my friend got it and I have to say that while it's a lot different than Polydistortion, you still feel the same vibe and you know you're listening to that same Icelandic collective you know so well...My favorites (so far) are Starlovers,Very Important Person, Superhuman,Love vs hate and Blue Mug. And, like others here,I saw them live in Montreal May 5th and they were sooooo good !! I had a wonderfull time and if they stop in your area, don't hesitate one minute, buy a ticket !

The GPS is adequate, although you should not even consider trying to use it as a replacement for an in-car navigation system. The interface is slow and difficult to use. The radio, while powerful, is difficult to hear if there is any kind of background noise. Even the sound of the wind outside the car with the windows rolled up can prevent clear communication.

This film feels like more of a re-telling of the previous film than a sequel to it (boy gets on train... 2 1/2 hours pass... then a machine planet is destroyed). But the feel of this film is different. The film seems a bit more harsh and dark, even in the colors on the screen. The animation is a bit of a step up from Galaxy Express 999.With this DVD you get:* The film, uncut and restored. The colors are quite sharp.* The Viz dub from 1996 is used. Japanese audio and subtitles are also available.* A short image gallery* A trailer for Galaxy Express 999, the same one as on the Galaxy Express 999 disk.* A trailer for Adieu Galaxy Express 999, the same one as on the Galaxy Express 999 disk.* The \\"Sayonara - love light\\" song is used in the menus.It's been 15 years since this film was released on VHS by Viz.

The Aloof make a slow and dubby version that's simply sublime; the instruments and vocals, starting with the strings and bass and adding layers incrementally to accrue and swell majestically. When the piano line comes it, it's almost as a relief of the surging power. The original itself is no slouch: it's reminiscent of 60s British pop, all sunshine and lights, even though the vocals tell of eating disorders. The various other mixes, ranging from the funky downtempo of Ashley Beedle or the acidic downtempo of Fuzz Townsend to the breaks of the Sol Brothers and Danmass, are fine to mediocre, but pale in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as I thought","review":"Unfortunately I am very disappointed in the swing seat I bought for my 3 year old son.

Yet this box set seems to pull it off quite effectively. It starts from the beginning and covers up to the mid-80s. The selection of songs effective illustrate Dylan's development and changes (good and bad) as a musician and songwriter. Some may find this set to be expensive, but it is an essential for even the casual Dylan fan. Alternate takes and live tracks make this a set worthwhile for the fan who has many Dylan CDs. Some key tracks may have been left off, but any attempt to make a collection like this for an artist as great as Dylan will not be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive introduction to Dylan","review":"The greatest compliment ever paid to Bob Dylan was by George Harrison, who said he thought that Dylan's music would outlast that of the Beatles.

It was supposedly made in 2006 but in some of the songs I had trouble wondering if it was Vicente singing or his son. Perhaps the songs were recorded some years back, I don't know.What we didn't like about this CD is that he appeared to be yelling his way through a lot of songs which neither I nor my wife like hearing. We much prefer an album of songs such as the CD \\"Necesito de Ti\\" which has a lot of variety in it. This \\"Living Legend\\" CD did not have that change of pace to it. It seemed like the same type of songs one after another. On the back of the CD, it says it's a remastered collection. That alone tells me this wasn't made in 2006.

Despite the hook, they did not stay in place for me and were not comfortable. The vinyl jacket wire was stiff and actually cracked! The hooks constantly came apart. The ear foam was crap. The old Jensen Audio company is long gone. It's just a cheap import brand now. Now I think the 'bigger' the driver, the worse the sound.

I know Hasbro has made some amazing female figures for the \\"Joe\\" line and this would have been the figure to use that template for.

This word, literally \\"the Name\\", is commonly used by religious Jews in place of Ad0nai (literally, \\"Our Lord\\"), to avoid reciting a prayer in vain. Therefore, according to some opinions, reciting a prayer in English from the Artscroll without using the proper word is not saying a prayer at all!

RamBam said exact translation is impossible, but a translater should try to put the Hebrew text into words as close to the same meaning as possible.

Her beauty and powerful voice will leave you breathless and will ensure that you watch this DVD over and over again. Lara's style on this show is a bit different from Lara Fabian Live (her Nue tour). Her approach on this DVD is similar to her 9-album although she sings all of her previous hits (unfortunately no English songs, but fans of Lara don't care, she sings great in any language). Even if the show is a bit more sedated than her Nue tour, it still has humor (Lara has a great sense for humor), style and elegance (a true Lara Fabian trademark). Two hours of non-stop musical excellence.A must for everyone who's interested in Lara's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lara is awesome as always","review":"I am not disappointed with this DVD at all.

This DVD will not only entertain you, it will take your breath away and take you to that place everyone needs to get away from reality for awhile. Lara Fabian is a beautiful woman. She has the voice of an angel, years of classical music training and can sing in four languages. When you hear her sing you will not only get the words and melody but she will reach out and touch your heart. It is probably impossible not to fall in love with her. And if you don't understand the words in French...not to worry. When you hear a violin, a piano or a symphony orchestra what are they saying? You will know. Music is a universal language. So buy this DVD. It will be one of your special things. Lara Fabian is a very exceptional artist.

Any fan who has gone to a live Mathis concert can understand when I state that Johnny Mathis sounds better live than on any of his recordings - the arrangements at a live concert are tremendous and support his voice to maximum effect. My personal favorite on this CD is \\"99 Miles from L.A.\\". This version moves me to tears every time I hear it. Johnny infuses the song with emotion and longing. Of course, the live version of \\"The Twelth of Never\\" is a hundred times better than the original recording.

Honestly hes so bubbly and has such a high pitched voice even when hes talking that i really just cant take too much of it at once. The music is catchy yes, but one of the greatest albums of our time? Not at all, I'm surprised someone actually even wrote that. And since it seems everyone stresses this a lot, I'm not an emo kid. I'm 19 and I listen to pretty much anything u give me and for the most part i like it.

You know how, when you're building a puzzle, and you are searching for a place for a certain piece, and sometimes the piece seems to almost fit, but it doesn't quite? Well, that's how his music is. Something just doesn't ring cleanly. The music really is pretty bad. His voice is horrible. (You have to wonder how people like this even get anywhere.) The lyrics......bleh.

Please do not buy this album, there are so many things you can better do with your time and money, I suggest getting yourself a Ray Charles CD, or the cast album or Les Miserables, or Hendrix, so you can know the sound of good music and cling to that in today's mindless listening culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Worry, Be Happy","review":"In a world of heartbreak and tragedy, you want an album that you can listen to and that will put you in one hell of a good mood. The Rocket Summer's new album Hello Good Friend does that and more. Bryce really spent more time on this album than he did on Calendar Days. The songs are well played out and the melodies are as addicting as crack.People will say this is cheesy pop/punk, happy go lucky fruity stuff, but you know you'll be blaring this behind closed doors, dancing around singing. Guaranteed, the kid with the Terror shirt will be tapping his feet and lip synching the words behind his friends back.Don't worry, be happy because Bryce sure is."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most fun cds to listen to...","review":"I love this cd because every song gives you something different. If band examples help, The Rocket Summer is like a mix of Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, the Format, and in a good way broadway. It's obvious that Bryce knows his voice and uses it in very creative ways. From slower songs like \\"Goodbye, waves, and drives away\\" to faster ones like \\"Brat Pack,\\" they are all pretty catchy in their own right. People keep referencing this as emo but the only real \\"emo\\" track is the end of \\"Christmas Present,\\" a partially instrumental song that really ends the cd perfectly. I'm not sure why other reviews suggest spending your money on other CDs that don't fall into this genre at all. I'd never heard of the Rocket Summer until a few months ago and now they are definitley in my top ten favorite bands. Worth buying if you LIKE the bands I listed above..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. . . this is bad. . .","review":"The vocals suck royally. I mean, come on, this is a *guy* singing and he's sounding like a girl. I guess you could try and get used to his voice if you WANTED to and then it might not be so evil, but . . . wow. His voice style is a bit breathy and falsetto-y, especially when he tries to hit high notes.I suppose if you like light fluffy pop music you might enjoy this. I could not get into his band. I knew I was in trouble when the tag on the CD said he'd sung on tour with Reliant K, but the words aren't catchy or clever, so it's even worse. Any guy who goes \\"oh, oh!\\" during bridge parts is to be avoided like a plague.Do yourself a favor and do not buy this CD. Unless of course you LIKE pop-music boy bands, in which case this will be right up your alley. I myself am waiting until the next P.O.D. album coming out in January and am extremely glad I did not purchase this CD for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did Aaron Carter start using distorted guitars?","review":"I only gave this album 2 stars because the music itself is so good. It's a great album ruined by what sounds like a 14 year whining about how he couldn't get a date for the prom. I do realize this guy is 22, which is what bothers me so much. I thought this album would be a bit more mature than \\"calendar days\\", but that is not the case. I would recommend this to young teenagers due to its positive message, but I think it's a bit too cheesy for people Bryce Avary's age. I want to like it so bad, but the lyrics are really hard not to laugh at. But props to Bryce for at least being positive. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but I had to be honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talent? 22 years old been on the scene since approx 1997 ?","review":"Bryce Avary's The Rocket Summer. Let here some of the reasons not to like it. Christian Music? Well, I'm not religious personally, very spiritual, but not religious traditionally. I do believe in Freedom, though and one's social political and religious beliefs are part of that. Pop music, overly optimist, sugary? Well, The Beatles were one of the greatest pop bands ever and musicians evolve. Not too often do truly talented musicians (he plays all the instruments, writes all the songs) hit the scene. The Rocket Summer deserves the serious, but un-criticizing attention of skeptics everywhere.Also listen to Ben Kweller and The Vines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting, and Inspiring","review":"I bought this CD with high hopes, and gosh, did it impress me more than I expected! This is one of the most talented one man band I've ever heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, this one is Awesome!","review":"SO I should start by saying this cd deserves no less than 5 stars. Honestly every song is great. The music is so upbeat, and the rhythms are catchy, but the lyrics are still complex, and the songs are dynamic. The cd includes a variety of instruments which were all recorded by Bryce Avery. I think since this is a solo record, it allows Bryce to work all the instruments and vocals into a flawless musical piece. I feel that listening to the samples may not be enough, as they made me hesitant to buy the cd, but if you find a full song to listen to you will understand what I mean. With that said, some of my favorite songs on the album are; Goodbye Waves and Drives ways, around the clock, I'm doing everything, Brat Pack, and never Knew.

Avery seems a bit more angry, but it feels like he is talking to you, the listener. I found it amazing. Going home, wind blowing in your hair, you really listen to his lyrics, and it blew me away. Stand out tracks , to me at least, are \\"Never Knew\\", \\"Brat Pack\\", \\"I Was So Alone\\", \\"Destiny\\", and \\"Treasures\\". This album is a bit longer at 14 tracks and 1 hour long.

But Mikhalkov was one of Russia's best-known and most-loved directors since his start in 70s. His brilliant debute was a game in \\"western\\" - an \\"eastern\\", as they were called in Russia - \\"At Home With Strangers, A Stranger At Home\\". \\"Slave Of LOve\\" is one of his early films as well, clearly a masterpiece. The story of a filmcrew, shooting on small south town after the Revolution of 1917 incorporates the doomed battle between the Reds and the Whites as well as the doomed relationships between a silent movie star and a cameraman-Bolshevik.Mikhalkov is playing with the finest nuances of feelings and meanings, creating a trembling, stealing, beatiful and fragile reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"teetering on the brink","review":"I give this movie five stars even though the ending is contrived Soviet hogwash.But up until the last few minutes...it's wonderful.The characters are members of a film crew trying to hide from the Revolution in the resort towns of the Crimea.

It offers you insight into the role of endorcers, and lets you get to know McCarty, Lapierre, McKenzie, and Cairns on a personal level. The LaPierre part is very good. My only complaint is they could of found two better tough guys than Cairns or McKenzie. How about Georges Laraques or Matthew Barnaby? Anyways, DVD is only about an hour, not much on bonus features either. If your a hockey fan, you will enjoy the documentary though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Totally not worth the money at all. If I wanted to know about Cairns, McKenzies, Lapis or McCarty's famalies or what their lives are like outside of hockey I would watch NHL insider or a documentary or something. It was nice how they looked into each guy individually and how he portrayed his role as an enforcer. However they showed ABSOLUTELY no fights at all, except for a mila-second of McKenzie grappling with Grimson, or Cairns about to drop his gloves etc. Too bad this is the only NHL production of its kind right now, cause honestly I would say this is the worst buy I have made in a long time.

The opening tracks are intense and full. Brian Tyler's scores for Timeline, Children of Dune, Constantine, and The Hunted are also really great but I was really surprised by this CD. It is some of the craziest action music in years (I also really like \\"The Bourne Identity\\"). Check out the title track or \\"Downtown Tokyo Chase\\" with its pounding drums and powerful orchestra. The melodic side is cool too. The haunting \\"Neela Drifts\\" is probably my favorite track with its memorable acoustic guitar melody and its beautiful sound. There are guitars on here too including a track that both Tyler and Slash play on called \\"Mustang Nismo\\" which is from the section of the movie where the main character combines a Nissan motor and a Ford Mustang chassis. Great music for driving of course!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing several tracks from the movie","review":"I'm giving this one star because I did not find in any track of this CD the songs I wanted from the movie.

At the end of the movie, there are statements on screen stating what happens to Amin, but there was nothing about Dr. Garrigan. My husband and I were curious, so we googled. He's a fictious character! Loosely based on an British advisor Amin had, who served 5 years imprisonment for his part in Amin's regime. We felt dooped! It is one thing to watch a movie knowing it is fictionalized, it is another to be made to believe what you are watching are real events.True, the movie is well acted. And the atrocities Amin commited were a background to the main story, but anything that tells the \\"inside story\\" is called into question in my mind because it all revolves around this fictional character...that you are lead to believe is true."},{"rating":"1","title":"five stars for whitaker zero stars for story","review":"'Nuff said, this was a sham from the beginning.

(Who grabs a gun in the front any president and not shot to death?)I was expecting this movie to be factual and not fiction.The director should go back to making documentaries- this is one of the worse movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's THAT good!","review":"It's one of the movies that is getting better every time you watch. Forest Whitaker is great (well, he won the Oscar finally). James McAvoy, in my opinion, steals the show. Let's be honest, the role of Idi Amin is made for the Oscar. The role of Nicholas Garrigan would have been easily shadowed and overpowered by Idi Amin without the great acting. James McAvoy hold himself well and equally against Forest Whitaker. There is certain danger, or bias, when an outsider portrays the so-called third world, even if s/he claims that s/he tried to tell the story from \\"their\\" perspective. This movie is not exception although with a lesser degree. It is a very emotional and sometimes violent movie that touches your heart. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth Would Have Been Interesting","review":"Rather than using a fictionalized version through the eyes of a rather uninteresting (except for the Scottish accent), and utterly naive doctor as his improbable right hand man, why not writer a screenplay based upon Idi Amin's actual life and tailspin into the cliched king whose power and paranoia drives him crazy with bloodlust?Now, that would have been a film I may have watched to the end - not this one. It fizzled, then left one wanting.Yes, Forest Whitaker gave a superb performance, but not enough to save this bad screenplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last King of Scotland","review":"This is the much lauded film about Idi Amin and his rise to power, his tenuous grip on his advisers and his own sense of reality and his relationship with his personal physician. It is infused with his paranoia and maniacal flips from joviality to aggression. Forrest Whittaker and Jame McAvoy play their roles superbly and Gillian Anderson is excellent, but sadly underused as an actress. This film is rich and colourful and shows to some extent what life may have been like in Seventies Uganda. I found it to be perfectly watchable and the acting impressive, but I wasn't as engrossed or engaged as I'd been lead to believe I would be (hence the 4 stars). But this is a good story, directed well, with a great African soundtrack. Well worth a viewing for a look at a ruthless dictator.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie...Excellent in Blu Ray","review":"This is one Great movie.

Either way, you won't be dissapointed.Whitaker's performance is outstanding, though I expected him to be in the movie much more than he was, especially in the beginning. His portrayal of Idi Amin is extremely convincing and passionate. It was great to see such an incredible performance.I really enjoyed learning about a subject I knew so little about. It kept my interest the entire movie and felt I really understand what happened in Uganda by the end of the movie.The only reason I rate it 4 stars is because the film quality wasn't the best. The filming was simply average however that was easy to ignore because the content of the movie was what gripped me. I recommend the movie highly, yet be ready for an intense Drama, it is not for the light hearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rated R for \\"Gruesome Images\\" --quite accurate","review":"When I look back on this movie as a whole, I liked it for the most part - it was powerful, disturbing, and showcased yet another history lesson about a leader \\"for the people\\" (and the people are brainwashed to love him at first) who quickly turns into a murderous, insane, EVIL dictator. Whitaker's performance certainly deserved that oscar. Wow. Excellent accent too.The main problem I had with this movie was that I felt no sympathy for the main character, Dr. Garrigan. I wanted him to be punished, to die. He was such an idiot and made horrible choices throughout. Most people would at least have some common sense not to do some of the things he did. I mean, he should never have expected to get away with anything. He was generally a selfish character, a womanizer. I blame him for what happened to one of the women towards the end, and I wish he'd had to suffer in that woman's place. She never deserved to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Powerful Film","review":"A very powerful film, and I don't have to tell you why because you can read so many other reviews.

The central character, Dr. Garrigan played by James McAnvoy never existed.With that I changed my perspective & it is still a very good movie. A bit of a morality play. Of course it is the oft told tale of the corrosive effects of absolute power corrupting absolutely. Forest Whitaker playing dictator Idi Amin has the performance of his career. That & the other performances elevate this movie. Real live historical figures & events, with footage are interspersed with stories behind closed doors of the palace which are not fact. A major movie to see just for the acting if nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant and terrible","review":"going on the lines of other movies set in Africa such as Blood Diamond and Hotel Rwanda, this movie is great yet extremely disturbing. it showed how great and ugly people could be, that no one is fully good or evil.you have the naive scotish doctor who has a nack at trying to get in bed with married women, and you have a dictator who puts on such a good front you don't actually see his true colors until later. the character development and acting was impressive. you really felt as if these actors could have actually been the people. there were little to no instances of them breaking character which made this story unbelievably good.there were disturbing scenes, but that comes with the territory. just like in Hotel Rwanda with the genocide of the hutus and tutsies; and in Blood Diamond where people were enslaving their own just for finding diamonds. this was another eye opening movie, one that i can't unsee and almost makes you wish the movie wasn't based on the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a brilliant film and a must have","review":"Amazon does a good job of telling you what the film is about so I just tell what I thought of the film. It is has a brilliant cast and the acting is really good. The script is well written and is a terrific portrayol of a true story. It deserved all the awards it got and probably deserved more. A must buy, it will be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bloddy Mess in Africa","review":"I had never heard of Forest Whitaker before this movie, and I feel that he is probably an excellent actor. However, in this semi-authentic biopic, he over-acted like an amateur. The movie was filled with gratuitis \\"blood, guts and gore\\" that were not necessary to the plot. Don Cheadle's \\"Rwanda\\" is far superior, as are several other movies on Idi Amin and Rwanda. I was disappointed that the director chose the sensational rather than to tell the story. This movie was like driving tacks with a sledge hammer."},{"rating":"1","title":".....because you are white......","review":"Didn't like the movie. Loosely based movies rarely tell the whole story but was hoping for more truth than this one gave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and exploitative","review":"Does anybody else find Forest Whitaker irritating? It's probably sacrilege to say it, but I've always found him over-earnest, even in junk like \\"Species\\". Anyone who caught him recently in \\"ER\\" vicing someone's hand were subjected to the full range of tics, eyeball bulging, sweating and imposing theatrics he could muster until total thespian meltdown was achieved.This film didn't appear to have any purpose other than to distress the viewer as much as possible. The Man Called Horse scene right next to an international incident was silly and if Amin didn't sow his wife's body parts up in funny ways as most commentators have suggested, why pander to possibly racist myths? Most puzzling.I did however like the Scottish guys performance and the direction was reasonable. Amin was miscast but that is where we came in."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring movies of the year","review":"First of all, this is about Adi's doctor, not Adi. Secondly, it was one of the most boring films of the year. It would have won my oscar as the most boring but that award went to Letters from Iwo Jima. I got up twice to go to the bathroom during this film and didn't even hurry back. I couldn't wait for it to end. It grossly minimizes Adi's human rights records as well as the raid on Intebi. Excuse my spelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Movies like this make me want to never watch movies again. A disgusting look inside the worst of people.

His finger falls upon Uganda and his fate is sealed. At first he works at a clinic, but then his path crosses that of dictator Idi Amin and his life becomes inexorably intertwined with that of the Ugandan ruler as he becomes his personal physician. The movie is dramatic and fast-moving and the performance of Forest Whitaker as Amin is truly memorable. Fiction though it may be, the film is very entertaining and it does give the viewer a look at the havoc that one man can cause when given absolute power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forest Whitaker-The King of Acting","review":"This is one of my favourite performances by a male actor in film history. Forest Whitaker is something else. He just totally embodied his character, and he gets so into his craft. He's one of the few actors left with total passion and heart. My favourite scene is when they are at the airport and Forest Whitaker finds out his assistant/doctor is trying to poison him, and had an affair with one of his wives. When he gets in his face and breaks it down to him, it was a classic cinematic moment and brilliant acting. I also love the way \\"Last King of Scotland\\" was filmed. All the technical aspects were overlooked by Forest Whitaker's oscar performance. They really made it look like the 70,s. The whole film had that 70's feel. There is also some great music in the movie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last King of Scotland","review":"I enjoyed watching this dvd and felt the persona of Idi Amin was well portrayed.

McAvoy's character is extremely naive and he does a great acting job.The ending may be quite shocking to some, I myself couldn't bear to watch a few minutes of very gruesome (but necessary and justified) violence (after 1h45 minutes of watching).Certainly not a disappointment.A well directed film, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A best-of-career-album of country-folk","review":"Campbell's toned down his act from his previous two LPs, dropping the twang and rockabilly for a folkier, singer-songwriter sound. What's emerged is his huge talent. The mostly-acoustic arrangements push the lyrics to the fore, and whether they're original compositions, or the well-chosen songs of Jamie O'Hare, Campbell sings them with intimacy and conviction. Campbell's songs explore the pull between restraint and liberty, from the lonely dreams of a prisoner in \\"I'm Gonna Fly,\\" to the dream chasers of \\"Five Texas Dollars.\\" His well-chosen covers include O'Hara's stunning song of farm foreclosure, \\"Bidding America Goodbye.\\" Cambpell's voice is a beautiful melodic match for the songs, and the accompaniment frames him perfectly.

He alone is fantastic as the brilliant Camp Helper \\"Stick\\".Great performances by Bill Paxton, Kevin Pollack, and Diane Lane should be not overlooked.There are some great life lessons and some very funny and touching moments.This is a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having a bad night?","review":"Actually, I would have given this film one star, but I'm giving it two stars on account of the fact that if you have trouble sleeping, this is the perfect movie to watch. About ten to fifteen minutes ought to do before you doze off. The perfect remedy for your sleeping disorder. Don't even try to figure out how Diane Lane and Alan Arkin get mixed up in this mess. I thought summer camp was suppose to be fun...although that guy getting his hand dipped in pee was funny. Ok, so it got a chuckle out of me but I swear that's it. If you want to watch a good movie with Bill Paxton, go for \\"A simple Plan\\". In the mood for Diane Lane? Go for \\"Murder at 1600\\". Huge Alan Arkin fan? Check him out in \\"Wait until Dark\\". That final scene with Audrey Hepburn is priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"MADE IN MEXICO CRAPPY VIDEO","review":"Love the movie but will never buy a movie from amazon.com ever again.

That quote makes me laugh every time I see it, which is more than I can say for Indiant Summer.My friends and I watched the movie, knowing full well that it would be godawful. Within the first 20 minutes of the movie, we found our prejudices about the film validated. This is a bland movie with generic actors and terrible comedy. Watching this movie in the hopes of being entertained is like eating cake in the hopes of losing weight. The only entertainment we derived from this movie was our own comments about how mediocre Indian Summer truly was.Just look at the cover and you'll get an idea of how boring and average this movie is. In fact, you can tell that the characters on the front cover were Photoshop'd into the canoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indian Summer","review":"A slice of life comedy that just doesn't work. The practical jokes are a little too cruel to be funny. The relationships are not entirely believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like slapstick humor, you'll love this film","review":"While the premise of the story - a group of childhood friends called back to experience the last year of their old summer camp - could have had a lot of potential, the movie repeatedly resorts to slapstick humor to carry you from scene to scene, as past and present interpersonal conflicts and relationships are clumsily explored, and trivial and childish behaviors are re-enacted, with the apparent expectation that the audience should remain interested. I gritted my teeth, but I have to admit that after an hour, I could no longer take it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. I definitely think it had the potential to be good. What I didn't like was that you didn't really get to know the characters. I felt like an outsider while watching this film. I think if the writers had started out the film showing us the characters as kids at camp then it would have been easier to identify with them. I also thought the actor who played \\"Uncle Lou\\" was awful. His acting stunk, although I thought all the others were good. I have fond memories of summer camp so I think the concept of a camp reunion is good, but this one bombed. No wonder it isn't wasn't very popular. I hope a better summer camp movie comes out soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indian Summer Blu-ray","review":"This dvd skips , stops, both audio and video , would not recommend that you purchase it at Amazon.com .

This is one of the worst films ever made. I note that over time only 1 in 10 people found this review useful..Do I need to actually say that this is pitful, amaturish, supercilious tripe?

I probably liked it so much because it brought back memories of being at Boy Scout camp and borrowing the canoes to paddle over to the Girl Scout camp across the lake at night. I won't go into the plot because it's already been covered very well by the other reviewers. I will say that fans of horror movies might be interested that Sam Raimi of Evil Dead fame makes an appearance in the movie as the handyman Stick which is fitting since the first 2 Evil Dead movies contained references to Camp Tamakwa."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all time favorite","review":"My husband and I have a handful of DVD's that we watch over and over - this is one of our favorites!

What I didn't notice until I was home and had opened it was that it was Fullscreen. A minor setback, I thought. I figured I'd just return it for the widescreen version-- until I realized that there is no widescreen version. This is almost unheard of for the DVD medium. I can't think of a single movie I own that isn't widescreen (or any movie at all that isn't at least available in both formats).If Fullscreen doesn't bother you, you won't have any problem with this DVD, as the movie is really good. If you're like me however, you'll be disappointed when you realize that there is no Widescreen translation of this DVD yet.At least it was cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my faves!","review":"This movie could possibly be my utmost favourite. A simple story with a great cast about the days gone by, when life was much simpler, easier and sincere. A group of adult friends revisit their childhood experience of a youth summer camp and reflect upon their lives of what's become. Laughter, sadness and making amends are part of growing up and this movie depicts these. Video and audio presentation is decent, and much better than the artifact-laced and non-anamorphic dvd (of which I own as well as the archived laserdisc copy). If you are a fan of this movie or enjoy movies with a simple, laid back story about life and friendship, then this movie is recommended, as this blu ray has the best video and audio available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great older movie","review":"Great cast, great storyline, great music....all around great movie.

Looking forward each summer to reunite with our friends and familiar surroundings. The feeling of camp is special and the bonds formed are forever. As with this film it brings it all back the feelings the sites the sounds and emotions. Though the script is good and story is familiar we can all relate.

Lucca is the protagonist who we are supposed to like: she is beautiful, talented, and tragic--or at least that's what I think Grondahl wanted his readers to feel. However, Lucca comes off as more of a prig than anything else, and Robert is so detached from those close to him that it is difficult for the reader to like him as well. Lucca is beautiful, and we know she will get any man she desires, and even those she doesn't. There is only one surprising scene in the novel, and it's a disturbingly gross one at that. The rest of the plot seems to be filled with shallow passionate moments and relationships that never go beyond chic Eupropean detachment.The author takes such a pessimisic view of love and life that it seemed better for my soul to stop reading Lucca than to finish it. But for some reason I did, and I can't say that I'm glad I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it","review":"The reviews made it sound like I could get into this, but I'm about a quarter of the way through, and it's been an excruciating read.

Partly, I think it's that it is written with dialogue that's not set apart by quotation marks, so sorting out what is said, what is thought, and what is just narrative (and sometimes, who is saying it) is too much like work.

It is as follows: \\"Flirting is the art of interacting with others withouth serious intent.\\" This does not mean you you play mind games, it simply means that while flirting you get to know people and find out whether you want them as a business contact, or a serious relationship. Overall the book offers a few imaginative ideas, but it really is too vague. If you follow some of the suggestions you will only get so far before you may have to ask yourself how you make the transition from just flirting to building a closer tie with that person you may have bumped into at the store.

Milkscreen is a fantastic product when used as directed! Liquids or solids, other than breast milk, poured directly on the reactive pad may lead to false positives. Breast milk has a neutralizing effect which allows Milkscreen to look for and monitor the presence of alcohol.

It turned dark green-blue, indicating that I had a significant amount of alcohol in my milk. No way. The instructions do admit the test is ultrasensitive, sometimes being affected even by vapors in the air...but even in the absence of cleaning products or other sources of alcohol in the area, it still is way too sensitive in my opinion. I agree with a previous reviewer...use common sense, and wait the 3 hours for each drink consumed. This test is too expensive and too sensitive to be useful in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense is cheaper!","review":"While I think the creators of this product have great intentions, this is just one more example of marketing unneccesary items to breastfeeding mothers.Current research indicates that drinking *in moderation* is fine while breastfeeding your child. The amount of alcohol that actually makes it into your breastmilk is very small (less than 2%). The AAP, La Leche League and other authorities in the field all agree that a glass of wine is safe.Put it this way - if you're concerned enough about the level of alcohol in your bloodstream to consider testing your milk, then breastfeeding is the least of your worries!

Considering the musical direction he turned in the late 70s and 80s, this is an easily justifiably conclusion.However, Neil didn't start that way. His early years were mainstream rock, and this disc does an excellent job of portraying them. Highlights included the country-flavored Kentucky Woman, the powerful ballad Solitary Man, and the solid rockers You Got to Me and Thank the Lord for the Night Time.Above all else, Neil Diamond is a superb songwriter, and this disc includes his original version of I'm a Believer, which became the number one song of 1966 for the Monkees.There are some weaker cuts on the album, but they do nothing to detract from its overall excellence.

Storing it took up a fair amount of space as well.This cooker allows you to cook a pound in one fell swoop! So much faster!The only draw back for me--and I don't know if others have experienced this--is that if you like your bacon crispy, it is virtually impossible to get it off the \\"hangers\\" and unbend it without breaking it.

Many of these techniques help clients gain access to intangible ideas such as anger, stress, and sadness through tangible projects and games. \\"Feelings Tic Tac Toe\\" (pg. 34-35) is a favorite among my clients!!! The section of activities aimed at coping with feelings is a valuable resource and a special addition that can't be found in many play therapy activity/technique resources. The self-esteem activities are unique and fun, and the graduation section has helped me develop successful terminations with those youth who have worked hard and are finishing their work with me. I'd recommend this book to anyone who has felt \\"stuck\\" with clients, as it has definitely helped me conceptualize therapeutic ideas in a different way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book has fabulous exercises for working with children.

I have this one and the sequel as well. both are chopped full of activities. I use it wiht junior high and high school level. Some of the stuff I have had to adapt to my setting and it is easy to do. As some others have said, some activities require certain games. One game I actually found (well, an off brand) at a dollar store.

When I received it (and I need to applaud the speedy delivery of the order! it was within 4 days of ordering) there was no weight to the package and I thought it was empty. Finally, my curiousty got the better of me and I opened the box to find \\"very small\\" plastic pieces - now I understand it was a \\"scale\\"model, but it was certainly cut down. The point of this whole bad review is that the cost was $14.00 and change, with a shipping charge and tax totaling $6.00 (so, $21+ total)- and I felt cheated. I am sorry that I ordered this particular product and would return it and get a refund if it weren't so close to the holidays. I guess the conclusion is, don't buy models over the internet - I have purchased a lot of things over the internet and this is the first time I was totally disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful pony","review":"I got this pony for my birthday. I am an older collector. I love her sparkly pink hair and how it has dark and light pink hair. Her symbol on her lip is swirling stars which is beautiful. She is even more beautiful without her coat and hat on.The hat looks like it has to be gentle with or it might loose the band that keeps in on the pony's head, but something probably can be sewn in its place if you are good with sewing.

I followed the directions just as they were written, and I don't make substitutions, yet, none of the hot dishes were good. One of them, my complaint was flavour, and that is objective, so we can excuse that one. The second hot dish, the rice didn't cook all the way so it was unpleasantly crunchy (I used the exact rice called for in the recipe). The one I made this weekend, all the chicken was dried out.

I thought it was going to be such a stupid excuse for a movie. But it actually turned out to be one that I enjoyed. Richard Dreyfuss heads an all-star cast along with Seymour Cassell, Dan Hedeya, Burt Reynolds, and Carrie Anne-Moss. The story follows the four main characters from their time as mob hit-men to their time in a retirement home in Florida. They're fired from every job possible, trying to survive the now envaded Florida scenery. They yet again turn to crime to make everything ok again. Packed with good comedy and great actors, the Crew is not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this book","review":"I read the reviews here and thought they were useful so I bought the book. To my horror, this author basically undermines the authority of Scripture by stating that the Bible is unreliable in matters of science, history, morals and what not. Then he tries to build on whatever authority is left after he has effectively tells the reader that little of what the Bible says is true. A classic example of man's reason overriding that of revelation. For me, I take the Scripture's side anytime. The Bible is true in what it says, whether it be science or history, even morals. It has the full authority of God in what it says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Athletic Stretch Tape","review":"Love this tape. Very soft and effective.

The table was very useful and conveniently fit into my 4Runner with all sorts of other gear. Giving this one star though because it broke within a few days of normal use. The problem is that the plastic sockets where the table folds into are very flimsy and brittle. Within two days one plastic socket broke and the table legs got all folded up the wrong way. Easy fix and working great until it happens a second time. This time another socket broke and the legs turned into a twisted pretzel of junk. Almost impossible to fold up correctly now and destined for the dump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic","review":"I bought 2 of these tables because they were marked down to $32 at a local store. Both of them came out of the box damaged. They have plastic knobs that are designed to fit into holes on the bottom of the table top. That is how the table top is secured to the bottom legs. On one table, one was broken and on the other, 2 were broken. Also, on one table the metal cross support bars were damaged. The bars are made of aluminum but they are connected to the leg by a cheap piece of plastic. The plastic was broken. If the plastic on these table can't even survive shipping imagine how easily they would break just under normal use. Also, I want to note that the boxes these tables came in had no damage to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camping table","review":"Received this table as a gift about 10 years ago. found it great on the beach while camping and now carry it my rv (easy to store).

The first time I opened the box containing this table was while setting up the camp site. Too late: the table was so delicate that the main parts that hold it together -- the leg anchors that support the equally flimsy and fragile aluminum cross pieces -- had been broken in the simple act of shipping. I looked closer, and these main supports were made of some incredibly cheap, delicate plastic. This thing wouldn't have lasted a day on a campsite, even if it had survived shipping! (We placed the table in the campsite's trash dumper the next morning). Buy a lower cost table from another company -- no need to even go to a higher priced unit, since anything else would be better designed and constructed than this table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Easily Breaking Design","review":"This table is very poorly designed, same as these other reviewers, the plastic connection-joints were broken before we even used it.We didn't notice until we tried to take it camping, so lovely Target wouldn't take it back past the 90 days, even though it sat in our garage in the new box.So I tried to order a replacement table, this one arrived broken as well. So I tried one more time, and guess what? This one arrived broken as well.I am now contacting Coleman as the table is supposed to have a 5 year warranty. But I don't want another Coleman table! I advise others with this breaky-table to call Coleman and complain! 800-835-3278Our friends have used another table for years and it has never broken: Orion roll a table.Follow up: Coleman actualy sent us a new table with new-updated design & it works great! They arranged to have the broken one picked up & shipped us the new one at no cost. Good service Coleman!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great table.","review":"I am a U.S. Soldier and I demand a lot from the gear that I buy. I purchased one of these tables from the px and have used it in very precarious areas to go shooting and camping and it has worked great. Unlike other posts would have you to believe it is coated aluminum table top and light weight steel legs and as I recall off the top of my head it is rated for 400lbs. But it's like most gear and you have to have half a brain and set it up properly in order to have it perform correctly if you don't you will break it. so I say it is a great light weight easily portable heavy duty table that works great as long as you use your head and use the gear proper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super compact and versatile.","review":"I got this compact table for our family camping trips and tailgating. I love how compact this folds in the bag; easy to pack and store in the car trunk or carrier. Set up isn't super easy, but once it's up it stays put. The table is best used as a buffet or prep station, not as a table to eat at or for games, as the cross bars hit your legs while seated. Wish the price was lower -- it would be a better value, and more acceptable in the $25-40 range."},{"rating":"2","title":"L'Elisir d'Amore","review":"This lively performance is well sung all 'round.

My first choice wasDonizetti - L'Elisir d'Amore / Eschwe, Netrebko, Villazon, Wiener Staatsoper, because I prefer traditional performances, and because that performance truly sparkles. However, I liked the Alagna, Gheorghiu performance enough that I ordered both DVDs. I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roberto's voice is too hard","review":"Excellent performances by Dulcamara and Belcore. Nemorino just wasn't melodious enough for me. This production was in 1996 and Roberto has certainly improved since. As for Adina I do not think she was coquettish enough. For some strange reason the scene was updated to the 1920s; why this when the original was quite ok?I have the Pavarotti version on VHS, which is now coming out on DVD. I much more prefer his Una Furtiva Lagrima than Roberto's. Likewise I think Judith Blegen provides a better performance than Angela. But Dulcamara and Belocre are much better in this version. In my opinion both version are worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want those men fired!!!","review":"I was looking forward to watching this DVD, but thanks to incomptent authoring by Miles Tudor and Philip Rowlands, who botched the 16x9 enhancement so that it doesn't work on all players, including mine, producing a painful image that ought to require these men be subjected to Argento Opera meets Space Warriors 2000, for all two of you who get my joke, as the two similarly screwed up The Death of Klinghoffer.

This performance however doesn't come close.While it is professional, it is not world class. The recording mix is poor, and it wouldn't surprise me if it weren't mixed at all. The result is that the symphony often drowns out the vocalists. The camera work is poor too, but overall it is just a poor production.As to the technical aspects, the format cuts out the right and left sides so as to fit on a tv screen. I was also extremely disappointed that though the opera is sung in Italian, there are no Italian subtitles.The fact that it was filmed in Lyon and not somewhere like Milan should say it all. You go to Lyon for a gourmet meal - not for the opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is A Great Preformance!","review":"I am 12 years old and a big opera fan. I absolutly love this preformance.

Meatloaf coloaborator Jim Steinman produced the album and wrote two songs for it including \\"Eclipse\\". Bonnie Tyler's rough voice (often compared to Tina Turner, Kim Carnes, and Stevie Nicks) is beautifully showcased in the 9 tracks on this album. Look for the title track as being a catchy song with a great hook for a course, also a highlight of the albun is Tyler's rendition of the Bryan Adams hit \\"Straight From The Heart\\", She brings it out with perfection.

Even my instructor at the computer learning center which is currently using this book in it's self paced program admits it was very hard for her to follow.

It comes handy for games like Super Smash Bros Melee (11 blocks) Sonic Adventures DX ( 8 or higher depending by your chao garden in the game) Madden Nfl 2002-2008 (between 40 blocks) Zelda WindWalker (12 blocks) and SB Battle For Bikini Bottom (10 blocks). This memory comes with 251 Memory spaces!!!! More than other memory cards! So if you have big memory games on your Gamecube make sure to get this memory card!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS CARD","review":"First off, never buy non-Nintendo licensed equipment for your Gamecube. Most third-party companys don't test their products by Nintendo's standards and most thrid-party equipment will cause problems with your Gamecube or will break very easily (A Interact Memory card corrupted itself every time my friend tried to save games where as my memory card went through the wash and worked perfectly fine). This card is only $more that then mem card 59, and holds 4 times the memory! Most fo the Gamecube games that have been released recently require 5-10 blocks to save (ie: Super Mario Sunshine needs 7 blocks) and you will run through 59 blocks fast. Sports games tend to take all 59 blocks. The Memory Card 251 is an excellent deal, although you may not be able to find it in stores (stores are not allowed to order them from Nintendo, Nintendo just ships the stores Memory cards when they feel like it according to a wal-mart representative). This is a definate must for any Gamecube owner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service!!","review":"Fast friendly service. Received in nice packaging.

Don't bother with cards that have smaller capacities. The 251 will ensure that your Gamecube can keep saving on one card rather than requiring you to keep stacks of multiple 59 block cards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!","review":"If you have another, sell it and buy this (Unless, of course, you have the 1019).

Buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but 16x is WAY BETTER!","review":"This memory card is pretty good. Although, it's good, memory card x16 has 1019 blocks.

Actually, you can buy a memory card with 1015 blocks, yes 1015. Third Party. Nintendo doesn't manufacture high enough capacity memory cards, which third parties do. A Standard Nintendo GameCube holds *about* 54 blocks. You couldn't POSSIBLY hold more then a sport game's season on there and expect to hold anything with a scant 54 could you?

First off, always buy Nintendo-made first-party products. Other memory cards are known to be unreliable and may currupt your saved game data, making it unusable! While third-party cards seem bigger and better, the fact that you could lose your saved games is too big a downside to me.Before I got this card, all my game data was spread accross 3 or 4 older cards, which was very confusing at times. I plugged in this baby and was able to transfer all my files over in a snap, and it only used half the card! This will be the most useful purchase you'll make!

Better than memory card 59!","review":"Well hears the deal there is nothing wrong with the memory card and there is not much to say because it's not third party so of course it is gonna work. But unless you're a game freak, you won't use memory card 59 all up. You can if you play madden nfl 2003 or something like that but memory card 251=16 MB which is higher than PS2 memory cards. Wierd huh? PS2 memory cards are bigger, the Sony kinds, and gamecubes memory card is smaller and stores more data. It might be because sony wants money or gamecube has compressed data.

It covered many details of the trucks too quickly and had no helpful graphics, i.e. how the drive train worked, etc. The music was like that from bad 70's TV cop shows. The dialog and banter between hosts was silly and many of the action sequences, like mistakenly dropping a car off of the tow truck were really unnecessary humor that our little guy would be better without.

And Pelecanos have received rave reviews here on Amazon, so I thought this must be great. It didn't feel great.I'll start by saying this though: The writing is well done, the conversations sound real, and the story feels believable.However, it took a whole one hundred pages before the story started moving. With that much time building characters, there should be a lot of depth - but it never happens. Ramone and Holiday are pretty one dimensional, and really have only one pattern of expressions. The parallel stories don't have a single character with whom I'd relate or care about what happened to, and thus many chapters felt like a chore to finish. Compared with James Lee Burke's depth or Robert Wilson's plots, this book has a long way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"There are times that I have liked George Pelecanos and other times that I haven't. I'm kind of in the middle here. Point of view switched too many times here because I wasn't sure why there was a point of view for one of the characters since he wasn't part of the murder that took place. I think it's good to switch when it's all part of the same story but that wasn't the case here.I think that since this was about a murder mystery about a teenager, then there could have been a lot more on that with one of his friends as a character although I'm not sure I would have liked that either. It's a tough call. I still think that Pelecanos is a great writer and I would still read his other books but this isn't one of his better ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good author, poor performer","review":"This is in reference to the audio version of the book: while Mr. Pelacanos can weave a tale, he would be advised stick to the written word and let an actor perform his audio versions.

After finding that a recent murder closely resembles the facts of that old case their paths cross again resurrecting a lot of bad blood, tensions, while at the same time exposing the common ground they all share.

The story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically, but the author's writing style is sometimes a distraction. Why do the African-American suspects always ask for Slice soda to drink? And they repeatedly make a point of asking for Slice. (Do they even make it anymore? I thought it was replaced by Sierra Mist). And another distracting detail is the author's way of giving so many people nicknames. You don't need to tell me that a guy's name is Ed \\"Smiley\\" Jones if you never mention \\"Smiley\\" again or there's not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname. That said, I liked the use of DC as the backdrop and if I was going on a plane ride, I would probably pick up another book by Pelecanos (but I wouldn't let anyone see what I was reading and then I'd leave it in the seatback when I deplaned)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassingly bad","review":"Political correctness rules and ruins this lumpy and uneven book.

Two bodies had dropped overnight, and assignments and pairings were being discussed.\\" Yes, and passages of the novel were being written in the tedious passive voice.The attempt at street talk does not ring true, the plot is rusty, and the whole thing is unconvincing.

The plot cracks along, the characters are really good and ROUNDED, you felt they were real people rather than cut out \\"goodies\\" and \\"baddies\\". There wasnt the sometimes pointless traveling and descriptions you get in some thrillers and the whole thing has a delicious sense of ambiguity.

Pelecanos entwines many stories linked by four murders--three from the 1980s and one from the present day that appear linked by their facts. Two uniformed police officers--Gus Ramone and Doc Holiday--from the 80s have moved on. Ramone is a detective with children of his own investigating the murder of one of his teenaged son's friends; Holiday is no longer on the force but becomes involved with the murder. The present day murder bears uncanny similarities to the earlier murders, and another current one. The story proceeds at an compelling clip, with interesting turns and twists, nothing unbelievable, just enough to keep the reader guessing. This is an entertaining, quick read.

While it was being aired I caught about 90% of it. I was so disapointed after I complety watch the dvd in full. It as nearly a third of it cut out. Most of the non critical scenes were deleted. Everything about Julia's sister Soledad was basically deleted. The part where she tries to play it off like she's pregnant by Gabriel was deleted. Everything about here having to choose between Samuel, and Leandro was deleted. Ever thing about Alvaro mis treating Lucero was deleted and just about everything about Lucero and Ramon was cut out. Everything about Julia and Sebastian's almost relationship was deleted. The whole funeral scene where Julia's first son dies is gone. Most of Nadia and Alvaro relationship hardly happend. This was just a huge disapointment for me.

Recently I compiled a list of my top hard rock albums of all time and this album rose to #1 among thousands of that I considered. You just have to hear it.

The album is good indeed with outstanding songs like the catchy \\"Easy living\\" (not Uriah Heep cover), \\"Feel me, touch me\\", and \\"Another day\\" (the album's hardest rocking track) among others. There's also some good, although not great, solid rock tunes included and you won't find any fillers. Singer Dave King has a good voice but his \\"high pitch\\" can be a bit annoying in the long run. If I didn't already have this one, I'd get it today. The album is worth either very strong 3 stars, or weaker 4 stars...Anyway, Fastway managed to release another good album with \\"Waiting for the roar\\" in 1986. But after that they totally lost it.

This is not the first time its been on CD but this is the best version that has all the tracks from the original US CD and 2 b-sides that were on the We Become One single (Crazy Dream and Back In The Game). This RockCandy version is remastered (sounds great!) and contains 13 studio songs and 4 live songs from a BBC broadcast. The booklet is great w/ an interview w/ Fast Eddie.

Since I needed it in a hurry I paid for two day shipping and it showed up on time, that is probably the best thing about this set. Wish I had purchased the Joe-Knows-Electronics set for $20, as there are 3 times as many resistors and each different resistor value has it's own bag. Didn't need the bigger selection of resistors, but having to sort through a bag of (5) different values referring to a chart (not included) to figure out what resistor you are looking at is a pain.Update: I see that some of the later reviewers received each resistor value in it's own bag. That would have been much handier, but the ones sent to me were mixed 5 resistor values to the bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"My product rating might be misleading because...","review":"If they hadn't of messed up I'd give it five stars. the box comes with a bunch of numbered bags with different resistors. Mine was missing bag 10 and 16 I believe (I'll have to check later to confirm) and had two bag 13's. It would be a great selection if they had all come.

Packaging was very organized.The resistors I needed were included exactly in the kit !Worth the money!!! Buy these resistors !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"My set (purchased October 2011) doesn't look like the one pictured. The cardboard box is flimsy. When the outer sleeve is removed, there is a label that describes each of the 18 numbered plastic bags (4 values in each bag). Inside each larger bag is 4 smaller plastic bags, each labeled with the values of the resistors inside.The main label is in three sections (6 bags in each section), In other words bags number 1-6, 7-12, and 13-18 are described with the contents in each bag. It's easy to find the resistor you want by identifying the large bag first, and then the smaller bag inside the large bag.To make this more convenient, I organized the 18 bags, and using 3 binder clips, I clipped the 6 bags of each set together in order, to make it easier to find resistors in the future. while it's not hard to find one bag out of 18, keeping them in order makes it trivial to organize the resistors.It's not great, but the cost is low, so it's hard to complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice little resistor kit","review":"Perfect if you need a small number (5 each) of a comprehensive range of resistor values from 1 to 1 million ohms. They come in a little slide-out cardboard box with separate compartments for different value ranges. Downsides: the yellow color bands are difficult to see over the background color, and the little zip-lock-style bags are thin, so the resistors sometimes poke through.Neat thing: 1/2-Watt is the smallest resistor size that you can write on if you'd like to label the resistance values with numbers. But it's difficult; you need super-steady hands and a smudge-proof permanent marker like a Sharpie, and no larger than 0.3mm, preferably less than 0.2mm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elenco Carbon Film Resisors: Very Ohm Complete!","review":"Found the list and Ohm range very complete and in the ~ 5% range with 1/2Wat only wasted energy in my expectations!

Paul Giamatti steals the show with his performance as a salesman who has had enough of the grind. The plot told from the point of view of Giamatti and Andre Braugher is a bit \\"off the beaten path\\", and their relationship is a strange one, but the acting is solid.

I couldn't really feel anything for any of the characters. this is probably because they jump arounnd between 3 different sets of characters and don't really give you an actual chance to get to know the characters and like them. but my biggest gripe about this movie is how UNREALISTIC the karaoke scenes are. NOBODY just walks into a karaoke bar and starts singing when there is a contest going on... especially when cash prizes are involved. Is more like: turn in your request and wait for another hour or two while all the contestants who showed up before you sing. In this movie, the characters just walk into the bar and the next second they are singing already... yeah right! I hate to nitpick, but be realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"booo!","review":"I thought it looked good because it was a Gwyneth Paltrow movie.

There was so much potential for the story line and comedy, but it appears somewhere along the line everyone just got lazy. The only worthy converse is between the father and daughter. Huey Lewis, Gwyneth Paltrow and Arnold McCuller's acting and talent were great, but everyone else really lacked. Especially Maria Bello's, which I was really surprised that she was cast to sing since she has no talent and her voice just made you want to turn off the volume. There is a ton of holes in the story line and talent with this one.

I was drawn to this film by the headline stars like Gwenneth Paltrow and Andre Braugher. Big mistake. The acting is sophmoric - I've seen high school plays that were executed better than this movie. The fault lies squarely in the lap of director Bruce Paltrow and the sorry script. The only professional performance in the movie is Paul Giamatti as a traveling salesman fed up with the rat race of being on the road, only to come home to a wife more interested in chatting on AOL than having a real conversation. I tried to like this film because I love Gwenneth Paltrow, but not even she could save this from being movie-making at its very worst. Even the songs in the movie version don't sound like what was played on the radio - different mixes. Should have never been released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?????","review":"Whoever decided to market this movie using basically only the one scene between Huey Lewis and Gwenyth Paltrow was a GENIUS.

Duets is the latter.Rarely does bad acting, directing, and screenwriting come together like this - in such perfect proportions to create a truly unwatchable stinker, a BOMB in the true Hollywood sense. I liked Paul Giammatti in other movies, but his character is such an annoying, whiny loser you wish Andre Braugher would just pull out his .45 and put him out of his (and the audience's) misery. But at least he's not as lifelessly dull as the other cardboard cutouts in this movie. I'd have rather seen a whole movie about the fat guy who sang \\"Copacabana\\".Who'd have thunk a movie could be so bad when it's about the high-stakes, exciting, and glamorous world of - karaoke?

That's a question that can reasonable by posed whn you listen to his greatest hits package. Is he the \\"long-haired, hippie-type pinko...\\" of the hilariously funny story song \\"Uneasy Rider\\"? Or is he the conformist jingoist of \\"South's Gonna Do It Again\\" and \\"In America\\"? I suspect the truth lies somehere in the middle.In his prime, Daniels was a decent talent capable of occasional greatness, as he shows on \\"Rider\\" and his biggest hit, \\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia.\\" Also, his far more empathetic \\"Still in Saigon,\\" puts Billy Joel's overblown \\"Goodnight Saigon\\" of the same early 80s time period to shame.Overall, an up-and-down collection with some soaring highlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless classic","review":"I remember hearing \\"The devil went down to Georgia\\" in my teens and vowed to buy this CD as part of my collection of classics from years gone by. I wasn't disappointed when my CD arrived either. I put it on straight away and much to my surprise (and happiness) my kids love it too and they're aged 22,20 and 15! This truly is a great collection of some of the best hits The Charlie Daniels Band released over the years.

They have a long range and great sound fidelity. If you are trying to save on your budget these are great, if money is not an option keep on looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"You get what you pay for. For $50, you have a receiver and 2 mics. Build was impressive, case looked sturdy, documentation was in English.Originally purchased to add a karaoke type singalong to a DJ setup for tailgate parties. For this I figured, if it broke no biggie. Well, that's what happened. When they worked, they were great, only problem is they lasted less than a year. All of a sudden one channel developed noise on the input and essentially rendered that one mic useless. So now its a single channel.Called Nady and they admitted that to fix it and with shipping would cost more than the unit is worth and to purchase a more expensive one next time. They never heard of the noise problem and wouldn't elaborate beyond that. So buyer beware, you get what you pay for. If you're going cheap with the intent of replacing it, you will sooner than later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mic function","review":"Mic sound quality okay. On/Off switch on one mic dies not work properly. You must switch it up and down several times to work. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to specs.","review":"While these mics did pick up sound and broadcast (most of) it back to the receiver, the overall quality was not good and certainly not what is advertised in the product specs. I got these for a wedding reception and had to switch over to wired mics halfway through the event due to frequent dropouts, interference and hissing, and very limited range (about 50' at best, even with fresh batteries and the receiver positioned in a clear overhead position in a large, open room)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what we use it for","review":"Delivery was actually really fast for this product. The product was as expected. I used it with my professional speakers and it was identical to our professional speakers except we paid a cheaper price for this product. If just looking for entertaining guests, this is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine didn't work","review":"Sometimes you take the risk of getting a defective product when you don't want to pay much, and that's what happened here. Simply put, the one I got does not work. I managed to get a little sound out of it when I turned up the volume on my speaker system to a maximum level and also turned up the volume to maximum on the included receiver unit. I checked this system with a few other speaker systems and got the same result. Just to make sure, I also had my friend look at it who records music for bands for a living. He told me it is screwed and I should send it back, however, I was stupid and threw away all the packaging. He also told me that this is what I should expect for the price, and that any decent wireless mic setup will cost three times as much just to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"clear voice, easy to use, light weight and seems the best option at $50 price range!","review":"clear voice, easy to use, light weight and seems the best option at $50 price range!

I'm a professional DJ and I've been using these Mic's for some time now and never had any problems with them (performance wise), THAT IS UNTIL one night my MC accidentally dropped the Mic and it shattered the metal wiring and broke the mic. Now I only have one to work with and I'm being super careful with that one.DO NOT DROP THESE MIC'S, THEY WILL BREAK THE FIRST TIME!

Im glad I didn't pay $50 dollars or I would have sent it back for my money back!!! Just a molded piece of empty plastic with no substance what so ever.

I used them for 2 gigs. First gig was OK as it was just me talking. 2nd gig was no good. One of the mics is dead and the range is only 15 to 20 feet. At about 10 feet they drop off and get static. I keep them in the box and take care of them. I used the 10 dollar durecell batteries and buy them before each gig. This was embarassing. I had a cerimony where the transmitter was no more than 15 feet from the reciver and the pastor doing the wedding was droppin out BAD! Only about 1/2 the cerimony worked. When the mic was used for the Vows the bride had zero reception and everything she said was NOT heard! Its deadly when you have a paid gig and things do not work! So i am going back to the good ol long mic cords. More stable. I may even invest in a real mic such as sure or EV. You get what you paid for.

I use these mics for my karaoke show, and the singers are pretty rough on equipment. The singers are never more than 30 ft or so away from the receiver, so I have no opinion yet on maximum distance they are effective to. If/when the singers break the mics, I'll buy another just like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nady DKW Wireless Mikes","review":"These are working very nicely.

This accounts for the variances in color, the Chinese characters on some phones, and the packaging being different from phone to phone. Usually these should include the Phone Tools, USB cord, charger and earpiece. I got my black V3r through a large online auction house ;) and it included a nifty black leather case. There is an active 'modding' community online that provides tutorials on updating the firmware on these, if you get one with Chinese characters but like the color and so on.

This album is my favorite, and while others may recommend \\"West Side Soul\\" over this, \\"Black Magic\\" seems to be his most steady and arranged material available. Magic Sam blends Chicago blues sound with a soul inspired voice that is both riviting and relaxing.

He only cut two albums before dying at 32, but West Side Soul is a definitive Chicago Blues album. This particular album has heart-felt deep blues feeling to it.

They give us an insight into the human mind and our hopes and dreams, and yes, maybe even into the afterlife. Sadly, though, this book seemed like it was merely mining a sensationalist bent, and didn't not come across as an honest telling of someone's experiences. The book was not very well written, and seems to read like an cartoonish retelling of something that amy have been on a daytime television show, although I'm not sure if that is the editor's fault or the author's.In all, I would advise that you money is best spent elsewhere, as, in all honesty, I felt that this author may simply be trying to cash in on people's willingness to trust someone with a story to tell about heaven. Sad, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was at times bizarre, disturbing, and ridiculous.","review":"I found this book to be bizarre. The stories that Brubacker relates are frankly very difficult to believe. Perhaps the most disturbing part of the story is the change that occurs in this man's life due to his heart attack. His life goes from being relatively normal to totally NDE and spiritially oriented, but spiritualality with a bizarre twist, including the so-called \\"red eye\\", which sounds more like a character from a poorly written episode of the \\"X-Files\\". But I did find myself thinking about this book a lot after I had read it.

I'm 19 and in a Roman Civ class right now, and this series has definitely helped me see the Roman Civilization in a much more interesting and fun light as well as help me to remember, at the very least, the names of all of these amazing men.Scholars read with caution, as even a lowly undergrad noted several inaccuracies....but everyone else, just enjoy the book and have a great time. It's impossible to put down. My only complaint is that Iggulden does not develop Caesar's character past the point of portraying him as an ambitious and strong individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smell The Blood? Gore? Hear The Screams? You Are Now In The Field Of Swords.","review":"\\"And one was written on the sword...for you must enter a room to DESTROY IT, DESTORY IT, DESTORY IT!\\" That was just a lyricfrom a song that relates to this novel here. For all interested, the song is called War? by System of a Down. Anyway, this book is much better than the other two books : The Gates of Rome and The Death of Kings. This book is about the experences of Casear when he went to Gaul and destroyed all the tribes there and named Gaul a part of Rome. The book has GREAT batlles and they occur quite often. The history is still altered but, I have learned to cast that aside and see a great battle aganist Ceasar and the tribes in Gaul. The book is so well-written that I felt that I was right there with Caesar, smelling the blood of my brothers and destroying my enemies with my short gladius. Aside from altered history, this book is a HUGE battle and is quite the tale to behold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glaring historical inaccuracies","review":"Although this book and the others in the series are supposedly historical novels, an author cannot play fast and loose with history. The author makes Caesar's mother mentally unstable as well as epileptic. He makes Brutus an orphan on the estate--except for the mother who abandoned him because she's a prostitute. Caesar gets to kill Mithradites--although Pompey really did. He has Marius killed by Pompey in a barricaded Rome! How could you believe any insight that Iggulden has into Caesar's character when he recreates historical fact?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visualize Roman Glory","review":"This book helps visualize Roman History & glory with so much fun and pace. Covers the entire life of Julius Ceasar & Marcus Brutus with such details (obviously fiction). When we visited Rome, we could so well relate to Forum, colosseum and other sights as I could visualize the scenes in my mind. I an now at this 3rd book of Conn Iggulden series and can't put it down. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found a new author...","review":"For me! Liked the book so much I ordered an extra copy for my Mom.Easy reading. Full of descriptions of Caribbean customs .

I am married to DeAnne Deane's former \\"boyfriend\\" in this book, and has a quite different account of what actually occurred after her partners suicide. Talk about rewriting history! It was his money that bailed her out and tried to clean up this mess for the next 7 years before he literally ran for his own emotional life (instead of kill himself like Wayne did). Her partner who shot himself (and was supposedly the victimizer) can't speak for himself to rebut DeAnne's allegations. Ms. Nelson needs to do a little better job of screening her interview subjects. In my opinion, Ms. Nelson's credibility has been seriously compromised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choice # 1","review":"I just purchased the Mag 77M and have used it only a few times, but it is the best saw I ever owned.

I was deluded. I want to start a photography business, and except for some very flimsy public relations information and a few general suggestions about business practices, it gave me nothing. Nada. As soon as it came today, I plowed into it looking for help. I don't need a lesson on lighting, thank you very much. I don't need to know that the author has a high end studio that I can't afford yet. I don't need to know that telephone manners are important. Not yet. I want to know how to get launched, how to set up accounts, what I need for permission forms, what copyright issues I'm facing, and there's only a meager dry crust of bread in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book does a good job a mentioning all aspects of a successful photography business, from great lighting, treating your clients, and marketing. I think anyone who applies the information in this book to their own photography business will only prosper from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its all about the little things!","review":"I read this book first day I've got it. Great material about how to start your own company and what is common mistakes. This book is not about how to create best portrait in the business, its about how to treat customer right and sell your work. Actually, only 50% of the pictures was great, the other half didn't like so much. Thats why I striped one star. This guy is better businessman than a photographer, so if you dream about starting your own photography business you have to read this book. It is very simple and straight to the point. But If you want to take a great pictures just for fun, you should pass. He gave very clear formula to the success only your job is to make it happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way above average","review":"Some of the O'Reily books really shine and this is one of them. I'm an experienced hardware engineer, but I still got some good tidbits out of this book which is all the more impressive when you consider it's written for a relative beginner. The author does a nice job with both the content and writing style.It covers many topics which are relatively common knowledge among experienced hardware designers but you rarely find in one book. Some of those topics I've never seen in ANY book. There's some good stuff here. That said, it's probably not the ideal book for someone who's already tackled a few successful embedded hardware designs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the absolute beginner","review":"This book has some good information for the absolute beginner.

Things become rather complicated when the two have a fallout as a result of one turning out to be an undercover cop and the other shooting him in the head. Luck has it though, that the two are far from seeing the last of each other...Though not a masterpiece, it is a funny film, guaranteed to provide more than a just a few laughs.Adam Sandler, Damon Wayans, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!The setting, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!Overall, Bulletproof is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though you might want to stop short of adding it to your collection, it will surely put you in a good mood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Funny.","review":"This is Sandler's only bad movie, as far as I'm concerned with the possible exception of Going Overboard (early unknown film). Number one the teaming of Wayans and Sandler did not work at all. You can also tell that Sandler's sense of humor did not have a lot of control in this. Sandler fans like myself will try anything once and this one was definitely a one timer. A tip for the SANDLER COLLECTION (3pack DVD including Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Bulletproof), dont get it, Bulletproof shouldnt be in the collection and was probably only put there to make it seem essential. Buy Happy and Billy, then buy Waterboy instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a couple problems...","review":"There were only two things I didn't like about this movie:1. The writing.2.

What a book!","review":"Is it time to move beyond what we learned in Sunday school and open our minds and hearts to a new way of seeing God and ourselves? According to the Bible, Jesus was one with God, and he told his followers that what he did we could do. Maybe it's time to take responsibility for how we live our lives and our ability to change our lives. This book lovingly provides a view of life beyond what we were taught. It supports that we are all equal in what and who we are. It describes a freedom and power that can make our lives a daily miracle. Maybe it's time to think for ourselves and be more than we ever thought possible. As with all great new age books, Story says take what resonates and leave the rest. There is no requirement that you change what you think or believe.

I plodded through it because I REALLY wanted to review this book and in good conscience could not do so without finishing it. I have read dozens of mountaineering books and this is the worst of them all.Whatever Mr Roper attempted to do, he managed one thing well: every single one of the characters in the book appears to be either self serving or an irresponsible airhead. Even Devi Unsoeld is not spared. The main subject of the book himself, Willi Unsoeld, comes across as an annoying, pigheaded, irresponsible leader who does not lead. The whole book reads as a mean-spirited, gossipy, tabloid trash talk. Almost every page includes some snide or mean remark on someone. Mr Roper even manages to make digs at Galen Rowell in a tangent unrelated to the book. His main preoccupation seems to be to do a job on John Roskelley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the editor, edit","review":"This book was good when it stuck to the story of climbing the mountain. Roper goes off the story so often it is distracting. If he would have stayed away from philosophy, current events, past events, psychology, etc.... he could have shortened his book by at least one hundred pages. Stay with the story!! It may be a shorter read but a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Mountaineer","review":"I do not recommend this book because I knew Willi Unsoeld, and this book does not talk about the man I knew. Willi was my teacher in the classroom and in the mountains and I spent many hours with him. The author does not capture the spirit or the vitality of Willi Unsoeld and actually wrote this book against the wishes of Willi's family. Even the title of this book is offensive to people who knew Willi because it is so far from the man who really existed. The author includes many assumptions and speculations about Willi that are far off the mark. I would love a book that explored Willi's life and his remarkable accomplishments, but this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I <3 The Matches","review":"I've been going to their shows listening to thier music for over a year now, they are full of energy and always fun to be around.

I am deeply in love with it. Forget VDKTL which don't get me wrong is a great album and one of my favorites, but decomposer is a completely different piece of work. You will realize this right from the first couple notes of Salty Eyes. It was apparent from VDKTL that The Matches were trying to create something unique. With Decomposer they have succeeded in creating something special and unique. It's hard but soft, electrifying but smooth. The album definitely flows great. It's predictable yet extremely unpredictable. I really don't think there is anything to compare it to. If you are a fan of music and have been hoping that someone would finally go beyond the norm and experiment a little bit, this album was made especially for you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"goodbye e Von Dahl, hello Creativity!","review":"The Matches are one of my favorite bands of all time, starting with this album, not e Von Dahl, and I have known of them back when they were a local band called \\"The Locals.\\"This album is a perfect bridge from their debut album to A Band in Hope. Although it still can be considered pop/punk or alternative, they create their own sound that is comparable to no one. Not quite psychedelic, but not punk, Shawn Harris best coined it as \\"Schizophrenic.\\"As amazing as A Band in Hope is (very diverse, filled with half experimental half pop/punk), I wish that they had stuck with more of a complete experimental sound that they did in Decomposer.This is definitely one of the most original modern bands out there right now, and I wish that they would receive the credit that they deserve, as opposed to the repetitive, 4-chord wannabe punk that has clouded our airwaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece of art!","review":"That's right.

Von Dahl Killed the Locals. The first cd was great it was fast, catchy, it was punk. They lost their touch with this one. If your as much into punk rock as I am I dont suggest buying this CD. They used a lot more keyboards and synthesizers and the tempo got a lot slower. It sounds more like electronica rock rather than punk. I dont know what to say, I thought the new CD was gonna be amazing, but its not. Definantly not the same old Matches from the first CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and original CD","review":"This cd is amazing. With sounds that range from techno beats (Drive) to orchestral lead-ins (Salty Eyes) The Matches have truly created a diverse unique and all around great sounding record. Intricate layers of sound are put into every song so that every time you listen, something new jumps out at you.

In addition to that they also include a live taping of Haunted.The differences between the original and the band versions of this song are very minute. Basically, in the band version the guitars and drums kick in right before the last chorus and only stick around for approximately 30 seconds. And considering that this is such a soft song, the live version isn't much different from the original either. However, the live version of Huanted was pretty good. But I wouldn't say that it makes this CD worth it's price.If you already own Fallen, then this might not be the Evanescence CD-single for you. You might want to check out their Going Under Import CD-single. That one has a great Nirvana cover of Heart Shaped Box and is, in my opinion, worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"y didnt they....","review":"If u have fallen, u would notice that my immortal on the cd is different to the one they recently brought out.

It's not merely a song that's not good. It's horrific. It not only fails to add to, but also takes away from one's listening experience. The singing is extremely annoying, and the piano part is not bad, just simple- Mozart could write it in his sleep. All these things considered, I could still write this song off as another stupid, annoying ditty by another one of today's unoriginal, untalented artists. But then they add in electric guitar and drums, for about thirty seconds, probably to make their moron fans think, \\"Oh wow! What brilliance!

I was really anticipating the release of this album, and paid $18 to get it the day it came out, only to be incredibly disappointed. I really have to wonder if Layzie and Bizzy even know that they released a new Bone Brothers CD? The entire disc is composed of recycled lyrics from Midwest Cowboy and Thug Brothers... I don't think there are any new verses at all. I will say I liked most of the beats though, but that's about it. Normally I can put in a Bone CD and just let it play through, I tried to listen to this disc twice and gave up... The first Bone Brothers album was WAY better. I can't believe they let this crap get released..... this is going to be added to my CD rack just to help complete my collection but will otherwise just be collecting dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recorded together","review":"This CD is not recorded in the studio together. Rather Bizzy Bone and Layzie Bone acapellas are taken off of other CD's and put over new beats. This per say is a remixed album of Thug Brothers Vs Midwest Cowboy. As other reviewers say the beats are no where near the quality of the originals. Not to mention the verses have no theme on tracks as it can be noted that there is no chemistry flow and have awkward feelings. For a bone duo check out thug brothers instead of this disc.

Bone Brothers 2 gets 1 star only because the lyrics are still better than 90% of most rappers out there(excluding Layzie's versus, they were sub par). All of the lyrics were cut and pasted from previous albums(very badly)into new beats . This album is garbage and I would not advise anyone to buy it.

I highly recommend this book for Policy Planners and those interested in histography, volunteerism, and Asian American Studies. Especially potent for those compelled in the circuitous rational, that ground conflict establishes a venerated democratic value system. The reader is left to speculate as to why entrenched corrupt civil war settings consistently prompt this \\"Christo-American\\" reaction.Dockery's voice is original, masterful, and commanding.

This film is just inspired lunacy from beginning to end, and it never lets up, continuing to ratchet up the ridiculousness quotient. And far from being dumb, this movie really creatively mines the comic potential in what is a pretty arcane, literary topic: seafaring and the legends and camaraderie of sailors. In so doing, it creates one classic set-piece after another, from the giant, fat-assed flying cupcake to \\"these pipes are clean!\\" The only comedy film I've seen in the past decade that's this hilariously insane came from Korea: it's called Dasepo Naughty Girls and hasn't even been released on DVD in the US.

But this thing (insert head shake thingy) is so monumentally bad I'm actually at a loss for words. The blue chick with 6 arms and her giant husband that just opened a \\"housewares\\" store on a remote deserted island was pretty creative. OK, seeing Chris Elliot riding on the back of his girlfriend swimming across the Pacific with a ski rope to hold on to was pretty funny but that was about it.Now, if you find yourself all that curious about this flick the DVD transfer is pretty good and the sound is about what you would expect...but who cares? 2 wigs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure trash","review":"Take this movie and burn it with the kitchen trash.It is absolutely stupid!

Overwritten, implausible and far too beholden to Proust (a model the author freely acknowledges) I found it's only achievement was Makine's attempt to describe being an outsider in two worlds and a member of none. He strives far too hard for literary effect and the effort shows (why use one appropriate adjective when ten will do?). It seems clear to me the critics who reviewed this book were starved for any gesture toward writing serious literature and this resulted in overpraising a modest effort (for another example, see \\"Cold Mountain\\"). The novel was hated almost unanimously by my reading group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately a disappointment.","review":"Haunting and beautiful in fits and starts, \\"Dreams\\" is ultimately a disappointment. Makine's keen insights, refined sensibilities, and sense of time and place are largely wasted on a narrator who remains a callow, self-absorbed youth as he advances chronologically into young manhood and early middle age. His relationship with Charlotte, which constitutes the focus of the book, is particularly vacuous: Charlotte is the only one who talks, and the narrator, as far as we can tell, the only one who thinks. Makine seems self-indulgent; he's presenting raw material that should have been shaped into a final product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depth of memory and connection","review":"This novel is unque in placing me into the transparent and transcental dimension of memory. It let me feel the power of reflectoin and voices from the distant past or other worlds. This novel doesn't have to be compared to Proust's masterpiece. The stream of narration and the language (I am reading an English translation) is almost mesmerizing, sending the reader off this world. I would place this as one of the best literary work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Embracing Heritage","review":"This is a fantastic journey by a young boy who has a vivid imagination which is inspired by his grandmother. Through her he is able to piece together and embrace his rich heritage. Although the book is a novel, it reads as if it is a person's memoirs.The book is richly poetic. It reads like a dream. The author has an uncanny knack of drawing the reader into the lives of ordinary people as well as into the lives of historical figures including the Tsar of Russia. It combines a past drawn from many cultures. This is all part of the heritage of the boy.It is a beautifully written coming-of-age story. It is captivating and inspiring. Since it contains a message of hope, I especially embraced the book since I am the author of a spiritually-themed novel. This is writing at its best.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Imitations","review":"I bought this CD shortly after the 9-11-01 tragedy and promptly returned it. Why? This album contains cheap arrangements of famous marches in which too many liberties are taken. Many of the marches begin with the second stanza instead of the beginning the way the composers had written them. Your ear immediately knows that something is wrong. I also found the arrangements to poke fun at the marches, which is annoying rather than patriotic. To make matters worse, the orchestral playing is third rate. The sound stinks too. These simply are not the genuine article. With so may great march albums available, pass this one up. Instead, try any of the Marine Band recordings that are available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living on Higher Ground","review":"\\"Living on Higher Ground\\" is a moving story of one man's personal journey through life and his burning desire to rise above his humble beginnings to obtain a better life for himself.

This book is a testament to the fact that each of us is the architect of our own life and the master of our destiny."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those aspiring to achieve greatness","review":"Paul Vann is a true hero for those aspiring to achieve greatness. Through the use of personal stories, both triumphs and tragedies, Paul Vann demonstrates with passion, motivation, and joy how to obtain one's goals in life. From being raised in poverty to retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel, Paul Vann suffered setbacks, but by focusing on his goals, and with divine intervention, he has obtained and is living his dreams. The book is divided into 13 important and distinct periods in his life. At the end of each Chapter, Paul Vann asks the reader to reach into his or her heart and write down what's important -- to create an Action Plan. Each Action Plan serves as a guideline, a plan to review periodically, a goal to achieve. By following your own Action Plan, you too can achieve greatness, whatever greatness means to you -- Paul Vann has confidence in you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orrin Port Rockwell: Man of God Son of Thunder","review":"Great book if you want to look beneath what Porter Rockwell was belived to be. The name that comes to mind when reading about him is that he was an avenging angel but not a good one. The book is a great read and I wanted to have in my Library.

Rockwell wrote his autobiography after the death of Brigham Young and although it is very hard to find a copy I got to read it at the R.L.D.S. archieves in Independence, Mo. According to Rockwell he had it published himself to try to set the record straight. Funny though, he makes himself out to be a cold-blooded killer who worked exclusively for B.Y. after the death of Joseph Smith Jr. There apparently were no ghost writers available to Rockwell as is evident by the word usage and the very straight foreword though disjointed way he tells his story. Quirky things are included like his saying that he never tried to assassinate Mo. Governor Boggs since the attempt failed and that Joseph Smith Jr. told him that he could not be killed if he never cut his hair, in an emulation of Samson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...","review":"Well done history of a controversial figure.

A few months ago I watched that b&w Hollywood Brigham Young movie and there was Orrin P Rockwell leading the Saints into the Zion of the hour. This book told me just about everything available about this strange figure in history, in a reasonably good, if decidedly Pro-Rockwell narrative. Schindler presents Rockwell as a Saint rather than a drunken fanatical assassin at every oppotunity when the historical records seem a bit cloudy; fortunately, however, the author has put in some wonderful footnotes which often contradict or illuminate Schindler's assessments. The reader is indeed given all the evidence and can either side with Schindler or form his own judgement about all those apocryphal murders and the secret combinations of the Danites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...stick with metal!!","review":"I had heard alot of rave reviews for silicone muffin pans & thought this was a great idea.

The film has been overlooked and should be made more well-known.The special features are a theatrical trailer, an interview with Bernard Tavernier and scenes a documentary featuring Clouzot.There are two newspaper articles in liner notes about the controversy surrounding the film as well as the essay about the film.I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleary's Moonburn is brilliant, unique and Clearly inspiring","review":"If you are into New Orleans Rhythm and Blues with a so sweet funky beat (done just right), then you need this CD.

My son proudly rides it in the neighborhood with older kids, so this has given him another way to keep up with the crowd. So far it has held up well. Only time will tell. Definitely worth the enjoyment for son and parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assembly nightmare","review":"I bought this big wheel for my 4 year old. It is ridiculously tidious and time consuming to build. After i opened the box and i had started putting the bike together i realized a part was missing and had to take it back and exchange it for a new one. After trying for over an hour I gave up and will be returning it back to Costco. Holes on plastic do not match up with screws. Pull lever rubs against the back tire. Front wheel parts falls apart. And can you please come up with something more common sense than cap nuts? Its a pain to remove these things if need to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off alert!","review":"be warned! You will NOT receive the big wheel modeled in this image! The model you will receive will be a later, cheaper model. Of course they do not bother to tell you that until you call to complain. Another Amazon rip-off. You'd be better off on Craigs List... At least there you expect to get mugged........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Part","review":"Ordered the Big Wheel for my son for Christmas. The box was missing the front metal axle. I have tried to get the part sent to me but no one responds to my email. So I currently have a Big Wheel that I can not put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the old Big Wheel","review":"My grandparents had one of these 40 years ago that lasted through 24 grandkids. I bought one of these and it lasted two months with a three-year old. The replacement part and shipping were going to be half the price of the bike. Piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it is suppose to be.","review":"My son got this for his birthday in April... Being that it is only July, you would think that it would still work. However, the stickers are all pealing, the pedals do not move and the bike is just over all too hard for my 4 year old to use. So sad since we was so excited to get it. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Washer for pedal assembly","review":"See the picture of the washers in the \\"Customer Images\\" link to see what the washers look like.The major problem I had was assembling the pedals.Washers for the pedal assembly: There are two designs (see the photo in the Customer Images).The one on the left came shipped with the big wheel. The one on the right I ordered from http://www.gamma2.net/new/OBW-parts.html . The one on the left was super-difficult to install and the pedals didn't spin freely. The one on the right isntalled easily and the pedal spins properly. There is a noticalbe difference in design of the two washers and it affects the installation as well as the performance of the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy, Unbelievably High Price","review":"Our son has had a blast on Big Wheels - he rides them for miles and has now worn out three of the front wheels. Even so, they still qualify as quite durable. The fit and finish look somewhat cheap, but for the typical price it's a good value.The important issue for this review is the price posted; it's about double the price at one of the large discount stores. If you're paying more than $35.00, you're paying too much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Your Time Assembling...ITS WORTH IT!","review":"What a treat! I received this yesterday and my 3 year old son is IN LOVE. So's his dad! After reading many favorable reviews, I purchased this and boy am I glad. We rode for almost 2 hours last night! Well, my son rode and I RAN to keep up. He FLIES on that thing. Not scary though, because the kids sit so close to the ground. Not necessarily a \\"tipping\\" toy... But folks, a word of advice - TAKE YOUR TIME PUTTING IT TOGETHER. It is not as sturdy as the original and there is definitely room for error. So, follow the instructions carefully and you will be very happy you did! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollow tire","review":"First off, let me say this bike is cool; just as fun as when I was growing up with my siblings. We bought this for my son who is 5 and he just loves it; he enjoys it and uses it everyday. However...Just as when I was a kid and would zoom around on this bike, eventually the tire would wear down and not function as well. It's hollow. One would think that after all these years, technology would prevail and an improved front wheel would be placed on it. We bought this in July; only had it for 2 months and the wheel isn't round anymore. I called the company, Alpine, but they are no longer around. There is another company listed on the Princess big wheel we got for our daughter, that company, too, is defunct. I called Target who said they would replace it for free, but alas and alak, they are unable to obtain one. I found a few sites I will check out, but this is ridiculous. The fun didn't last very long. I gave the toy 4 stars overall, if only they would improve the wheel's quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"i don't know why i loved this movie so much","review":"i saw it on ifc the other night and the only reason i watched it was because tunde adibimpe, the lead singer of my favorite band tv on the radio, is in it. it was pretty much a \\"chick flick\\" and it was kinda slow at parts, but it made me feel really happy after watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"jump tomorrow","review":"A badly shot, uninventive and plotless 'film' with a slew of dull characters played by overacting non-actors.

I almost bought it myself, but thought, no, I should leave the family something easy and obvious to get for me.Now this movie is a collector's item, with prices skyrocketing! I'm not sure even I would pay $70 or more for any one movie, even this one. That said, it's a fine film, with Earnest in great form. You will never forget the sight of him riding the canon downhill. I don't even find that particularly funny--but it's the one scene that sticks in my mind even now, all these years later.Earnest, come back! We need you now more than ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, it's minus five stars","review":"I sat through this horrible piece of garbage in the theater, sitting beside my four year old son who didn't know any better. There's no plot to speak of, no script worth remarking, but only Ernest and companions seemingly ad libbing (badly) their way through the landscape with a giant cannon.I was a fan of the earlier Ernest movies, liked the impossibly dopey humor, but this isn't just the bottom of the Ernest barrel, it's actually a deep pit beneath the barrel, close to the core of the earth, where terrible creatures lurk.If you must buy this awful thing, do not watch it with the children. They don't want to see what's inside your stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"The flatware set is very nicely finished, and comes with a sturdy wooden caddy. The quality is excellent. $40 plus free shipping - Great deal!!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice set of flatware","review":"This is a very nice set of flatware with outstanding Oneida quality.Not one of those sheapy sets you can find in Ross or Marshalls.All items are heavy, sturdy and shiny. The knife handles are very well ballanced.I was surprised it is NOT made in China. My set is made in Vietnam.It comes in a vey nice box and I would be proud to present a set this quality as a gift (If I had an additional one).I will definately keep mine. Go for it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly, looks like discount special","review":"This set was so ugly that I can't believe Oneida has its name on it. I am returning this immediately. I am completely disappointed. The pattern does not look elegant like in the picture; instead it looks stamped on and consequently very cheap. I've purchased Oneida before and found its flatware beautiful. I don't know what happened here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not as expected.","review":"I have a set of Oneida that I purchased over 30 years ago. It was the cheapest Oneida at the time. It was discontinued, so I was looking for something to supplement what I have. This is no comparison. The back is unfinished, it is much thinner and the polishing is missing in places. I will keep it for the price but it is not the same quality as what I have at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Place forks are HUGE! Doesn't match the place spoons...","review":"I bought two because it wasn't a bad deal at $39.99 each I will have to return them as the place forks are way too big...They are the length of the knives. it is the salad forks that match the size of place spoons. And then the teaspoons are iddy biddy besides all the others. The pictured setting is not accurate. Such as odd looking setting with the \\"pitchforks\\" standing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better bargain than you'd expect for the money","review":"I must admit, I was nervous about the design, from the descriptions listed before me. Let me assure you, for the price of under $50.00, this service for 12 is incredible. You get the quality of Oneida flatware: Heavy, smooth & pleasing design for very little money. I got mine for a little over 75 cents per piece! It's great for everyday use. The floral/scroll design is not overpowering. The larger picture provided is fairly good (the dinner fork handle pic is inaccurate.) Before I got the set, I was searching everywhere for a good close-up picture. The design is softer than say, the Oneida Dover design. These are drawbacks not described: There are no extra pieces available, i.e., servall(pie), casserole spoon, cheese knife, steak knives, jelly, tongs, carving knife, cake knife, fruit forks, etc. My particular seller (not Amazon) would NOT answer my emails. Don't let this deter you! I am extremely HAPPY with this lovely flatware..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I ordered this set because I have had other Oneida flatware that was very good quality and this was a really good price. The first set I received had 11 forks and 13 knives. The knives were beautiful, but the design quality on most of the other pieces was not very good. I returned the set for replacement. The new set had the correct number of pieces, but the design quality on the handles still isn't very good on a lot of the pieces; some of them don't look like flowers and some are almost smooth with no design at all. I kept the second set because I figured it wasn't going to get any better sending back for another one, but I am really disappointed and probably won't buy Oneida again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Cow","review":"Holy Cow.

Will Smith has become a critically acclaimed actor in this film (and also Seven Pounds).The blu-ray picture is sharp and shows really fine details. Audio is pretty darn good for a drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important and very powerful film","review":"If you are looking for a pretentious art film, this is not.

It is all about him getting in the 'door' not about how he struggled. I, along with others, have worked hard and gotten no where, because we don't get invited to the game, we are smarter than our managers but since we don't go out drinking with them we get pushed aside doing clerical work.Therefore I am not impressed with this story any more than \\"wow someone made it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony DVDs not working","review":"Tried to watch this movie the other day.

Don't watch this!!!","review":"OK I suffer from deppression. I kept watching hoping it would get better and it only got worse. I watch movies for entertainment not to end up at the bottom of the world. I am so surprised there are so many good reviews. The only time it ever got better was thirty seconds before it ended. So if movies tend to have this result...don't watch it. A few of my friends came to me with the same thoughts about it that i had. So don't rent this for a pregnant woman, recently pregnant, or someone with depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capitalist Propaganda","review":"There are only a few movies that I find so detestible that I can't finish watching. This was one of those. I hated the message that anyone has a chance to succeed in this society if he works hard enough. That message is an afront to everyone who doesn't make it, who is poor and remains poor. In the first place, nobody should have to go through what the hero of Pursuit went through. What are we doing? Creating a system in which one exceptional person \\"makes it\\" while the rest are just sludge to be plowed back under? The irony of this is that the real person this \\"true story\\" is based on had affirmative action going for him. But that wouldn't fit the message of this film that anyone who tries hard enough can succeed. A more honest treatment of this guy's true story would show the role of government intervention in giving people a foot-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with it - slow","review":"This movie was soooo slow..

Boring and contrived, I couldnt even finish this load of junk. Stick to the bad boys franchise will, its your bread and butter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have ever seen!!","review":"Are they kidding? This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. This fool violates the first rule of investing, by spending his life savings on those machines that he then has trouble selling. Then his dream to transform his life: to be a stock broker. Give me a break. How bourgeois. And once he was a success, no mention is made about what he did with that money to say...help the homeless since he was one for sometime.And all the Thomas Jefferson quotes, what does a slave-owning aristocrat really know about freedom?The American dream in this movie is one of the false values this society actively promotes. Don't fall for it!Save your money and watch something with some value, like I Love Huckabees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie!","review":"This movie is great for those who have a lot of life experience under their belt. As a single parent, I particularly identified with the father (Will Smith) in this movie, but I know I wouldn't have \\"got it\\" and felt the emotions it evoked as deeply when I was a teenager or any time before I had kids.

The story is excellent and based on a true story. But it ends too quick. They needed to show Chris Gardner getting rich.Wil Smith and his son were great in this movie. The guys at Dean Witter were all very believable. The guy who played the nut who thought Gardner had a time machine was good.The Pursuit of Happyness is good for renting and watching once or twice. Personal development enthuisists should definitly watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this film...","review":"Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, but the script is not up to the challenge. My expectation was to see an uplifting film about a man beating the odds. Mostly what I got was the undeniable awful side of society. I realize it is based on a real person's life, but half way through the film, I got the feeling the person did not know that there is a safety net call welfare, and that my uplifting movie turned out to be for the most part, a long squeamish downer.I bought the DVD - This one is not a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This a great movie.

One scene is especially fond when a subway platform and an imaginary \\"timing-machine\\" generate a positive outlook to allay their predicament.

The only thing I wish it included is more of the portion of Chris Gardeners life as a millionaire. I think the director (from italy) was right: we Americans don't know how lucky we are to live here.

It remains us that no matter how bad things seems, you should never give up on your dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Pursuit","review":"Based upon the true story of Chris Gardner (with the inevitable sprinkling of dramatic license elements), Will Smith and his real-life son steal your heart. This is not your typical Hollywood telling in which the main character starts out strong, takes a little dip, then easily succeeds. Instead, Will Smith's character takes dip after dip after dip until your exhausted watching him failing again and again. Yet . . . you root for him again and again and again.Smith shows that he is so much more than simply a comic actor. He is a four-star actor in this four-star film. If you want to be challenged to never, ever give up hope, then watch the Pursuit of Happyness.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction , Soul Physicians, and Spiritual Friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pusuit of Happyness","review":"I think Will Smith and his son did and excellent job of portaying the main people in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"it doesn't work","review":"I really wanted to watch this movie and have in my collection but it doesn't work.

There are many great scenes that Smith turns in, but one of the most gripping is when he tries to find a make-shift bedroom in a subway. Heartbreaking.Overall a great movie which shows how Will Smith can turn in solid performances in non-action/non-comedy roles and is all the more compelling since the movie is based on a true story.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I really enjoyed \\"The Pursuit of Happynes\\". I thought that it was a good movie, that was very simple to enjoy. It is about a man who, against all odds, makes a name for himself in the world. It was one of those movies that is just plain frustrating. Things just continued to go from bad to worse. All the while, the acting was extremely convincing. There is not much to say about this great movie, so I will keep this review short. I think that everyone can get something out of this movie. You will not regret watching this movie, several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Evil of Wall Street","review":"Will Smith in his finest performance since ALi in 2000, gives the good side of how stock brokers get rich the hard way. The movie reflects how realistic and how hard it is to achieve success even through the hardest times. Before this movie, there was Wall Street in 1987 having Michael Douglas as the evil Gordon Gekko, power hungry stock broker who uses insider trading to make himself richer but yet Douglas won the Oscar@ for playing this guy and Will Smith lost his Oscar to Forest Whitaker as the evil Idi Amin in \\"The Last King of Scotland.\\" Even though the movie reflects on a father who was homeless and does everything he could to care for his son in the end he achieved something that could be hopeless for anyone in his position a better life. Smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable and Life-shaping","review":"Based on the true story of entrepreneur/millionaire Chris Gardner, the movie follows the struggles of a homeless single father trying to raise his son in 1980's San Francisco, while pursuing the grand dream of becoming a stockbroker. The story evokes tears of sadness and tears of joy, as it takes the viewer through a real daily struggle not uncommon to so many in the world around us. A rags-to-riches story, yes, but even more a story of determination and hard work and a story of human potential.Will Smith performs his best role ever as Chris Gardner, and his real life son Jaden plays the younger Christopher. Their chemistry is inspiring, as is the rest of the film.This 2006 movie is rated PG-13 with good reason, however, and I don't recommend it as a \\"family film,\\" as it has some brief language, and the subject matter is too intense for children.

This Blu Ray version is terrible. It looks like it is in 480 plus it is grainy. This disc is just like the Click Blu Ray version. What is up with Sony pictures? Their blu ray discs look terrible. I did once talk to a sales rep at the Sony store and he told me that Sony Blu Ray producted discs would play through component and not only through HDMI. I guess the reason why is that their discs are not in 1080. Don't get the blu ray version, stick to standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"WILL SMITH, GENIUS","review":"From Six Degrees of Seperation,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Ali, and now this. Pursuit of Happyness is wonderful, and it makes you want to fulfill all of your dreams. Whether it is possible or not, it at least gives you the fight to want to reach for your dreams. Very Inspirational, and a powerful performance by both Father and son.

Life is not always a happy ending, but if you don't even give yourself that chance, life certainly won't either. But when it is a happy ending, the meaningless world suddenly becomes meaningful.

Will Smith's performance is excellent. The film is well done, drew me in and held my interest to the end.Chris' struggle is as real as it gets. His perseverance and fortitude in spite of grueling life trials, is inspiring. It's also a testament to the power of a child's love and trust and the importance of keeping family together.I HIGHLY recommend this film, and for family viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO MUCH TRAGEDY, NOT ENOUGH HAPPI(Y)NESS","review":"OK movie with very good performances by Smith and his son. The scene with both of them sleeping in the subway's restroom is more than enough to have made Smith Oscar-nomination worthy.

After returning it and getting a new version, the same problem happened. The same thing happened with the copy of \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" I got.

The author identifies specific behaviors that comprise micromanagement, such as dominance and control over time and how tasks are carried out; imposition of the will by the raw use of power or authority; excessive, unnecessary requirements for approval of tasks or decisions; intense monitoring; a refusal to delegate and/or accept collaboration; and excessive, unnecessary and redundant reporting requirements.

Even a light coating of vaseline would have done the trick, they didn't even have the budget for that?I guess if it was 3-D then it didn't matter. But it certainly left me unfulfilled.

I have sampled the shutter-glass TV technology, and the various 3D available in the movie theaters. The blu-ray format for Journey uses a red/green anaglyph rather than the more common red/blue. This may be a matter of taste. The concept of 3D is used best used to draw the viewer into the action. This was done well in the movie \\"Spy Kids 3D\\".

The result is much worse than even an experimental 3D-TV series of broadcasts some years ago...I fully agree with the reviewer who proposed that a higher-priced but better-realised package would have been much preferable; maybe even a CRT-screen implementation for those (like me) who still prefer a good CRT over a run-of-the-mill LCD screen.Do not buy this item.

I watched this thing on a plane and even with the crappy audio, I could always figure out what was coming next. From the initially disaffected kid to the purdy icelandic \\"guide\\", the screenplay writers didn't so much write a script as they did a bunch of set-up and payoff lines with really lame jokes. And they even provided a rollercoaster ride a' la the Indy Jones movie. And if one carnival ride is worth doing, its worth over-doing with two more.Still, it provided an hour and a half of mindless entertainment which was successful at passing the time.

If you're a fan of the 1950's style red-green type of so-called \\"3d\\" films..you'll like it. But it's unwatchable - as was the case in the 1950s, so is the case with this dvd - the colors are completely messed up in the \\"3d\\" version, and the only watchable version is the 2d version...a sad disappointment, considering we were waiting with money in hand for this DVD release.

But for computer artist, it comes with one thing you could normally expect. A paycheck. And so, with a few months left on the project and a promise of a paycheck when the work was completed, scores of 3D artists toiled, sometimes 80 hours a week to get this movie done. Their ultimate reward? The studio shutting down and the people who financed this movie refused to pay the artists their earned wages.Frankly, I don't know if this movie is good or bad but one thing is for certain, the hard working artists who contributed to this film have gone without payment for over a year. For this reason, the movie is a failure. You CANNOT create an effects driven movie and then refuse to pay the artists responsible. Even Brendon Frasier joined the artists cause to no avail.

It lacked energy and there was no where near enough action for an \\"adventure\\" movie. There would be a short sequence of potential excitement, and then... nothing. The acting: Ho Hum!!

I saw this in 2D, but lots of coming-at-you scenes must have worked beautifully in 3D projection.The bad: pretty much everything else. The story's logic faltered in just too many places. And, for a movie about a scientist, they got way too much of the science horribly wrong. Magnesium never occurs in metallic form in nature because it's so reactive, birds didn't exist 150 million years ago, and, well, lots more. And, despite his best effort to shake it off, Fraser'sGeorge of the Jungleseems to stand behind every attempt at a dramatic scene.

If I were rating the 2D quality of this movie, I would give it 2 or 2 1/2 STARS.

It'll also make a great father's day gift since my dad really likes Patrick Stewart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have no doubts -- it's as good as they say!","review":"My first online \\"review\\" is offered primarily for those who might be having doubts about the quality of \\"Return to the Centre of the Earth\\". I know that I was curious to see if Rick Wakemen could pull off what seemed such an obvious \\"stunt\\" (i.e., a sequel to his most successful album), so it was especially pleasing to see that he has done that and more. I've purchased some import CDs of Wakeman's works over the past decade, and none of them prepared me for \\"Return.\\" It's not perfect -- Wakeman is *not* the best lyricist and the Dolby Surround encoding adds nothing to the experience -- but it's WELL worth the purchase. I haven't stopped listening to \\"Return\\" since picking it up at an import store last month (before I knew it was scheduled for a U.S. release)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Journey!","review":"Some will disagree, but this \\"Return to the Centre of the Earth\\" I believe is technically better than the first. The recording is crisp and clear, the narration by Stewart is flawless, the songs are very melodic and catchy. Rick doesn't overwelm the entire CD, but he does let loose when appropriate. I have really enjoyed listening to Rick's recent creation. He has also written a sequel that would make Jules Verne proud. It stays faithful to the classic. This is a great CD to introduce those not familiar with Rick's work, and it is a must have for all Wakeman and YES fans. (Would be great to see this concept album on a world tour with all the guest performers.) Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick is THE MAN if you have imagination","review":"In the same vein as many of his \\"visual music\\" epics. You need to open your mind to appreciate it. Understand endevours such as these may sound hokey at times but if you have a good imagination you should enjoy this work. Patrick Stewart as the narrator was an incredible choice, his voice is right for the part. Songs featuring Trevor Rabin & Justin Hayward are the best on the CD. Ozzy is great but his wonderful vocals are shadowed by a corny choir. That is my main complaint about the CD. Too much choir in places where it need not be! Get an arranger to help, it stifles all the talent on the album. However the orchestration is great.I just wish the CD showcased more of Rick's amazing talent. If you enjoy Rick or YES give it a listen. Contrary to most of the modern no talent artists around today, Rick & all the prog rockers still have something musically original to say. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had really high hopes for this album, but I guess those positive reviews I read were from true fanatics. I found the music repetitive and uninspired. Wakeman is at his best in a group setting (his work with Yes is truly brilliant) but this release in no way recalls the great moments of the original Journey. Not even Patrick Stewart can save this album.

Just like the song \\"The dance of a thousand lights\\"which a had the chance to hear life in his solo tour,which brought a standing ovation in West Palm Beach,South Florida.This is a Masterpiece that is part of the best of the best. Buy It."},{"rating":"1","title":"Except for the title, does not compare to the original.","review":"A really boring CD - Rick needs to be less prolific and more thoughtful in his efforts - in my opinion most of his recordings beyond Criminal Record, e.g., White Rock II, Time Machine, 1984, The Real Lisztomania, etc. are not worth the price of the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Ozzy Tune...Otherwise Skip This One","review":"I'm not familiar with much of Rick Wakeman's work, nor have I heard the original Journey To The Center Of The Earth CD, but this album is just not that interesting. The story, voiced byPatrick Stewart, fails to spark any excitement, and with the exception of Ozzy Osbourne's Buried Alive, the music just kinda lays there. I love the music of YES, but I would guess a person should start with other Rick Wakeman releases instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Symphonic Progressive","review":"Wow, hold on a minute why I pick my jaw off of the floor. I am a fan of all of Rick's epics and believe that is he is a true genius. But I never thought he could out do the origional Journey. But was I wrong, he truly gives a true meaning to progressive symphonic rock. Each track flows perfectly into the next and Patrick Stewert and Ozzy are welcome additions only adding to the awe and splender this album possesses. The Dolby Digtial aspects give the recording a crisp clean feel, I'm happy I have the right audio to really enjoy this recording. Any fan of Yes should have a copy in there collection. Bravo!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited Value","review":"This volume exhibits all of the weaknesses of the early period of the Anchor Bible Commentary. The primary contribution is the author's translation and the textual notes, while exegesis of the text is sparse. Once Myers establishes what the text is, he seems to have little concern for what it means. All of this is quite similar to the volumes on Chronicles in the Anchor Bible series. In addition, now that this commentatry is 35 years old, many of the literary and historical assumptions which undergird it are dated. The commentaries on Ezra and Nehemiah by Williamson and Blenkinsopp are not only newer, but far superior in content and format. Even the older commentaries by Rudolph and Galling (though they have not been translated into English) are superior to Myers. Anchor has begun producing replacements for many of the earlier volumes. Hopefully, Ezra-Nehemiah is on the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Taste of Old Cuba","review":"I cannot tell how much I love this book.

When she passed, she took some of the best cooking with her. The book gives me recipes that taste exactly the way i remember them - never fails.

In addition, the book contains a rich array of anecdotes from Mrs. O'Higgins' childhood which bring alive a time and a place no longer available to us. The stories are as great a treasure as the recipes, for they are written in a style which absolutely characterizes the Cuban people, a style which is full of wit and humor and a general attitude of generosity towards the world and towards the world's many gifts.

Everyone should read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A typical Review","review":"This book by Mr. Halliday is fascinating. Not only does it tell of Shakespeare's life and what had influenced his works, but it also tells of certain historic items that are happening. This book does go in depth in William's life. But why four stars and not five? I used this book for the study of someone great in History for an English class. Four stars was given for the reason that the book would talk about other people such as Queen Elizabeth and her affairs as well as drift from William Shakespeare. If you can deal with the annoyance of the story drifting off topic, and enjoy learning about Shakespeare. Then I highly recommend this book.4 out of 5 StarsJesse FlanneryStudent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Display not so good","review":"There are plenty of games to chose from, however, I do care for the graphics.

I have seen the movie many times but on my first viewing of the DVD last night was sorely dissappointed that it was the cleaned up over dubbed (badly and not even thoroughly)version.

Today, after losing more than 130 pounds, I am a size 10-12 and have been this way for the last 7 months. After trying every diet on the market, finally The Hunger Within, focuses you on the real reasons why we eat, allowing food to become a source of nourishment and not self-destruction.

After 12 weeks of self guided revolting exercises such as eating whilst looking in the mirror, keeping endless food diaries and having role plays with myself I was no more enlightened as to how to solve the problem. The authors solution is to learn to make your \\"adult\\"(sensible) voice in your head overule your \\"child\\"(the one thats eats to make itself feel better). How you do this other than by sheer willpower and self talk is still a mystery to me. The book will be useful for those who don't understand why they eat compulsively and it will offer you some ways of coping. It will also make you see that you are not alone. My advice would be that if you really have an eating disorder you need to seek professional, human form, help in order to overcome it, this book is no substitute."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hunger Within","review":"I was disappointed with this book, also. I thought the written exercises were a little silly and disappointing. I expected the book to have more substance to it. Overcoming Overeating and It's Not about Food are better books for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busy work...","review":"The book \\"The Hunger Within\\" was not at all helpful to me in overcoming compulsive overeating. The book is filled with step by step instructions and tons of 'busy work' exercises. While the book does talk about the triggers for overeating and provides alternatives, it never gets to the root of why some people have triggers and some don't and how to lessen the triggers. I can memorize the steps, I can make a conscious decision to make another choice, however, this does not eliminate the trigger or the sometimes overwhelming desire to eat. Following the steps still means I am constantly battling with myself. There is no inner peace with this process.To overcome overeating, one must understand where the trigger is coming from and address the underlying issue. A much better book is \\"The Taming of the Chew\\" which is a holistic approach to overcoming overeating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The answers really do lie within this book!","review":"Marilyn goes through 3 different characters perspectives throughout the journey from enlightenment to recovery.

I purchased it for my 3 year old son who seems to love it. (Of course, he is rather tall for his age, so he manages it very well.) It is easy to ride and peddle. In fact, he seems to be able to peddle this toy much easier than other toys recently purchased that require \\"peddling\\". The only issue I see with this toy is that the front tire requires inflation and the manner in which this toy was constructed, a regular bicycle pump does not work. You have to take it to a bicycle shop or gas station to inflate the front tire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Green Machine","review":"We got this for my son's 6th birthday, by the time he is 7 he will be too big for it.

Some of the puns are obvious enough, but Kiernan really goes over the top on the rest(mostly taking passages out if context), even going so far as to suggest that Iago and Roderigo have a homosexual relationship. The book is self-consciously vulgar, attempting to surprise rather than to inform. Sure, Shakespeare had an incredibly filthy mind, but it seems that Kiernan has one far filthier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filthy Shakespeare","review":"This book is fun if you can't get enough of Shakespeare.

Sometimes you see a pattern and you don't even want to begin because it appears too complicated. This book is not like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to follow patterns","review":"I'm very disappointed in this book. The specific patterns I wanted are here if you can unravel poor drawings and the percentage system of Meg's mother. If you prefer specific directions, you find them but for one adult size only ( e.g. spiral yoke sweater).I think it is too precious to expect the world to have knowledge of EZ's kntting system in order to use the daughter's book.

Every song is a cover version performed by a group known as The Obscure, and the band does no justice to the originals.The more disappointing cover songs on the album are The Obscure's version of \\"Are You That Somebody\\", originally performed by Aaliyah. Their version of \\"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing\\" by Aerosmith is even worse.I think it's shameless that the album's distributor intentionally packaged it in such a way that it doesn't appear to be a compilation of cover songs.

I had an item sold to me like this thru another company and had been given no warning of such until I unpacked the box.In any case the Krups toaster was not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"A toaster with ups and downs syndrome.","review":"It took a little while to get the feel of the two-sided handle. It not only starts the toasting cycle, but raises the toast higher for removal.Thus, it's great at retrieving any size piece of toast. However, the overall unevenness of toasting, gives this only 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of features, but doesn't toast evenly","review":"This toaster looks good and has lots of special features, but doesn't perform its main purpose, which is toasting bread and bagels. I tried toasting both with the same result: they were very brown at the top and not toasted at all on the bottom. Also, this toaster leaves large stripes on the bread that aren't toasted. I sent it back the day after I received it and purchased the Cuisinart Metal Classic Toaster, which is even better looking and toasts very evenly, top to bottom, with no stripes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Mistake","review":"Although Consumer Reports rated this model as #2, I have found this a very disappointing purchase. The cheap aluminum parts inside bend all the time jamming the toaster. It toasts very uneavenly and inconsistently. I am very sorry I purchased this toaster. I was expecting much more from a toaster so highly rated but I've learned that Consumer Reports does not always get everything right. Listen to the other warnings and stay away from this toaster. As soon as I find another toaster, this one goes off to Goodwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little toaster, especially for bagels","review":"I had a tfal toaster that died, and needed a replacement. This toaster does the job well. I haven't had any problems with uneven toasting that have been reported in other reviews, and I like the fact that it has nice deep slots (for rye bread) and that the slots are wide enough for bagels.The pull-out crumb tray is also convenient. I also like the easy to use lever to raise the toast out of the slots. I do wish that the 'cancel' button was easier to see and that the bagel and defrost buttons lit up to indicate that you have pressed them. But hey, its just a toaster, and its just making toast."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"loved it from the start...but now the little wires that support the bread and go up and down have bent and are jamming.

However, it would be nice if they had made the slots a little bit longer. The width is fine and accommodates even thick slices of bread. The bread I usually buy is Oroweat and I have to punch it down with my finger as it is a tad too long for the slots.

Even from the outset, it did not toast very evenly. I will probably never buy another Krup product as it wasn't cheap and it didn't last (Is it quality control, lousy technology or what that produces these poor quality products?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't toast evenly top to bottom","review":"We've had this unit for several years. I wish I had returned it. It looks great and I like the lever to raise the toast out of the unit. But I almost always have to rotate the toast to get it toasted on the bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST toaster I ever owned -- BY FAR","review":"It is highly *reproducible* in its toasting so you can actually predict how your toast will come out (the way you like it). It does not burn when toasting on the 3rd time in a row like many toasters. It has a handy 'lift' handle, plenty wide enough for bagels, doesn't take up tons of counter space, and has a great defrost feature. I've owned this toaster for more than a year and it has restored my faith in toasters! Thanks Consumer Reports!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toaster ever","review":"Finally, I've found the perfect toaster. It toasts bread, etc. evenly, and the lever to raise the toast is one of the best inventions for toasters in a long time - no more sticking something in the toaster to retrieve toast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"Have had this thing for about a year and I give up. Unless you slice your bread an inch and a half thick, it burns the slice on the edges and dries it out in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toaster","review":"I have had this toaster a week and am very happy with it. I like my english muffins well toasted and this is the first toaster to toast them to my satisfaction. Bagels come out great as does regular toast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all that .....","review":"Does what it promises and more. Nice wide slots, sensitive settings for degree of toastiness, nice looking stainless & black design. A nice extra is the fact that the top grate will hold larger items to be warmed--like muffins, etc. I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great in our kitchen and does a good job!","review":"I bought this toaster in exchange for an inexpensive $10 toaster because this old one was too narrow to fit bagles or rolls. This toaster does exactly what it should do...it toasts bread, bagels and rolls, and it does it very well!In addition to it, you will get a great looking device, which looks very nice on your countertops in your kitchen. The black and steel finish looks really stylish and the whole look-and-feel of this toaster is of a very high quality for an unbeatably low price on amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs as advertised","review":"A pretty good toaster that works as advertised. Once in a while it toasts unevenly, but not sure if that due to the type or shape of the stuff being toasted. Having the same lever load the toast and also extend it for removal is really handy. All in all, a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough for the $50 plus price range","review":"I like the manufacturer, hence went with it but realized it's not the best for the price. The bread comes out quite bent up no matter whether you put it horizontally or vertically. Also after couple uses, I realized I had to keep bumping up the setting to 5 than 6 and the max is 8 which I might hit in the next couple months? and of course will then end up with a terribly burnt up 'toast like object' Though the looks are v.nice and the pop down handle is convenient to use. I wished it had worked out but will be returning it and trying out the 'Breville Ikon Toaster'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemingly great features, but doesn't toast well! *0* Stars","review":"I bought this toaster today at Williams-Sonoma, and I am going to return it tomorrow. It has seemingly great features -- defrost, bagel setting, warming tray -- all things I would use often. However, I toasted 6 pieces of bread tonight to test the toaster and was amazed at how unevenly it toasted. I would say 1 of the 12 sides was toasted ok (not well!). Some sides were not toasted *at all* yet the other side of the bread was done. I can't believe the el cheapo toaster I was going to throw out toasts much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap aluminum parts bend","review":"But it toasts lousy, won't take slices that are the least non-standard in size or shape, and the cheap aluminum parts inside bend and jam.

They did a great job picking one out. The bagel settings are great(slots nice and wide too), love the defrost mode, great to hit with frozen items like waffles, then toast them, they come out perfect. The feature I like best is that you can make smaller items like english muffins pop up higher so that you don't have to use the \\"fork method\\". Another great feature is the drawer that slides out sooo easily to clean out the crumbs. With my old toasters I had to turn them upside down, unscrew the tray and shake the toaster to get crumbs out and what a mess! It's so easy to wipe down with wet cloth and always looks clean, goes great with other Stainless appliances too."},{"rating":"2","title":"krups toaster","review":"Overall we like this toaster better than any ones we've had before. The only thing I don't like is that the warming tray that fits over the top has a tendency to get jostled by the toast when it tries to pop up. I do like the features of the lever to raise the toast out of the toaster therefore avoiding burning one's fingers and of the crumb tray which is so well designed that it slides smoothly out and in."},{"rating":"1","title":"died too soon","review":"I did a lot of research and really loved this toaster up until the day it broke!It looks good,toasts all sizes of bread and bagels well.But less than a year from purchase one of the little metal supports for the bread bent and \\"jumped the track\\".I managed to push it back temporarily but I have to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"too late to return it, sigh","review":"This is in the Hammacher Schlemmer catalog, so I thought it would be the best. Toast comes out overdone on top and with lines, as another reviewer noted. Eggo waffles get hard but not browned. And it takes up a lot of counter space. I'll try the Breville -- they make a great blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Tried it for a week. We had to set it to the highest settings just to lightly brown the toast. Too high and it burned. We were going to try another since we like Krups products, but bought a more powerful T-Fal instead.This one may have been defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"This is the 5th toaster I've purchased in the past few years. and all I ask for a toaster to do is evenly toast a slice of bread but can't seem to find one! This one burns the top half of the toast and the bottom is not toasted. VERY frustrated. Threw out the box, or I would have returned it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice job... settings a little touchy","review":"Overall very happy with this toaster. Toasts quickly and the feature to elevate items up out of the slot is very handy. The sides stay cool as it toasts as well. Only complaint is that there seems to be a fine line in the darkness settings dial that quickly jumps from done nicely to burnt. If you know where that point is, then you...and your toast...are golden."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of many","review":"I have probably owned a dozen toasters over the years. The features on this Krups toaster are well thought out and designed. It's probably the best toaster I've ever had. I'm very happy with it and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features/ poor execution","review":"The toaster handles breads and bagels well and has an innovative twist handle which both lowers the toast (clockwise twist) and raises it for smaller items (CCW). However the toaster fails on its toast settings. Turning the toast dial fully clockwise produces a bagel that is browned on the edges only. There is no way a user can recalibrate the knob and customer support was readily available, but useless. The defrost function works well but the bagel setting leaves the outsides almost untoasted. The two buttons can be used singly or together.It's too bad as the toaster could have been a great product based on its intended design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups toaster comes up short","review":"As well as not toasting evenly, the slots of this toaster are too short for the sliced bread I use - opening is just under 5 inches long. I have to cut the crusts off the bread to fit it in the toaster. I do like the toaster's ability to raise shorter items (like muffins) that you would otherwise have to fish out with a fork. Crumb tray is very easy to remove at base of model. Space above toaster gets REALLY hot when it's on the higher settings - not suitable for low undercounter spaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I spent months reading reviews for toasters and purchased tne Krups FEM2B.The results were consistantly uneven toast. The control level light-dark made no sense if I turned it all the way up to level 8 it was barely toasted on bottom 2/3 and the top 1/3 was crisp. I returned mine and am back to researching toasters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups: Quality Control Issues?","review":"Hi, I usually don't complain about the products that I buy because I consider myself a savvy consumer, but in this instance I was dubbed big time! A few years ago, we received a Krups coffee maker as a wedding gift and we love it! However, this particular toaster rarely worked. In fact, I would say that 85% time it would either not toast or would \\"flip\\" the toast prematurely e.g. 5 second or less. I have no idea if this is a fluck in quality control or not, but I highly recommend buying a different toaster. I know, I thought, Krups makes a toaster? Wow, I'll buy it, after all how hard can it be for a German company to manufacture functional a toaster? Well, evidently, they have issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"overated","review":"I bought two of these with high recommendations but they are not well made.

In addition it no longer provides even toasting. Stay away"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"Purchased this Krups toaster in December, at the time it was $59.99, and yesterday it decided to retire itself from the toasting business.Eight months for a supposedly high end toaster, with a new sleek design.

If I could get my money back, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute...but I really don't care about that","review":"Looks great sitting on the counter, but not a very good product. I was looking for an infuser that would let only a few tea leaves through or none at all. This one let in alot. Not what I was looking for.Bodum Yo Yo Tea Infuser With Lid, Stainless Steelis much better. It does let through a few leaves, but not as bad. I hate having a whole bunch of leaves at the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish- but not functional","review":"I bought this tea infuser as a gift and it had the eye appeal but that's about it. Very hard to untwist to put tea in. Once the tea is in, the holes are too big and unless you are using large leaf tea, much of it will end up in your cup. The plastic was also cheap. As I was trying to unscrew the metal tip to remove my used leaves, the handle broke right off!I would not suggest buying this product. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice","review":"I tried it once and then realized I had lost ten bucks.Filled it up with my tea and that worked but I noticed the locking mechanism was flimsy.After I stuck the infuser in my cup of hot water, the water didn't enter the infuser chamber! The holes are too small.I waited to no avail. Finally, to get water into the chamber, I had to swish it around and bang it on the side of the cup and that's when the flimsy locking mechanism opened up. What a mess.My $2 wire-mesh ball infuser is much better.It does look cool though."},{"rating":"2","title":"TeaTime.","review":"We love to drink tea and we prefer to drink loose tea. We used to buy empty tea bags but it seemed a bit wasteful. After getting this we can brew a cup of tea very easily.

Mine sits on the counter because it looks so cool, but although I am a serious tea drinker, this isn't the one I reach for. The polycarbonate (Lexan) is sturdy. So is the mesh. But the two aren't easy to put together--or to separate. The metal mesh bottom doesn't clean all that well, either.What I do like is the little holder which effectively eliminates drips. I also like the fact that you can stir with the unit--something you may need to do, because it doesn't infuse all that well. The top is solid, so that should have come as no surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good, functions poorly","review":"This product looks really cool but it functions poorly. You fill the bottom infuser part with the tea. As you quickly find out when you try to use this product to brew tea the top portion is filled too...with air. The air makes the infuser want to bounce along the top of the cup so you are forced to hold it down into the cup and stir it like a spoon to get the infusing going.While some people have complained of the holes being too small, I found them to be too large. A lot of tea leaf matter ends up floating around the cup.I have some infusers made with fine wire mesh. There is no problem with air creating flotation with those, and no leaf pieces end up in my tea. I will go back to using those and consider this ten bucks wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple and perfect","review":"Handy little tool here. Love that you can stir with it and catch the drips in they stand. The stand also gives you a no-mess place to store the tea so you can reuse it for that second or third steep. Only complaint might be that it takes up a lot of space in the mug, but that's not much of a problem. Definitely a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love it, but...","review":"I saw this tea infuser in a tea shop while on vacation and decided that I needed to have it. I am glad I waited! When I returned home from vacation I visited a friend to help her paint and she offered me a cup of tea with this exact tea infuser. I really loved the color and shape, but I felt like I left half of my cup of tea undrunk due to the magnitude of tea leaves floating in the bottom of my cup. When I infuse tea, I want to drink the tea, not the leaves. I did like the ability to easily stir the cup of tea and the holder, but the holes in the infuser are HUGE. I think I will pass on this one and stick with my Finium fine mesh tea infuser until I find something that actually strains the leaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and easy","review":"I bought this because it was cute but keep using it because it is easy.

Both drive me crazy, perhaps the former more than the latter. Whatever the case, Di Meola's a gifted, highly expressive, innovative guitarist when playing on albums alone or with musicians of his own caliber. Here Collins's typical thud-thud-thudding detracts from everything on the lower register and the Fairlight sprinkles the middle and upper ranges with powdered sugar. Innovative people make mistakes, of course, but the mistakes are not necessarily worth owning. \\"Elegant Gypsy,\\" \\"Friday Night In San Francisco,\\" \\"Trio\\" and \\"Casino\\" are among the truer testimonies to Di Meola's gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and Insipid","review":"Knowing that Al DiMeola has recorded many fine, groundbreaking albums, Scenario comes as somewhat of a disappointment. Despite the two star rating, it is not a bad album. Its just uninspired and insipid. I've listened to it many times trying to find something exciting in the music but have failed each time. There is not a single song that stands out.

The arrangements of Manuel Alejandro and the great musical background make her songs to be really top notch. It is Jeanette's voice, though, what makes everything click and boy, does it click. This is perhaps her most complete collection of songs. If you like great music, you should have this CD in your collection.

The problem is that 30W is not enough power for doing the job well: normal orange presure stops de motor! The transmission of the power is done by cheap plasic parts, so they broke easily.

It was strangely larger than the original (significantly), it had several cut marks on it, and the seams where the pieces come together were not finished well. Overall, the quality was disappointing. Since the only problem with the original item was the crooked plaque on the front, we decided to keep that one and return the replacement item instead of the original. We will make another attempt to fix the crooked plaque ourselves, since the block is not terrible otherwise.

To think that this drivel came from the man who wrote \\"Honesty,\\" \\"She's Got A Way,\\" \\"New York State of Mind,\\" \\"My Life,\\" and \\"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant\\" is just appalling.

He would never again turn out any real original material, but only copies of already written songs. AN INNOCENT MAN was clearly evident of Billy's aging ability.Here, no indepth study is needed. \\"An Innocent Man\\" is one of the few songs worth listening to. \\"Keeping the Faith\\" is overrated, and \\"Uptown Girl\\" is overexposed.Hold off to buy this album until you buy GLASS HOUSES, THE STRANGER, TURNSTILES, or a greatest hits compilation first.

Although it's hard for me to choose which one is a favorite, the most exceptionally crafted tune is \\"The Longest Time\\" with its doo wop harmony and haunting lyrics. Clearly this is another essential Billy Joel recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth!","review":"I have about a hundred and fifty CDs, and if I was to rate all of them, I would probably end up with six or eight that really deserves all of five stars. This is one of them. It's a wonderful mixture of rock n' roll, soulful ballads and...well, pop. There's not a weak track on this album, and a few of the songs (\\"The Longest Time\\", \\"Uptown Girl\\" and the title track) are just marvellous. Great lyrics, great vocals, and so incredibly melodious! \\"An Innocent Man\\" is a beautiful piece of work from a truly great singer-songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keepin' The Faith","review":"An Innocent Man harkens back to Billy Joel's leather jacketed, teenage years and emulates the rock sound of the pre-British Invasion days. \\"Easy Money\\" has a rolling sound and became the title of a Rodney Dangerfield movie and the title track finds Mr. Joel singing a torch song. \\"The Longest Time\\" is an almost a cappella number that pays tribute to the street corner doo wop groups. \\"This Night\\" is another slower song while \\"Tell Her About It\\" has a definite R&B influence. The song became his second number song and has a party atmosphere. \\"Uptown Girl\\" has a full, explosive sound and a Frankie Valli & The 4 Seasons feel. \\"Careless Talk\\" is fast paced song and \\"Christie Lee\\" is about Christie Brinkley. \\"Leave A Tender Moment Alone\\" features some nice harmonica playing and \\"Keeping The Faith\\" sums up the overall theme of the album and closes it out on a high note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joel's last great album:4.5 stars","review":"An Innocent Man (1983) marked a turning point in Joel's career. It was his last consistently good album and marked the beginning of a slow but steady songwriting decline that ended with a whimper in 1993. (I consider Joel's peak to be between the Stranger(1977)-Nylon Curtain(1982)).But this album has a lot to enjoy. Good catchy songs strong on melody and with good lyrics. It's a bit frivolous (most of the songs seem inspired by Christie Brinkley), but high in entertainment value.This album is also noteable due to the very evident change in Joel's singing voice. It's noticeably deeper compared to Nylon Curtain (from just the previous year), and he was obviously having problems hitting the high notes-most evident in the \\"Longest Time\\". (Joel was only 34 at the time so his singing problems may've been due more to smoking than age.)Oh by the way, the bonus videos (Longest Time, Keeping the Faith and Leave a Tender Moment Alone) on the CD are great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK Even CD","review":"We have another CD with some good, some bad. Basically, the even tracks are the good ones, except for \\"This Night\\" and \\"Keeping the Faith\\", meaning only 3 of the songs are really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good CD","review":"This is a very good, consistent CD. Of the 10 tracks, I've rated all but two of them as Very Good. Those other two are rated as an Excellent and as a (merely) Good (one each). My specific track ratings are:1. Easy Money -- 4 Stars2. Innocent Man -- 4 Stars3. Longest Time -- 5 Stars4. This Night -- 4 Stars5. Tell Her About It -- 4 Stars6. Uptown Girl -- 4 Stars7. Careless Talk -- 4 Stars8. Christie Lee -- 3 Stars9.

And fell in love with every song on the album. I am very picky about my music. So that is rare. I guess I love the variety of styles. Some ballads, some pop and some oldies.My favorite songs are Tell Her About It and This Night. This is definitely a keeper for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Classic Billy Joel","review":"This was one of the first records I ever bought of Billy Joel and I was blown away. This is Joel at his songwriting best. Just look at the string of hit songs that came off this album. Some other noteworthy songs include \\"This Night\\", and \\"Easy Money.\\" The album definitely has a 60's influence in it, but that's what makes it great. This was Billy Joel in his prime as a singer, songwriter and entertainer. Even if you have most of these songs on the Greatest Hits Collection, you're missing some other classic Bily Joel tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Billy CD.","review":"This was the first Billy Joel recording I purchased, largely becasue it had the hits \\"Innoncent Man\\", \\"For The Longest Time\\", and \\"Tell Her About It\\" on it. But it also has some great Billy tunes, like \\"This Night\\" (a song with the do-wop feel of the 50s) and the lesser-known \\"Keeping the Faith\\", a personal tune about growing up. If you're bypassing the greatest hits CDs, and looking for one essential Billy Joel recording, this is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something good for Everyone","review":"This CD is an interesting mix of early rock and soul, mixed with a bit of teeny-bopper pop rock. That mix proves to be awesome. The CD seemes to be woven through with the theme of love (lost and gained). Somewhere along this ride, you will be moved (if not many times).The music found here is tight and on the mark. From the sax on 'Christie Lee' to the drum work on 'Easy Money'the band rises up to their usual level.Many of these songs received a lot of radio play and might have been overplayed, but time heals that wound and allows us to enjoy them all over again. I have had many favorite songs off of this CD at various points in my life (and listening). That should speak volumes of the quality and versatility found on this recording. The romantic will love 'This Night'. The jazz-rocker will like 'Christie Lee'. The 50's person will enjoy 'Keeping the Faith.This is definitely one of the more universally appealing works by Billy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, upbeat album","review":"Although this album was released many years ago, it seems that a majority of these songs have been Top-40 hits: Tell Her About It (#1), Uptown Girl (#3), An Innocent Man (#10), The Longest Time (#14), Leave a Tender Moment Alone (#27), Keeping The Faith (#18). I'm a fan of many of his songs throughout Billy Joel's career, but for me it's a fresh change from some of the more solemn or heavier songs he's written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Polished","review":"Billy Joel breezes through a variety of styles, ranging from doo wop to the Four Seasons. There's even a little Beethoven thrown in, just to show he's smarter than all of us. Joel's transitions through a variety of styles seem almost effortless, which is of course why he gets so much criticism. His talent cannot be questioned, but it almost seems like he can do this stuff in his sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction","review":"This is a great book to start in financial statement analysis.

This book enabled us to run a high-level diagnostic on the financial health of our prospective business, and recognize certain significant challenges. Consequently, we have had second thoughts, and are proceeding with caution--or at least now we are in a position to make more informed desicions. Amazingly, we were able to find ways to improve the company's financial situation that the CFO has apperantly overlooked--and he's an MBA. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written Overview of Financial Statements and Accounting","review":"This book is great for anyone ranging from beginner to intermediate knowledge of financial reports. I have taken accounting and finance classes in college. This book tells the same things that 600 page textbooks and hours and hours of lecture can tell you, but it does so in an easy to understand and concise manner.Most important it explains the relationships clearly between the income statement, balance sheet, and cashflow statement. This book would be great for anyone starting an education in finance or for any investor trying to broaden their knowledge base. If you invest in stocks, you should learn how to read financial statements. This book will give you some much needed knowledge that you can use as you scour for companies to invest in.This author takes pride in his writing. John A. Tracy is a professor of accounting, but his knack for concise explanations and the clear use of the English language is evident throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, wide range of functionality","review":"My wife and I were searching for a camcorder for the birth of our first child, and this one fit every requirement we had.

I saw this in a CD at a local cd warehouse, and bought it. This cd is unbeleivably ill, completely raw, live sounding, very underproduced, nothing like nelly or rule, who could be out rapped by Judge Judy trying to hiphop, this dude shows off true skill in rhyming.

I thought it was a joke until I scrolled down and saw prices reaching $125+.This is a superb album, the Amazon-review-mentioned \\"Rhymes Like Dimes\\" is especially good, with my favourite track by far being \\"Doomsday\\", an emotive piece of music masterfully sampling a Sade hook from \\"Kiss of Life\\".However, no CD is worth $120, $12 is a more reasonable price for a used disc.What is going on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"I didn't like it but I only decided to listened to it to see if MF Dooms an artist Id be interested in after listening to Madvillain, but it has way to much R&B for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"MF DOOM MIXTAPE FEAT.

Each artist truly makes the songs their own; no almost-but-not-quite the original versions here (except perhaps the Los Lobos version of Are You Experienced?), but rather songs in the artists own varied styles, that provide more interpretation of what they think Jimi meant and what the songs really are.Styles vary from reggae (Neville and Sheena Staples) to country/blues (Roseanne Cash), traditional blues (Charlie Musslewhite), jazz (Isham) and even gospel (Blind Boys). Chuck D. and Laurie Anderson do their version of songs in their signature styles -- fans of either won't be disappointed - that truly expand on the originals.

For the life of me, I can't understand why mostly overrated artists have a need to regurgitate perfect tunes in their own style.

It's probably not going to make my top 10% for the year of all the CD's I'll buy, but will easily make my top 1/3. It's high points by Neville and Sheena Staples, Laurie Anderson and a handful of others are very high. Its weakest cuts are more interesting than the best cuts by the artists mentioned above. I don't have high expectations for tribute albums, so perhaps that's why I was pleasantly surprised. But it's unquestionably worth a listen.

I hope no one in their right mind would have him working for them. He would be disruptive and most likely rally some of his co-workers to revolt against the American work system. He obviously has it in for the Christian work ethic and standing up for what this country was established for. Get a life, Gil, boy!

Worth every penny if it keeps him from hurting himself on the tile floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not soft enough for newborn-12 months.","review":"My daughter is 7 months old and recently became very active (crawling, sitting on her own, falling over, etc...) so I bought these playmats to give her some cushion (we have all hardwood floors). While these are well made and appear to be fantastic for older children, I feel they are not soft enough for babies ages newborn to 12 months. For example, when she gets excited while playing on her back, she'll kick her feet against the mats...and I can see by the expression on her face it hurts her heels. I've also noticed that when she's sitting and falls over, her falls seem to hurt. I ended up ordering a new and much softer, thicker mat for her until she's a bit older. It definitely has made a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL PRODUCT","review":"I purchased 2 packs of these mats and placed them under my grandaughters LITTLE TYKES play structure and they are wonderful.

I wish I could find more of this product in stock somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - Need More!","review":"With twin two-year-old boys, we've found a gazillion uses for these things - over ceramic tiles for clumsy crawlers, between high chairs and carpet (food cleans up easily), as quick and accessible diaper changing pads, under toddler playground equipment, and even for building giant cube playhouses. We did think they were a bit expensive at first, but found them to be worth the price.They sell out quickly at Toys R Us and Home Depot. Employees from both stores indicated that they wished they could have more of these in stock since they run out so quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"great play mats!","review":"Great mats! they are thick, durable.

While they were great while my son was first learning how to sit on his own, they are not as durable as I expected them to be. These mats are easily scratched and scuffed (even by my sons soft finger nails!) My son is turning 8 months soon and while we have only had these mats for a few months, they already look like they have been through the ringer. We have them on top of hardwood floors and they slide easily which can be a safety hazard. I definitely recommend putting a grip mat underneath for hardwood floors. We didn't have any issue with him chewing on the edges and it has been great for cushioning his small falls. When it comes time to replace these ones, I do believe I will go with different brand with more durable, better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pefect for tummy time!","review":"I bought this product for my 4 month old.

I couldn't be happier. She just learnt how to sit-up and I don't want all those extra pillows around her. These mats are life saver. She can sit-up and play with her toys and I don't have to worry about her falling on head if I don't catch her fast enough. She feels safe and she can enjoy all her toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"These mat's smell - strong odor","review":"The mat's have a strong odor and leave behind an oily/slippery substance on my hardwood floors and my feet.

The other 2 had VERY rough sections that caused major irritation on my son's knees. When I contacted the company, they gave me a VERY hard time about the issue and basically said they wouldnt do anything about replacing those mats until they received them back and could do an investigation as to how this could have happened. They kept saying that they had never seen anything like this before as though I was making the issue up. In the end, I was SO unhappy with their attitude that I returned all 8 sets and went with another brand.

So far so good. They seem pretty comfortable and I find that I like sitting on them as well. They don't come with edge pieces and like another reviewer stated, I can't find them on Amazon or on the company's website. It's probably not a huge drawback, though, since my son is starting to put things in his mouth and I've heard other parents complain about the mats with letters that their kids constantly pull out and suck on. I think some parents end up putting the edge pieces away until their kids are older anyway. My biggest complaint is that these mats pick up every piece of fur and hair that comes into contact with it. I have to wipe them down or vacuum them at least once a day. Overall, though, they are great and I ended up buying another 2 sets to have more floor coverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Playmats","review":"We bought these mats for our 4 month old baby girl. We have hardwood floors throughout our house, and these make a great \\"soft spot\\" to sit on. I also have a bad back which makes sitting on the hardwood very difficult. We bought these hoping that it would help to cushion the floor when playing with our little one. They are wonderful! Not only do they make it easy to sit on, but it's a nice surface for \\"tummy time\\" with the baby. We have also used the mat under our picnic blanket at the park.

I also read the book PRE, and it does mention that his friends did not call him Pre until college. Also, the actual race footage (running in the outside lanes, and finishing close together) would not have occurred. But one must look beyond these impurities, and realize it is the story of one of the most inspirational American runners.

The acting found in this film is that of early 90's soap operas. Cheesy lines fill the scenes in this movie along with Melrose Place esque acting. The script depicts steve prefontaine as an insecure, scared little kid, when he was the exact opposite. Jared Leto does a good job looking like pre but not much else. The running portion of the movie is based more on the easiest shot than on an actual race. Since when did long distance runners run in the middle of the track anyway? I am not denying that the story is one of the best out there but if thats what you're looking for, Without Limits, the other movie about prefontaine far surpasses this movie. Better acting, better script, no interrupting interviews with the actors posing as steves friends and family, and it was actually shot in eugene rather than somewhere in washington. Overall this movie was a dud! Watch without limits, its one of my favorite movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"Enjoyed this film very much.

The movie truly depicts one of America's greatest athletes in a realistic and exiciting way.

I have seen this movie numerous times and highly recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME","review":"The Story of Steve Prefontaine is one that will not soon be forgoten.

If you want a real movie about Prefontaine with great racing scenes, good characterizations, and Donald Sutherland as Bill Bowerman who can resist that check out Without Limits.

This movie doesn't even compare to the other movie on Steve Prefontaine, Without Limits. The acting is very poor, the writing is horrible, and the production values are atrocious. It is also much much less factually actuate than Without Limts (for specific reasons why read the the 1 star review, A Customer). People who say that Jared Leto resembles Pre live in a reality that I'll never know. He looks and acts nothing like Pre. Again not even comparable to the job the Billy Crudup did in Without Limits. And there is nothing in this film resembling the relationship between Nike co-founder and legendary running coach Bill Bowerman, portrayed by the brilliant Donald Sutherland, and Pre as there is in Without Limits.In short this film is a cheesy poorly acted melodrama, and it boggles my mind how anybody could think that this film was better than Without Limits, or even a decent film on it's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good!","review":"Someone gave me this movie for free, and I let it sit on my desk for months thinking it was going to be a total bore.

In 2001 I had \\"tendon release surgery\\" on both wrists and no longer have any problems unless I really, really overuse my wrists. BUT, prior to the surgery I tried at least a dozen different brands of wrist supports, and this was the winning brand and style. I recently purchased a few more pairs of these via Amazon because my old ones were getting beat. I spent a long time looking for these particular supports, and finally found the manufacturer. The manufacturer's \\"Internet Source\\" is not economical, but the Amazon source was extremely economical. I still use these to sleep in after wrist overuse and occasionally as I am \\"overusuing\\" my wrists if the activity is conducive to being performed with straight wrists.

I kept trying to get into it, but by the end I was speed reading just to find out what happened at the end (not much). It is unfortunate, because Perry seems like he is probably a good writer, but the story lacks any real suspense, tension, or excitement. It is also very unbelievable, from the inital fact that Bernie \\"the elephant\\" has the location of billions in mob money stored only in his head (come on- it's the 90's), and when the money is given away to charities, they not only catch on instantly, but they then launch a nationwide net to catch Jane that would put the FBI to shame.

It is many lengths ahead of the pack with clear exposition. It makes you want to sit down at the keyboard and apply what you've learned immediately. The author says knowledge of five commands are sufficient to get anyone started and then tells you how to do it. The only shortcoming is that the book was three years old by the time I read it. Some commands are no longer recognized by the leading IRC programs, mostly because they have been supplanted by improvements. Nevertheless, there is plenty of meat applicable to mIRC and Pirch, the leading programs. The development and place of IRC in internet communications are explained admirably.

Morrison has captured the fantastic heroes' personalities to a tee. And penciller Howard Porter is nothing short of amazing. Simple lines when needed and detail when appropriate, Porter has a cinematic eye towards page design and panel layout. The action is dynamic and fluid, there is no confusion as to what exactly is happening. Back to Morrison, his strentgh is apparent in the little things he has his superheroes do; such as Flash's instantaneous redesign of the JLA trophy room or the insight into Superman's anxitey. The latter leads to the greatest moment of the book as Flash remarks on Supes' worries about living up to his image: \\"This is a man worried about living up to the name? He's wrestling an ANGEL!\\" Spectacular work by all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad effort","review":"One of the worst graphic novels I have ever read. The first story, about Tomorrow Woman, is the tired old cliche of robot becoming human. Poor Asimov is rolling over. The middle story about angels is well nigh unintelligble. There are entire frames that seem to be from some other story. The last piece about The Key is okay but half the story is the villain posing about and telling you what his plan is as opposed to allowing it to be expressed through the story.

This CD should be listed as a CYNDI LAUPER greatest hits package due to the amount of geunine radio hits found on this debut CD. On the basis of this release, \\"La Lauper\\" played to sold out concert venues worldwide and was asked to lend her vocals and support to the famous USA FOR AFRICA project (WE ARE THE WORLD).SHE'S SO UNUSUAL is produced to perfection and is bombarded with massive radio hits such as \\"SHE BOP\\", \\"MONEY CHANGES EVERYTHING\\", plus her famous ballads \\"TIME AFTER TIME\\", \\"ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT\\" and her 80s video anthem \\"GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN\\". Put this CD on and you are bound to land back in the days of DAY-GLO clothing and CUT OFF LACE GLOVES !(1984)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!","review":"I read my previous review and noticed my typos so I'm posting it again because for some reason my edit would not go through. This is a great CD, Cyndi Lauper has a nice distinctive voice. My favorite songs on the CD are Money Changes Everything, Girls Just Want To Have Fun, Time After Time, and All Through The Night, but my favorite Cyndi Lauper song of all time is Time After Time, when ever I heard that song on the radio I had to stop what I was doing and listen to it but usually when I turned my radio on or changed the station the song was usually almost finished, and now since I recently bought this CD I can listen to it whenever I want and I can hear the whole song from beginning to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cyndi lauper best album","review":"this is my favorite cyndi lauper album. but this is not digitally remastered . enhanced remaster. cyndi lauper best of the best (gold cd) import. will prove that im right. the best digitally remaster recording ever. but does not include money changes everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the original...","review":"Alas the SACD reissue is aweful. Apparently the engineer who worked on this reissue must not have cared for Cyndi's voice because it is mixed way too low in comparison to the instruments. I consider \\"Time After Time\\" to be one of the ten best pop tunes of the 80's. Listening to the muffled and often difficult to hear vocal track on the SACD version was enough to make me feel like I'd wasted my money and things don't get much better then that on the rest of this disk.Hopefully there will be a SACD release of this album some day that does it justice. For now, just say no and stick with the standard edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Release is an ILLEGAL BOOTLEG!","review":"Be aware! No DVD release has officially been made for this concert.

She's Unusual is not that much different but what sets it's apart from other similar albums from that age is the excellent songwriting by Lauper and other's whose songs ended up on this CD. OK, Opening track Money Changes Everything could easily have been on a Springsteen album but the song is still good. Most known are of course the superhits Girls Just Wanna Have Fun (with lyrics that deserve more attention since it is not all about just having fun) and Time After Time. Prince's When You Were Mine is another example of great songwriting. So underneath the often clanky sound sits a well written record."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is unusually good.","review":"This is an 80's classic if there ever was one. Truth be known, I'd even keep this over one of her collections. Sure I'd miss \\"True Colors\\" and \\"Drove All Night\\", but this is pure Cyndi front-to-back. Half her hits are on this one album, like \\"Time After Time\\", \\"All Through The Night\\", \\"She Bop\\", and of course \\"Girl's Just Want to Have Fun\\". But what makes \\"She's So Unusual\\" is the lesser-knowns. I totally love \\"I'll Kiss You\\" and \\"Yeah Yeah\\". Plus this is remastered with extra tracks! Then there's the classic cover photo. You don't get that in 2006. A must for fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, But Feels Like Filler Between Great Singles","review":"Cyndi's debut dazzles with fun and exuberance, for at least the first half of the album anyway. The first six tracks are probably the most delightfully infectious collection ever recorded by any artist in the 80s. It's almost comes across as if she's a young girl, rediscovering the exciting new wave sounds and analogue synths for the first time, and imbuding her wacky persona throughout. Ironically, she finally popularised new wave in America just as the genre itself had died out, although the synths serve mainly to give her otherwise anthem pop songs and power ballads an even wackier sound. Unfortunately it all dies out by side 2 of the album, towards the end the album struggles for life through increasingly generic new wave fodder without hook or charm, giving the whole affair an impression of being several dazzling singles being held together with filler.Best Tracks: Money Changes Everything, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, She Bop."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE'S SO Unusual","review":"I DO NOT HAVE THE CD BUT I DO HAVE THE AUTIO CASSETT OFCYNDI LAUPER AND I DO LOVE HER MUSIC AND TONIGHTCYNDI LAUPER IS ON LIFE TIME INTIMATE PORTRAIT AND IAM AMAZED THAT SHE IS SO GOOD IN HER SINGING CAREERAND I WONDER HOW TALENTED OF BEING A PROFESIONAL SINGER.YOUR FRIEND,REBECCA DERANEK THIS MY OPIOIN ON THE SUBJECT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Brightman,excellent as always.","review":"Sarah Brightman's newest release 'Eden'is just as wonderful as can be expected from one of the truly great artists of our time. She mixes pop,classical and haunting new versions of film scores(Titanic,The Mission and The English Patient). Though this CD does not show off her complete vocal range in being less classical in focus than 'Time To Say Goodbye', it does show another facet of her exquisite soprano voice.

This CD is so hauntingly beautiful, I cannot pick a favourite song. [Although my personal favourite of all time is 'Dust in the Wind' - the Kerry Livgren \\"Kansas\\" song from the 70's -- she gives this song a new beauty that will make it live on]. But all the songs are so wonderful, that I feel like I have entered a Star Trek Holodeck with the love of my life and I am in the most romantic setting that can be imagined. Such is the power of this Stunning CD. I cannot recommend this CD highly enough. Buy more than one -- you will want it with you everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best album!!!","review":"Having followed the musical carreer of SB for quite some time, one never knows what to expect listening to her latest CD. This CD is no exception. This is one of her best ever made. SB and Wolfgang Peterson have outdone themselves this time. The CD is a beautiful descent to SB's intimate place called \\"Eden\\". You are swept away to her realm of music, fantasy and your own imagination. Will SB be able to top this CD, only time will tell, but knowing her track record, she probably has some great CDs up her sleave. Note to the Americans: Having seen SB last night in Brussels (Belgium) I can give you one advise: Go visit one of her concerts in the US in may/june 99 - it will be a night in \\"Eden\\" you never forget. SB is one of the last great soprano stars in the league of Callas, Schwarzkopf...If only she would make a full classical CD of aria's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"After listening to \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\" many many times and, each time, coming away from the experience with tears in my eyes and joy in my heart from the profound experience of hearing this angel sing, I find it hard to believe that \\"Eden\\" is by the same artist. What a mismatched hodegpodge of music; limited range both vocally and instrumentally, and, to say the least, almost monotonous sounding. Not one single cut worth listening to more than the first time and most not even then. Sounded like someone reached into a \\"grab-bag\\" of singles and put the first 16 on the CD. Shame...shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hyped up diva","review":"Sorely disappointed by this album. Brightman's voice is monotonous and her singing style is boring to the extreme. There's never any tone colouring and her technique is clumsy. In some of the songs, her singing can in fact be pretentious. It makes one feel that she's a product of media hype rather than genuine artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"****EDEN****","review":"This CD by Ms. Brightman explores many styles, yet carries you along as it does.

I was entranced, and immediately went online to Amazon.com to see if it was available there. It was, along with Eden, and others by Ms. Brightman. I bought three Brightman CDs right then and there! The songs on \\"Eden\\" are a good sampling of Ms. Brightman's talent, and I strongly recommend it for anyone who loves the crystalline sound of a truly pure soprano voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not up to usual standards!","review":"Ms. Brightman's voice can stand alone - par none. I did not care for the first three cuts on this album, too \\"new-agey\\" for my tastes. I found at times that her voice seemed to be over-shadowed or lost behind the music. Could do without the birds or nature sounds as well. The rest of the CD was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise","review":"This is a lovely richly orchestrated collection of wide variety of songs that evoke a peaceful perfumed garden! The recording opens with a composition by the heavenly Sarah Brightman herself called, In Paradisum. The song is hauntingly beautiful,entwined with a subtle Eastern rhythm.It opens the door to a truly delightful array of selections from Ennio Morriccone, Kansas' Dust in the Wind, to Puccini. The entire recording is bathed in a magical tranquility!

And I must say that Brightman has a vibrato that makes my speakers fall down on the floor. And the music is good too. BUT! Making the lead-theme out of \\"The Mission\\"-movie to a baroque piece, isn't that just a little bit exaggerated? And her \\"version\\" of H?ndels \\"Lascia ch'io Pianga\\" is so utmost overwhelming. Her voice bends up and down like a kid jumping in its parents bed. I'd say that I find some of the tracks very entrancing, but I would lie if I said that I love her voice above everything else. And it's not just \\"Nella Fantasia\\" that I am talking about.Although I must admit that I have a little favourite on this CD. And that is of course \\"Anytime, Anywhere\\". THAT is beautiful.

Her normally melodic voice is constrained and overshadowed with poor music. I threw it away! Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's in my collection","review":"Sarah Brightman is certainly one of the most flexible artists of today. This CD ranges from Techno/Pop (Eden) to Opera (Only An Ocean Away). I'm not normally fond of Opera but Sarah's voice sets it off as simply put, extrordinary. The whole CD is good which is very rare among today's musicians. I love this CD and listen to it every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I'm not an operatic snob, and I'm not a classical officionado, but I do know what I like, and this is it! Brightman always seems to start of her CDs with a little interlude at the beginning of her albums (in LA LUNA - \\"La Lune\\", from FLY - \\"The Fly\\", from HAREM - \\"Kama Sutra\\"). Her \\"In Paradisum\\" is long and beautiful, her voice soaring to high vocals. The next piece is \\"Eden\\", originally created by Hooverphonics, and this version is more classical than the other! It's really great! \\"So Many Things\\" is a great piece, followed by \\"Anytime, Anywhere\\", a Foreign Language - English piece (which works really well by the way). Bailero is the next piece, and it's great as well! Honestly, every single piece is beautiful, and it's a MUST-HAVE for any Sarah Brightman fan! However, the standout piece has to be \\"Nessun Dorma\\", which is a male aria, usually sung by Pavarotti or any other male. However, Sarah thought she could do it, and she did! Buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Excellent Excellent!","review":"This is my first Sarah Brightman purchase and I'm totally blown away. What an incredible voice! I'm listening to it right now and I can not say enough good things about this CD. If you enjoy female vocals in general (I'm a fan of Enya, Annie Lennox, Sarah McLachlan and Loreena McKennit), this will be a great addition to your collection. I especially like track 4 \\"Anytime, Anywhere.\\" Just amazing. This is the kind of music I can't play while driving because I get too caught up in the music. I am almost brought to tears. This is just excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbly surreal","review":"If the Garden of Eden had a CD, it would probably be this one. Sarah has an incredible range and sound. If you have seen her \\"One Night in Eden\\" concert, you will recognize many of these delightfully ethreal songs. \\"Eden\\", \\"Anytime Anywhere\\", \\"Il Mio Cuore Va\\", and \\"Deliver Me\\" are just a few excellent reasons to get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential CD for Any Sarah Fan...","review":"\\"Eden\\" is probably Sarah's most finely produced CD. I have followed her career since \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" and have fallen in love with her voice and the way it makes me feel while listening to it. She truly treats and uses her voice like the instrument it is, and this is conveyed throughout the CD and in concert (I had the pleasure of seeing her live, which is what made me buy this particular CD). The music also arouses great emotion and is the perfect complement to her voice. However, although her voice is completely mesmerizing, one cannot get over the fact that many of the tracks are monotonous, making them seem boring and long. The first few tracks, in my opinion, are the best, especially #4, my personal favorite. If you are a true Sarah fan and are familiar with her style, this is an important addition to your library. The companion video of the premiere of her \\"Eden\\" tour in Sun City, Africa is a great buy as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gorgeous, magical rainbow of music only Sarah could sing!","review":"This recording is adventuresome, heartfelt and extraordinary! Sarah Brightman has created a collection of songs that her voice explores with a passionate, lilting touch. The only puzzlement for me was her version of \\"Dust in the Wind\\". It feels out of sync with an otherwise compelling, wonderful performance by a woman who has been, by commercial standards, grossly underrated.This CD offers some of the best examples of her incredible voice I've heard since \\"Phantom\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ^_^","review":"I bought this CD when I was travelling in Asia.

Nothing like her Time to Say Goodbye CD.","review":"The type of songs on this album are nothing like the ones on Time to Say Goodbye. They're neither beautiful nor romantic. They sound very new age-ish and don't complement her beautiful voice. Instead of trying to mix a contemporary/pop flavor to her songs, she should stay with the more classical ones. The songs on this album do not leave you feeling inspired or wanting for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethreal, just beautiful","review":"Diva may be the wrong word for Sarah Brightman. Celine Dion and Whitney Houston are divas. Sarah is destined to be a legend in opera. She is one of the greatest sopranos ever to grace the stage. Yes, she may be only 5'2\\", but it's amazing how well she can carry her voice, considering most sopranos are larger than her. She shows great diversity in her album choices, and 'Eden' is one of the best. It doesn't reek of Andrew Lloyd Webber, but gives considerable depth to her voice, and expands it as she never has before. Many say she has been overhyped by the media; I think she hasn't received enough. Bravo, Sarah, or should I say Brava. I can't wait for the next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Gorgeous!","review":"Eden is a wonderful CD! It is by far the best of Sarah Brightman! I recommend this CD to anyone that appreciates beautiful music. My favorite song, I think, is track 16, \\"The Last Words You Said\\".

I was hoping Sarah Brightman's newest would be more of the same fascinating bridge from classical vocals to upscale pop. But, just as with her earlier cover of Queen's raging Who Wants to Live Forever, Kansas' Dust in the Wind is a BAD choice for Ms. Brightman's sweet and prim style. Much of the rest of the album is a bit boring, certainly not something I'm going to listen to over and over. I'm glad I didn't pay full price!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A splendid work wrought with passion.","review":"Ms. Brightman's voice is indeed a thing of beauty. Her songs denote passion, pain, and intensity in different form. This disc is definately a must-have, as it contains, in my opinion, the best work she has done solo in years. The title track, predictably enough I am afraid, happens to be my personal favorite from this particular disc, as it is complex yet very simplistic to varying degrees. Sarah's voice is so astounding that she is an ispiration to those of us who aspire to sing, even if simply doing so in the shower. Highly recommended, as the variety of songs on this disc make it a great listen anytime of the day or night."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Eden\\" - Ideal!","review":"This album brings together 3 really memorable pieces of music(\\"In Paradisum\\", Anytime, Anywhere\\", and \\"Scene d'Amour\\") and a hauntingly lovely voice.

A few tracks still have her doing her \\"opera voice\\", but by and large, if you are the type to enjoy fresh air and relaxation, then this CD is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff if its your kind of music","review":"I picked up this CD on a whim and loved it. The beautiful, flowing and sometimes haunting lyrics are truly serene. I would equate it to something a bit like Enya only with a little more of a pop/almost techno feel on some songs. On the whole, its a great CD to fall asleep to."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"\\"Eden\\" is excellent! I love Sara's new modern sound.

It is the first albun of hers that I own and I can see that her voice has come a long way from her Phantom of the Opera days. Dust in the Wind is spectacular and the latin version of the Titanic song is better that the original. I especially like the tracks Eden, Only An Ocean Way and The Last Words You Said. This album is a must have, and I wish Ms. Brightman continued success in the Future"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one yet!","review":"This is a must have for every sarah brightman fan.

'Phantom of the Opera' was a personal favorite. When I saw this title I bought it on a whim to see what her contemporary music was all about. Turns out it is FANTASTIC!! Even her rendition of 'My Heart Will Go On' (done in Italian (I think) blew me away...which is saying a lot considering I tend to switch channels if the original comes on the air. Give a listen on the product page or take a copy home to see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD!!!","review":"I have practically worn out \\"Eden\\" in the few days since it arrived in the mail. I'm a recent fan of Sarah Brightman, having seen her on public television doing a duet with Andrea Boccelli. By no means a student of music, I have come to appreciate the clarity, range and beauty of her voice. In the right mood, many of her songs bring me close to tears of joy. \\"Eden\\" seems to bridge the gap between classical and popular music in a lovely way. I loved \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\" perhaps as well; still trying to get used to \\"Dive\\". I am so pleased she is coming to Montreal on June 20th, I can't wait!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trust in God...Sarah Brightman will provide","review":"This is a very good CD, better than \\"Time to Say Goodbye,\\" and (dare I say it?) better than \\"Phantom!\\" Every song is good. I especially liked \\"Anytime Anywhere\\" and \\"Only An Ocean Away.\\" If you've never bought a Brightman album, buy \\"Eden.\\" Some of it reminds me of Goth band Switchblade Symphony...and yes, that's a deceptive name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"All the songs are great, a real masterpiece. Sarah has the most beatiful voice in the world and there is no one else like her. This album is a must for every serious music lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent voice but spoiled by its background music.","review":"Honestly,Sarah could have done her songs solo. Or she can sing with just one instrument. I'm so sorry Sarah I have to throw out this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing for Brightman fans","review":"Never have I been so disappointed in a cd as I am with this. Compared to \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\" (which is one of the best cds I own), it's hard to even imagine this is the same Sarah Brightman. Her voice sounds so incredibly weak and wispy, and the orchestrations completely overwhelm her, almost to the point of drowning out her voice entirely. Only on \\"Lascia Ch'io Pianga\\" does she even approximate the power she displays throughout on \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\". This is nothing more than elevator music at best. I will never play this cd again and I certainly won't buy another of hers without listening to it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"The singing is cloying; the music is mishmesh. Stay away!","review":"Barnes and Noble bookstores have been playing this CD for two months now. Nonstop. I can't stop them from doing further damage to my eardrums, so I'll do human-kind a favor by writing a review here. Right away, you notice that Brightman's voice is tiny; it even cracks at the high ranges. Like Franz Liszt's music, she alternates between loud and soft, then slow and fast. Every word is dragged out for no apparent reason other than to fill the CD? The songs are rinky dink but Brightman makes a big deal out of each one. In all, this stuff is cloying. And I understand Brightman had soprano training? And she has fans?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There may be something wrong with my CD copy...ALERT","review":"I played the EDEN CD last night (1st time) & I cound not hear Sarah's voice. The background was so loud that I had to put my ear to my speakers to hear her voice. At first I was angry that her beautiful voice was hidden behind \\"the background music\\". Then, a friend came over & said something must be wrong with that CD. Has anyone had this problem? Can you really hear her wonderful voice on this CD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to her best","review":"I'm a huge fan Sarah Brightman fan, but this CD is a stinker. Save yourself a trip to the trash and pass on this dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brightman STILL does not have it!","review":"Read these words carefully: she has no power, no volume, no dramatic ability whatsoever. Her limited vocal resources have no business in the Puccini repertoire. Listen to real artists such as the likes of Angela Gheorghiu, Ruth Ann Swenson,or Renee Fleming, before you call Sara Brightman an \\"Angel of Music.\\" As if! Merely possessing an agreeable tone quality with all the training in the world does not compensate for lack of voice. The world is loaded full of a vast amount of singers who have more talent in their little fingers than this fake. Listen to a clip from one of the artists above and then see how wonderful Brightman is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This CD struck me as a bizzare and pretentious mishmash. It moves so slowly and in so many different directions that you will probably be disappointed no matter what sort of music you enjoy. Sorry. Just one person's opinion, but a sincere one."},{"rating":"2","title":"exceptional","review":"Sarah Brightman has a voice with which you can find yourself lifted to joy or brought to tears. I listened to this cd with a friend who was totally unfamiliar with Sarah and she couldn't stop listening to it. \\"Deliver Me\\" is perhaps the most popular and best track while \\"Only An Ocean Away\\" is one very lyrically simplistic yet most moving songs on the cd. Overall a wonderful cd. I'd love to hear Sarah do a song with Delerium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best !","review":"I have many CD's of Sarah, maybe I miss an old one, but this CD is definitely the best for me. The atmosphere created in this recording is worth closed curtains, candlelight and incense. Let the magnificent start of the CD get into your head, relax and enjoy. Sarah's voice is best in the more classical numbers, especially Nella Fantasia, Tu and Nessun Dorma. That doesn't make songs like Eden, Only an ocean away and Deliver me less interesting or beautiful. On the contrary, all songs are of very high quality, beautiful and well brought. Only Dust in the wind could be left out, although probably many people will not agree, but I think that the original by Kansas just cannot be beaten."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Personal Favorite","review":"I gave this Sarah Brightman CD five stars because I find it to be my favorite. The opening with track 1 is brilliant and beautiful, simply beautiful. Also some other amazing tracks are 9, Tu, So Many things, Eden, and track 14. Of course Deliver Me, Dust in the Wind, Anytime, Anywhere are excellent. This album is the most diverse out of all of Sarah's, it includes some opera, pop like, and gothic like songs. This is a beautiful album that should apeal to everyone, not only opera and classical fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice from fairyland","review":"Sarah Brightman doesn't have a powerful voice. No matter. Her tone is as pure as snow. Listening to her is like hearing the voice of fairies.I love classical music. This isn't classical. I love popular and New Age music. This isn't either. What Sarah's music is, is her own. Her style doesn't fit into any one category, much to the dismay of those who require absolutes in their music styles.Sarah's CDs are very popular in my office. Eden is our favorite. Her pure tones take us out of the ordinary work routine and makes things seem special. This is a very special CD from a truly special artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah does it again Jewel","review":"As i said SB has done it again with eden.Combining interesting, haunting, and beautiful songs that make up eden. Take for instance In Paridisum, all the quietness and a wonderful vocal.Baleiro as a strange but also interesting song, and then my favorite,the haunting,Deliver Me. Pop or Opera, Sarah's music almost always seems to please me. Not so good as La Luna, but almost just as good. It is turn Wonderful and new and haunting. Very well done, I think. And Sarah even writes some of her own lyrics. Her voice is not small, only a bit high. Thank-You Sarah."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a hit!!!","review":"I bought the album without having listened to any of the previous albums. I love Texas music and Chingo doesn't disappoint. The beats are good and his flow is on point and hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"It sounds like the music is based on the artwork. This is the \\"Captain Planet\\" of music CDs. Of course, if you make a music CD that says \\"Yes, we can deport you all\\", it would be protested by these illegals whom can't vote anyways (well, legally, but they still do in Wisconsin and California)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible!","review":"I find it amazing that this book got published, considering its low level of scholarship.

Well, ever they have never read 'The Prince' or we just have really different opinions, because I literally could not put it down.Try it, you love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak to me...","review":"Yeah speak... my teacher wanted me to read it because I'm quiet like Melinda. So I bought it and read it. After I found out that she was raped I thought to myself... is this why my teacher wanted me to read this book? She thinks I'm quiet because she thinks I've been... OMG no! That would never happen to me! The truth is, it could happen to anyone if they are not careful. Trying to be popular and get drunk at a very early age will lead to trouble.Just for the record, I have not been raped...ever. I'm too shy to even go out with my blanket... if that makes sense.Overall speak was a good book... yep.(end.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Both Good and Bad","review":"Speak had both its good and bad moments. There were many slow parts during the book that seemed to be un-important to the story but at the same time built more background for the basis of Miranda's character. Speak had many funny and compelling moments and was a worthwhile book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Voice","review":"I thought this book was completely wonderful. The writing is very sharp and very witty - it brought back all of the angst of being an outsider in a world that values conformity. Anderson adeptly captures the thoughts of a girl who is struggling to remain true to herself in an extremely hostile world.As an adult, I couldn't put the book down. I would hesitate to recommend it to middle school kids, because the subject matter of rape might be too overwhelming. Actually I think it is appropriate for them, but some parents may disagree.Overall _Speak_ is a powerful and moving book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak--Spoke to Me","review":"This book was amazingly well written. I received this book for Christmas('99) and finished it the next day. I didn't want to put it down. The characters are portrayed in a way that relate to teenagers like myself. The author confronts a fear most girls and women don't want to even think about, much less experience. The main chracter, Melinda, spoke in a way that makes the reader understand the pain and fear that took control of her, keeping her from saying what needed to be said. This is one of the most touching books I have ever read. It inspires one to face their fears and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak","review":"In the novel Speak, Laurie Halse Anderson describes the main character, Melinda Sordina, as an outcast.

Her friends from the years before don't like her and she is having a hard time dealing with the traumatic event that occurred at the party. I would definitely recommend this book because it is very precise on some of the feelings that teenage girls have. Everyone feels alone at one time or another and the way Laurie Halse Anderson describes Melinda's emotions very accurately"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insiteful","review":"This book was very interesting. If I had been raped, I would of had that boy in court by tomorrow. This book tells of a girl's struggles after a traumatic experience. Struggles to live on, deal with it, and yes, to speak. Even though her life was at first sort of depressing, it got better. The character herself had a great personality, and a lot of teenage girls can probably relate to her. I know a girl who was raped as a child who refuses to tell her parents. We all probably know somebody, or know them and not know they were raped. Even though I usually go for the strong female image, this book was an exception. I couldn't put it down, I just had to see what happened. I will be sure to read all of the author's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak","review":"Speak is one of the best books I have ever read. Nothing compares to it. Melinda has so much to say but is too afraid too say it, but with one word she has her life back again. I was surprised when I read it because the author could compare such a dark reality with an everyday event like a party. Everyone thinks this can't happen but, it does. Melinda at first thinks that IT is her fault but it's not. She knows that IT happened and she can't change it but she doesn't have to suffer anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book- Bad Ending","review":"This was a really interesting book.

Based on the extremely enthusiastic recommendation of some of my high school students, I read \\"Speak\\" and knew right away I had found a book worth buying in quantity and studying in class. The hilarious, pointed observations of high school life alone make the book worth reading, but its understanding and insightful treatment of a serious problem makes it worth studying.Boys may object, calling it a \\"girl book,\\" but I predict that they will enjoy the book within the first few pages as they laugh at Melinda's wickedly funny comments on high school and later sympathize with her conflicted emotions about \\"Him.\\" Get this book, read it, enjoy it, and pass it on to a high schooler you know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"This is a good novel about a girl that is raped and a back to school party.

As she battles through an art project, other classes and lack of friends, Melinda finally opens up to someone only for them not to believe her. At the end Melinda finds her voice when she is confronted by the boy who raped her to begin with.I'll be honest. I didn't love this book until the end.

She creeps through her high school like a ghost, on the edges of life.Worse, no one seems to understand that Melinda is having serious problems and needs help. Everyone, from her parents to her teachers, just treat her as strange and troubled, demanding to know why she's suddenly \\"decided\\" to act this way. No one seems to wonder why a normal, happy girl would all but shut down.Anderson creates a believable character, ordinary in all ways yet remarkable in her silent suffering.

By calling the cops at the end of summer party screws up her freshman year of high school. Melinda starts freshman year with a secret that keeps her friends from talking to her. While no one knows her secret, she must tell someone. Melinda has a hard time in school with grades and teachers. Melinda stops caring about what she looks like and how she acts or how she dresses. She doesn't feel safe out in the open world. Melinda would rather be alone. I feel this book opens up minds about a new high school experience. Melinda starts to look out, and stand up for herself.

And make you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you pause and think","review":"I am not a teen but this book was recommended to me. It was quick paced (took less than a day to read it) and was compelling. It really makes you think about why people act the way they do.

Hopefully this book will give us all pause to be a bit kinder and more understanding.I think the author does a great job with the voice of Melinda... it rings true."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPEAK","review":"This bok was recommended to me by my 18 year old daughter.

In fact bought a copy and gave it to my counsellor for her library to loan to other victis out there that need to know it is okay to speak out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious and dark","review":"I found this book mysterious and dark. Ever since Melinda was attacked, her friends deserted her, so that high school was a nightmare.

She learns to stand up to her enemies and friends so that she can finally be herself.Speak left a haunting impression on me and I am glad I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"eoiughaeogi","review":"Speak was a very powerful, meaningful book. it's about a young teen who went to a party going into her freshman year in high school, drank and got raped by an older guy from her high school. she wound up calling the police and having her friends and everyone turn on her. it was not a great way to enter your first year of high school, with no friends, being raped and just not having a great summer. the book itself relates to teens in our society today. somehow i was just hooked from the beginning and it always made you want to read more.the book also gave a great message. it pretty much \\"spoke\\" to me. Laurie Halse Anderson pretty much gave me the interpretation that if something is wrong or soemthing is bothering you like that, or soemthing bad happened no matter what you need to speak out to someone, you can't have it trapped inside of you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words Of Emotion","review":"Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson is one of those special books that comes along once in a great while. It is a novel that will touch the hearts of many young females, but will also appeal to the male, seeing that I read the book and enjoyed it thoroughlly. We meet Melinda, and are taken away into her depressed and sedated world. We wonder why this young freshman is the way she is, why she feels so alone, why she has a horrible outlook on life, and why she never talks. The novel symoblizes the typical teenage life, being exact on almost every topic and opinion that is addressed in the novel. Laurie Halse Anderson shows here that she is a phenomnol writer. One who knows her audience and strikes home with them. She writes words of emtion, and makes us feel weak at heart, which is the message she is trying to deliever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy and Amazing book.","review":"SPEAK is an amazing and entrancing book that is a definite must read for anyone of any age.

This book was so beautiful because of how it portayed Melinda's life & her witty sarcasm was very remarkable for a debut novel. I didn't want to put it down & you almost felt her struggle & the end was very triumphant & touching & it made the book worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Book","review":"I thought this book was amazing. Some parts hitt a little too close to home for me. But parts like the 10 Lies They Will Tell You In High School and her pep rally experiances made the book totally worth reading. I'm sorry to say I am a pathetic reader, but I just couldn't put this book down. I recomend it to anyone who finds humor in the halls of high school. It's not for anyone who has never experienced being left out or who can honestly say their in the \\"in crowd.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerfully Written","review":"Speak was nothing less than extraordinary. Anderson wrote a powerful, compelling novel in a contemporary style. Her bold use of sequence and emotion that comes through Melinda give you a sense that you are standing right in front of her, watching the entire story play out. It is no wonder that the list is quite long for all of the awards and recognitions this book has received. I think it deserves 5 out of 5 stars, because I find very few faults in this book. There is no lack of description or character revelations.Not only does Speak raise awareness of date rape victims, it sheds light on the social pressures of sex in high schools. The author highlighted specific points such as her losing her friends due to her standing up and calling the police that broke up the party in which she was raped by a guy three years her senior. Not only that, but the pressures of her home life with her parents not being there for her. Melinda becomes reclusive, her only outlet is painting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak","review":"Speak is about a girl,her name is Melinda who is 14 years old.

My body shivered in fright, and smiled very bright. Melinda a main charecter was an outcast, no one wanted to talk to her, sit next to her. She was a loner and a gonner in this school. She was like this because she called the cops on the last day of summer party. She couldn't tell why, she couldn't even rememmber what happened. Then when she started taking art classes she found a way to tell people what happedned with out using words. The author had great intentions for the readers one of them was don't be afraid to do something even though people are going to hate after. I recommend this book to people who like real life things and have something hard and long to think about. Will Melinda tell her secret. What is her secret. Those questions you will have to find out by reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak","review":"Laurie Halse Anderson's novel Speak is a touching story about a teenage outcast's struggle to speak. Melinda's first year at Merryweather High is a lonely one with no friends and no escape. Her sarcasm and wit conceal the deep secret she holds inside and serve as a comic relief. She is isolated by her classmates, and she becomes quieter every day. Her parents try to get her to talk to them, but her secret stifles her. Only Melinda and a senior, Andy Evans, know the haunting secret she holds inside. She has no one to turn to so she expresses her feelings through her artwork in her art class with Mr. Freeman. In the end Melinda inspires the reader when she overcomes her battle by shattering the silence. This novel is filled with an explosion of emotions and will leave you speechless. I enjoyed this novel thoroughly, and I certainly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak Review","review":"Freshman, Melinda Sordino, starts high school depressed and outcast.

This book is about a teenage girl, Melinda Sordino, who was raped at a party and then called the police. She becomes a total outcast and all her old friends are now enemies. This book is excellent because it has an inspirational ending and everything is modeled like a high school year. I finished the book in two days because I wanted to see what happened next. I would recommend this book for any high school student.Niemietz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak!!!!!","review":"Wonder what it is like being an outcast at your high school? What about turning into this outcast all of a sudden, when you used to be just like all the other kids?That is what Melinda Sardino, the main character in Laurie Halse Anderson's \\"Speak\\", feels like. Something happened to her during her summer going into 9th grade, that made her call the cops at a party, causing everyone to hate her. The problem for Melinda is that she doesn't have anyone to talk to about it. None of her friends from middle school like her anymore, and they all separated into different clans. Will Melinda find new friends? Will she find someone to talk to, someone she can trust, so she can tell everything that happened to her? There is only one way to find out, and that is reading the book.I really liked this book because it connects with a lot of things i have seen in high school. It is about a typical 9th grade student struggling to survive through her first year of high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read on the hardships of adolesence","review":"This book is about a young girl struggling with her peers.

This is an issue that all young women need to be aware of and sadly prepared for.The book covered a sensitive issue in what I believe to be a true to life way. I'm sure reading this book will help victims of rape realise that as much as they may blame themselves they are victims... it's not their fault!"},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"I don't know what all this fuss is about. I read this book a while ago, and it's not that I didn't like it, but I didn't love it either. The language is kind of boring, it's not a 'read it in a day or else' book, you are not curious about the end or the twists that might happen... and so on. It's about a girl who goes through a frightening experience and loses her self confidence. I'm not saying I don't feel symphathy; it's just that there are many books out there that are worth reading and worth 5 stars other than this one. Don't waste this time unless you have no books to read other than this one. Or you LOOOVE stories with troubled teens. In that case, I would recommend Robert Cormier; not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPEAK REVIEW","review":"THE TITLE OF THE BOK IS SPEAK AND THE AUTHOR LAURIE H ANDERSON.

I recomend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't ever forget to Speak","review":"I was a little skeptical when I picked this book up from the library, but I gave it a shot and am glad I did.

No one but her and The Beast know what really happened that night. She slowly finds her voice again when one of her ex friends begins to date The Beast.

I read it in the 8th grade and what was ridiculous was that it had been hidden away in my school library's somewhat \\"restricted\\" section. In order to check out this book, a parent signature was required.. But when I read the book, I couldn't believe my school did not allow this book to be on normal shelves. It's great and theres nothing shocking or appalling about it that would make it deserve to be on the restricted section. Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring","review":"The characters have no depth and the book is very cliche. The biggest problem is that the book is written at a very low reading level (I'd say about 4th or 5th grade) but is meant for older teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boys should read it, too","review":"Wow. This book has hit a home run with every kid in my school who's read it--male or female. Captures the torture this girl endures when peer judgment crashes down on her.

She never fit in the groups or anything. What I liked about this book was it talked about this girl and her hole life story. Like she never fit in at school or she never had friends. Everything she did there would be a problem behind it. What I didn't like about the book is it dragged on I mean it would be on the same topic for the longest time. Ohther than that I really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written!","review":"Speak was an amazing book. I, being a teenager, can easily relate to some of the factors in the book.

Anderson is a fantasic author and has done an excellent with one of her first novels, Speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful must read","review":"Several people told me to read this book and I finally got around to starting it one weekend afternoon. Well, I couldn't put it down. The language arts department at my school is considering making it a core reading requirement for our 7th graders. The voice that is given to the young woman in the novel is amazing and pulls the reader deep into the story. You can feel the pain and the isolation that many young people feel. It is also a powerful book for anyone who has experienced any sort of abuse in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak","review":"The book that I read was Speak. In the story there was a girl who went to a party and called the cops. After she did that nobody wanted to be her friend. All of her old friends ignored her or laughed at her. She had very bad grades except she was good at art. During the time she had a friend called Heather but Heather becomes embarrassed and ends up not being her friend. She has parents who never cook and just leave post-it's every time they want to tell her something. In school she found an old janitors closet that was abandoned so she decided to make it her special place just for her. She is an outcast. The people who would like this book are people who like journal type books and like to listen to what people have to say. It is a good book for middle school kids and adults too. It is the best book I have read all year. You should buy it because you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book was great. In the begining it tells you that something happened to this girl named Melinda at some beer drinking party and you cant put the book down untill you find out what that was. She becomes depressed and despised when she calls the cops at that party. her frineds wont talk to her and everyone else at that school wont talk to her. In the end she conquers her fear of a guy in the book that \\"hurt\\" her, and defeats the anxiety of being alone and depressed. She gives hope to people who read this book. She will show you that anything is possable and to never let people walk all over you. It taught me to stand up for myself and to never let anyone do anything that they dont want to do. This was a great book and is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did we go to the same highschool","review":"Ok, obviously I'm an adult reader. This is a fabulous book on a topic that unfortunately is part of reality, and also unfortunately is one women/girls are ashamed to speak up about. Her approach to a sensitive topic and her empowering ending are enough to recommend this book alone.But the highschool she set it in was so real, I was having flashbacks. We had the same mascot, the same jokes about our mascot, the same enemy school mascots, latin club, the same cliques, the uncomfortable mix of kids who flaunt their family's wealth with kids who are from economically average families, the same lunch room politics, the same weather. But I'm from the midwest, not the east coast. Her lists of lies they tell you on the first day of school fit my school perfectly. She hit straight to the gut of what it is to be in highschool. I'd managed to forget about all that."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, a must read","review":"Melinda started off her first year of high school at a bad start. After calling the cops at a summer party her life changed in many ways. Her best friends split up into differnt groups and abandon her.

Through her drawings in Mr.Freemens class and the support from him she begins to reach out to others. In the ending of the novel Andy Evans comes after her again. She shows him this time that she wont let him do the same thing he did before she speaks out and realizes that this is what she should of done from the start.I felt that this book very good because it relates to many teenage girls in highschool and the different groups that they can grow into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak","review":"I think that this book was a very interesting book and I liked it very much. I thought that the events in this book were based on true life experiences. The events in this book show how hard it is to live as a teenager and not to make the same mistakes.

I thought that some parts were not very understandable, but i still liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak","review":"New to high school, Melinda Sordino finds her friends have disowned her, and classes are much more difficult than she expected. Armed with a sarcastic and even sometimes sardonic attitude, she sets out to make the best of things. Unfortunately, her friends' relentless silent treatment and her less-than-adept teachers cause her plans to fall through.Faced with no one to talk to and her far below adequate grades, Melinda does the only thing she can think of: not talk. But instead of simplifying things, her troubles only seem to multiply with her newfound silence.Anyone who's ever felt left out will enjoy this story. I found Melinda wry and easy to relate to, and her stereotypical high school seemed a facsimile of mine. Speak is a must read for any high school student, or even anyone who's ever been to high school. Laurie Halse Anderson does a wonderful job bringing that sad, sarcastic little person who lives inside us all to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak","review":"This was a very good book. It was about Melinda, and something bad happened to her during a summer party.

Everyone is against her, even her former best friend. The only way she lets out her emotions in through Mr. Freeman's art class. Melinda shuts herself out from everything, her parents, her former friends, even giving up in school. I think that this book is a good read for teens because it puts a new perspective on the people that are outcast in real life. It makes you think twice before judging them as weird or anti-social."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Well...I dind't think this one was GREAT, but I did enjoy it.I still am bothered by the way Melinda refused to talk throughout mostfo the story. Also, she talked about her friends rejecting her...maybe if she had TRIED to talk to them, none of this would've happened. Thats what I kept thinking throughout most of the story. JUST TALK TO YOUR (former) FRIENDS!I found this to be quite annoying. All in all, it was an interesting book...but a few things just weren't explained well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Through Highschool","review":"Forget what it was like in highschool? If you read Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson It'll be a blast from the past of if you're going through it right now.Speak is the kind of book that brings you into the story, you feel bad for Melinda and get mad at other people for her. This book describes very well how highschool girls and cliques are. I think that the author is very good at describing how Melinda is feeling.Melinda Sordina is the main character. She was at a party at the end of her 8th grade year. She Called the police and got all of her friends in trouble, some were ever arrested. Going into her freshman year of highschool everyone hated her because of the party.I think this book was very good especially if you like suspence, sad, scary, emotional books. This book keeps your attention til' the very end and makes you pity Melinda and gets you emtionally attached to the characters. I really enjoyed reading this book and would recomend it for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Moving","review":"This book made my heart go out to all young ladies who have been raped.

The content is extremely meaningful. Laurie HAlse Anderson uses this book to express to teens the idea that nothing can be done to help unless you'll talk to some one. This books theme ad and purpose are extremely wonderful, as is the story line. This book is excellent for Literature projects for eight and ninth grade students, or a grat book to read just because. I found \\"Speak\\" a respectable novel due to the fact that it discusses real problems that other authors are afraid to write about. All together this is an extremely good book that you find yourself not wanting to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"fight back","review":"I loved this book! The girl learns to fight back against her rapist.She starts out being an outsider and at the end because she fight back against the guy who raped her everyone start being her friend and respecting her. At one part she sticks piece of glass on the guy because he trys to rape her again in a broom closet i loved that part. In this story she reminds me of myself she doesn't talk to people as much untill she stands up and opens up to everyone.At one point she talks about hating school and wondering why there are so many groups that spit up like prep ,jocks,and freaks. I recomend this book to any one who is hiding from soemone who has hurt them in some way and wants to stand up ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak","review":"There are only a few people who dare to write about rape. But the truth is it DOES happen and it can really screw people up. I could really relate to the way that Melinda was feeling. There are a lot of teens who feel like they don't fit in and Laurie Halse Anderson really did a good job about portraying how teens feel. This book had chills running up my spine. I felt really sorry for Melinda because of the way nobody really understood what really happened to her. They all thought she just wanted to rat out the party when really she had been raped, she was scared and she called the police. I loved this book from beginning to end and I would recommend it to teens AND adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn'd like it","review":"it had writing in it and it was all wrinkled. the only reason i got it used was because i needed it cheap and fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Voice Broke The Piercing Silence","review":"Melinda was thirteen years old when IT hurt her.

Now everyone hates her for ruining the party. All her friends desert her, she is stuck as a mute out cast. She has no friends. Finally she stands up to IT, her voice is finally heard. Her silent cries for help were found, and she became a stronger person inside. Her voice broke the barrier between her and lonliness and hurt. This was an amazing book that I couldn't put down! Usually it takes me awhile to finish books, but this one took me 2 days! I almost cried when Melinda confessed what happened at the party. It was exciting yet very sad when IT would come near her and hurt her. I am 12 years old and this book is my favorite book of all times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silence is never Golden","review":"I read this book when I was a freshman in high school. Although it has been three years since I first read it, it has never left my mind. To read a book with such originality at such a young age is hard to find. Most girls my age were reading a book on their favorite pop star. Well not me. I yearned to find a meaningful book on which I could find hope and fear, love and hate in. This was my answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant and Hopeful","review":"Speak is one of the most honest works of fiction I have read, and I highly recommend it to all. For those who have been victims of any kind of abuse and those who have perpetrated the same, Laurie Halse Anderson gives readers of Speak a realistic and penetrating account of the effects of violent acts and words. In a world filled with bullying and oppression, novels like Speak may stand as a beacon of hope for victims and as a poignant informant for would-be or current abusers about the intense damage facilitated by abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are hardly any words for \\"Speak\\"","review":"My English class never got the chance to read this book during the year, so my teacher let me take it home for the summer. As soon as I started it, I wouldn't stop reading. The author captures the reader and never lets go until the last page. The haunting story of Melinda is easy for teens to relate to, whether they've gone through the exact experiences as the character or not. Everyone has problems talking to some people, whether it is from humiliation or fear, and it's tough to overcome. This book is a quick read, but there's so much to get out of it it's not the usual young adult novel. The symbolism of Melinda's problems and the problems she has trying to make her art project (a tree, of all things!) \\"tell a story,\\" is very clear and very clever. \\"Speak\\" is filled with so much raw emotion you can't help but laugh in some parts, and reach for the Kleenex box in others. And you'll remember the powerful ending for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak your mind.","review":"After reading this, I felt really proud of who I was as a person and as a girl. The courage and the strength of the main character's words can be felt coursing through your veins. She had such a poignant and profound voice that made her such a creatively, interesting heroine. You understand the power of her silence and the urgency to find herself again. There's so much to be heard and said when you want someone to look at you and know that there's something wrong, but you don't have the heart. It's such a rewarding story with a tremendous amount of spirit. It's such a universal novel and yet so small but with a huge impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak","review":"I have never been touched by a book. I have never been emotionally attached to the main character, relating to them, crying for them, laughing at the things they think or say. Speak did all of those things for me. Its a brillant book. Truely brillant. The symbollism in it is also extremely simple to spot, yet still brillant. Theres no other word for it, just brilliant. You get inside Melinda's mind. You feel for her. The ending is so gripping, so perfect. She has to do a tree project in art and she just cant get it right. She has a tree in her front yard that has a dead branch, and in order to live the branch needs to be cut off. As soon as she realizes she needs to saw the dead branch, so to speak, off of her spiritual tree, she cant live and she wont get her tree for art right. The description of her teachers is hilarious and perfect.. Read this book. Its my favorite book of all time and ive re-read it millions of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"My thoughts on Speak","review":"This book is very good because it talks about the life of a troubled teenager.

Melinda is a freshman and a lot of people know what it is like to be in high school at that age. Melinda has no friends and people she doesn't even know hate her. She is an outcast.The plot is very realistic about some of the situations teenagers face everyday. Melinda went to a party and got drunk and raped. The setting is very easy to connect with. This setting takes place in a high school. This setting is easy to connect to because we have all been in high school before and we know the challenges it holds.

So read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book worth reading","review":"When Melinda goes through the worst year of school with no friends at all, she isn't the happiest person in the world but is expected to be by her teachers and parents. She has no friends due to the fact that she called the police at a party,why she called the cops is a secret and I'm not telling.As I read Speak I felt as though i was friends with all of the charactors.

It was different from any other bookI have ever read. The story takes place in Syracuse, New York and it explores Melinda's freshman year in high school. She is an outcast; her friends dumped her and the other kids don't like her either. As the story unfolds, you discover little secrets and find out what happened to make her this way, what it was that caused the pain to make her practically go mute.

You have to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"This is simply just a great read; I could NOT put it down for the life of me. By far, the best book I have ever read. I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever you say can and will be used against you","review":"Speak is an amazing read for anyone. While it is targeted towards Young Adults, I think it would be a good book for parents to read as well. Perhaps parents could read more YA books and it might actually give them a better understanding of their own teenagers. This gives the reader a good insight into the theory that there are two sides to every story. Not only does the unspoken character have to deal with the horrid aftermath of rape pulling at her emotional soul, but she can't talk about it to anyone. Fear of rejection, peer pressure, and teen angst play a major part in this powerful coming-of-age story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit right to home...","review":"This book was so amazing and familiar. Not familiar concerning me, but many people that I do know. It made me think and I really understood some of the hardships this character faced.

But what if you had a good reason to call the police like Melinda Sordino? Wouldn't that make a difference? Probably, only if Melinda actually told someone what had happened. But if she did tell what had happened at that party, and she accepted what happened and that what happened wasn't her fault, Melinda's carefully built facade would be shattered. So she will not speak of what happened. Wonderfully written book that takes you inside Melinda's mind and you will se how strong of a person she really is and will have you cheering her on throughout the whole story."},{"rating":"2","title":"How was Speak?","review":"The book Speak is a wonderful book for teenage girls because it tells the accounts of a how a fourteen-year-old girl was raped. The main character Melinda starts off here first year of high school being an outcast who has no friends. She \\"ruined\\" the biggest party of the summer by calling the police. The reason she called the police was because a senior Andy Evans raped her not because she wanted to ruin the party. This book shows how Melinda's life is though her freshman year of high school. I like this book so much because I can relate to her, not that I have been raped but how other people my age live. The book also taught me a lesson to always be aware because some day I to could be raped too.

I strongly encourage that you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest books","review":"Were you ever scared as a freshman in high school? If so this is the book for you. It is a book about a freshman girl who has problems with her freinds. But most important is what happened on one cool night before school started, & what speak is really about.Laurie Halse Anderson gives a perfect description of what it's like being a teenage girl in her freshman year. Melinda sordino is a private person. She doesen't wan't to tell what happened that one night before school started & I think she should speak up. She go's to merryweather highschool & has a secret abandoned janitors room.Hopefully you will read this book. You will be amazed in how overwhelming melinda's life is. I'm sure you won't copy her because it would be hard to copy her life. This is a good book & I reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outraged","review":"Where have our morals gone? As an adult, I can understand and appreciate the content of this story. However, my 13 year old daughter found the main character just plain weird. Melinda is inadequately coping with a traumatic event. She is suffering from depression and needed intervention. The story goes on and on trying to show she is an outcast. Do not confuse \\"outcast\\" with depression. An average American teenager does not have the wisdom or maturity to recognize the difference. This story needs to be followed up with a discussion on how to handle rape-medically and emotionally. As a medical professional I was disgusted that Melinda never received any professional help-now that would be a teaching moment for teenagers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the school but the big mystery was no mystery","review":"The writing in this book is good.

I felt that the resolution, when it came, was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"We ordered this book for my son's english class. We did not want to spend lots of money on a book that would only be read once and then pu aside. So we decided to order a used one. You cannot tell that this book had been read before. The condition was excellent. It would have been better if the shipping time was less, but we did receive it in the time promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, maybe I had high expectations","review":"I thought that the main character, Melinda, would lose her voice or get sick where she lost her voice, from the other reviews I had read. It actually didn't happen. She just didn't talk around adults and picked at her lips.I like the overall message. It is satisfying at the end. But I think it could have been written better. It fell flat for me. There weren't enough descriptions. The character development was superficial. It seemed everyone had a role and that was the only role they played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Read In A While","review":"This was one of the only books I finish in a day because I can't put it down. The heroine, Melinda is similar to me in highschool. What makes this a good book is that Melinda can be anyone and even a small part of her personality is found in everyone. The only reason I didn't give this book an extra star was because the ending didn't really end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read book","review":"speak is about a girl (melinda) who is a freshman.Last year there was a big party.something happend at that party that made her want to call the cops.all her old friends wouldn't talk to her because of that.but if only they knew what happend to her that night.

This is a great book, even though it's about rape, it puts you in the head of someone elses trauma and how it affects them. The fact that the boy who did it thought it was funny would just push me to tell even faster. If you're a person who doesn't like to read but has to choose this book!

All teenagers, and parents of teenagers should read this book. It touches wonderfully (with wit and raw emotion) on a subject far too overlooked in high school education and society today, and offers a character many girls can relate to and others could learn from. From someone who cried with Melinda, not just for her, I recommend this book with all my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maya Angelou would be proud of you, Laurie","review":"After hearing Laurie Halse Anderson speak at the 2000 International Reading Association convention, I was moved to read her novel, Speak. It captured the feelings that my young adult students feel about being on the outside looking in. It uses fantastic allusions to Maya Angelou's, I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings. I thought Speak could touch the heart of any young reader on a journey to find their place in the world. Read It! I can't keep it on my bookshelf. The author deserves all the compliments I could give. She is delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emily's Speak Book Review","review":"Laurie Halse-Anderson's novel, Speak, is a riveting story about a teenage girl starting her high school days as an outcast. The main character, Melinda, had called the cops on the end-of-the-summer bash and everyone is busted. The reason for calling the cops is something Melinda keeps deep inside and does not reveal until the end. This novel shows Melinda as she struggles with many difficult aspects of high school and her home life. She has trouble speaking to people and expressing her true emotions. Though she's still very apprehensive, one person she starts to open up to is Mr. Freeman, her art teacher. He has taught her how to express her feelings through art and also told her he'd always be there to listen. Will Melinda finally open up to him or anyone, and find her voice? I enjoyed this novel because it was realistic and detailed. It is a book that brings forth a mixture of emotions. It will make you laugh, cry, and yell out in anger. I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This book is a very touching story.

It's about a young teenager named Melinda. She goes to a high school where no one speaks to her because of an incident that happened last summer at a party. She speaks to no one about that summer. During the party she called the cops and everyone found out that it was Melinda who called the cops. A lot of her friends got arrested for drinking and taking drugs. But no one knows why she called the cops. It wasn't because they were drinking. It was something else, something she can't speak of.This book is a sad and dramatic story. You should read this book. Don't you want to find out what happened to Melinda....What really happened to her? Find out why she called the cops and why she won't speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Good Book by Job David P3R4","review":"This is about a girl named Melinda Sordino. She is new at the Merryweather High School. She does not have any friends or have cool teachers. At the end of summer, she stood in the middle of a drunken crowd and she called 911 because she needed help. So her old friends won't talk to her, and people she doesn't know hate her from a different. The safest place for her is to be alone, inside her own head. But thats not safe because there's something she's trying not to think about, something about the night or the party that, if she let it in, would blow her carefully constucted disguise to smithereens. And then she would have to speak the truth.This book is very exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DEFINATELY HATED THIS BOOK","review":"Ok, from the very beginning this apathetic character bores me to death. Although you and many other people who have read this book may think this book is deep and emotional, I'd have to say it's the exact opposite. The only good part is the end.Why? well obviously because it's the end of that book and I can spend my time more meaningfully doing other things. The other reason is because it is a surprisingly fast-paced and refreshing ending that just makes up for the rest of the blandness in this book--which is 90%.Yes, this is a serious problem. She doesn't speak, she destroys her lips because she can't speak, and the Person is still lurking around her school.Props for a good idea. but no cigar for depth, character development, writing style, and it's overratedness.Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"Speak is one of those books that you keep reading thinking it will get better. Thinking you will finally reach the climax. Well, there is no climax, and it definetly doesn't get any better. There is no plot to this story. Speak is written through the eyes of a teenage outcast. It is in the form of her journal. If you like books that don't follow a story line and have no definite point, you will love this one. By the end you are tired of hearing this girl complain. I definetly do not recomend this book to anyone! I give it two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"Ok maybe because i was forced by my english teacher to read this book, it shafted my view, but this is seriously the most awful book i have ever read. Melinda is a depressed freshman, and doesnt know how to deal with it. she thinks about suicide and constantally dis's other people at her school. Yes she did get raped, but other people have gotten raped and delt with it in other ways than that. Basically my whole class thought that this book was terriable. It was written well, but after the first half you knew what was going to happen. The only thing that i did not understand is how no one noticed anything. I mean she cut her self and constantally skipped shcool and didnot talk. This is where her parents, classmates, etc should have noticed something. Yes they did hater her, but her \\"best friend\\" should have notice something and so should have ehr teachers. This book sucked and was unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of offensive language and adult subject matter","review":"Melinda, a freshman, is considered an outcast at Merryweather High School because she supposedly busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops.

There is excitement on almost every page. Every page is filled with a new complication every time the main character, Melinda Sordino, turns the corner. Sometimes the book seems a little boring but the author, Laurie Anderson, makes her writing flow so that the reader never gets bored. This book is well written and states a universal theme. It tells of struggle and tells of fighting for what you believe in. I found the writing style to be rather interesting and unique.

She thinks she knows but it wasn't her fault, she had to do it.

She just doesn't know how to tell anyone what happened she thinks it's her fault when it's NOT! She holds it all inside and it drives her crazy. People at school pick on her about it.

I've been considering adding this book to a curriculum I'm creating for 8th/9th/10th grade. Laurie Halse Anderson certainly knows her way around the often dark high school hallways.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. A++++++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"very touching, a must 2 read for anyone!!","review":"This book is amazing. It didn't let my attention off of it through out the whole thing. I think it is very touching because it made me cry by the end. A girl gets raped during a party while she was drunk, and then hides her fear for the guy who happens to go to the same school. It involves friendships, teachers, parents, and her passion to draw. Its AMAZING, one word describs it all, and im not just saying that. YOU HAVE TO GO READ IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter reality","review":"The isolation, fear and pain of Melinda in 'Speak' is the bitter reality of High School life for some. The way in which her 'friends' react to her when she most needs them is disturbingly typical and adds to the mean world in which she is struggling to survive. If you are ostracized at school you will recognize yourself and perhaps this will help you endure it all. Even as the author explores the most sad situations she does so with humor, wit and grace that inspire the reader to hope and care deeply. How can all this be fun and make you laugh? Anderson's skill and deft use of humor makes this a book to both understand the bitter realities of life and to laugh at them."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful - could easily relate to","review":"I loved this book because it was like I had written it myself. I haven't gone through the exact same thing as the character, but she would relay my exact feelings as I have suffered through depression. It's one of those books you can either totally relate to on a personal level, or not at all. After all, often that is whtat makes a good book. My favorite excerpts are: \\"When people don't express themselves, they die. One piece at a time.\\" \\"I'm the only one sitting alone, under the glowing neon sign which reads, 'Complete and Total Loser, Not Quite Sane. Keep Away. Do Not Feed.\\" This book made me laugh and it made me cry. I love the author's style.

When Melinda attends the beginning of high school none of her friends wants to talk her anymore. Now she has no friends. When she walks around school everyone talks about her.The reason why the book is called \\"Speak\\" is because they want Melinda to speak for her rights and say what really happened at the party.

So from that day on everyday she would walk down the hallway in school and she could hear everyone talking about her.

It follows Melinda Sordino, a girl hated by her peers since she busted a wild end of summer party by calling the police. Alienated by her friends and alone, Melinda plummets into a world of silence, surrounded only by her thoughts. The style of writing in this book was cool, with different headings to describe each entry...it was almost like a journal. Melinda's thoughts are hilarious at times, and tearjerking at other times as she explores herself through art class, befriends geeky \\"martha\\" wannabe Heather and struggles with her issues at home. The ultimate question is, what caused her to call the cops and silence herself? Read this book and find out!

When Melinda finally finds her voice and speaks out, the reader feels Melinda's hard-won strength.

All of us were moved by Anderson's dark, yet witty and often funny prose. This is the story of a teenage girl who experiences a horror that is all too real for so many young women. Our heroine suffers silently through an awful school year as she slowly learns to trust, heal, and speak up.You will find yourself laughing at Anderson's sharp and knowing depictions of high school social structure, parent-teenager relations, and teachers who just don't get it. You will cry in frustration and sadness at the heroine's pain and wonder how everyone around her can be so oblivious. You will cheer at her ultimate triumph and find yourself wanting more of her story. I strongly recommend this book to teenage girls and women of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"* SpEaK *","review":"I would recommend this book to all teenagers.The name of the book is \\"Speak\\" by Laurie Halse Anderson.I liked this book, because it talks about the emotions and reactions of situations that would actually happen.This book talks about a likfe of a student that has just satrted Merryweather high-school.

By calling the police at an end-of-summer bash, she is now officially considered a loser. With her old friends gone, Melinda no longer speaks to anyone; even her new \\"best friend,\\" Heather.This novel on self-discovery, empathy, and social acceptance is simply breathtaking.Without a doubt, SPEAK is a phenomenal book. It is emotional, inspirational, gripping, and surprisingly funny. It is told from Melinda's poignant, outspoken point of view. Anderson perfectly depicts the cliques, heartbreaks, and reality of high school. This book will grip you from cover to cover.SPEAK captured my heart with it's sarcastic sense of humor and perfect portrayal of high school.

For anyone who knows someone who suffered sexual abuse, or has been through it themselves, this book is extremely relateable. I really enjoyed reading it, and highly recommend it. For teen readers who are struggling with depression or anxiety, the character is very easy to connect with."},{"rating":"2","title":"To all interested and those haters","review":"To all those haters out there: you complain about the predictability of the novel, the mature content, how boring it was, etc. Has it ever occurred to you that there was a deeper meaning you didn't grasp? This novel is not an exciting story. It is supposed to get a point across, and if you read carefully, you will find it.To all those hoping to read: This book is wonderful. This is not meant to be an action-packed story. Anderson is trying to make a point. If you understand the meaning behind this book, you will appreciate it.

Reading stories that carry themes of self-growth and empowerment is always a joy because it is something that all can relate to. The protagonist ventures off into a horizon in search of identity and solidifies a voice that projects harmonious tunes. Anderson's writing is simplistic, but highly endearing because it amplifies an astonishing magnitude of vividness and life. The author personifies the very essence of what it means to be a teenager and magnifies the various sensations that one goes through in the process whether it be anger, defeat, triumph, joy, etc. All in all, Speak is a wonderful and captivating story that outlines the very beauty of setting sail and searching for the missing element that completes the self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"It was a great book!

I've read it 6 times and it still rocks.I can totally picture myself as Melinda Sordino. I can imagine everything she's going through, and all of her pain. People said this book was unrealistic? Unrealistic was Annie's Baby! This book is one of the most realistic teen books I have read in a long time.Clearly the people that didn't like it must not have understood it very well. Adjectives are used very well, and everything is so descriptive. Each character I could picture as one of my friends.Please, please buy this book, and if you don't like it, give it to somebody else as a birthday gift, because this is one book you SHOULDN'T leave somewhere at the back of your bookshelf.

This book is about a girl named Melinda who had a great life until one summer when she went to a party with her friend Rachel and ends up getting raped and calling the cops. She tells no one what had happened to her the night of the party, there for she goes through her first year of high school alone and silent because nobody wants to be her friend anymore. I really liked the end of this book I don't want to give it away but let's just say she finds a way to let her fear of people knowing go and expresses herself in a way that she feels she has not been able to, and the best part is she doesn't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why 4 stars???","review":"4 stars because the book was great and had a great moral lesson and You may want to put the book down at the begining and never read it because it is boring, but before you do, please read this!

So please read this book it's great and teaches you a lesson, a good lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, mysterious","review":"This book was about a girl who didn't really have any friends. No one ever really talked to her because before school started, she was at a party, and she called the police. Everyone thought she just did it to get busted, but there was a reason behind it that she didn't tell anyone. She doesn't really talk anymore, but enjoys spending time with herself in her closet. She also likes working on the art project her teacher assigned her. Towards the end, she tells people the reason for her calling the police, and people begin to understand why she did it. It was a really good book, and there's a really good lesson behind the whole plot. It was fun to read, and I think a lot of people would enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak","review":"Ever wonder how reputations start?Well in the book Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson.It tells you exactly how your reputation can affect your high school life.Your reputation make or brake you.Melinda Sordino was a lot of fun to be around and had a lot of friends in middle school.Then at this end of summer party she had a few drinks met a this senior that liked her so they danced.Then something happened so she called the cops,because she didn't know who to tell or what to say.then at school she was given the label snitch.In high schoolnone of her friends like her anymore, and half the school thinks she is wierd.She was depressed and didn't say much until the end of the year,and one boy saw through to real her and became her friend.Melinda expressed her feelings through her art,and by talking with her art teacher Mr Freeman and he showed her how to.

The story went on for ever, even thouggh it was only 200 pages. It was boring and the characters were un-exciting. The story-line could have been so much better if the author told her secrete in the beginning instead of the very end. The idea of this girl going on and on and on about her problem and not even telling us what it is.Maybe if she said it at the beginning i wouldn't hate the charcter so much. She just sat there and let her stupid friends make fun of her and everything. If your into low-self esteem and un-exciting characters this book is for you. but if your like me and like those tough, strong and cool characters I don't recomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Stinks","review":"Our teacher is reading it to us and I am finding it very lame. I am a 16 year old female, btw, so this is supposed to be for people of my ages interest.....but....For starters: It is very predictable to tell \\"what happened at the party\\" (a big catch phrase in the book) by page 75 Melinda has given you enough clues to figure out the big secret. Melinda also is hateful. She critizises \\"death junkies\\", cheerleader, \\"404's\\", and other groups of highschool students.This is a very juvinile book. For a real story on rape i reccomend \\"When Rabbit Howls\\". This is a truly horrifying account of rape that drew a girl's mind to develop multiple personalities *has some explict content*But yes, I found Speak very very very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I picked up this audio book from the small selection available at my library. Reading the back cover, the premises of the story sounds interesting enough, however, once the story began, the \\"interesting\\" quickly disapated.Very quickly, any reader can figure out exactly what's going to happen in the rest of the book. It left for nothing interesting later on. The story is told by a freshman high-school girl who was raped during the summer by another member of her school and her thoughts and struggles from the aftermath.Very predictable. Very boring. The protagonist mostly just whines about a lack of friends, and her dislike for school and teachers.Yawn.The only good thing about this audio book was the voice of the reader. Her voice sounded like it could be that of a young girl and was very expressive.My advice? Skip this book and look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars","review":"I give this 2 stars because I am not satisfied with the product.

The night of the party something happened to her (something she can never forget). Since she called the police her old friends will not talk to her, and people she doesn't even know hate her. On the first day of school a boy that was sitting behind her on the bus, unwrapped his breakfast then shot the wrapper at the back of her head. One of the basketball players hit her square in the face with mash potatoes and gravy. The whole lunchroom laughed at her. Her ex-best friend Rachel and some kids were sitting behind her and they just laughed at her. Rachel was the person in the whole galaxy that Melinda was dying to tell her what really happened. The person Melinda hated, because of the night at the party was Andy Evens.I would recommend Speak to anyone who, because it was a good story.

High school students today face the issues of rape and peer acceptance. Anderson uses these issues of our times in an emotional story of a young girl's self-growth. The theme is one of self-growth and self-worth. The story is written in first person, which allows the reader to experience Melinda's emotion's through her words and actions. Anderson's use of the tree is symbolic in this story. Melinda connects the idea of cutting off the unhealthy parts of a deseased tree to her own life. By the end of the year she has gained the confidence to speak about the rape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting- take 2","review":"Steve is a 16 year old adolescent that is in trouble.

After the first few pages, I was captured. I could just imagine the scenes in this book actually occuring in the high school I attended. Anderson captured the language and actions of the young adults in her story. Even the thoughts portrayed by the main character were right on target. I can just hear the voice of a high school student coming through in this book.This book deals with many topics high school students face daily. It deals with family issues, peer pressure, cliques, dating, and social issues. I think every adult and young adult can find a character in this book that they relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emily's Speak Review","review":"Let me start off by saying that Speak is a wonderfully written book. I was required to read this book for class and was not extremely excited about at first. When we started to read it, I really got into it. It is a little confusing but that is what makes it exciting.The main character of Speak is Melinda. In the beginning you find out that no one likes her. Basically she is an outcast. Her best friend and her group of friends last year refuse to talk to her. They have all gotten on with their live and are doing bigger and better things. Melinda seems to be stuck without anyone.As you read this book you are taken through Melinda's journey through a year of school. You do eventually find out why she is such an outcast. Melinda also does overcome it. There are many ways that you can relate to this book. Overall Speak was so good so I had to give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaks Volumes","review":"This is a story about a girl named Melinda.

She can't seem to tell even her closest old friends what happened and becomes mute throughout the year. The book is about how she deals with her life as an outcast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak","review":"Speak is a witty and inspiring book about a social outcast who has several obsticals standing in her way. Melinda Sordino, the main character, had a picture-perfect life with her group of friends and a close relationship with her parents. However, this was about to change when Melinda went to a senior's party. When something unexpected happened, she broke up the slightly illegal fun by calling the cops. Now, everyone at her high school hates her including her so-called best friends. Melinda's picture perfect world had come to a complete hault and her words failed her. The heavy burdan of what happend at the party was becoming way too much to hold in. Melinda knew that speaking the truth was the only way out of her maze. Colorful and raw characters add the extra sparkle to this gem of a story. A twisting plotline will keep you entertained and curious throughout Melinda's ordeal.

A must-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Anderson's unique style and structure makes this book a great read. I have used this book to encourage my students to read, and they love it. One girl I tutor told me she loved this book--her favorite. She said that the book is very realistic. She likes Melinda--the protagonist. Anderson weaves this tale of a depressed ninth grader and really captures the way teenagers think. She is right on when it comes to friendships, the school itself, teachers, grades, the lunchroom, gym class, extracurricula activities, etc. The novel itself is divided into marking periods! Totally clever. I love the groups: the jocks, the country clubbers, Idiot Servants, Cheerleaders, Human Waste, Eurotrash, the Marthas, Big Hair Chix, etc. Applause for this wonderful writer who has given younger readers something to motivate them to read more. I just ordered her new book \\"Fever 1793.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaking Out","review":"I loved this book.

The main character, Melinda, had called the cops on the end-of-the-summer bash and everyone is busted. The reason for calling the cops is something Melinda keeps deep inside and does not reveal until the end. This novel shows Melinda as she struggles with many difficult aspects of high school and her home life. She has trouble speaking to people and expressing her true emotions. Though she's still very apprehensive, one person she starts to open up to is Mr. Freeman, her art teacher. He has taught her how to express her feelings through art and also told her he'd always be there to listen. Will Melinda finally open up to him or anyone, and find her voice?I enjoyed this novel because it was realistic and detailed. It is a book that brings forth a mixture of emotions.

Myself and other friends in the military, enjoy bantering back and forth, the various lines and situations. It's very interesting to see the different command styles that are presented in this film. One could side with either character. The crusty Jock Sinclair, is easily the soldiers choice, while the officers would tend to side with Basil Barrow. Either way, it certainly shows the importance of loyalty to the moral of a Regiment, and that when there is a division in the Mess, the results can be disastrous. Definitely a must see for anyone who is in, or interested in, military life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Debut Album","review":"The debut album of two Brits set out to be one of the defining pop-bands in the 80's. This was the first vinyl album I bought.The songs are all great - excellent fun and dance records. Nothing like the serious Georg Michael of today (who shouldn't be embarrassed today that he recorded this album).I rate 'Bad Boys' and 'Young Guns (Go For It)' as some of the best singles ever released, 'Club Tropicana' is not my personal favorite (but has an excellent video!) and 'WHAM! Rap' is a classic.But the songs 'Nothing Looks The Same In The Light' and 'A Ray of Sunshine' are classics too! A must for a every fan of '80s pop and dance music!If you can afford it, try to get a european version of this album, since you will get remixes of 'A Ray Of Sunshine', 'Love Machine' and 'Nothing Looks The Same In The Light', which extends the album to well over 50minutes of fantastic (George and Andrew were quite modest with their title:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and sunshine --- There's enough for everyone","review":"Of the three, this is actually my favorite Wham! album. In \\"Fantastic,\\" these brash boys were making music first and asking questions later. \\"Bad Boys\\" serves as an excellent summary of what sort of attitude the listener might expect from this album. Rap music peaked with their \\"Wham Rap\\" found here (which by the way is better than \\"Wham Rap '86\\"...some things you just can't improve on). \\"Young Guns\\" is a fitting finale to this fine 80's classic.If you long for the nostalgic days of leg-warmers and big hair, \\"Fantastic\\" is guaranteed to transport you back to that enchanted decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very \\"fun\\" albulm. What you'd expect from a young Wham.","review":"I think this is a great CD. You can definatley hear the distinct sounds of George Michael's writing talents. The sound is very hip, fun and of course a little bit sexy. While each song on the Fantastic CD is great - my absolute favorite is \\"Club Tropicana\\" - it has a groove you can't help but love and probably haven't heard before. This CD is definatley worth a listen especially if you're a George Michael fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shamelessly Fun","review":"I give this cd 4 stars for the fact that it contains two of Wham's greatest songs...\\"Bad Boys\\" and \\"Wham Rap\\".

The writers see Corelli as a great propagandist for what is right and wrong in the world, and thus attempt to excuse or expiate her own tendency for hypocrisy and an inability to know her own mind. This is an insight into one kind of her contemporary admirers, but does her less justice than the more even handed biographies of Eileen Bigland and Brian Masters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun and Educational Book","review":"Dubal here has made revealing interviews with 45 very famous concert pianists.

Smaller than I imagined, it has a diameter of 1 3/4.I'm a little skeptical about mounting this upside down (attached to the bottom of an overhead cabinet) with a boom mic attached using the tiny screws that came with it. It doesn't seem like the screws will hold it if you're into moving your mic around a lot combined with gravity - they are extremely small.

Five Stars ... video quality, minus three!","review":"The advertising for this three-video set is VERY misleading ... mainly for what it DOESN'T tell you. While I feel the CONTENT of the \\"three tapes\\" is excellent, through no fault of the narrator the quality of the tape reproduction is AWFUL. I expected three tapes of the customary \\"SP\\" speed quality. What I got were three 40-minute-or-so tapes that looked like third-generation, taped in the VERY SLOW SPEED. Selling this as a three-tape set is VERY misleading. The entire program of about two hours could easily have been placed in a single cassette at the best quality/speed. The images on the slowest speed are fuzzy -- extremely so. Much detail is impossible to see. A shame for a travel tape.

Michael Wallis is a very good narrator and the sights shown are interesting. From the Dixie Truckers Home to the Big Texan Steak House to the Mojave Desert each part of the route is a fascinating item that the viewer will find interesting.Only a couple of criticisms. One is that some sections of the route are completely short-shrifted (i.e. without looking at a map you would never know from this video that Route 66 went through both Springfield, Illinois and Springfield, Missouri; both are totally ignored by the video as if neither city had anything intereting in it). The other is that packaging this as three tapes is a complete waste of resources since the material from all three tapes could easily be fit on one VHS tape.Besides these criticisms though, I highly recommend the Route 66 video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the feeling of getting there.....","review":"Having just returned from a trip on Route 66, from Chicago to Oklahoma, I thoroughly enjoyed this series....granted the video quality could have been better, but the pace of the \\"trip\\" and the overall production technics reminded me of my trip.....unharried and reminicent of pre roadrage!

It is disappointing to see that this able writer has not dealt with either myth effectively. He not only has not debunked these errors, he has been taken in by them. He has added a new twist to them by advancing the indefensible notion that these myths are not really that far from the truth, because they actually \\"elevate\\" man rather than reduce him to insignificance. This is in complete disregard of the history of the serious damage that has been done by these myths.

I found it to be disorganized, with an awful index. There was very little history or neighborhood information that I'm so used to with the other travel books. It also doesn't keep restaurants, museums, hotels, etc. separate in the listings; it's very easy to miss stuff. Some of the restaurants have their logo above their review, which makes me wonder if some of them paid for placement. When we got to New York, we left the book in the hotel room and successfully relied on advice from the concierge, cabbies and just wandering around. Personally, I'd recommend Lonely Planet or Fodors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is ridiculous! As the previous reviewer stated I also ordered this item which clearly stated that I was buying a \\"Case Pack of 10 bottles\\" of foaming dish detergent.

I just wrote the store that listed and shipped the item (Polstein's) and am awaiting a response to see how they will rectify the situation. The customers shouldn't pay for their error.

However, it does mute the sound of the cello as others have said, ~ 50%. In fact when I went to orchestra rehearsal and people were setting up, I started to warm up and I was not filling the room; the sound seemed more \\"private\\" if that makes sense. I'm usually embarrassed to warm up (I'm still kind of a beginner) but the mute changed all that. And there is no deterioration to the sound when I practice. I will say that my teacher's mute does not have solid ends so he can push his down further on his bridge than I can with mine, but mine still works. The solid ends make it so I can only push it down halfway.

Well, Mr. Destiny, played by Michael Caine, offers James Belushi a chance to be a wealthy corporate hot shot instead of a regular James. As you can imagine, it does not work our well for James. You know, self-loathing, John Lovitz (a friend) almost commits suicide--the usual stuff. The movie has funny moments, and the pace is pretty good. The ending is somewhat predictable, James is happy to be a regular James (again). It's not all about the money.

It is like a soap bubble--amusing, attractive but ephemeral. It isn't bad. With Jim Belushi's easy-going charm and an outstanding group of supporting actors, how could it be? My favorite scene involves one of those supporting actors (Maury Chaykin) and Belushi in a hilarious negotiation over paving the driveway. \\"There's a mud guy?\\" And the movie can make us think about how we wistfully look back at the choices and events of our lives, but I think other stories (\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", \\"Back to the Future\\", \\"Frequency\\") or poems (\\"The Road Not Taken\\") do a much better job of that.

After almost a month of emailing back and forth, they still do not understand or believe me. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!! Also, read their return policy very carefully. It states, \\"be sure of what you write\\" and \\"all products will be tested.\\" If you say it does not work, they can turn right around and say it does, without providing any proof.

In fact, I probably used it for about 20 hours since I put the new battery in. It held a charge for about 18 of those 20 hours. I cleaned all the contacts on the battery and the laptop to see if maybe some dirt had affected the ability to charge the battery and then left it on to charge overnight (with the computer off). I woke up the next morning to a melted battery. As I said the computer was powered down and was sitting on a desk (not carpet). There was no reason why it should have generated that much heat. There's no damage to the computer aside from the battery. It's pretty clear these are cheap knockoffs, so I'd steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready to use","review":"The battery is just as perfect as the original.

Scary, and not in that startle-you-for-a-cheap-scream way that a lot of thrillers can be, I mean this is just honestly frightening.

Larry and friends actually take the time to share techniques and the heart and soul that is the foundation for the techniques. I have been fortunate in that I have been able to spend quality time with Larry and this DVD just reminds me of how passionate Larry is about his music and his life. This DVD share some intimate insight into some of Larry's most memorable performances and the style of bass playing that he invented while performing with his mom Dell Graham. The DVD is absolutely wonderful.Nat"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funk Buzz Bass Attack","review":"This is not a beginner's instructional tutorial. There is no stop/explanation that is the norm of other instructional DVDs. It is assumed that the viewer has had more than a few years playing experience and thus little explanation is required and close monitoring of the applied technique is the instructional method. Though the cover states \\"Beginning To Intermediate\\", this DVD is geared from advanced intermediate to professional level. What is presented are songs that require advanced technique and skills. An advanced musician will readily understand all the principals presented here as involved and applied to the funk/fusion genre. This is produced in a studio setting with two exceptionally accomplished musicians (on drums and organ) from Graham's other musical endeavors. The asides are a bit distracting but if you want to know how funk is played then this a great instructional DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your money","review":"If you are looking to see Larry Graham in concert or just on stage DO NOT purchase this DVD.

The Shield probably has the best and most eclectic music of any show on television. I must say, the songs that were FINALLY picked for the compilation are weak. Far from the best music from the show.

I would have associated Alea Jacta Est with the Darkwave Avant Garde style of the early 1990's French group \\"Lucie Cries\\" or the various compilations \\"L'Appel De La Muse, Vol.1, 2, 3\\" etc.This album is not even close, rather it more resembles the late 1970's style of power guitar, bass and drums. Bluesy? Maybe a little. Pink Floyd? Hardly.This release may appeal to people who enjoy listening to FM radio, or the more mainstream rock music going around. That's why I gave it two stars and not one. However, if you're looking for the unusual, experimental, sophisticated sound of a French Darkwave band, stay very far away from this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hymns you and your child will treasure.","review":"Hymns for a Kid's Heart is a collaborative effort between Bobbie Wolgemuth and Joni Eareckson Tada.

The fact that the book comes with a corresponding CD is a stroke of genius. The arrangements are grand and the children's voices are strong and heartfelt.

The guest appearences are just a added bonus.I have all of Clouds albums and would have to say that this is his best work yet. The true hip hop enthusiast would apreciate the west coast style beats with lyrics that would make Rakim's jaw drop. On top of that this album boasts the work of one of the most underated DJ's in the game, DJ Wise. Wise's scratches are drop dead amazing. Your jaw will hit the ground when you hear scratches of Hulk Hogan, yes THAT Hulk Hogan.If your reading this, it means your interested in the album.

Second, it sounds exactly like Summer of Darkness! Some people say it's sooo good, but the riffs and lyrical styles are EXACTLY the same. I hate it when a band releases a new album, and it sounds the same, just like the Coldplay album(s). I do admit that christian metal is an oddity, but their \\"metalness\\" is not based on religion. If \\"metalness\\" means challenging the norm, than \\"christian\\" metal bands take the cake by challenging the challengers.

A christian metalcore band that is actually tolerable to listen to? What I discovered on that album, as well as their previous release, has been all but lost. Every song, every single song, is laced with very weak \\"nu-metal\\" garbage. Yes, the singer has a lovely singing voice, but come on. Where are the songs like \\"Beheaded\\" from S.o.D.? I appreciate an occassional singing chorus as is so popular with recent \\"metal\\" bands, but this needs to end somewhere and this release from a band I had at least a moderate amount of respect for has made that extremely evident. Much like Seether's latest, artistic quality has seemingly been sacrificed for vain attempts at higher sales. I hope that, like Seether, this new offering does poorly and the folks in Demon Hunter and their record label realize this is not what fans of metal expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is ridiculous","review":"First of all, they suck.

This is definitely the BEST christian metal band to have yet come. I strongly disagree with the last comment and side with the first comment made and chalk the last comment up to one who only appreciates metal. The sung chorus show the true versatility of the band as well as the fact that the Ryan Clark has talent. Any man can scream, but not all men can sing beautifuly, much less run a very heavy verse into a still seamingly heavy chorus with melodic singing. The talent of this band is evident in every song that comes from their studio. It is a true wonder how they keep it so fresh and yet bring an almost reminiscent sound.This band is for all lovers of music in any sense. They keep a positive message and yet are not afraid to show their humanity in addressing everyday life. Constantly bringing a positive message through heavy-melodic, drum driven, vocally appealing, Christ-centered, evangelistic, powerfull metal"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM","review":"Its been a while since I've heard an album this good.

The sound is not too far outside, yet Miles plays his usual tricks with your ear, making you listen and interact with the music rather than just have it around for the ambience (like that is possible with good Jazz!).The title track is great, as is the live take of \\"What it is\\", featuring some very Scofieldesque guitar.As a sax player, this album didn't thrill me, as I am neither a Marsalis or Bill Evans fan, but as a Jazz player it did. Egdy, and accomplished. I'm glad I own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"Miles was coming back by this point- his tone and power are better than on his prior 80's efforts, and with that his confidence was re-emerging.Backed by a great group including Branford Marsalis, John Scofield, and ever faithful drummer Al Foster (who was with Miles in the 70's as well) \\"Decoy\\" is a very credible effort by the re-emerging Miles."},{"rating":"1","title":"An improvisational jam album?","review":"I don't even know where to begin.

I was hoping for something I could keep my LifeStyle meter, Test strips, alcohol pads lancet device and my Pen needle in. It won't do it. Over all size it would appear to fit.

I listen to it because I'm subjected to it at work and don't have a choice, but you do. Stick with early Kraftwerk, OMD, YMO, Fad Gadget, John Foxx, Gary Newman--all great stuff. With Joy Electric you get choir boy vocals set against all the annoying sounds of a typical video arcade. For cult members only."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Terrible Album!","review":"This album is horrendous! Why can't we get more music like Bill & Gloria Gaither! This whole album sounds like the Disneyland Light Parade -- YUCK! As a Reverend, I have to object to this kind of innane and empty-headed music.

The flutters and beeps are perfectly done (though a little more overproduced--which isn't such a bad thing--and predictable than their earlier work.)I have heard a lot of people saying that this is their best album but the songs don't go anywhere, as good as they are, and they sound a little too much like Erasure's \\"I say I say I say.\\" Beyond this the lyrics are waaaay too right-wing.Pat Robertson would give this CD a better review but I think that this CD belongs in the 'Christian Rock' area of the CD store--which has little significance to the rest of the world of music.(I feel really bad writing this review, because I really want to like this album!...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly awesome Synth-Rock.","review":"Pure and Perfect, this album is by far the best one in my collection. If you can feel music in your gut, you'll love it too. Following the success of \\"Robot Rock\\", this album conveys amazing feeling in the same manner, but still very different feelings. Robot Rock tended to give a feeling of curiosity and hope, then also mourning and courage. This album a more pure hope, and at the same time, a childlike awe and wonder. Even aside from that, the lacy under-tones, frantic synth beats, and swirling melodys make this, and Robot Rock, a definate hole in any music lover's collection who doesn't already own them."},{"rating":"2","title":"NECA Bobbleheads Rule!","review":"I am a booblehead collector and this is my first NECA bobble.

Buying the Terminator NECA boble next, very excited about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool but Not Much Bobble","review":"For any Predator fan, this is a very cool figurine. He's great, with detailed armor and a collection of skull trophies at his feet. However, he's not much of a bobble head, mainly because his dreadlocks are so long in the back that they prevent his head from moving backwards. Even if they weren't blocking the backward motion, there isn't much freedom of movement on the \\"bobble hinges\\" or in the \\"bobble spring.\\" I have a bobble-head Abby from NCIS that has so much bobble to her that I need only tap her head to watch her go, whereas this guy is more of a big-headed figurine. He's cool enough that my husband loves him and decided to keep it, despite no bobble. So long as you're not set on the bobbling, you'll enjoy having this Predator around to add character to your desk, shelf or curio case."},{"rating":"1","title":"A so-so sculpt and a really bad paint job","review":"I really wonder if the figure i got is the same others review, mine is quite amateurish comparing it to other Neca's releases.

Peter Jones's version, on the other hand, is visually vital, emotionally compelling, and convincingly narrated by the actor Liev Schreiber. I recommend it for any school class or age group reading Steinbeck, the most American of modern American authors, for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!!","review":"This is one of those albums that must be heard. Randy Kaplan succeeds in relating to you the angst of loss with bittersweet tales of regret and acceptance through truly artistic ballads of rock. The music so captures you that you'll find yourself needing to listen to it everywhere. Once his lyrics seep into your soul, you realize a horrowing depth to which you connect to his satirical and intensly creative neurosis. Songs such as Cutty Reel, Alaska and Unpaid Bills are masters in that they independantly deliver you to a moving picture all of their own but are ultimatly connected by Kaplan's unbelievable musicality. Randy Kaplan is a brilliant songwriter and exceptional musician. In addition to his rustic and soulful voice he plays many of the instuments on this album. From his array of guitars, various organs and the return of his harmonica, he is truly a master of his art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Pick!","review":"This c.d. was given to me by a friend with rave reviews. After listening to it just one time i was pleasantly surprised with it's great sound and good lyric content. His ability to connect an overall picture to the listener is well accomplished. it sounds stylish, folk, hip and in the catagory of \\"david gray\\" type rock. i look forward to future work by this artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"You DO need special installation tools.","review":"The original has ball & socket joints at each end. For some reason, these guys decided they'd only put that joint on the bottom. So, as the other reviewer said, you must remove the ball from the top joint. But what if you need to replace the unit again? It will no longer take the original equiptment. I'm sending them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Israel Crap is still art.","review":"This film is anti-Israeli propaganda, plain and simple. But watching the film from a neutral perspective would not give you this thought. It is a beautifully produced piece of art (and other things) showing in almost British style comedy the ridiculous nature of some of the more prevalent parts of Israeli culture. A highly recommended watch, but if you are looking for something without political motivations, I suggest you find another film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky Algeria!","review":"This is the best set to get if you can find it (seek and ye shall find). The orchestra just sparkles. Valentini-Terrani's rich dark voice is so perfect for this role. Araiza is once again a super-dreamy Rossini tenor, why he is not bigger in the USA is beyond me.

I never expect great quality out of character items, but this is not to bad for an inexpensive backpack.

If he was to buy a watch he would have spent more money, but he was very pleased when I gave him this watch as a gift. Plus he didn't know that I got it at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Mexican movies I've ever seen","review":"Ave Mar��a is an amazong movie. I really don't want to tell you what is it about so that you can really see it by yourselves, but it is definitely a movie to be seen by all of us having two cultures in our blood. I am half Spanish and half Mexican as the main character of the movies is. And when you have two cultures, two religions, two different lives to live, there is a struggle in the soul for integration in which both parties feel they should have the whole you and it seems that one has to die in order for the other to live. There is misunderstanding inside and out. There is injustice inside and out and there is the struggle for the integration of two major cultures into one single heart. Beautiful picture I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use!","review":"Seems to be very sticky and maybe that's why I haven't been able to get the backing off of the second side.

Since man bags are not really 'in' where I live, the straps make a difference on the appearance of the bags. I needed a strap that was wider and could be interchangeable with my bags. This shoulder strap was perfect. I don't really carry heavy items in my bags, so I didn't need a strap that was heavy duty. I like this strap because it is comfortable and adjustable and looks 'manly'. You really can't beat it for the price. Caution..the buckles are made of plastic, so if you are looking for something heavy duty, you may not want to purchase this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the kind of music I've been searchingfor for years!","review":"I love gospel music but have always wanted to find a piano soloist that played the more relaxing gospel songs.

There seems to be too much production on this country album and the artist would have faired better with a simple guitar and 3 peice band backup.

I recieved a copy of the album and a copy of his new single dance til dawn. The tune is catchy but lacks polish. It sounds dated, like a 1985 country song with a real bad beginning that is cheesy to say the least. I've never heard anything more on this guy besides the web page I was directed to.

I can understand that if your are really practicing alone this my be an ideal spot to practice in the nude. As for video filming it is not. I would have loved to follow along with this model and have seen some more wide shots of her as she practices. Part of yoga is getting your body art right through the use of poses and this model does her poses well. It is really wonderful to see this model in her poses.

It contains two massive Hi-NRG hits in the form of It's Raining Men and I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair.The album opens with the vibrant track Success where the two contrasting voices of the girls come over most distinctly. Hungry For Love is a funky mid-tempo song, whilst Dear Santa starts out as a slow Christmas ballad with soulful vocals before the fast Hi-NRG beat kicks in.Hope is an uplifting song with some impressive vocals. The real appeal of the album lies however in the closing tracks It's Raining Men, a camp classic with a pulsating beat and I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair, a festive number with a catchy tune and foot tapping rhythms. Fans of 1980s dance music will love this album.I Got the Feeling/Earth Can Be Just Like HeavenSylvester - Greatest Hits"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad subtitles ruin good movie!!!","review":"A visually impressive film that is faithful to Dostoevsky's novel.

A film Russian in its elemental humanity, German in its expressionist mis-en-scene. It's loud, even when it whispers. That the film itself haunts seems appropriate given that it is a ghost-story of sorts. If you're just looking for entertainment, look elsewhere. This is a film about ultimate questions.The transfer looks okay on analogue television, but on my laptop it lacks definition, as if it were transfered from a second-rate VHS tape. Wish the folks at Criterion would get their hands on this one. I would not hesitate to upgrade.If you like stately and intensely reflective films about the interior of the soul, by all means RENT this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I was lucky to find an acutal Russian movie version of 'Crime and Punishment'. It was made in the 70s, but is in black and white. The directors and producers have done a fine job here in staying faithful to the book and going into the mind of the main character. It was the very psychological book and so is the movie. The movie is not as sad as the book though because very few people could duplicate Foydor's mastery.

Most books rely on secondary sources to a grest extent and fail to examine the accuracy of the primary accounts, but not Mr. Lindley. He got his information for this book \\"straight from the horses mouth\\". In some cases he even investigated the accuracy of the horse. It is not a book of shared opinions, but rather the evidence comes the first hand accounts of the individuals involved and the governmental records of this period of history.

Some of his ideas make sense, but I still don't know if Travis drew that line in the sand or if that story is just a romantic fiction. Trying to make some kind of ultimate sense out of obscure, ambiguous, and conflicting documents is more a matter of faith than scholarship. Lindley seems to think he can separate the facts from the fictions, both intentional and unintentional, but it just can't be done.

Their vocals were just as they were 30 years ago, and they played the songs almost identical or better to the original recordings. The back up band was first rate, and they played every note as it appeared on their original recordings. I will watch this over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"WILL MAKE YOU SHAKE YOUR BUTT ACROSS THE LIVING ROOM","review":"I expected this to be a good DvD and I was not disappointed. I watched it 3 times the first day. The production values are solid with good audio and video. The lineup of songs is great, but as usual there are some that are missing that you wish weren't. I would not hesitate to call the backing band some of the best musicians in the world. There are all kinds of instuments being played and being played well. Two things stuck out about this DVD. First I had always considered L&M to be mainly a Kenny Loggins gig with a little help from Jim Messina. I could not have been more wrong, Jim Messina is well represented on this DVD and it opened my eyes to his overall contribution to the team. Second alot of their music is mellow, and I thought this DVD would also be a bit on the mellow side.

Excellent musicians accompany them in this superb recording and camera video editing, that your 5.1 HT will sparkle, making you feel like you were actually there. Songs like \\"Be Free\\" and \\"Angry Eyes\\" recalls the days when songs were lose, jazzy, rocky, inspirational with guitar and sax licks with outstanding musicianship, something that is completely lacking in today's rock & roll arena in general. This is a superb DVD that should be played loud. Enjoy those voices and feelings, as true talent like these are hard to come by!

And the backup band here is beyond belief. First rate! This concert is one of the best ever. Outstanding performances - great song selection - can't do any better.

Most people think of \\"Your Mama Don't Dance\\" when they hear the name Loggins and Messina, but they are pitifully shortchanged if they don't go deep into the volumes of music put out by this band in the 70's. Loggins and Messina not only have perfect complementing vocal harmonies, but the addition of instruments like the violin, mandolin, recorder, flute, sax, steel drums, etc, was an innovation that most popular bands today follow. Every time I think \\"I'm just going to listen to a few cuts, I end up listening to all 2 1/2 hours of this phenomenal piece of work from, in my opinion, the best rock and roll duo ever! An added bonus is a section recorded in the 70's from a Loggins and Messina appearance on the \\"Midnight Special\\" with Wolfman Jack. You gotta have this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"This DVD is something that I have waited for. I was not able to attend the concert when they toured, but this is the next best thing to being there. Not only are Loggins and Messina excellent singers/musicians, but their supporting band is top notch. This duo's return to the stage was way overdue. I am just glad that it was put on DVD so that I can view it anytime I wish. You will not be disappointed in the song list and play. If you are a Loggins and Messina fan, this is a MUST HAVE for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of the native sons","review":"You normally don't expect much from reunions of long defunct bands.

The backing band is entirely different from the original L & M band, but this group knows how to play these tunes, and adds some nice touches to the arrangements. Also, Kenny & Jim can still sing well.A good selection of their catalog is played, no new material, but a well done cover of Buffalo Springfield's \\"Kind Woman\\" is performed.

This novel is nothing more than a minute by minute, day by day catalog of what a somewhat dimwitted little boy does at the \\"County Home\\" while his aunt and uncle attempt to watch over him. The setting is murkily conceived at best, and the characters are nothing more than opportunities for \\"stories\\" to happen. Is this \\"Home\\" a prison? Is it a half-way house?

I expected at least the same quality as the other since it's been years and I now have the best OS available. NO!!! The picture quality is crap and can't be tweaked.

Do not buy unless the subject will be well lit and very close to the camera.

This will increase the friction between the cam and the base, making it more stable. The metal peg can also be unscrewed from the camera allowing tripod attachment or a custom made base.The best usb webcam I've seen is the 3com homeconnect.

The second half of the performance is lighter music that appeals to children as well as adults, especially songs like \\"Blackbird,\\" where the singers mimic the sounds of the musical instruments used in the original Beatles recording. Every song on this DVD is a gift! Clips of the \\"Spem in Alium\\" recording sessions are interspersed among the songs, along with the singers' commentaries on the project.

The non-linear sequence of the story can make it hard to watch, but very intreging. It blows open the thoughts that we have in everyday life. That we are the most important, it shows that every life is insignificant to other people. The story deals with racism and mature themes, underlying troubles. It gives us glimpes into the fact that at times we can reach out and change other peoples' lives but in fact we choose to change only our own, as you see in the very end of code unknown. The interweaving of the storyline makes it a wonderful way to see the daily interaction between people that don't know eachother, and choose not to know eachother. There is only one linear scene in the entire movie and that would be the drum scene, but everything is brought together in the end.

I prefer foreign films; they are more willing to look at the human condition and subtly explore the difficulty of truly relating to others -- something usually avoided in Hollywood product. But in the end, I truly disliked this film, particularly because it is so pretentious and ponderous. It's a very lazy film that tries to hide the fact behind its flashy film-school techniques. The director obviously believes he's in uncharted territory when he makes his obvious points about prejudice coming from all quarters and uses long (very long) takes. It results in a dismal, irritating viewing experience. Binoche, however, gives -- as usual -- a wonderful performance. For films with true emotion and valid, creative use of real-time technique, try a truly great director, Eric Rohmer (\\"Summer\\" and \\"Boyfriends and Girlfriends,\\" in particular)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Point Unknown","review":"I'll keep this brief, as I feel like I've already wasted too much time on this movie as is.

It is without any added features whatsoever or the ability to turn off the subtitles. Kino is obviously representing some fine films, but if future releases by Kino follow the pattern of Code Unknown it will poison the well of any enthusiasm on the part of the discerning audience Kino depends on to buy copies of these sorts of films.The Kino release of Code Unknown is being sold at a premium price, but has the quality of a cheap knock-off DVD, no better than buying a VHS tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to say...","review":"Ha, Ha and Ha!What does the director want to tell us?Probably the answer is \\"Code Unknown\\".The title is perfect and represented everything about the movie and director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full maple bridge","review":"The bridge that I ordered from amazon was all that the said it was.

A fine film and a lousy soundtrack equals a mediocre movie. Not so in this case. I was enthralled by the music when I watched the movie. But the real test comes when you listen to the soundtrack without the film. Can it stand on its own as a composition? I have heard some people complain of repetition in this soundtrack. There are two main themes which are indeed repeated throughout the movie. What I find fascinating and truely delightful is the manner in which the two themes are interwoven to create a musical tapestry. As the soundtrack progresses, there is a sense of ascending until at last the composition comes to climax which is breathtaking.I found it to be a wonderful work of art with or without the film.

I have seen the movie so many times to count and had hoped there was a sound track. The songs have so much emotion built into the structure of the music.

You music watch the movie to get the full effect of the emotion drama from the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love it.","review":"I initially bought the CD for the single track #6. But I discovered that the entire CD is just amazing. As soon as the music starts I seem to forget the immediate surroundings and it immerses me into the world of chivalry and honor. In addition, If I close my eyes while the music is playing, I can almost touch the music.

If you want a novel that takes you on a journey somewhere, this is your ticket. In a certain way, I've never come back.It would not be possible to write a book on dreams with greater depth and internal consistency.

The trick is trying to put together a spider when you've never put together a spider before (said with humor and l-o-v-e). I would highly recommend.

It is sturdy and lightweight. The wheels are very big and thick. The padded seat is thick and comfortable. It has great brakes on the handles. One quick snap downward and it brakes to sit still, one snap upward and it goes again. My Mom is 5' and she sits nicely on it so her feet can touch the ground, its not too high up. It also has ample storage under the seat for a purse or some valuables to hold while shopping. A gorgeous blue color. What else can I say about it..

She loves this walker because it is very sturdy, rolls well, has a deep padded seat, padded backrest, excellent brakes and plenty of storage. She feels confident with this walker and uses it for walking exercise and general getting around. She especially appreciates it on days that she does not feel 100% - it gives her a degree of confidence. The frame color is a deep metallic navy blue. Please note that to fit it into a car trunk you may have to remove the handles (they pop out). However, it is not extremely compact when folded. If you need a rolling walker that folds very small, this may not be it. Otherwise, this is the one. Also, the Amazon price was the best, and included free shipping. Good deal, promptly shipped via UPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugo Portable Walker","review":"The walker was easy to assemble and it arrived quickly. The problem I have with it, is at times it is impossible to open, you have to play with it to get it open. This is a major problem to me because many times I am alone cannot rely on others to help me with it. I need to have a walker that I can rely on to use. Several times when I could not get the release button to function I had to rely on the old tried and true cane for my mobility issues.

As the story progresses, her mother is prone to fits of fainting as she ponders what to do with a daughter who has antlers. The silly and sometimes absurd events which take place in this book are sure to ignite a young child's imagination. Illustrations in this book help enhance the perception of silliness in this book which will undoubtedly cause fits of laughter in young readers.While this book is short on plot and lacking in literary structure, I believe children will enjoy the story for its humorous moments.~DeeDee Fox, Author of The Ruby Red Slippers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on conflict","review":"This book has received great reveiws far and wide. I hate to admit it, but I just don't see why. The protagonist, Imogene, wakes up with a set of antlers on her head. To many of us, this would be a big problem. But, Imogene doesn't seem to mind all that much. Her family, however, hates the whole idea. Now, in most children's story books, the protagonist is faced with a certain conflict and at the end of the story he/she has solved it and has grown somehow from the experience. In this story, Imogene isn't bothered by her problem and does nothing at all to solve it. In fact, the problem solves itself. She wakes up and voila, no more antlers. Instead, she had grown a new problem. (Another that she doesn't seem to mind.) In no way do I see that either Imogene or her family has grown or changed in any way. I admit, some of the situations are comical and in their own way pull the book along. But again, there is no solution to the problem and I have issue with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable Tale","review":"I love this book! I'm 31 and remember reading Imogene's Antlers as a child. When it came time for me to think of appropriate books for my young child, this book immediately came to mind.

Later, as the author brings his account into more modern times, it gets a little better. One thing I did learn from Indian Running was about their stone-age beliefs and rituals that many tribes still hold on to. I always thought that mistreatment by the \\"white man\\" had to be the primary reason for the Indian's plight today but I'll tell you this,their stone-age beliefs and \\"spirituality\\" hasn't helped either.

Oddly enough, I think it is easily his best CD. I'm a fan, have listened to all of his songs and albums a number of times, but I come back to that. This is his best.My favorite Billy Joel song is on this CD and I'm sure it would be one of my handful of favorite songs of all-time. \\"Why Judy Why\\" is a haunting melody, a beautiful song I can't stop listening to. In addition to this, \\"Nocturne\\" is the most beautiful piece of instrumental music I've listened to ever. If I ever learn to play the piano, that is the first song I wish to learn how to play.\\"Everybody Loves You Now\\" is another excellent song and for more casual fans, \\"She's Got a Way\\" is on this, though this version is slightly different than the version on the Greatest hits (that version is from Songs in the Attic).

And, believe me, it was worth it. Even though the songs are not as catchy as, say, \\"My Life\\", the album still ranks amongst my favorites. And, if this isn't enough to convince you, the album also includes the entire lyrics, PLUS a rarely seen COMPLETE live performence of \\"Everybody Loves You Now.\\" This 1971 album (don't be fooled by the fact that it says 1983, that's just the original re-release date), is a must-have for any Billy Joel fan.Marc-David Jacobs: Billy Joel FanP.S.

In fact, simplicity is the album's greatest flaw. There are only two worthwhile compositions here: \\"She's Got A Way\\" and \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\", both re-recorded in superior versions on Songs In The Attic. The rest are throwaways that Joel wrote before his songwriting talents truly flourished (see Piano Man for Billy's true debut). The production doesn't help either. It makes Billy, to his own admission, sound like a Chipmunk!Billy Joel is a phenominal songwriter, but Harbor is nowhere near his best work. An album for completists only."},{"rating":"2","title":"The seed was there for greatness","review":"I only wish I was living back when this album came out, because I would have correctly predicted Billy would have been the superstar that he turned out to be. This album (next to Turnstiles) is probably as intimate an album as Billy Joel ever made. The melodies are haunting and it's clear he has absorbed much from the Beatles in this debut, particularly the McCartney like \\"You Can Make Me Free\\". The lyrics to \\"Tomorrow is Today\\" are almost as haunting as Beethoven's 5th (not quite), but knowing that the lyrics were originally a suicide note is why I say that.This wouldn't be the first album to start with if you've never bought yourself a Billy Joel album. Try The Stranger or 52nd Street before venturing to this less popular but possibly just as rewarding material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as original","review":"I happen to own one of the original records of this album, and the remastered copy is good, but much is missing. \\"You Can Make Me Free\\" is actually much longer, with Joel and an electric guitar going off on a 2 minute romp at the end of the song. You don't hear this on the re-master. \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\" actually has an acoustic guitar in it, and the drummer makes a mistake at the start. This is all lost in the remaster. Finally, \\"Tomorrow Is Today\\" has horns and strings at the part where he goes soulful: \\"Oh Ma, Goin' to the river, gonna take a ride...\\", and at the climax. Honestly, the high speed on the original is not that noticeable and certainly bearable.

Those books give you solved solutions to the problem, where the Practice Problems book for some of the sections only gives you answers, like A. I've been trying to work through this book but it is frustrating when you get stumped that there is no where to go and see how the problem was solved. Wish it had a companion with the full solutions. The ones that do give you the solutions make assumptions and do not list them. I would also highly recommend getting the Sample Problems book offered through NCEES."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous softcore","review":"This film was released the same year as Keanu's \\"Matrix.\\" I wonder if it purposely related to that or if it was by chance. My guess would be the former because this film does have some cheesy black-and-green imagery that is very imitation-Matrix.This was typical softcore: bad acting, silly plot, lots of female bisexuality but no male bisexuality, etc. This is really just an opportunity to see cosmetically-enhanced bosoms. Like all heteropatriarchal films, this one shows far more female nudity than male nudity. The sexual scenes were obviously fake too.The one fascinating part of this film were male torsos. The actors obviously do work out. However, I wonder if there pectorals are bought just like their female counterparts. All the characters are white, yet not a single man has a single chest hair. If you've even been in any male locker room in middle America, you would know that this is highly unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very useful book","review":"I saw the PBS programs and wanted to capture them for future study.

After nailing the arena rock, hard rock, and acoustic rock genres, Guardian redefines themselves with this dark, moody, alternative-esque album. Don't let \\"alternative\\" scare you. There is more here than just power chords. Tony Palacios' guitar work is nothing short of amazing. The guy can SHRED! The entire band is outstanding on this disc, and I urge any fan of Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, or even OLD Guardian to give it a chance. Steve Taylor's production is top notch, and his contribution in the lyrical department is a breath of fresh air in a world full of lyrical cliques.Yes, it's a Christian album...but it's an honest album.

I bought this because it was described as having \\"one white cube lide\\" and \\"one bottom cap.\\" I guess I was supposed to figure out that a \\"cube lide\\" was actually a Cloverleaf shaped lid (Look at the picture, dummy) and a thin plastic bottom cap.

While Wolff seems to deal primarily in an extended minimalism, we also see similar characters in similar situations. The outcomes, the messages of each story, reveal something different, but it all seems familiar. I have the feeling that I could read a dozen of these stories in one sitting, enjoy the process, but be left with little more than the unified feeling the stories bring. In this way, though, the stories are comfortable, and greatly inspiring. Sometimes we are most inspired by what falls short.

You work out for 15 minutes and stop for about 3. Too many stops for a cardio workout.The lower body portion is intense, lots of positive affirmations and gets the heart rate up, but again, there is a lot of stopping so your heartrate goes up and down the whole time.I would do this as a lifter upper, but if you want a pure cardio workout and not a mind/body workout, try Christi Taylors step/aerobic DVD's..they are great and most can be customized to fit your time constraints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"This is a wonderful, motivating workout.

I feel so EMPOWERED! Sometimes it's difficult to get into this at first, but once you begin to speak to yourself, once you begin to memorize the mantras, you become passionate, you become a part of something.

Goldsmith does an excellent job of relaying appropriate events and common complaints about the program. At times, though, she seems to compromise accuracy in her interpretations in order to appeal to the Pollyanna-ish service learning audience. Perhaps the best, and most candid portion of the book is the epilogue. Goldsmith and her former corps-mates offer criticisms that are commonly heard within the corps. Unfortunatly, I believe that these suggestions have not led to improvements at City Year and their concerns are still startingly relevant. It is a must read for anyone considering spending a year with this organization."},{"rating":"2","title":"The holy grail for Vivaldi lovers","review":"I bought this as a record back in the 70's, and was pleased to find it had been redone on a CD.

All those big names on the cover are not just there for show: these are the best performances by the best players, and as far as I'm concerned the best conductors, too. (I will go out of my way to find Ormandy-conducted performances of just about anything.)At the end of the one live performance on the album, you can hear the people jump out of their seats to applaud and cheer.

The total lack of gestural expressivity in this recording makes it arguably perfect dinner/background music, but the mere ghost of an adequate performance. This recording will arouse no strong partisans, which is perhaps the reason it is has been so little reviewed, here and elsewhere.The advocacy of some \\"big time\\" record producers for such timid performers, at labels such as Harmonia Mundi, is perhaps now being rewarded by record sales that are in the doldrums.

All pieces are instrumental, and include numerous concertos and the complete Four Seasons. The music is very beautiful and reminds one of the Tuscan countryside and Alpine mountains.

It paired with my Sony Ericsson 580i with no problem, and I was able to place and receive calls within a minute of having it out of the box.As a few of the reviews have said, the sound quality isn't the greatest, but it's good enough compared to a lot of other speakphone type devices.

This happens regardless of duration or battery level. Sometimes it will power off after a few minutes and other times it will power off after half an hour and sometimes it stays on for a while. This problem happens around 80% of the time I use the device. I could not get any response from the manufacturer and I unfortunately lost the original receipt.

The door is hinged, as opposed to most doors that are composed of a semi-flexible flap. These flaps tend to wear out and become brittle, in comparison to the rigid plastic of the Cat Mate door. I also like the locking feature, which is a simple slide, as opposed to an barrier that must be slid into most other doors (fyi, you can buy a multiple slide Cat Mate door, which allows you to lock the door, or only let it swing one way. This is great if you want to let your cats out, but not in - or vice-versa).If your door is thick (i.e. typical exterior door), the supplied screws are not long enough, and you will have to buy longer ones.

He does veer off from the subject of the meal, but I thought that enhanced the reading experience. I also enjoyed his behind-the-scenes descriptions of the kitchen, which added an extra dimension. If you have ever had a meal in a restaurant of similar distinction, this book will allow you to relive that delicious experience. All-in-all, I would heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in food and its professional preparation. And, if you are like me, it will act as an amuse bouche, making you want to read Todhunter's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"I love this book.

Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Intentioned But Overly Simplistic.","review":"The author encourages parents to take a controlling and authoritarian approach to parenting. Advising young men to join the 'Promise Keepers' to learn about good relationships would have to go down in history as the silliest violence prevention strategy I have ever come across.She has a chatty easy to read writing style, which parents will relate to, and I don't doubt her good intentions and commitment to eradicating violence, but I fear any parent who actually tries to implement her strategies is going to have a very difficult time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as they want you to think","review":"For general information it's ok. The information is ill-organized and when working through the problems at the back of each chapter, many of the answers are not actually provided in the book -- you are expected to research further in referened material in the chapter. When an instructor has to give the answers to problems that are in the back of the chapter because the chapter does not actually have enough information to solve the problem, there is a problem with the book.Also, the writers may know a great deal about networking, but they do not know much about passing that information on to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with a lot of useless information","review":"I used this book for a networks class in college. It does cover all the material that we went over in class. Although this book does contain a lot of useful information, it is also stuffed full of some complete nonsense. There's a lot of stupid stupid examples when they try to describe something technical with real world situtations. Sometimes the examples don't even relate well but are just in there because the authors felt they had to force an example into the book. Because we had to read the book for class I spent a bunch of hours reading through 500 pages of text with only 200 pages of real information. The main problem with this book is that it's really a 200 page book expanded out to 700-800 pages and I really can't appreciate that cause I have to read so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily Understandable","review":"Of all the CS textbooks I've read in college in these 2 and a half years, this is perhaps the only book that I can understand the content in the first time reading it.You know how some textbooks (particularly math and physics) are written in a way that it may be difficult to understand? This book is definitely not one of those. Yet it still covers the material throughly, from general ideas to technical details. I am glad that my school chooses this book as the textbook for my networking class, instead of some random book that is impossible to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly wordy","review":"Oh my gosh this book is sooooo wordy. It's 800 pages long, yet it probably could be condensed to less than 600, all without the loss of clarity. The authors explain everything to an excruciating degree, and often times things are repeated over and over again. For example, on page 194, a sentence reads:\\"Web servers typically spawn a new process or create a new thread for each new client connection\\".And then, only two sentences later, the authors write:\\"Web servers often use only one process, but create a new thread with a new connection socket for each new client connection\\"I'm not saying that this book should be written so as to be as precise as good code, but oh my gosh, spare us the overbearing details. Just give us the facts, please, and dispense with the jargon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book to read","review":"This book is very easy to understand, but some of the assignment is challege.

I blew through the book in a hurry and was up and running with Director in a couple of hours. Anyway, the size of the book was perfect as well.

I find the Dir. 8 Bible too extensive, but this is too simplistic.The first 5 chapters repeat the basics I've already learned in school. Chapters 6-10 are of little use because they're about graphics, and I do graphics with graphics software. The chapters that could have been expanded like adding video, lingo, etc. are cut too short.Using this book, I was able to make very simple Director 8 projects. I want a simple book that shows me how to get the most out of Director 8, like rollovers, uniquely shaped video playback windows, etc. Y'know, the stuff that makes people go, \\"WOW!\\" and pay big bucks!

Clearly the tie-in with the Bond film (which the single was atually released before) did not have the desired effect on sales. By far the best track of the lot is the Motiv8 Spectral Dub which is much more in keeping with the usual up-tempo Motiv 8 club sound than the extremely lethargic Money Penny Mix. The other mixes, notably the Sharp Dub, are not what producer Steve Rodway is best at, being a more non-commercial, underground sound - and so fall rather flat. Basically this is a disc for fans only. If you are exepcting something of the quality of Rockin For Myself, the remix of Mary Kiani's 'When I Call Your Name', or even the Spice Girl's Wannabe remix, you'll be rather disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny fantastic record.","review":"I HAVEN'T HEARD MUSIC LIKE THIS IN YEARS.

The first song on the album, \\"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\\" is an old song that you don't hear too often in this modern day, but Bryan Duncan does it beautifully so that it could become a renewed classic.A few of my favorite more modern songs are also included making this a well-rounded album with just enough variety.

They're pretty heavy, the production is decent, and the vocals are slightly death metally in a not entirely generic way, but this band is still utterly unimpressive. After they're done with the one-powerchord riff they move on to some standard listless melodic death riffing, and then some bland strumming of fuller chords with some gang vocals that seem to be used as some pathetically clueless grab for hardcore credibility. It loops monotonously from there, until they reach the obligatory breakdown, and useless extended outro, dragging the song out for another minute and a half after it had already run it's course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"A great resource and required reading/looking at for modellers.

As an added bonus, when recently released on CD by Latino Bugger Veil, the songs from the Surfers' EP \\"Cream Corn From The Socket Of Davis\\" (released around the same time as the original record, in 1986) are included at the end.Song highlights: the pounding acid-drenched cover of \\"American Woman\\", the bizaare Daffy Duck-like whooping vocals in \\"Waiting For Jimmy To Kick\\", the watery sludgyness of \\"Strangers Die Everyday\\", \\"Mark Says Alright\\" which only vocals are a distorted freaky growling, and the hilarious \\"Moving To Florida\\", where Gibby gleefully sings away about potty-training the Chairman Mao and sausages dancing on the hood of Ray Bolger's car.

Aesthetics are the only redeeming qualities for these water bottles. Functionality is zero. A single band is supposed to keep up the bottle but when full of water the weight is too great, it drops out onto the cage floor. I had to jimmy my own fix to this - why buy a product that doesn't work. Additionally, once full, the bottles literally spewed water. I tried multiple times and came back to a flooded cage.

The Supra was by far the most plastic feeling and one that wasn't terribly pleasurable. The Skyn felt less like plastic-like but was still not skin-like at all. The NaturalLamb was EXTREMELY pleasurable and felt like real skin (as it's made from intestines). The only downsides of the NaturalLamb are:1. There is a strong odor that I didn't care for2. The thought of using an intestine for a condom is a bit nauseating for me3.

Basically, I didn't get what I thought I was ordering; False advertising with the picture of 3 types of condoms, and no customer service.As for the condoms, the Trojan Supra is way too small. So, if you have a tiny penis, you will love these. The Lifestyles Skyn fits well. Seems a bit thicker compared to regular condoms, but not bad. As for the NaturLamb, pictured in their ad?

The case was decorated in a cute, hippie kind of way and it did include little pens and a notebook for creativity. That was good. The camera, however, (which was our main reason for buying this) felt like a cardboard project that someone painted. We tried to use it to no avail.

The Bjerknes book is a scholarly book, and it presents the facts. Anyone interested in the 1905 papers should know the truth. Max Born said of the 1905 relativity paper, \\"It gives you the impression of quite a new venture. But that is, of course, as I have tried to explain, not true.\\" The truth is that the theory belongs to Boscovich, Lange, Voigt, Fitzgerald, Larmor, Lorentz, Palagyi, and Poincare, among many others.

Dangerous Davies is a wonderful, honest, decent and human hero who doggedly pursues even small clues and seemingly trivial details to a very believable conclusion. The interest here lies in the characters and in how all the pieces come together -- not in some terrible sinister plot or horrendously gruesome crime -- but in the kind of sad, everyday misadventure that you could read about in any newpaper any day of the week. Mod, Dangerous Davies confidant, is an interesting kind of misfit -- an intellect who lives life according to his own rules -- and he provides much of the comic relief of the series.

Geronimo and his cousin get captured by pirate cats who want to eat them for dinner. Even though I love Geronimo Stilton, I sort of liked the Black Bandit in this book. Pirates are just so cool. The part when the pirate cats were going to eat Geronimo was the scariest. The best part is when he finds a special treasure!I like the way the book is printed with the words being different colors and styles. It has lots of pictures and maps too.

While the information capsules about the employers are indeed helpful, no specifics were given for internships these employers might or might not offer. Instead, the contents of the book (aside from some prefatory material providing poor advice about resumes and cover letters) act as a directory to employers.

I must have either been on drugs or had 20 bucks burning a hole in my pocket when I bought this. There is NO FM music in this DVD, there are several factual inaccuracies, and there are no interviews with anyone really important ( no one closely associated with the band, just a few random people who played with them back in the sixties, and two members of the British fan club, of all things .) The few rare pictures shown of FM in concert and things were of only slight interest, and saved this from a one star rating. SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!!

I, like others, bought this DVD because I'm a Fleetwood Mac freak and for the inexpensive price, I thought I'd give it a chance. Just because it's unauthorized doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to be awful, right? But, this is so bad that it's almost painful to watch.It's terribly inaccurate - and for those of us who are huge fans, this DVD is maddening to watch because things are said that simply aren't true. The \\"experts\\" have very little connection to Fleetwood Mac - in some cases, they have NO connection to the band. There's no Fleetwood Mac music (I'm sure that's because it's unauthorized) and no film clips, either. There's nothing redeeming about the DVD.

Not Authorized by Fleetwood Mac...","review":"When I ordered this DVD through amazon, I had NO IDEA it would be a collection of still photos and U.K. fanclub members talking in a documentary format about the group. What you cannot see on the Amazon item description is that this is an UNAUTHORIZED release meaning no video clips or audio sound bites of the band.The Peter Green era of the 1960's at least had former band members talking about their experience with the group. But if you are a Buckingham-Nicks era fan you will be in for a big disappointment. I thought this DVD would have rare clips from the Mac's midnight special appearance etc. Instead, you get some geeky kids putting \\"their spin\\" on what the band was all about.My advice would be to save your money and hope \\"an authorized documentary will be released in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you want your collection REALLY complete","review":"The best part about the DVD is that we get to see & hear Bob Brunning, a temporary bass guitarist near the beginning of FM. He is well-spoken and speaks well of the band. Other than that, it flies through information you might already know, leaving out many facts and figures, making the documentary both somewhat inaccurate and incomplete. The fact that it is \\"unauthorized,\\" is probably the reason behind the omission of FM music, though some of the original music is acceptable. I did not find it a complete disappointment, but I also found no reason to cheer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical non-authorized stuff...","review":"The better documentaries are Mick Fleetwood's DVD, \\"Classic Albums- Rumours\\" and the VH1 making of \\"Say You Will\\".

The book describes Irish people who came here and quickly became Americanized. It was somewhat easier to be like an American in Montana than it was in New York.

And naturally, she falls in love with him at the end and realises her fianc�� doesn't measure up.

Paul Levine has created two wonderful characters in Solomon and Victoria Lord. I can't wait to follow their next adventure.You will laugh, and feel like you never imagined for two lovable fictional characters. Even the romantic elements of this book are well done and tasteful.

Streisand produced it, I believe.HOWEVER, audiophiles, I do think the remastering for this CD version has robbed it of some warmth. The sound just seems a little clinical and not as intimate.

Really? 5 stars?","review":"Well I'm baffled how anybody could give this five stars, but then again I start alot of reviews this way. However with this movie I feel justified beyond any doubt. I saw this as a preview and it looked good, and starring Amy Smart how bad can it be, right? Well first off maybe they should change her name to Amy Doesn't pick good movies to star in, and that would be dead on, at least as far as this movie goes. It was so badly done that I had no idea what was happening. Were talking shaky camera alot, out of focus and no good look at anything period. I don't know what the \\"demons\\" look like because there is not one good shot of them. And I think I know the reason why.Could it be this movie is so low budget that any viewing of the \\"special effects\\" dead on would just kill the rest of it?I think so. Skip this unless you what an example of what a pourly executed movie looks and sounds like."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Have the Shakes","review":"This movie is unwatchable.

Could barely see what was happening!","review":"Well, from what I saw as this was filmed way too dark, it started out good. It then goes straight down hill at an unfortunate slow pace. Amy Smart (who I usually like) had a profanity laced script. I mean seriously almost every other word was the F-bomb or something equally profane which didn't really match her character. Overall I would not recommend this film unless it was VERY inexpensive and everything else was checked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was a less than 1 star rating","review":"Filmed completely in the dark.

This makes me so Mad, because i would have really enjoyed the film, if it werent for the Pitch, Utter Darkness. Epic Fail. I would love to see this movie Re Made, with Light!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUSY","review":"Potentially could have been a great film, but the shaky hand-held camera work made it difficult to watch. The second major problem was that most of the action in the film was in almost complete darkness. It was so dark that you could barely make out anything. What a waste of film. You would have thought after they shot a roll or so of film, they would have realized it was just too dark and would have re-shot that portion and used more light in future shooting. Nope. It never gets any lighter. Could have been a great horror film if you could have seen what was happening. Also the ending was so ambiguous that it was impossible to figure out what actually happened. A complete and total waste of time. Not even as good as Blair Witch Project, which I hated. The costumes, the actors and the locale were all great, but totally wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"I just got my copy in today and I must say it is well recorded and his voice is incredible!!

I was really happy with all of the toys until one day when I was giving him a bath. I noticed that he had something yellow on his mouth. The octopus has these yellow circular designs on it. It says bath toy right on the tag but when it gets wet the yellow comes right off being a choking hazard to the child. I took it away immediately and threw it out.

I purchased these for my son when he was a few months old, he is now 10 months old and he is still enjoying them. They are bright, attractive and easy to play with. They are small enough to throw a couple into a nappy bag (sorry, diaper bag) without creating bulk. They are really handy for distracting your little one whilst you are on the go (in the car, shopping, etc.)and some are even bath friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Band","review":"MQB is a positively brilliant band which has yet to attract the following they deserve.

It was a little shaky in the beginning, but once the central idea of the movie kicked in -- teaching the clone how to be a guy, then having the REAL girl show up again -- the movie really kicked into gear.Lots of fun, farce-like setpieces follow, with classic mistaken identity and intentions. The performances were all solid, especially Ali Landry, who's unbelievably sexy and spends about half the movie in her underwear. The British guy from the movie GO is really funny too, and the redheaded nerdy character Felix is good as well. And Eugene Levy is great as always!Overall, a real surprise. THe more I write the more I realized how much I liked the movie.

A fantasy which suddenly will materialize in a lab generating a complex web of twisted situations and mistakes with awesome humor sense.Worth entertainment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from lower budget non-mainstream studio movie, thus I avoided it for sometime at the video store. Glossy cover + pretty gal cast usually = to...nothing. But I was pleasantly surprised how good it is. The story line is simple (Reminded me of Love potion #9) but very entertaining and funny. The acting is good. Filming is excellent. And most importantly the script, the editing and the directing of this movie are first grade. There's Eugene Levy who plays the role he is excellent at. I love James Roday expression when he comes home and tries to open his front door with the key only to have it fall completely off its hinges. Desmon Askew who plays his nutty lab friend. And lastly, Ali Landry plays both roles (the real and the clone) convincingly. In all, a well spent 95 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off","review":"The box was correct, but the product inside was a vhs tape that was a home movie combination of a high school/small college game and an interview. Fortunately, the product only cost like $4, had it cost much more, you better believe I would have demanded my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Millett Book Yet","review":"Bring us more Shadwell Rafferty and George Washington Thomas. This dynamic duo has captured my imagination. I found myself torn between reading the footnotes and reading the story. I finally gave up and read all the footnotes through from beginning to end, even when I didn't know what they related to in the story. The history in this book is fascinating and I admire Millett's ability to turn his in-depth factual knowledge of the Twin Cities into a highly entertaining and deftly plotted mystery. There are surprising twists that I never saw coming, thorough characterizations, and--pleasingly--the emotional quality of the characters shines through without the restraints of Holmes' and Watson's prescripted personalities. Their minor involvement felt just right--enough to thread this book in with the series, but also enough to bring in the worldly knowledge that Rafferty wouldn't have. Highly entertaining. Millett has found the perfect heroes for the Gilded Age. Please give us more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed Holmes fan","review":"This can not be a true review as I have not yet been able to finish the book. I loved the 1st 3 books of this series and highly recommend them. In those books, Mr. Millett captured the \\"real\\" voice of Dr. Watson (as created by Doyle.) This book is all over the place with different points of view -- a street person who catches rats, Shadwell Rafferty, an axiliary character, the author and when we hear about Holmes it's in the awful form of journal entries with initials and ampersands that slow the reading. I intent to try again to finish the book, but think I'll find the next one at the library rather than buying it as I did the first 4, just in case Millett has truly abandoned Holmes in favor of Raffety and is tired of writing in that beloved voice that he was clever enough to re-create when he chose to."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Added perspective","review":"Despite a typo in the first sentence of the book, a definite turnoff, this is an interesting and entertaining tale in the usual Millett Minneapolis setting.I like Millett's style of writing. The use of historical figures such as James McPharland and the Molly Macguires lends an added perspective to his tales, as do the references to long forgotten places in Minneapolis and St. Paul. I am almost tempted to read Lost Twin Cities which, I suspect, is one of his works.I have read all four of his Sherlock Holmes novels and look forward to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointing book","review":"I really have to say that I was disapointed with this book. The writing became longwinded and boring, and the story just seemed to drag on and on. Of Millett's four stories, this plot was by far the worst--the whole thing was based on the sexual preferences of two men.The other big problem I have with the Secret Alliance is that it doesn't really involve Holmes at all. The main character is clearly Shadwell Rafferty, which is not exactly what I was expecting. The long portions taken from Watson's diary were added so Millett could call it a Holmes story. The writing from Watson's diary is extremly boring and hard to read, since little of it actually involves the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Millett's Best","review":"Disappointing. Sherlock Holmes basically disappears from the book - except for the stupid diary form that is practically unreadable - and Shadwell Rafferty does not take the stage. The narration might as well be from a newspaper - no humor, no real way to identify with the characters. He has no alternate narrator to take the place of Watson, and that reduces his usually wonderful book plots to dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Millett is getting worse and worse","review":"I enjoyed \\"The Red Demon;\\" I enjoyed \\"The Ice Palace Murders\\" much less. I didn't enjoy \\"The Secret Alliance.\\" I'm a Sherlock Holmes fan, not Shadwell Rafferty, and Millett seems to have become infatuated with his own character to the detriment of involving Holmes. If one is going to write Sherlock Holmes stories, then he needs to write Holmes stories, not give him a secondary role to one's own creation. Millett also seems to be increasingly enamoured with his own knowledge of Twin Cities history, and this sometimes gets in the way. We want Holmes, Mr. Millett, not Rafferty, and if you are going to give a leading role to your own creation, then don't try to allure a readership with mostly false claims about a Sherlock Holmes mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sherlock Holmes and the missing character","review":"How Sherlock Holmes' name can be used in the title with good faith is outside my understanding. I've read all of Millett's \\"Holmes\\" books, and this story is not only the most tedious, the most uninspiring and the least exciting, it is also the most non-Holmes mystery. We really only experience his presence toward the end of the novel, and then it is still only a shell of the Holmes we've seen from Millett in the past.Shadwell Rafferty is a respectable character, but he is no Holmes. Please, next time just give us a real title like \\"Shadwell Rafferty and the Englishmen.\\" At least that would be fair warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret Alliance Revealed","review":"The true secret alliance is between the publisher and the author, as they attempt to con and bamboozle the innocent public into thinking that this is a \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" story. It is not. Not even close. Oh, sure, we're given some badly written \\"diary entries\\" by Watson, but those are filled with Holmes and Watson pining for Minnesota. Funny how Conan Doyle missed Holmes' deep love for the Midwest.The bulk of the novel is taken up with Millet's own creation, Shadwell Rafferty. Tragically, if this were a \\"Shadwell Rafferty\\" book, it wouldn't be all that bad. Rafferty is an interesting enough fellow, and the narrative voice used for him is light, but gets the job done. But, then, \\"Shadwell Rafferty and the Secret Alliance\\" wouldn't sell books, would it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Sequel","review":"Larry Millett's fourth book is easily the weakest in the series. Holmes and Watson barely make cameo appearances, it's all the annoyingly stereotyped Shadwell Rafferty. The far-left politics don't help either. Millett needs to either research other settings for Holmes and Watson or just give Rafferty his own series so those who can't stand him can avoid him. Having Holmes visit Minnesota once was a stretch, four times is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title... Shadwhatever whoever and the who cares...","review":"My sis turned me on to the author, unfortunately this is the first of his books that I've read (only halfway so far, and will probably not finish it.) Now, I'm not sure if I will try any of his others... can I give this zero stars?Obviously my biggest complaint is the same as most other reviewers, the utter lack of Holmes and the horrible way that the diary pages are written. Utterly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest treat around","review":"Last year I had coronary bypass surgery and my daughter came to stay with me. She went food shopping and ran across these little gems. She remembered me eating them from when she was a child. Well, now she is hooked on them too.

While the customer service from this company was excellent, the violin was extremely poor quality. It has a very tinny, hollow sound more like nails scratching a chalkboard. It is completely unacceptable for school concert use. It was, in my opinion, a waste of $50.00. It will most likely sit and gather dust in my daughter's closet as I had to go out and spend $550 for a \\"real\\" violin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality with some work","review":"I wanted to learn violin, but I wanted to get a reasonably priced one, I have the brown version, if I had known there was a purple I would've gotten it haha.When I got it it needed tuning, so it wasn't able to be played right away, and the strings snapped when I had a friend try to tune it. So figuring it was a 50 dollar violin the least I could do it get it looked at, I took it to a music store who replaced the strings and were amazed it was only 50 dollars. They said other than the strings it was a wonderful quality violin.You get what you pay for, but with a little work (recommend replacing the strings) you ahve a very good violin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so solid...","review":"This violin is not really worth what I paid for it.

Thou I bought the tape in Germany (January of this year) I wanted the DVD. Had the tape converted from PAL. Never did I think she whould be back in the States. Kylie covers all her 14+ years of hits and her new? single \\"can't get you out of my head\\".From the opening of \\"Love Boat\\" to \\"Spinning Around\\", this is one fast paced concert that will leave you asking for more! Some of my favs from the concert: the opening tune ~what an entrance~,\\"Your disco needs you\\", her slow set, and of course \\"Light Years\\". My only complaint, \\"Give me just a little more time\\" ~from the early 90's~, was missing.

The releasing company missed a golden opportunity to clean it up -- the film is grainy, flickering and shows signs of deterioration that could and should have been corrected before releasing the film on DVD. The soundtrack, as well, is perfectly awful, with shattered, screeching highs and inaudible lows. I have recordings made from wax cylinders recorded before 1910 that have been restored to sound much better than this 1934 release. It's very discouraging that so little care and attention should have been paid to finally making this film available after so many years. Anna May Wong, and the people who buy this DVD, deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard-rocking","review":"This album is a good combination of heavy rock and Christian lyrics. My personal favorite lyrics of the CD: \\"All those fashion victims seem so aggravated Going with the flow is very overrated I got a revelation...I'm a new creation, baby, the world can't bring me down.\\" Good music to crank up really loud while driving around with the windows down."},{"rating":"2","title":"What rock is supposed to be!","review":"Every song on this CD rocks my face off. There are no \\"filler\\" songs. The lyrics (especially on the songs co-written by Steve Taylor) are clever and profound, and work perfectly with the music of Jamie and Tony.

You guys made this game striving for realism and squad combat. Now when your \\"elite soldiers\\" duck at every sound and you are holding some gun that doesn't exist, it is not a Rainbow Six game.

The sound is very bad. Very poor quality for a DVD. I was very disappointed. Save your money and wait for a better DVD to come along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what they are.","review":"Good: strap can come off but hasn't broken yet. easy to reattach. durable plastic with flexible nose piece on hinges. slightly silvered finish.Bad: tiny clear band keeps it on. Looks like it might break. It is still holding though.These aren't really designed for sunlight, but that's what i use them for. Put in some black tape inside the eye sockets. Great for a little porch sunlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"Does the job but not good enough. Faults. (1) The bracket that holds it isnot strong enough relative to the weight of the unit. You can fasten it securely but it still wobbles because the steel is not strong enough. Handle it carefully and it works OK. I would not have bought it had I realized that it was so weak. (2) The hose end came off. I had to purchase a hose clamp to hold the hose end on again. Now I have a hose end with an inconvenient clamp around the end of it. This interferes with using the hose and attaching tools to the end of the hose with the quick connect that I use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Towel but not sure of the usage?","review":"I did not purchase these from the above seller but I did come across a pair at the local salvation army. It looked like they had been used to wipe away tears but had held up pretty good. They were really yellow though, I thought they would be more gold colored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic baby book for a PICKY mom!!","review":"I received about 5 baby books at my baby shower, and I didn't really like any of them! It's such a personal thing, and nobody knew exactly what I was looking for in a baby book.After my son was born, I went into Babies R Us and spent literally two hours browsing through all of their baby books, and every single one had something wrong with it: too \\"cutesy\\", not enough space, no place for a lock of hair/ID bracelet/footprint, etc. This was the very last book in the display, and the second I opened it up I knew it was \\"the one\\"! It has just enough questions to send you in the right direction, but not enough to be restricting in what you want to say. It has spots for all of those things I mentioned above plus a birth certificate, first photos, and sooo much more!From a VERY picky scrapbooker, this baby book was an absolute Godsend for me! I love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loggins Lost It With Vox...","review":"I tried to think of at least one good reason not to depart with this album; I couldn't ! The only reason I purchased the album in the first place was the song Love Will Follow containing some very soothing and soulful Fairlight synthesizer work as well as silky background vocals from singer/songstress Marilyn Martin.The only minor irritable detail of the song is Loggin's falsetto style.Also, the credits included everyone from The Pointer Sisters, Sheila E., to various DeBarge family members (talk about an 80's pop music ensemble that read like a who's who list). Most of these cast members gave the album an almost We Are the World feel to it (ironically these are some of the same artists who indeed performed on the We Are the World album back in 1985) ! I , too, agree with other reviewers who have commented on the album being a commercial overkill..."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP THE PAIN!!!","review":"A plethora of production tricks and a doerth of memorable tunes. This is the sonic equivalent of waterboading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Re-Release.... BUT","review":"... It's a shame that it was not REMASTERED. The whole CD is still at the same levels as the 1985 release.That being said, it's nice to have the two previously unreleased tracks from the Caddyshack S/T on CD for the first time. The production on this album clearly reflects that it is a product from the eighties, but songs like \\"Loraine\\" \\"I'll Be There\\" \\"Forever\\" & \\"Love Will Follow\\" are really strong.Guess I'll have to buy the album AGAIN when they finally get around to remastering Loggins' catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see!","review":"Excellent documentary about how the brain can rewire itself and even grow new neurons, which translates to how a kid can learn in a class room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"I loved the movie and I have had her music before. I could listen to this CD for hours, especially while driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference book","review":"This classic book on superconductivity is excellent for an experienced reader who has already some background in superconductivity. However, for a student trying to learn superconductivity, it says too many things in too brief which may be difficult to follow. While teaching a course I would prefer to follow a book like Superconductivity by Ketterson and Song and refer to this book for selected (special) topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Size matters","review":"This bag is great for warmth and room, so if your camping with a car its fantastic...for hiking though its massive, about the same size as youd hope your rucksack might be.....so too big and cumbersome for hiking but a great product other than that"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pallas..qui��n es PALLAS ??","review":"Vaya trabajo musical, todo una pieza de colecci��n, valorada muy poco fuera de Europa, sin embargo es una referencia obligada para la gente que gusta del Rock Progresivo. Este pieza es la base musical de PALLAS. Considerado como Neo-Progresivo, pero creo que la definici��n es lo de menos. Ritmos y sonidos bien mezclados, letras de batallas ��picas, las cuales hacen cierta alusi��n a guerras verdaderas, el equilibrio vocal de Euan Lowson es una muestra del buen manejo de impostaci��n voz-instrumento.La l��rica ac��stica de los teclados tambi��n es muy resaltada y pronunciada en la mayor��a de las canciones.Finalizo comentando que hay quien ha comparado a PALLAS con MARILLION y con IQ, pero....si quieres saberlo....Mork"},{"rating":"1","title":"History of California","review":"I downloaded this book thinking it was a true history of the state. It must have been written by someone from the chamber of commerce or a tourist bureau. It's written for kids in a style that portrays the state as some marvelous fantasy place. I live in California and love it here but I couldn't get past the first chapter. Don't waste you time on this mushy, gushing, piece of trite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but...","review":"Currently I'm on the sixth chapter of this book and so far so good. For those who are pursuing CompTIA's Linux+ certification I believe, according to CompTIA, that this book will provide all the help and resources that you need to pass the exam. One qualm though, grammatical errors and a few incorrect verbage.It would have been best that they were omitted. The author uses,\\"however,\\" and, \\"though,\\" so much and incorrectly that it makes reading difficult and not very enjoyable. So far I believe his, \\"however,\\" means, \\"for example,\\" you can try that and see if it helps, I have not figured out, \\"though\\" as yet. \\"However,\\" if you can get around these quirks, then you'll be rewarded to know that this book is complete for the Linux+ certification and very informative, \\"though.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent study guide","review":"Last April I bought this book along with Linux+ 2005 by Jason Eckert to pass the Linux+ exam. I read both books twice over a 4 month period and passed the exam the first time. I am an MCSE and CCNA with minimal Unix/Linux experience, and I was pleased with the background the books provided for the test questions. For me, both books were worth the money and I keep them handy as reference material."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an OK book to start with....but that's all...","review":"I bought this book because I had such good luck with Sybex. I got my A+ and Network+ with the Sybex books. But this one fell short....WAY short. I took the test after reading the book and taking the practice exams; and I also took 2 Linux classes (which is a year of Linux) at my school...and FAILED! I got a 570 (you need a 675 to pass). So I studied again for 3 more weeks and took the test for the second time...FAILED AGAIN! None of the questions on the test were covered in this book; this book is a great starter book. But, if you want to pass I recommend that you buy at LEAST one more book. Also I recommend that you download a Linux distrobution and use it everyday for at least 6 months. I'm going to buy another book, and possibly another one after that. Don't underestimate this test...It's WAY harder than the A+ and Network+ put together. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fully Satisfied","review":"I am fully satisfied with the book. It fully fill up my expectations. Hence I recommend to study also another sources such as The Linux Documentation Project, Distributions sites and so on. It is impossible to include knowledge for CompTia Linux+ exam only to one simple book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent study guide","review":"I found the Sybex book to be full of all the information I need to study for the Linux+ exam. It is rather a dry read though, but it still takes time to explain things in simple concepts. I enjoy the fact that the practice exams will work in a linux environment, but I was a bit let down when the pdf version of the book would not work in FedoraCore 4 due to some security measure on the pdf. Overall this is a decent book for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouch! Eye strain","review":"The paper 3rd edition has very tiny print. Also, needlessly verbose quite often.

When the item was shipped it said it would be here in about two weeks I was bummed out about that but I figured Id wait. Two days later it showed up on my porch I couldnt believe how fast it shipped!!! It was packed up extremely well and for free shipping the box was pretty big so I bet it wasnt that cheap for the company to ship! I took it out and fabricated the fender so it would fit on my supermoto took about an hour with a dremel but it looks great.
