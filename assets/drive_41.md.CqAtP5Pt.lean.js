Anderson has a blurb on the book's cover, because I was just about to compare this book to the terrible Butlerian Jihad novel by Anderson in terms of writing style--not a good thing! This book isn't quite as bad, but that's the only good thing I can say about DEATHDAY. I, for one, am not even going to contemplate buying the sequel. This book has no literary soul, and no resolution of any kind either. What's worse, it lacks any of the qualities I would expect in a Dietz book. His novels had been going uphill since Legion of the Damned, with strong characterizations and intricate portraits of fascinating universes. This book lacks effective character development, and there is NO fascinating universe, just Earth on fire. There are too many good books out there to waste time on this product--using the word literature implies too much that just doesn't apply here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful, trite and overdone","review":"I realy wanted to like this book. I picked it up looking for a new author. As others have noted, racism plays a big role in this book. It's not done well. The author manages to pound the issue into nearly every page regadless of wether it would fit the plot.Those that noted that the aliens seem to share human motivations and actions are in my opinion, correct.I had to give up on this book after about 50 pages. Like others who have reviewed it, I love sci-fi, I thought I was getting a good action packed aliens-vs-human thriller. What I got was a heavy handed morality play that could have been better by a third grader.When I found out from reviews that author actually decided to write this as a first in a \\"series\\" I gave up. I rarley put down a book unfinshed. It bothers me to do so and I probably would have finished this mindnumming tale if it had been a stand alone novel.I cannot recommend anyone read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I just didn't like this book. I think that the racial overtones were over played. I've always thought that the human race would unite against a common enemy, especially a human killing ET. Dietz did do a good job with the action sequences, but there were not enough of them. The book waffled between an action book and a political book and did a poor job at both.Pro- good action sequences, different plot and take on humanityCon- too many alien names, personally, I just didn't like the plot. Story seemed very sterile with really no emotion.It's a short book if you want to read, but i would take a pass on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starship Spaceneedle","review":"The cover art for this latest sci-fi \\"masterpiece\\" by bestselling author William Dietz takes the cake for the goofiest effin cover art of any sci-fi novel that I have yet to see in all my years...DOESN'T ANYONE NOTICE THAT HALF THE SPACESHIP IS THE SPACE NEEDLE ATTACHED TO WHAT LOOKS TO BE SOMETHING RIPPED OFF OF STAR TREK!Google image 'space needle from the underside'.....and you'll get it.The space needle destroying seattle.....wow, just wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Day lacks any depth.","review":"This book is a pitiful excuse for an alien invasion story that hinges heavily on race; that of the humans and the aliens, who are just as stratified,race minded and backwards as 1875 America(reconstruction era).I only have one thing to say: Mr. Dietz lacks any and all knowledge of race issues in America, unless he is dealing with white racist--which was shallow at best. I found the lack of African-American conflict in: 1) becoming slaves (again!!) and 2) becoming overseers, as a profound white-washing (at best) or an intentional oversight (like a lazy student with a forced term paper) into the true effects of slavery on a culture...AND a country.I recommend using this book to hold up the end of a wobbly table because nothing else--the plot, characters, or the pitiful attempt to deal with the race issue--can stand up under the conscious eye of the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I forced myself through the first \\"chapter\\", and those were the most painful 46 pages I've read in ages. I enjoy good science fiction, but this book isn't good anything. The technique of introducing multiple characters in differing situations whose paths through the plot will intertwine is poorly executed. The characters were flat, uninteresting, unengaging. The entire first section was rushed and boring, as if even the author didn't really care and just wanted to get the framework in place as quickly as possible. Mr. Dietz needs to read \\"Footfall\\" again, to see how this unoriginal approach to alien invasions can be written as an interesting novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Day? More like: Boring Day!","review":"I was looking for a word to describe this book and nothing other than \\"horrible\\" or synonyms came to my mind.I borrowed this book from someone at work because the little synopsis made it sound interesting, I should have reminded myself to never judge a book from its cover. To make it short, this book is boring, I usually read a book in a couple of days but this time it took me a month just to get done with the first chapter. This book is so full of cliche' that will bore you to death before you even try to understand what's going on. The characters are just so flat, they lack any kind of personaly, and every single military member acts exactly as you would expect them to in a B series movie.I never gave such a negative review to a book, but if you have some spare dollars you can find thousands of great books here on Amazon, starting with Stephen Baxter.

I read this book when I was approximately 10 or 11 - about a girl sent, unwillingly, to live with relatives on a farm.

I think it should be amazing throughout and this one wasn't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Momma of 4","review":"I read this book recently and liked it so much I wanted to have it on audio so my husband could hear it also (while driving to work.) It only took him a few weeks to get through the whole thing and he absolutely loved it. From the few tapes I listened to myself, I found the narrator did a great job of capturing the character's personalities and pulling the listener into the story. The tapes were used from a library, but they were in great condition. I think we will listen to them again and again, and they were a great buy! If you like Western's at all, \\"The Virginian\\" is a must. I wouldn't say I'm a Western Fan (I'm more of a Jane Austen buff) but after this story, I would have to say I think I am! I laughed out loud, and the cow puncher hero known as The Viginian totally enchanted me as much as any Mr. Darcy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic indeed!","review":"One of my favorite westerns, and with good reason: This truly is a classic in the best sense of the word. After I gave one to my daughter, when she got old enough, now I've made sure the boys each got one too. They may not read it for a while, a mother's recommendations being what they are, but this book can wait. Age and time will not detract from the story, so whenever they choose to discover it for themselves, I know they will love it. It's so well written, the themes so timeless, it is a priceless work of literature, not primarily a western. I would recommend this to everyone who loves a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the book that created the genre","review":"read it because you like westerns, want to understand the origin of the genre, or just plain like a good book.

In 1977, the Western Writers of America voted this novel as the top western novel of all time. It probably started the whole genre (even if one counts the pulp fiction popular in the late 19th century). Historians have always pointed out that there never really was a \\"Code of the West.\\" This was just something thought up by writers, journalists, and film makers. The West was made up of both good and bad men, just as today. But, in my opinion, this book challenges that concept. Wister based his characters on real people he interacted with in the West a few years earlier. There really were men like the Virginian. There really were people who, unknowingly, followed a Code (just as there are today)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsung classic, unsung hero. A unique character.","review":"The Virginian is a classic because of the superb characters who fill its pages. The protagonist, known only as the Virginian, embodies a code of manly virtue. He is unique. Without Mary's civilized purity or the Virginian's wild perfection, the book would be a dry, uninteresting Western, full of stereotypical cowboys swaggering around with their pistols on their hips. Instead of a Buffalo Bill, Wister gives us a young man who loves Shakespeare and Dostoevsky and who does unpleasant things because he must, not because he enjoys them. I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as exotic as I expected, but a fresh start for Krynn","review":"I picked this book up not knowing what to expect. Could I really tolerate another drastic change to the world of Dragonlance? Then again, maybe a totally new setting would breathe much needed life into Krynn. (After all, this is Chris Pierson, how can you not read it?)What we get is an isolated continent, peopled with familiar races, influenced by familiar gods, but with a different twist on the events of Krynn.Pierson fills his new canvas with a good story: 3 separate and very different lives uniting in a bid to contain an ancient evil within the confines of its elusive relic. While the Taladas Trilogy may not turn out to be the powerhouse that the Kingpriest Trilogy was, it certainly appears to be worthy reading and proof of Pierson's potential to be the new voice of Krynn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very burly. This is the wide version.","review":"If you are keying in \\"V832\\" beware - that same number is also used on the shorter, 5\\" version. This is the 8\\" version. The shorter version is handy for doors with windows, and is not sold by Amazon at this writing - try local lumber yards (real ones, not Home Depot/Lowes).This is a very burly bolt. The barrel pin is a full half inch. There is a place for a lock in the closed position. It's intended to mount just as you see. If the small piece is a problem, you have two options. #1 The kit includes a flat piece that mounts like a striker plate and provides a hole that sticks out. #2 I have seen installations where they simply drill a hole in the door frame and the bolt extends into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for $","review":"I bought this for my husband who doesn't smoke cigars much, usually he smokes 1 on the weekends, so I didn't want to invest a lot of money into it.

This book should not be sold as a study version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Running Commentary","review":"Dr. John MacArthur, known as one of America's greatest current expository preachers, has taking great lengths in making a study Bible easy to use and still full of detialed information. The running commentary (notes at the bottom of the pages) is some of the best you will find.The commentaries pick up strength in the New Testament which has much to do with the Christian's soterialogy. The Topical Index section is simply one of the best on the market.Why four stars instead of five? Well, often in his running commentaries he provides only one view. This is especially true in regards to prophecy. His overview on Theology is quite good, but not excellent. Again he provides only one view in regards to eschatology, which is a highly debatable topic. I would have preferred him to present his view,even emphasize it then, add other views that are in the scope of orthodox teaching.All in all, a great study Bible and well worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"MacArthur Study Bible","review":"As a minister, overall, I've enjoyed studying the MacArthur NKJV Study Bible. There are those times that the commentary has nothing to do with the verse in question. I've learned to overlook this. I do not like the Topical Index at all. It is difficult to find specific Bible references. I would much prefer a Concordance.I have had my MacArthur NKJV Study Bible since it came on market. I must say that the publisher could have done a better job in putting the book together. The glue on the book's binding is not that good. The book cover has been working loose for years and is coming apart at the edges. Be ready to use a good glue to make repairs. Otherwise, expect pages to start falling out if you give the Bible much use. Also, this book is not intended to be held by those whose muscles are failing. It could be quite heavy for them.

As well, there are no considerations that to understand the message of the Bible we should understand the culture in which the Bible has been written, the aims of its being written, etc. These considerations would undermine several interpretative claim. In sum, the author see the Bible as a book of metaphysics and science, not of as message of love coming through Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little negative","review":"This study guide seems to be on the negative side for bible story analysis.

For example, in Isiah Chap. 19 he ignores history to make the outrageous claim that not only will Israel be \\"saved\\" at the Second Coming, but so will Egypt and Assyria!!! This was certainly news to me which I quickly discarded in the trash can where this misfounded idea belongs. Also, the \\"many\\" maps in this Bible are almost completely useless. Instead of MacArthur's study notes, stick to the classics like Matthew Henry's Commentary or Halley's Bible Handbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commentary is largely unsubstantiated opinion","review":"Macarthur seems to expect us to follow his interpretation of the Word simply because he... says so!

I was flipping through it to see what MacArthur says about various passages. I made a shocking discovery. He omitted 1 Corinthians 4:19-21.

Would you want your name and work sullied by these profit mongers who charge these prices for a substandard product? Money..money money..is the god of this world.

One does not have to agree with the textual notes to have a good Bible or enjoy using this one.It is, of course, typical MacArthur. It favors a limited kind of dispensationalism and endorses cessationism. But don't let this keep you from getting one.

Some of them are up-tempo, as suggested by the CD title, but there are also slower tracks that are in a much more romantic vein. Mel's interpretation of \`How high the moon' is in the latter category, which is so different to the June Christy version. Tormé classics \`Don't let that moon get away', \`No moon at all' and \`Blue moon' are here of course. His version of \`Moonlight in Vermont' is quite lovely, as is \`Velvet moon', a number that was new to me.

Various instruments mostly play solo, while chords are added just sometimes here and there. It is mostly homophonic and not dense at all. The lack of dense chords makes it sounding weak. Too gentle.

That lack of density makes his music in some sense \\"modern\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"the world's greatest atavism","review":"Who says you can't write 18th-century music in the 1990s?

My concerns were unfounded. While some of the more complex vocabulary words required explanation, students were captivated by the pictures and story. Each page offers the opportunity for discussion and learning. They were disappointed when time ran out and we were unable to finish the book in one reading.

There are brilliant melodic ideas on this album, but one gets the sense that this is a band still developing. The musicianship is rough, which I guess is maybe kinda the point, but with structures so loose and open and mellow, it sometimes sounds like the tunes are about to fall apart. One hears the drummer meandering around tempos, some sections of songs just kind of sit there lifeless, only to have a brilliant verse or chorus kick in. I think that if you dried out the reverb, it'd sound hellova sloppy, like it's the first time these guys have ever played these tunes.Still, it's a really moody, mysterious, and enjoyable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't feel anything.","review":"The hipster hype for this record was so overwhelming I had to check it out. Wow, what a letdown. The whole thing is produced to sound like it's coming from a tinny AM radio. Cute in theory, but extremely frustrating over the course of a record. Totally fuzzed out and detached. Trying to connect with this record is like trying to enjoy sex wearing a full-body condom. It's all wash-out and fuzz and self-conscious retro detachment. The songs themselves, as they are, aren't without their charms, recalling the Byrds and Zombies and such, but you'd be much better off picking up one of those bands' albums then settling for this.

This book is nothing more than a rehash of the German view of the battle and an obvious twisting of facts. Mr. Hofschroer's assertions about Wellington's character couldn't be farther from the truth. There have been countless books written on this subject and none of them have come to the outrageous conclusions of this bogus work. The Duke of Wellington gave the Prussians full credit for arriving in time to save the day at Waterloo in his famous dispatch. There isn't one incident in the entire military or political career of Wellington where he ever deceived any ally of his true intentions; only his enemies remained baffled. He was a true man of honor Mr. Hofschroer, which is more than I can say for you. Congratulations on distorting the truth.

Hofschroer has a long track record of producing military history of the highest quality for which today's reader, so often presented with a rehash of poor research, should be very grateful.It is clear from some of the reactions to this book that he has put the noses of certain groups of people. Wellington worshipers and other such religious fanatics will have a problem with this book. Certain facts it reveals must make such people feel uncomfortable. The historical establishment, so used to peddling accepted 'facts' must have been made to feel a little foolish. Does that explain certain reactions to this excellent book?If you like hard facts and a well researched account, read this book.

After spraying the wasp multiple times directly with the spray, I watched it finally fall. Then, a few minutes later, it flew back, far angrier and looking for revenge. Finally, I dowsed the wasp with the spray while it was on the ground. It crawled around, not killed by the spray, but merely weighed down by the weight of the spray's petroleum distillate. I ended up having to stomp the bug and get insecticide all over my shoes in the process.The spray is ineffective at killing wasps and mostly seems to anger them further. Perhaps the bugs down here are tougher than this spray can handle.

Great, but everyone knows about those parks in CA. and FL. and they are now for multi-millionaires and priced out of sight. There is no way you can live in one for anything remotely affordable.

The central character, played by James Woods, is complex, enigmatic, and incredibly driven. While the movie exposes the horrific crimes against humanity that were committed by a U.S.-backed regime, it retains it's narrative integrity and never strays over the line into a heavy-handed mouthpiece of ideology.

It also incorporates some of the major events of the time (i.e. the assassination of Archbishop Romero and the rape and murder of four American nuns).I don't give it five stars because one does not leave this film with a good undertanding of what was going on.

The riots look silly, soldiers are scared, looking at the camera like wondering if the film was rolling or making sure their faces were seen. The F word is used excessively. Cathy (Jean Donovan) and Maria, with their teen looks, could be Boyle's daughters. At a bar they sing \\"ay ay ay canta y no llores\\" this song has been abused by Hollywood in so many films portraying Mexico.The film does deliver the story and no, it is not accurate, but watching a movie (any movie) to learn history, is like drinking water hoping it will taste like wine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Dramatization!","review":"Oliver Stone released this film prior to his blockbuster, Platoon. Like many of his films, some of the truth tends to be exagerated. In real life, the murders of the 4 nuns took place during a rode block by the El Salvador National Guard, not a death squad, as was portrayed in the film. Despite the shortcoming, it's the performance of James Woods (Oscar Nomination) and great dialogue that makes this movie work.

Actually, she should have sung it accapella, as she had done in concert (most famously at the Kennedy Center with President Bill Clinton in the audience). Listening to \\"Ironic\\" reminds me that Morrissette misunderstands the meaning of the word. Overall, though, this album is a sad indication that Morrissette has not grown artistically in 10 years, and somehow has to rehash her best-selling debut album to rescuscitate her spiraling career."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE ORIGINAL FROM 1996 IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!","review":"ALANIS MORISSETTE SHOULD JUST LEAVE JAGGED LITTLE PILL ALONE.IT IS NOW A DECADE OLD IF SHE WANTED TO MAKE AN ACOUSTIC VERSION.SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT A YEAR AFTER THE ORIGINAL NOT 10 YEARS AFTER.I THINK THE RECORD COMPANY MADE HER DO THIS.BECAUSE ALL OF HER CD'S AFTER JAGGED LITTLE PILL DID NOT SELL EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT THAT DID.AND NOW THEY ARE MAKEING UP FOR THERE LOSS.SHE DID NOT DO THIS FOR THE FANS DON'T FOOL YOURSELF.SHE DID THIS TO MAKE SOME $MONEY$ AND THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.\\"LEAVE A CLASSIC ALONE\\".DO YOU SEE \\"BON~JOVI\\" DOING {SLIPPERY WHEN WET} AGAIN?

Her voice is awful, her songs weak and shallow and her harmonica playing absolutely stinks. Why she would want to do an acoustic version of an album that millions of sheeple already flocked to buy is beyond me other that the idea that she wanted to milk every last penny she could out of an album that was played out the very first time it was spun on the airwaves.

Owch! Forced to do some 'remote officing' at a internet hotspot at the local Starbucks this week, I am beaten into a pulp by this grating CD which is on a non-stop loop.

Instead of enjoying her acoustic spin on her breakthrough CD I was bored to tears with the bland arrangements and horrible singing. Alanis has lost what little passion she had left and it's quite obvious that is a filler album and not an ode to the album that made her one of the most influential singers in recent history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter pill","review":"As Alanis further buries her career by deciding to release her albums *exclusively* at Starbucks, smart record stores, like HMV here in Canada, pull her music from shelves until she releases her music in music stores, not coffee stores.They shouldn't have bothered to restock the shelves, especially this cash grab collection of \\"acoustic\\" versions of songs from her 1995 album, Jagged Little Pill. Granted, you can find a number of these songs performed acoustically on some of her CD singles from Jagged Little Pill, including her 1996 performance of \\"You Oughta Know\\".This is a step back, not a step forward for Alanis. Next: the Nostalgia tour. And the artist is not even 35...."},{"rating":"1","title":"My wife loves this...

It's the thing she does at the tail end of her phrases. UUUUGGGGGHHHH!!!! Plus, her lyrics are BOOTY. Also, her song \\"Isn't It Ironic\\" is more a series of inconveniences than relating to the true definition if irony. She has to know this... she's a smart woman. Most of these songs have the rhythm section plodding away in the worst way. I gotta stop here"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recycled material somehow better than original?","review":"I'm sure most people who own/buy this album already own the original, and find it equally interesting. My subjective opinion is that this one is actually better. However, my reason for writing this is to note the quality of the recording. Listeners who appreciate that will find this one really shines when played through a high quality system - acoustic instrument separation is fantastic and her solid voice is crisp as it can be. They got it right and it's worth buying for this alone. I gave it 4 stars b/c it's a recycle, but for Alanis fanatics this is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"I simply cannot get over \\"you oughta know\\".

It sounded like a really good idea and a new, fun way to enjoy the songs again. When I finally got around to listening to it I was sorely disappointed. All of the songs are so slow and drawn out. There's no excitement or bite to any of them. The album literally puts me to sleep! I gave it a second and third chance recently but I just can't get into it. Don't bother wasting ten dollars unless you consistently struggle to fall asleep at night.

Second of all, the cd-rom doesn't have a save option so you'll be repeting questions each time you use it and you'll never do them all because of that. Third, the questions are either way to easy or impresively hard to find in your regular study reviews. And finally,to DAVE BROWN in Tempe AZ, the guy who wrote the first review on this book here: next time try and check everything about a item (book in this case) before you give it 5 stars, cause most people read these reviews and follow advise, and in this case yours sucked big time."},{"rating":"2","title":"carry your money & credit cards safely","review":"I use the en-route wrist wallet when traveling to safely stash cash, credit & debit cards, tickets and coins.There is no worry about pick pockets or lost purses with this item.It is large enough to hold 8 credit/debit cards, 500 euros & still comfortable enough to wear all day.Everything is secure with the velcro pocket and 2 small zipper pockets.

In the middle of the night when you're trying not to wake a sick, sleeping child, clicking a penlight 100 times isn't ideal. I ended up having to leave the light on, forgetting about it, and letting it die. Then, I went to the supply room and got the cheap one.

How is it that in a city of millions of people the streets of Rome were empty? How did Anita get to park her car at the entrance of the international airport? How did she park the car next to the Trevi Fountain on a street so narrow cars can't get through and so crowded with people 24/7? Come on, half of this film was probably shot on a Hollywood studio back lot. If you want the real deal romantic comedy get Roman Holiday and see the sights as they are even today. Three Coins was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's my two cents about Three Coins...","review":"I must go easier on this film than I would like seeing as it was made in the 50s. Being 19, I'm sure I can't appreciate the calm and painfully cheesy medea of that era. Still, I AM a fan of old movies and enjoy the laid back plots of the older days. O brother. This plot was certainly laid back - in fact, I think it laid all the way back and went to sleep! Three girls fall for three guys. The end! Each girl ended up with the first guy they liked, no surprises or intrigues. There was a gliche to each relationship, but it was ironed out smoothly before you could actually figure out what the big deal was. Two of the men were goony dreamboats, madly in love with their American beauties. The other was a cranky boss who tried terribly hard to be endearing but missed the mark by a mile. Quite predicatable, extremely boring... stick with the good oldies such as Born Yesterday, On The Town, Roman Holiday and the like."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING TRASH","review":"This movie is just plain trash, and I don't mean that in a good way. It doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a melodrama and it might've been good if they'd stuck to one or the other. As it is, it's just a painfully boring, poorly-scripted movie that did have occasional bursts of excellence (although if you blink, you'd miss 'em), but not enough to make it worth watching. Even the Italian scenery isn't worth the price of a rental, and certainly not worth the cost of actually buying it. If you're looking for Italy, you'd do better watching a travel video-- it'd probably be more interesting than this movie, anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine copy of a most excellent film","review":"I bought this DVD to repalce a very old video tape that I have of this movie.

Sure, the other two guys have to sit, so I'm gathering that it would make him feel awkward to be the only one standing, and especially moving around.

One of the world's greatest!","review":"Let's chat about what a real artist (Robert Jan Meyer aka Minus 8) can do with great, sublime, original music. A great recording should be an effortless picture that the heart hears now and the mind contemplates later. Minuit opens up pathways that most downtempo albums dream of. Give this CD to your girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, husband, dad, mother, to your kids or a special friend. Anyone who can hear will thank you for this reward.As a side note I have played this album a few hundred times (on my radio show) and I still get chills when the track White appears.I sincerely hope is that Minus 8 continues his musical career with fresh work for all of us to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gentle and Lovely Book","review":"A delightful and well-written novel.

The main character, Megan, is a woman I could relate to; her journey following the death of her parent is one that touched my experience of loss.

I hope she has a second novel in process!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yaawn","review":"Oh, sorry, I fell asleep! Had a hard time staying awake threw this one.

Ms. Pirro manages to write a most frivolous and banal story even with the services of a \\"co-author\\". I can only imagine what the writing would have been like had she actually taken the time to write it herself.

Apparently quite a bit. They are both good behind the camera with their false smiles and faux sincerity. They are both great at twisting facts and destorting the truth. They are both narcissists in love with their image. They are both so driven for fame that they would easily sell their souls and their children's souls to achieve it.

Being a parent with above average intelligence, I figured I could really use this book. I was wrong.

I have had phenomenal success using homeopathic remedies and would advise everyone interested in keeping dangerous drugs out of their bodies or those of their family's should at least read up on the subject, and this is one of the books to start with!I am always surprised when people say to me \\"that stuff is quackery, or you've been conned\\", yet they will go to their doctor and get a drug with deadly side-effects and take it! If only they knew that not all the prescriptions doctors give out have been tested - which is why a doctor will say to them \\"we'll try this one and if it doesn't work, we'll try something else!\\" And because it is a doctor who says it, people are gullible to believe that drug will not hurt them!Get the book, READ IT, and then ask yourself is it worth a try?

Had I done this I would HAVE NEVER purchased this product. As it is, having bought the product from a box store and NOT online, I made a $99.00 mistake, plus tax.The product has too many limitations to be considered as a viable add-on to your powerpoint presentations. As a presenter, using PPT every week, in training presentations, I can tell you that this product does more to limit PPT's slide producing capabilities than it does to add to them. As a matter of fact, I found the product to \\"take away\\" from PPT's slide building procedures, NOT \\"add\\" to them.Save your money and wait for the next PPT add-on to come along.

I was a little surprised at first as the storyline is pretty complex, but the very rich illustrations spark his imagination. My husband and I have immensely enjoyed creating a narrative around the characters in the book, but sometimes also just sit with him as he flips through the book and looks at the pictures. Do not hesitate to buy this book. This book may not promote pure reading skills (no words), but it teaches a child how to dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sector 7 is awesome","review":"If you like incredible artwork with an amazing story line than you will love Sector 7 by David Wiesner.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This disc was such a disappointment. The musical interpretations were milk-toast, and the audio quality was even worse. This was supposed to be a musical journey of France. Ha! Mostly what you get is wavy water and grazing donkeys. Save your $10 and do not buy this DVD. Judging by this, I suspect all of the Musical Journey DVD's will not match up to anyone's expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aurora classical Variations","review":"Sooner or later there would be an orchestral version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Variations which he composed for his brother Julian and various rock musicians. You must be a die-hard fan to get this version as it is a solely classical arrangement for cello and orchestra. Coupled with their father's symphonic tone-poem \\"Aurora\\" it is a lovely and warm disc. The arrangement for the orchestra is well done.Tone colours off course now vary from the various electric instruments used in the original and that's why it only gets 4 stars.The concept behind the original variations was for cello with rock band and the spontanaity of the first disc is somewhat lost. However it is still and excellent recording and should boost the repertoire for solo cello and orchestra much."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong item","review":"I order this product and went I got it it was not the same product in the picture so I return it back .Amazon told me that they cound not replace it with the one in the picture"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthprice!","review":"I was VERY disappointed in this CD.

This crusher is awesome! It sure beats trying to crush a can with sledgehammer, foot or hand! It's built with a sturdy metal so it should hold up for a long time of use. Just make sure not to overextend when pushing down. We have found that it works best to leave a couple of cans in the bottom so when you add cans to it they align correctly. It holds five cans. The sliding mechanism works smoothly! We have been recycling cans for years where we did not crush them. It feels great to recycle with less trips to the recycling center! Also, it's fun to use, you get to crush a can in seconds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life","review":"No problem with the seller, but this is a piece of junk!! Worked for about a month. Finally after trying to fix it several times I threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nees a little adjusting but it is good.","review":"When I first used the product, I stacked 6 cans in it and started crushing. I found that the second can was falling behind the plate after crushing the first can. I had to adjust the guide wire in the back to prevent the next can from falling before it's time. After the adjustment, it worked great."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Engineering","review":"While this crusher primitively demonstrates the function of a lever, that's almost all it's good for. For one, the can stack constantly jams the next can up behind the piston during use. This does not subside by simply reducing the amount of \\"crush\\" you apply to the previous can; the following can tips back and stands up behind the piston. As mashing the lever back and forth does little to unjam things, we are now reduced to a one-can-at-a-time scenario. I paid twice as much as I could have for other single can models.Finally, even with a healthy coat of lithium grease on the piston guides, this crusher ground right through it's \\"powder coated\\" finish after only a couple of uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply engineered","review":"After doing about 4 dozen cans, the handle started to bend and spread at the pivot and the bail wire for the crusher plate started to slip out. After that it's trash. Recommend Dial Industries can crusher made from polystyrene. Its better designed, holds 10 cans and half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going, going, gone!","review":"We've had this 2 years, and in that time it's crushed about 9 full sized garbage bags of cans. Time to replace it.Don't get too personally attached to that wire framed can stacker. Ours detatched after about 3 bags full, leaving an effective single can crusher. After 6 more bags full of cans, we've lost the crusher today. The metal moving parts are too bent out of shape. That's about 75 bucks worth of cans it's gone through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable through all these years","review":"We purchased this item back in 1999 and we mounted it outdoors on a wooden beam above a plastic hamper to collect all the crushed cans as they drop. The crusher has endured use by us as well as abuse by kids in the family that yanked and hung off the handle as they \\"tried\\" to crush a can. Very durable, excellent price and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Can-Crusher","review":"I really like the Pacific Precision Metals Multi-Can Crusher. The only thing I would like to see changed is the amount of space to put cans in. It only holds 6, I'd like to see that doubled to hold more cans. The product is durable, and will last longer than the plastic ones on the market.

This isn't an easy read - especially compared to Moffat's \\"Before Scotland\\" which I read last year. Brilliant book by the way. \\"Arthur and the Lost Kingdom\\" is full of information about the local area in lowland Scotland where the author grew up.

Stellar, return of the avengers, Queens get the money, are all dope songs that aged very well. Like on many hiphop albums, there's a bit of what feels like filler material. This prevents the album from becoming a classic that makes you want to press play again when the album is over (it's 74 min long). Still, even the filler material is listenable. My original cd was scratched and I bought it again. I guess it's always a good sign when someone really wants to keep an album in his collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still tithing?

The orphan and the widow is listed along with the Jewish Levites, read Deut. It's great. It tells you how to eat the tithe. (I know, this is a foreign concept to most Christians, who've never read the old testament.) Eat the tithe with your sons and your daughters, your men servants and your maid servants, the widow, and the orphan. You are to eat the tithe before the LORD. Oh, you mean it's a party. Ding. It's a party, enjoy. Not a burden now, it's party time. Of course if you go to the First Church they will want to know why you don't tithe anymore. If that scares you, don't read Deut. or buy this book. Fair enough? Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mehhh","review":"This was an ok read , I would recommend it to someone who was unfamiliar with the law of God and how he set up provisions for the leaders, and the poor through tithing although in my opinion there are some issues that look intentionally left out, yet all in all pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners at all...","review":"If you don't already know the names of the poses and know how to get into them instantly, then don't purchase this video. The instructor speaks very fast and I had a hard time understanding what he was saying. Also, there was no explanation as to how to get into a pose and I had to keep looking at the television to see if I was doing it correctly (ignoring my breathing because there was no time for it) and by the time I got into what I thought was the correct pose, he was already changing poses in a fast manner. In less than five minutes, I had to shut it off and sit in child's pose to breathe slowly and collect my racing thoughts. I am pleased to say that I was promptly issued a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Beginners","review":"I am new to yoga and I found this video difficult to use.

The ravioli maker, though, is a total piece of junk. Different friends and I have attempted to make ravioli with it on four different occasions. It shreds the dough and wastes all the fillings. After I bought it, I went back to read the reviews and there were dozens of reviews attesting to the same problem, not a positive review among them for the ravioli maker.

Stan Getz plays with his typical late-period eloquence and assuredness, and occasionally manages to lift the level of this music to acceptable.

Freedom Fields is like listening to old ballads by sailors and peasants, and that is what he intended it to be. If you like Nickel Creek, which is more American bluegrass, you'll like Seth.

And you might even get that large stick unstuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Absolute Worst Thing I Have Ever Read","review":"I have been reviewing books for some time, but I have to say this is the absolute worst thing I have ever read. The author (and I use that term VERY loosely) apparently had a bitter divorce and has used his anger toward the ex-wife as a means to debase all women.The arrogance is astounding. From the misogynistic thread that runs rampant throughout the text to the obvious cruelty, it is truly a sad commentary on where we have gone as a society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Ditto.

It seemed to have no ending, just an end. I was very dissapointed. I did; however, enjoy the marginal comments by the dead. I thought that was very original and insightful. I would try another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"While this novel was on a subject that I usually find rather interesting, I found the work itself to be lacking. The \\"whisperings\\" in the margins only distract the reader and provide little to no substance to the work. Additionally, the subplot involving the origin of the popular soda recipe could have been better developed. Overall, I would not recommend this book unless you really are sick and stuck on the couch, but even then it won't make you feel much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore Slump","review":"I very much enjoyed Bee Season. This is a classic sophomore novel. Very ambitious. Consciously unconventional to very little effect. Very poorly edited. Haphazard story lines. Not a very enjoyable read. I found it interesting because of the historic context, but the descriptions of bygone places such as Boston's West End and Scollay Square are over-researched and not remarkably subtle.I find it unfathomable that anyone could call this book \\"awe-inspiring\\". I liked the review \\"Each reader can interpret the meaning of this book according to one's own life experience.\\" The same could be said of the back of a box of Wheaties.I found the descriptions of the epidemic compelling enough to take out some of the books she used in her research which are more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remedy Lacks Great Original Ingredients","review":"Goldberg's first novel, Bee Season, was one of the best firsts I'd read in years. Instead of sticking with what worked beautifully the first time around, Goldberg resorted to a couple of clunky contrivances to spoil the formula in Wickett's Remedy. The novel starts out strong, with interesting characters and a compelling historical story line. Sadly, the interruptions of Goldberg's annoying margin commentary and the inscrutable QD Soda newsletter provide nothing more than a distraction. And by the end of the novel, even the story line gives out, stranded along with the protagonist, Lydia Wickett, on an island where both the good work she hopes to do and the story Goldberg begins with such promise amount to nothing much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Wisconsin","review":"The book I received was not what I ordered! The copyright date was 1998 and the book was two volumes instead of one. I needed the most recent publication for an administrative course I am currently enrolled in and am now unable to follow along because there are chapters missing and the page numbers don't match up with the current book.

My daughter played with them the first time and said they were broke. Now on the up side the scents are good and they do create a very nice lather for washing. But I would not recommend this product if you want 'play time'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, not crayons at all....","review":"Well, I there had been other reviews when I ordered these.

Each poem is approximately 1 page long, and is about a different world location - San Francisco, Japan, Australia, Kenya, etc. I felt that the book captured a bit of each place through the poems, and that they were humorous and fun as well. For someone with an interest in poetry, geography, travel, or humor, this book would be a great gift idea or introduction to these topics. I generally dislike reading poetry but was drawn into this book because of the cute drawings and theme of travel. It was quite a nice read, although the final page - about California geography didn't seem to fit. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big-Don's Review of a Shakespeare Classic","review":"This story was, as the name suggests, a tragedy. This was one of Shakespeares' more weak works. I recommend this for only the real \\"die-hard\\" Shakespeare fan, but for the rest of you, I would pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Tragedy","review":"I never understood why this play is so unpopular. Coriolanus is a very striking figure. He is a brave and valiant soldier. Yet, he has contempt for the people he protects. In all honesty this is very common. Shakespeare never allows the intensity of this play to drop for a moment. At first Coriolanus fights to the extreme for Rome. Then he fights to the extreme against Rome. His reconciliation with his former enemy Aufidius in 4.5 is a very memorable scene. Only when he is confronted by his mother, wife, and son does he go through a crisis of conscience. It is interesting that because he begins to see the world in terms other than himself, his downfall becomes inevitable. To be sure, this play is not a masterpiece like \\"Julius Caesar,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" \\"King Lear,\\" or \\"Richard III.\\" But it is A LOT BETTER than some of his popular plays like \\"Othello\\" or \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" I highly suggest it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Characters of a \\"Lesser-Known\\" Masterpiece ...","review":"\\"Thy valientness is mine. Thou suckest it from me.\\" That would be Volumnia's (Coriolanus' mother) quote -- and one of my favorites. \\"Coriolanus\\" is an intriguing story and the characters are marvelous. I have yet to see a better portrayal of a suffocating mother. Volumnia will live in my heart forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Kindle","review":"The commentary is modern and relevant, and the play itself is a masterwork: it challenges the audience directly with the character of Gaius Martius Coriolanus, who derives his being from war. It is a very great play, worthy of long and careful study. But the Kindle edition is essentially unreadable: it's impossible to tell the length of lines, since all is presented in scarcely differentiated blocks of text which, alarmingly, change sizes are you're reading. There are no notes to explain terms. The apparatus considered essential for modern readers is lost in the transition to Kindle format. (Try to find any act-scene-line combination: it's almost impossible). The Kindle is pretty slick, but the formatting of Shakespeare's play is beond this device. Buy the paperback; or let me know if you find a Kindle-compatible version that preserve stage direction, notes on the text, and the proper division of lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Value","review":"The recordings are crisp, the performers are big stars.

London made me feel as if I actually knew the people as well as he did. He used fantastic visual imagery and if I closed my eyes I could see the action take place. He used many sailing terms I was unfamiliar with and to more thoroughly enjoy the book I would suggest any reader brush up on sailing vocabulary and parts of a sailing vessel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I didn't know anything about Jack London or The Sea Wolf, but I knew the story was set in a nautical setting so I decided to read it. The story started off very exciting but then slowed down to a near crawl for most of the middle. There never was really any climax what so ever; I was looking for it the entire book but never found it. The plot was very predictable. I knew exactly what would happen the entire time which really ruined it for me. The ending was very cheesy and predictable. The protagonist is basically a wuss, and his extremely feminine viewpoint and talking style quickly became irritating. The book is LITTERED with nautical and sailing terms and half the time I didn't know what the narrator was talking about. The book isn't the best read I've experienced. I'll probably be staying away from Jack London from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"My point of view","review":"i think that this book isn't what i thought it would be. being a 13 year old, i had to read this book for school. i bought this book thinking that it was great after reading the back of the book and the reviews here at amazon.com. when i read the book, my classmates and i talked about how boring the book was and that it had no climaxing plot or any interesting points. then again this is just a point of vie of a some teenagers. to me, i wouldn't suggest this book to any teenager i know."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring............","review":"I have to read this book for summer vacation. I didn't think that this book is long but this book, at the start out, is extremely boring. I have absolutely no idea what the people or characters in the books were saying. I hardly went through the first page before my brain started to ask in confusion with the question, \\"what\\"? I seriously would not recommend this book for students under 16."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seawolf","review":"My son needed this book for assigned reading at school. The book quality itself is as with any new book, perfect. As for the story line, like I said, it was assigned reading. Jack London has written some classic stories, but I can't say they are considered to be among the books that your child \\"just can't put down\\" while reading.. (except for the fact that we won't let them put it down until they are done with the assignment) My son is in 6th grade, but I believe this book is most likely for 8th grade or higher when given as assigned reading for school, since he goes to a gifted school. They typically read books 2 - 3 grade years ahead in his classes. It will go on the book shelf in our home library among the classics, though not among the most cherished for enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stunk!","review":"This book was pointless and was a waste of time. Larsen places no value in life. The discussions of this book make it a deep, boring, can't keep your eyes open book. Stay away from this one. The summary calls it an adventure when the most exciting thing they did was sit in front of each other and sharpen knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"If I could give this book 0 stars I would. It is boring and irritating. The pointlessness baffels me, I couldn't stand picking it up and trying to force myself to finish it. Whenever I would stop reading it for a while I would find myself extremely depressed. I do not recomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughh","review":"Let me say that again: ughh.A good book, all told, but exceedingly dull and almost impossible to get through.

Just buy this book it's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack London-Genius","review":"The writing of The Sea Wolf by Jack London is rich and vivid, poetic and a real page turner. This book is my favorite of all of Jack London's work I have read. I just finished it and I have the urge to read it all over again. It's a slightly wordy book but strangely it's an easy read, and after the first chapter you won't be able to put it down-trust me. The descriptive language of this novel just engrosses you in Jack London's sea worthy story. I was so involved in this book I got sea sick several times-you'll love this book. P.S. I told you so. The best book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"could have been greater..","review":"Actually it's a very great book, but I take off a star for the gratuitous \\"love story\\" that instantly ruins the story as soon as the woman shows up in the middle of the ocean. Of course, before word processing, there was a lot less editing. I thoroughly enjoy some of Jack London's other love stories (Burning Daylight comes to mind) but the Sea Wolf love story was embarrassingly corny. The rest of the book, however, is superb, if don't mind a few lapses in logic."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite jack london","review":"I have read white fang, call of the wild and a few other of jack london's short stories and have enjoyed them all. I realize i love this book in part because of my love for sea faring stories but i do adore this book. I love the character study in this book, though it is not for the faint of heart. It is a very harsh book, horrible actions occur and heartbreaking happen in the story. If you don't like jack london books you definitely will not like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Classic","review":"This is one of my favorite books. London combines high-seas adventure with life's lessons as I believe no one else has done before or since. We all have a little \\"Hump\\" (good) and \\"Wolf\\" (evil) in all of us, and the struggles between these two seem to reflect those we all face inside ourselves. Hoist yer topsails, mate, and get ready for an adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Having a Kindle helps one to discover books which otherwise would certainly have been missed. This is one of them.It's the tale of a rather bookish \\"gentleman\\" who is virtually press-ganged to work on a sailing ship. Through vicious hardship he is faced with the choice of survival (and in the process compromising his morality) or almost certain death. The main villain, if you will, is the Captain of the ship, who's physical strength and presence is overwhelming.Some of the language is a little archaic, but the Kindle dictionary didn't let me down.It's well worth the read. Get past the first ten pages, and you may find it hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was not well written and the plot did not develop well.","review":"The book was boring and did not hold my interest"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and exciting!","review":"This book is a classic, and with good reason. Wolf Larsen is perhaps the best-developed character I have ever encountered in a novel. The story never lets up, and you will not be able to put the book down. Overall, it's a very exciting tale of the sea. Toward the end, however, the story becomes more of a romance. I didn't like this change of pace right at the end of such an exciting novel, and that's why I only give it 4 stars. But read it anyway, because it really is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Set Sail With Wolf Larson Aboard The Ghost","review":"I can't say anything bad at all about this fine novel which exhibits great storytelling and wonderful characters. \\"Hump,\\" also known as Humphrey Van Weyden, a wealthy and sophisticated gentlemen, is forced to endure the hard life of a sailor after being thrown from his own ship.

I find it a tough read, because of the author (Gandhi himself) has a writing style I find unexciting. The book started with a very methodical explanation of what Satyagraha is, and inserts transcripts of hearings before British officials (yawn!). A book I wish I hadn't bought, but your style may be different and you may enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So very few","review":"So very few books could boast truly world-changing ideas like this one. The effects of Ghandi's teachings have of course spread far beyond the struggles in South Africa and India to the civil rights movement in the US and more. Non-violence has never been weighed and found wanting, it has been weighed, found difficult and ignored. But, in the end, the way that looks easier, the way of violence, is the truly hard path to follow. What seems the longest road is not necessarily the most difficult to travel. We all need to review Ghandi from time to time and regain that other path away from self-destruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story but lacks punch","review":"Take this same plot and put it in the hands of a talent such as James Lee Burke or Earl Emerson and you would have the makings of a masterpiece. Unfortunately this author's skill is not quite up to his imagination. It surely isn't the worst writing I've come across, not by a long stretch; in fact, it's good enough that I would strongly encourage the author to continue working at his craft, with some emphasis on character development, story arc and avoiding cliches. I am not averse to buying another book from this author, particularly if the author works on these issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Don't waste your money on this product. I can't recommend them because the fabric isn't stretchy enough to give that nice sexy contour and for the same reason they are not comfortable. For some strange reason they also have two layers of fabric. This is quite unnecessary since one reason to wear thongs is to reveal a bit more than regular underwear and therefore it's nice if they are slightly see thru."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Military Aviation Reference","review":"A must for aviation enthusiasts. I've got several dated editions of Angellucci's aviation reference books. I think no aviation enthusiast should be without a copy of this most excellent reference book. The color pictures come to life, and it is packed with relavent statistics, data, and pull-charts which are teeming with information. The only criticism I have is that after glancing through this most recent edition in a book store... it doesn't seem to have any new aircraft. The Joint Strike Fighter and the F-22 Raptor come to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Herman Melville's Clarel - a 19th C pilgrims' progress?","review":"This is a welcome affordable version of the Northwestern U./Newberry edition of Herman Melville's one epic poem. The poem is a useful window on the views of mid-19th century American Protestants who were neither orthodox nor liberal. Science (including Darwin)(and materialism (or \\"Mammon\\")) vs. Faith and the continuing presence in Palestine of Jews, Moslems, Catholics and Greek Orthodox, and tourists (sometimes viewed almost as another sect) are among the subjects of attention for Melville's Euro-American group of pilgrims.Negatives: 1) the story-line itself is less than gripping and is largely a device to enable the characters to conduct a series of debates.2) this edition, if my copy is any indication, is poorly bound: five segments of about 20 pages each fell out of the binding. (Despite this fallout, the spine of the book remained uncreased.) Only the first three segments of the book (about 150 of the 530 or so pages) remained intact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Returned To This Older Title and Just As Good As The First Time","review":"What can I say, I have all of Jecks' titles once I got hooked.

But this book rambles on without any specific strategies about how to achieve the two goals. This book is no better than the usual motivational books so many of which are available on the market.Although the author says that this book stems from her own experiences in life but in reality one finds that she has only fleetingly mentioned about her own experience which led to this book being written. The chapters in the book are catchy but there is very little real substance inside. The exercises she asks the reader to do at the end of the chapters are surprisingly vague and naive --it does not lead to any deep insight whatsoever. I have totally wasted my money by buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Oxy Powder works exactly how I thought it would. I took 4 pills and only went once the next day, so I increased my dose up to 5 pills per night and I was good to \\"go.\\" I probably went on average 5-7 times per day.

I followed the directions to the letter, including taking fresh lemon juice to aid the reaction, etc. As the directions state, taking 2 more each night until reaching 3-5 bowel movements the next day. I am up to taking 16 pills, and have yet to have more than 2 BMs the following day, and have lost at most 1, maybe 2 lbs that I can directly attribute to this product, going from 245 to about 243. My stomach/intestines/bowels do make some noise, and true to form, my BMs are liquified. Word of warning...if you try this stuff and you feel the need to pass gas, do so at the very high risk of it not being just gas. Disgusting, I know, but I'm just being honest and trying to let you know what you are getting in to here.I would have given one star, but since it did seem to help a little, I gave 2 stars.As far as the shipping...I think I had the product 2-3 days after ordering, so no complaint there."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as advertised","review":"I took 4 of these pills and they began to work the following day-all day!

After that they did not reply at all to further questions on my part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rampant Diarrhea and lots of fake reviews","review":"I believed all these great reviews. I am sure some people like this product, but I found it toxic. I also do not appreciate the fake reviews.If you want rampant diarrhea and cramping, this is the product for you.To say this cleanses the colon walls when nothing else does is a joke. You need to take extra pancreatin or other enzymes for that. Just having rampant diarrhea will not cleanse your colon walls.This product is really overpriced. I rarely throw away supplements, but after trying it twice, I could not bear a repeat.I recommend doing a regular colon cleanse, taking triphala and also taking pro-biotics for chronic constipation. A good colon cleanse will also help to purify your blood and liver also.

It does nothing more than a normal laxative can do, however the side effects are a lot worse. This product causes severe bloating and cramping. As the manufacturer tells you, it also causes loose stools. Don't expect to travel far from a bathroom while you use this product -- you need to have it close by at all times, as your ability to hold your bowel movements in for longer than 30 seconds will be extremely compromised. Also, if you have a work out routine -- completely forget about doing it while on Oxy Powder -- you will not be able to work out for longer than 5 minutes without running to the bathroom. This is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laxative","review":"This is an expensive laxative.

After a few days I had to increase the dosage to get the same amount of \\"movements\\" a day.

Amazing results","review":"I had tried a couple of products and normally do not bother to write reviews. After taking this product as described, I had to come and write a review for this one. I works wonders. Let me put it this way: It works the way it says it will. I did feel the difference and would higly recommend this to anyone who wants to reclaim their health and vitality. I followed this with the Cayce apple diet a couple of weeks later(http://www.areclinic.org/articles.asp?articleid=62) and the results were amazing in my case. I am (was) healthy and do exercise atleast 3to4 days a week, 5' 10\\" and 165lb before doing this. After this and the apple diet, my weight dropped to 153lb. For a person who was not even thinking/planning on losing weight, that is awesome results and a super bonus :-). As I said I was healthy before I undertook this and after this, I feel a lot lighter and cleaner and even more healthier....."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff really works.......","review":"Oxy-powder is different from all other cleanse products out there. This does not have bulky fiber or herbs. It's just a few simple ingredients, and it works sometimes in a hour, and without a mess. Very smooth. If you take too much then your bowels will liquefy, so take a capsule or two to test for your needs. And also Amazon has the best price if you comparison shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible side effects","review":"I've been taking Oxy Powder for 3 days, following all the prescribed recommendations (including the healthy diet). I don't know how it works for other people, but for me it causes a very obvious diarrhea.

I feel dehydrated (in spite of drinking lots of water), dizzy, and have a very bad headache. Will not take it any more and will call them tomorrow to request a refund.This bad experience also made me browse for medical research article on colon cleansing. Surprisingly, I could not find any.... On the contrary, it seems that our colon is typically nice, pink and clean, and no doctors or pathologists have ever observed a mucous plaque or anything of this kind. So I am not sure whether to trust the whole industry of colon cleansing products in general..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Effective!!","review":"Disappointed with the results of this product.

After reading a few reviews about users experiencing stomach cramps, I was a little apprehensive about using Oxy-Powder.

I also continued to eat three servings of fruits and vegetables per day, and two fruit snacks. One the first day I had five major bowel movements. I do not want to get too graphic, but lets just say it poured out! I didn't experience any stomach cramping.In the past I have tried Juice Feasting, but felt constipated after a few days.

Out of all the colon cleanses that I have tried, I can say that Oxy-Powder is by far the best and most thorough.Some of the benefits of using Oxy-Powder that I have noticed include increased energy, a lighter feeling about life, a look of health, an acne-free face, and a flatter tummy.Oxy-Powder even cleanses your blood and body unlike many of the other colon cleanses out there.

It doesn't seem quite as effective for me. If I take two pills I don't end up going at all (without them I usually move at least once). If I take 3, things are too loose and I get bloated. I made sure to dring a lot of water as other reviewers suggested. I also supplemented with hcl pills thinking that maybe was an issue. Neither seemed to make a difference. However, I did notice my body liked these better than herbal pills. I was hoping this would make me more consistently regular but I think I'll have to reserve it only for times when I'm constipated.

After a week I then was on course with the colon hydrotherapy for a few cycles.I give Oxy Powder 4 stars cause I do have to take pretty much a daily dose of 2 for maintenance. The thing that amazed me and I have never asked is when I am on Oxy and drinking plenty of water I am amazed at the amount I go. All those years I was never going I was wondering where was all that poop going? It creeps me out thinking about it.It has helped me.

This book is complementary to an already working knowledge of these years in Europe but as the initial exposure to it will frustrate anyone. Roberts describes some events in insightful detail but then makes passing reference to others I consider major ones without explanation, as if assuming the reader already knows about them. He does this with annoying regularity. If you are looking to fill in the cracks of your knowledge on this subject, this may be the book for you.

I found the book a terrible show of women in the military. The book says 'Young and Female' The author was in her late twenties when she joined. I knew girls who where 17-18 when they joined. She seemed have no real desire to be in the Army. I feel that the author wrote the book to mearly get attention from the press, much like Jessica Lynch. I am amshamed to see her get attention from being a soldier when so many others deserve it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely incredible","review":"I couldn't put this down. She goes in to what it's like to be a woman in the army. And what it's like to serve in Iraq. And the insane environment of trying to be both peacekeepers and combat soldiers at once.The most amazing thing is how she looks at herself and is critical of how she handles issues. Which gives tremendous credence to the criticism she levels at others.While no book can truly explain what it is like to be in combat, this book comes awfully close. And it makes you appreciate how incredible a lot of our soldiers are - like Sgt. Williams.Update:I have seen people complain about what subjects she concentrates on in the book (sex being a biggie). I think her concentration matches what they she was thinking about over there and that makes it an accurate book. Another vote in it's favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a female Army medic...","review":"I found this book hard to read because of my dislike for the author. At the start of the story, we learn that she quits her civilian job because of problems with a female supervisor, which is a running theme throughout the whole book. Every female higher up (hell every female in the book) she dislikes because they are insanely incompetent. As a soldier, I understand crappy leadership, but women in our Army don't become SSG or higher by acting retarded and unmotivated. I feel like a good female soldier would highlight their female leaders skills and motivation, instead of making outrageous statements about them. This author seriously doesn't know how to look up to and respect other females without being jealous and hateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time for me and a shame for the Army","review":"As a German Police Officer, I was excited to hear about the Army Life in war of a woman\`s point of view. - And I only got a big dissapointment.The experiences she\`s telling about is not really a big, new impression to me, the usual circumstances for all uniformed members serving in an unimormed unit. An interesting book for civilists perhaps.But the stylistic way: Her associal language type, her self-heroic adventures (is there anyone who expects a 3-star-hotel in a war and is complaining about sleeping in bag on the floor for weeks?),and especially her adventures of drugs and sex, should not be published in a representative\`s book of the Army. What should the reader think about?A bad girl, of ill repute? Or a bad Army?I\`m sure there are more possibilities to show the Army\`s life.I\`m wondering about how she\`s got the permission of her supervisor in the Army to publish \\"her story\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"This book is not honest. It's nothing more than a really long article in the Opinion section of a newspaper. I wouldn't waste my money on this book. It doesn't show how it REALLY is being a female and in the Army. She just glorifies herself in every situation she can. Besides, even though she was in a combat zone, she never saw any action. I can only pray that no females look up to Ms. Williams--that is disgusting. If you want to know what it's really like for females go to a training base and ask female Drill Sergeants. Those are the women I look up to and always will. They are strong, professional, intelligent...everything Kayla Williams is not.

I agree with that assessment, but I liked those aspects of the book. I can see how the book wouldn't be very interesting to a reader who was also a woman soldier deployed in Iraq, because both the broad outline of the story and many of the details would be nothing new--she's definitely a bit of an Everywoman figure in the narrative. However, I enjoy books that give me a glimpse into the daily lives of people whose lives are very different from my own, and for me, this book fit the bill. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes slice-of-life memoirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love to Hear Myself Talk","review":"As a fellow Arabic linguist and female Iraq war vet, I was disappointed to see such a shallow portrayal of the struggles of women in combat. Ms. Williams, although making some pithy comments on Army leadership, does not show much integrity in her own behavior. When female soldiers flirt, take advantage of their gender, and participate in or refuse to object to the crude behavior of their comrades, they reinforce those habits. Having trained with Ms. Williams a few years back, I had hoped for a fresh perspective on the war, as well as some maturity gained by her experiences. It is far too easy to poke fun and criticize, but how about taking responsibility, speaking up, or becoming an honorable leader? This memoir shows a lot of raw emotion and promise, but it is not backed up by any moral or emotional depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor representation of women serving in Iraq","review":"As a woman Army Nurse Corps captain deployed in Iraq, with 17 years prior active duty enlisted service, I was dismayed to read Ms Williams account of her experiences, which seem more self-absorbed and immature than a representation of the brave, professional female soldiers and Marines that I have encountered here. I'm sure sexual advances and offenses occur here in Iraq, as they do all over the world in any organization, but I also know that if a woman in the military presents herself professionally and performs her job well, her male counterparts treat her with respect and not as cheaply as Ms Williams' book implies. When I read the book, I was hoping for a woman soldier's tale of being a true soldier and how her tour in Iraq helped facilitate that, as it has for many of us. I am proud to be a soldier and I actually do love my M16, much more than this book, which attempts to revive stereotypes I'd hoped we'd overcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh boy....","review":"Truly this book could have been summed up by one word (like others have mentioned), \\"WHINY.\\" Never mind my money, I want my time from reading this book back."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"Not very well written but interesting, none the less.

I have been deployed to Iraq and I'm sure I'll deploy at at least a couple more times before I retire. Personally, I found this book completely infuriating! Williams made money by fueling stereotypes that put woman back into the stone age. Contrary to what she would have you believe, not all male soldiers are trying to get into the pants of any willing female. Not that it never happens, but I would not consider it the norm. The majority of soldiers...men and women... are hardworking, self sacrificing individuals. The men I deployed with were very protective of the females, almost the the point of being annoying.This book went back and forth between Williams bragging about how eduacated and wonderful she thinks she is, and making a mockery of women in the Armed Forces.Please don't waste your time getting this book! If you do...please remember not to believe everything you read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love My Ego More Than You.","review":"Awful. As a female vet of Operation: Iraqi Freedom, I'm saddened to hear a voice like Williams' being heralded as the one to reify the collective military women's experience of Iraq. Snotty and snobbish, her prose is dull and stilted, and the experiences she describes are pretty ordinary, even outside a combat zone. If you believe you've a war story worth publishing, it seems like you should have a little \\"trigger time\\" to back it up. Williams' has none; all of her stories regard being a white blonde, having boobs, how dirty dust can make you, and throwing rocks at one another to pass time. She never lost a friend to gunfire, was never injured, and saw only one violent episode: a man who'd stumbled into a clearly marked minefield. This is a combat memoir? Hardly. These are the crude complaints of a person with a bone to pick with the Army and America for being ordinary while she thinks she's too special for either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Female and foul-mouthed in the Army.","review":"I enjoyed this book more for my parallel experience of being a female soldier and linguist than for any real literary merit. Williams has a very jaded, negative view of the Army. For someone who was supposedly \\"so educated\\", her constant foul language was off-putting. Was she unable to find better words to express herself? What annoyed me most was the narcissistic tone of the whole book. The Army is about \\"us\\" and \\"we\\", the squad/platoon/company/etc, not \\"I\\" and \\"me\\", the individual.Having seen the comment that someone wished they could have read what she did during those 12-hour shifts, I must add that she had to submit the manuscript for classification review (for security purposes) before being allowed to send it to the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Thing Works Great","review":"This is around the 10th Lee FCD I've purchased and it works perfectly, just like all the others I have.I wouldn't reload handguns without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lee Factory Crimp Die","review":"A really nice carbide die.

Issues from first aid to how hard to ride your animals are discussed. The value of this book is that it gives an insite into what it must have been like to pack a family up and move them to California or any point west of the Mississippi.

It's too creamy and wipes right off. My daughter got a very nasty diaper rash and I couldn't figure out why her rash wasn't improving despite medication. Thankfully, I ran out of Mustela and had to buy something quick at the local store. Once I switched to Desitin, improvement began immediately, and you can understand why. Desitin is 40% zinc oxide and very thick. It doesn't all rub off on the diaper the second you put it back on, unlike this stuff. As a new mom, I didn't know the difference, but now I do. I'm hopeful that this will help other new moms too.I just don't recommend this product if a rash has already developed. Perhaps as a preventative measure, it works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please consider this BEFORE you buy it!","review":"AH-HEM!

I thought they might show autumn being a ton of maple trees and deciduous forests-instead they show a bunch of grapes and an overly fat white bird perchimg over a ghoulish swamp. Winter was OK at best, spring was a bunch of flowers, and summer was the best one and it wasn't worth buying!

Even PBS nature programs at HD-TV channel have much better image-quality. The videography of many post-card pretty landscapes was only as ordinary as many tourists' travel videos. As to the music, unless you 'Play All' the whole video from beginning to end, there's no variation of the musical score for each scene selected from the menu --- the same music accompaniment at the first scene is played repeatedly in a loop for every other season selection, which becomes boring after a while.

It has an accessible style and Spanish examples which are more than one or two sentences or are difficult for one reason or another are translated in footnotes.

The Blasters fall into the former category. Life's unfair at times.There aren't any samples from this DVD offered on Amazon so imagine a really tight band, fronted by a great guitar player (Dave Alvin)and a very good vocalist (Phil Alvin) supported by a really tight combination of bass, drums and keyboards, playing a mixture of rock n' roll, blues and rockabilly.This a is a live set and the Blasters are a great live band.

Though there are some moments when her prose tastes a little too much like a Hollywood film, each course here is served with enough flavor to satisfy the stingiest connoisseur of good writing. What is most impressive about this collection is the way Khirallah Noble has managed to isolate small, physical, vivid moments and turn them into pivotal pieces of the lives of each character. Her smart and often charming sense of humor is a garnish; her insight into the interior lives of such rich characters makes The Situe Stories a memorable feast indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"jazz pianist","review":"Hines is one of the great masters and innovators of jazz.

But, although the WDR band (directed by Bill Dobbins) sounds excellent on tracks without Mahogany, it is his presence that brings something special, particularly when he scats like mad (on \\"Pussy Cat Dues\\").My only serious complaint is that the tracks often end too soon after the applause, instead of more natural merging of the songs at an album.

Probably Not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great source of coherent info for the beginner","review":"I read this book as a supplement to the 1917 Revolution segment of my History class, and found it quite helpful in providing the details behind the events described in class. As someone previously uninformed about the events described, it was helpful that Pipes did not assume an informed viewer and described the simple terms and concepts before he elaborated any further. Information is presented in an interesting form, providing information not only about the events but also the people behind the events. The pictures throughout are also useful in attatching a name to the many faces described, which results in the history being more personal, and thus more 'real', to the reader. My only complaint was that I found the last two chapters slightly hard to get through. It is clear he is deeply familiar with the issues being described, however, and the book will make a great reference book for both the beginner and the expert."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Concise as Russian history can be","review":"Pipes' history book is a well formatted and interesting look at this period of Russian history.A great tool for professors that are trying to find something that will hold the attention of students without sacrificing the needed information in the Russian Revolutionary period.This period of Russian history (as with most periods) is full of many confusing names, complex patterns and social happenings. Pipes' look at the period keeps things concise and lets the fascination inherent in this topic shine through for itself.An excellent read for people interested in Russian history that are looking for something concrete but digestable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it sounds.","review":"I read this book and I have to say, I'm unimpressed. The man's bias gets in the way of objective reporting of what happened. This guy has such a disgust of Bolshevism he lets in get in the way. Fortunately for me, I had read more accurate histories of the early USSR before I read this one, and thus was able to find out the truths this one is woefully lacking in.

Some twenty years before, her mother gave her a copy of Anne Morrow Lindbergh's sweet musings of life as a woman. A few years ago, I bought a copy of Gift From the Sea to give to my own daughter who was leaving home for the first time. That this book speaks to multi-generations is part of its allure. People from my mother's generation will recall the Lindbergh's public tragedy of a kidnapped and murdered son. Although AML doesn't speak of this in her book, the knowledge of this awful event and what it must have meant to the author colored my perspective as a reader, adding to my respect for her essays. Gift from the Sea has become a legacy in my family; someday I hope to give copies to my grandchildren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"This is supposedly a self-help classic, but I wouldn't want to turn to it in a time of need.

She has come to understand, the importance of finding peace and happiness within yourself, before you can share those qualities with others. Anne was, indeed, in her simplistic approach to life, a woman light-years ahead of her time. She had discovered, long before self-help books were fashionable, the ultimate joys and pleasures of a simplistic lifestyle, the richness of spiritual well being, and the importance of inner peace.Written in a unique, vibrant, flowing style, this book says in a lot less words what dozens of other self-help books set out to accomplish in long-winded, psycho-analytic terminology. \\"Gift from the Sea\\" is truly a gift from the soul of a woman with great wisdom and inner beauty, and one which you will long remember.

It is indeed as relevant today as it was fifty years ago and probably even more pertinent in today's fast paced world where we fail to slow down give ourselves alone time to comtemplate our lives.

This is the kind of book to be passed on from generation to generation of woman for each generation to interpret it in their own way and take away wonderful life lessons. It's a reminder to women everywhere that although we are the best nurturers, sometimes the one person who we need to nurture the most is ourselves. Then we can really give back to others.

It’s a pity because many works by Bloch are written with a level of skill and imagination that would shame even a Bartok or Stravinsky. In particular Bloch’s string quartets stand out as both some of the greatest music written for the string quartet medium in the twentieth century, and also some of the most neglected works by any great composer. There neglect is even more in inconceivable considering that these quartets are filed with many melodies of searching beauty. It takes a quartet with the imagination and skill of the Pro Arte quartet to resurrect these pieces and have the skill to pull it off. This music is superbly done, and much of it is recorded here for the first time.

This sounds more dated than anything Miles ever did (including his 40s and 50s stuff!). The sounds the keyboard player picks are laughable by now! the horrendous 'groove' bass lines are annoying and repetitive to the point of elevator and supermarket muzak quality. The only one that really 'plays' and still has a sound worth hearing is Miles. Don't waste your hard earned dollar on this plastic Madonna and Michael Jackson influenced stuff. Miles has a ton of other much more interesting albums (start backwards from 'the man with the horn')."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent coverage of beautiful physics for educated people","review":"A beautiful part of physics is conveyed without having to learn some rather deep mathematics. Feynman is one of the wonders in using diagrams to explain difficult things. This book shows how. It is captured from lectures and has a friendly feel as he talks up to his audience.I found this book an inspiration later when trying to convey some electromagnetic ideas to someone without the math background. The diagramming techniques work well. Without Feynman and this book I may have given up. But if he can explain QED to mere mortals, certainly more of us can convey difficult concepts (far less difficult than QED) to educated adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something New to Check","review":"QED is one of the clearest books on particle physics I have seen. The beauty of the book lies in Dr. Feynman's approach; he explains concepts in ways that even amateur physics students can understand, and he is not afraid to tell the reader that there are things science can quantify but not explain. Note: Feynman touches on quantum chromodynamic (QCD) theory, and there is another book that further clarifies the relationship between the two theories: look for The Quark and the Jaguar by Murray Gell-Mann. Amazon lists the book, and it is widely available"},{"rating":"2","title":"QED is masterfully written by an American Genius","review":"QED is your guide to the theory of Quantum Electro Dynamics which explains the interaction of light and matter. It is about a 1/4\\" thick and feels like it was written for the layperson to absorb without being over taxing. It isn't just another \\"popular science\\" type book because it provides an accurate explanation of the theory without being watered down by inaccurate metaphors and analogies meant to soften some difficult physics for the uninitiated. The text is a series of lectures Feynman prepared for an english teach friend of his who wanted to know about his theories but was afraid to ask (so to speak).This book is fun to read and I highly recommend it for the scientist or (most importantly) the non-scientist on your gift list. Fear not, Feynman is the greatest teacher of science America has ever had to offer (imho). You will enjoy this and quite likely a few of his other books such as, \\"Surely, Your'e Joking Mr. Feynman\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quantum Physics Less All the Math","review":"Richard Feynman stands out from other physicists in his witty ability to explain physical phenomenons in a simplistic way. Quantum physics (or quantum theory) is by far the most fascinating yet the most perplexing subject ever studied in recent-to-present history. I was lucky to have come acorss Feynman's \\"QED\\" while I was taking undergraduate quantum physics. Feynman adroitly explains the path of an electron without discussing vectoral analysis. He clearly conveys the ideas behind quantum theory by translating the obscure mathematical notations and manipulations into plain language understood by readers who are not in the science field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"In my opinion, a scientist who gives you the oppurtunity to delve into his mind and understand what he understands is a privilege both to the reader and to the cause of science. Feymann's QED does just that. It MAKES you understand what QED is all about and helps to understand the famous wave/particle duality in physics. This book can clearly be enjoyed by non-physicists and very easily understood. A good deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A QED Teaser","review":"An excellent explanation of QED with no formalism.

This book is not really to aid victims as much as it is to bolster the understanding of those who might be trying to serve their needs and assess their level of danger. It is academic in tone and that is off-putting to some. But these articles were designed for presentation at the regular stalking conference in Los Angeles so the tone fits the venue. I found it very informative and helpful in threat assessment, understanding different types of stalkers and what works to deter them. Victims can best use the information designed to help psychologically deter stalkers by robbing them of their pay-off--attention. It also explains that intermittent response is most likely to INCREASE stalking activity--as in slot machine payoffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk from an all American quack","review":"This is the witch doctor whose second-hand shrinking (he never actually met the patient) led to the imprisonment of Timothy Lee Masters for the murder of Peggy Hettrick, a crime we now know he did not commit.

Within 3 months, one of the tires went flat despite very limited use. A local service station told me that the inner tube could not be repaired because the tire had significant dry rot - after only 3 months!!

There's been a lot of years between then and now and, man, I really missed that girl. Luckily, after a 25+ year absence, I got to marry her last year and we sure had a great time putting The River on the turntable last night and smiling at each other.

I have friends who build and repair guitars professionally and it is all they use. Titebond is the gold standard for fine woodworking. I have been using it for year. If it is used correctly any failure is usually in the wood fiber itself. If you have any trouble it is probably because you are using the wrong type of adhesive for the wrong application. Titebond should always be used on bare sanded wood and clamped under moderate to heavy pressure for 6-8 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performed poorly on mitered 3/4\\" plywood joints","review":"I've used Elmer's Carpenters Wood Glue for years, but recently I bought some of the Titebond to give it a try.

After gluing a number of miters together I realized I made a mistake and had to take several corners apart. Kind of frustrated, I just pushed in on the boards, and they came right apart. I really didn't think they were held together stongly enough. So, I switched back to Elmers. And, I did an experiment. I waited 24 hours after gluing a joint with Elmers, just like I had with Titebond, and tried the same thing. I couldn't break the joint apart. I didn't try with all my strength, just the same amount I had used on the Titebond joint, and more. But, the joint held. So, I'm convinced the Elmer's is better for gluing mitered plywood joints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Bollywood Love Story","review":"Bollywood fans enjoy films like this one because they feature beautiful people in beautiful costumes and singing beautiful songs set agasint spectacular scenery.

Rani uses the cover story of an impending marriage, which delights Ajay's extended family ... and seems to renew Sonali's interest in him. Ajay and Rani begin to \\"pretend to be in love\\" which leads to real love, but will either of them admit it?

The vocals snap back in with a red hot fury.

I've returned to this CD many a time. I don't know why. Maybe it's the structure. Or the sheer \\"tribal essence\\" of it that my subconscious recognizes (and seeks). Ambient is OK to a point. But eventually it all starts to sound the same... Know what I mean? That's why I like \\"Origins\\". It evokes the primal like nothing else. Take the trip... You'll understand.........Tracks to emphasize in particular are Artifacts, Eyes of the Spirit, and Dreaming Now, Then. Also recommended is Suspended Memories, Forgotten Gods (again w/ Jorge and Suso). Same kind of trip. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"forgettable","review":"compare this album to roach's work with percussionist metcalfe on \\"serpent's lair\\" and you'll see the vital importance of persussion in tribal/trance. the tribal melodies on their own can't take it to the higher meditative level, and without the focus and energy provided by percussion the whole thing degenerates into nothing special. where the \\"serpent's lair\\" was brilliant and finds a permanent space in the CD changer, \\"origins\\" will get the obligatory 2 plays before it's retired to the CD stack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beethoven","review":"wonderful music for one of the greatest composers of our time.

While the more bold pieces like the 5th Symphony sound wonderful, the quieter \\"Moonlight\\" sonata and \\"Fur Elise\\" are extremely soft and you can almost hear the musician breathing. This is a problem on many other CD's, also, so if you're not picky about sound quality the fantastic price shouldn't stop you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with delivery","review":"I sent this candy bar to my mother in FL via Amazon/Prime; and it arrived melted and all broken up.

Otherwise I actually think it could have been entertaining, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where'd the Replacements Go?","review":"I'm a minor fan of the Replacements, but this solo effort by Westerberg is simply sub-par and BORING.

Buy that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"very respectable","review":"For the most part, Westerberg's solo debut is on par with most of his albums with the Replacements. Of course, there are a few duds (\\"Even Here We Are\\", \\"Things\\", \\"Glimmer of Light\\"), but for the most part, it's a fast paced album that just plain rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Good","review":"This album is disapointing! Without the chemistry of the rest of the replacements behind him the songs sound bland. There are a couple good songs but they all fall short of replacements quality material. The writing is weak for the majority of the songs too. If you want a good post-replacemets solo recond get Tommy Stinson's \\"Village Gorillia Head\\" or the Bash and Pop they're excelent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improves with repeated plays.","review":"It took me 5 plays to become completely captivated with this CD but after that I was hooked. A good range of rockers and whisper sweet ballads with great stuff in between.The lyrics are amazing - I expect no less from Paul Westerberg. Runaway Wind, First Glimmer, Black Eyed Susan, Things, and Even Here We Are (a precursor to the haiku-like Bookmark on Suicaine Gratifaction) are standouts for me but I really like every song on it. No waste material here.This is not for someone who is expecting to hear another Tim or Let It Be but if you liked All Shook Down or Don't Tell a Soul, give this one a listen or rather 5 or 6 listens. It's well worth the effort.

I loved it so much that I checked it out of the library as soon as she finished it. I've been a voracious reader ever since. I don't care if the stories about Lad are true or not - Mr. Terhune has written a book that makes me believe that Lad was real. I cried my eyes out several times while reading the book, and I wished that I could have a dog just like Lad. I still cry when I read it, his writing is that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story. Terrible edition.","review":"I love this story. I read it as a child and wanted to share it with my 11 year old daughter. I bought the General Books LLC (October 14, 2010) edition only to find that there are so many typos and errors in the text that it is practically unreadable. This copy was robotically scanned in (99% accuracy, unless a page is missing or two pages are stuck together during the process) and printed using Optical Character Recognition software (again, only 99% accurate, worse if the book used to scan was old or worn). No human ever proofread this book and there are so many errors, it became difficult to even read the text at all and took away much of the fluidity and grace of the story. So by all means, buy this book, it is a classic, timeless story. But please buy a different edition. One proofed by human eyes. This one is an embarrassment to publishing houses everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lad, a Thoroughbred in Body and Soul...","review":"I loved this book very much, and even still read my favorite chapters if I have nothing to do. The book is not one whole long story, but a series of adventures as experienced by Lad, a collie from Sunnybank. As others have said, it can make you cry, laugh, and even flare up anger. Lad is truly a special dog, as you will see when you read it. He becomes lost, is accused to killing sheep, acts as a guardian and playmate to Baby, and is a thoroughbred in body and soul, as his grave marker says.I highly encourage you to buy and read this book, I'm sure you will never forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical throwaway","review":"2 1/2Yet another in the never-ending onslaught of modern progressive rock letdowns providing typically watered up, easy listening rock, whereas (also typically) few instrumental segments provide the only obvious musical substance behind the awkwardly obscure fan concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Serving of Psychotronic Film","review":"Huge collection of various-quality horror and sci-fi!

Why do these comapnies insist on having their watermarks pop up ever 10-15 minutes for 20 seconds throughout the film? It's most annoying. And I buy DVDs to get away from that sort of thing. (And it's put me off buying any more from \\"Mill Creek\\"). And seriously apart from advertising it's pointless. My local community station shows films all the time where this happens. I'm assuming they just buy the boxed set and broadcast without clearance.Only other disappointment with this set.

Of course, many of the early features pre-date the movie rating system. However, there are a significant number of rated movies - some PG, but leaning heavily toward R.On a cheerful note, you can just reconcile yourself to thinking, \\"So - even if only a few movies are watchable, it's worth the price.\\" But it's not worth messing with returns & hoping you'll really receive 50 watchable movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality overrides cheesy fun factor","review":"All these are public domain movies with low production values.

Boring, poor quality, poor lighting, poor acting (not the good kind of poor acting, just plain bad!). Of the 50 movies I found at most 4 that were worth watching, and even some of those were bad at best. I have other of the \\"50 movies\\" and this is the worst of them. Save your money, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital version full of digital errors","review":"Unfortunately the character recognition software used by Google to digitize this book was inadequate to the task and has created a text essentially unusable. Clearly no one has done even the most cursory proof-reading before inflicting this on readers anxious to look into this renowned work. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a big fan of the DK readers.","review":"They're simply written non-fiction books. Most non-fiction books are written for older kids, or for younger kids only as read-alouds. A series of *factual* books that early readers can read to themselves?Brilliant.Not every kid wants fairies and talking dinosaurs all the time. Sometimes, they really just want plain facts.I really like these books.I do have one minor problem with them, and that is that the text is really not laid out in the best way for this stage of reader. It can be a little distracting, jumping from section to section, and the text-boxes aren't any help - the information they contain should really be integrated into the main text instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves the book","review":"I got this for my 6 year old daughter. It is at a good level for her to read, and she loves reading about bugs. Not only is it at a good level of reading for her, it is also very informative about bugs. She likes this book and giggles about the fact that it is about bugs. I like the fact that she can practice her reading while learning about bugs. It is not boring learning, it is really designed to be enjoyed by kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timely book in a era of misplaced values","review":"The Inner Edge could not have come at a better time. In a year filled with corporate greed and mismanagement, this book redefines what should be truly important in the world of business, and how to be successful and ethical at the same time. To have the Dalai Lama endorse it only reasserts the importance of the themes which resonate here. Ethics and spirituality do have a place in the business world, and if they can be successfully incorporated in the capitalist system, the world itself may become a better place. I especially liked the chapter on unfinished business, because it is often that which keeps us from developing into truly aware, healthy individuals. I only hope this book circulates throughout the business world, and maybe the greed-mongers will take a closer look at their own spirituality, and their effect on the community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!Jane Austen!","review":"Michael Kerrigan had done a good job in extracting funny and witty quotes from Jane Austen novels and letters!I love the pictures illustrated in this pocketsized book!It had divided section and many good advices from Jane Austen point of view.Gosh,she might have been a modern feminist in her time!It's quite a good guide especially for those who is taking English Literature in A Level.It sure helps me a lot!How about you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"basic information","review":"This book does not contain as much detail as I would have expected from such a highly rated text.

The camera sounds good if you look at all the features it has but when I hooked it up I found the software to be pretty bad. I'm a software engineer so maybe I expect too much but when you open the software and it takes up the full screen without a minimize button, i consider that pretty bad. Not to mention the software is not very intuitive at all and pretty difficult to work with.I also found that the picture quality was pretty poor as well. I have not worked with too many cameras but I have seen low price webcams with better pictures quality than this. And when you factor in the price, then it really is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy wireless","review":"Even after an upgrade to the newest firmware, the wireless connection was buggy. The included \\"IP configuration\\" tool never found the camera even after it had obtained an IP address from my router. I had to use the DHCP table from my router to find the camera's IP address. I eventually got it connected to my wireless network (40b WEP, DHCP), but after about 10min it killed all of my wireless connections. Worked ok when connected to wired ethernet network (except that the config util couldn't find the camera). Returning it ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bother","review":"Dont bother with this cam. DLink no longer provides support, and it took 15 hours to setup (and I know computers well!). Impossible to set up if your not computer proficient. Wireless sucks, hard to set up and range is poor. It is fairly cost efficient if you have the time to mess with it and the images are good. Need to purchase software to get the streaming video to a website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy and Difficult Installation but DLink Got It Working","review":"I would give this product a three star rating. The DCS 2100+ started out worse than a plague of locusts. To be fair, I am reporting the final result. A Senior Level Technician at DLink figured out the problem and with download of the latest update to the application software (IP Surveillance) the DCS 2100+ works as does the IP Surveillance software (It now allows minimalization of the screen. I still haven't conquered the surveillance mode completely and email alerts still don't work, nor have I figured out how to add my Linksys camera to the sureveillance software, but I am optimistic.Overall, this product has great promise. However, installation is not for the faint hearted. It may be the nature of the infancy of home networking or just the birth pangs of a relatively new product. I will add a few more DLink cameras to the mix when I am more comfortable with the remote monitoring functions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brought 2 of them, since there is really nothing out there","review":"That can compare in this cam in terms of spec.

We didn't think it wsa that dark, but color cameras need a decent amount of light to work with, and much more than you'd think. Obviously that would keep her awake, hence defeating the concept of baby monitor while she's sleeping.I returned it and am now looking for a decent B&W one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, sparkling and original, and zany","review":"Get Well Soon Book is absolutely hilarious, sparkling and original, and zany. Any who have bemoaned illness - including adults - will find this a jolly title which has a very simple message: there's always someone worse off. Harry the hamster gets his whiskers caught in his wheel, Danny the Dalmatian breaks out in stripes, and Delia the Dragon sneezes and catches herself on fire in this very simple yet heartwarming picturebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This thing stunk to high hell. And I tried everything to un-stink it. Baking soda, vinegar, time in the sun, time in the cold. It's just a very chemical smell that doesn't go away. So I threw it away. I'm sorry, but this reflects on Doc Johnson Company. Hence, they are off my list for any future purchases for even letting something like this hit the retail market at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless information!","review":"The author wrote 100 years ago about all sorts of esoteric material, like telepathy and mysticism, but this book is solid and practical, and the techniques work as well today as they ever did. You will improve your memory, easily and successfully. Atkinson's charismatic, upbeat writing style, a little dated, still makes you feel like he's there with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible to be used as a textbook","review":"While the book is informative and the opposite of a John Douglas book, it is terrible to be used as a textbook in a classroom. The book has numerous grammatical and spelling errors, and if that isn't enough to irritate a student that has received bad grades on papers for the same issue, it is fully opinionated. Not sure why someone writing a textbook would fill it with opinions instead of facts, but Keppel did it! On top of that, it is the same information repeated several different ways over the course of chapters in it. If you are a professor/instructor, please continue looking for a better book - your students would appreciate it. If you are a student, bring these complaints to light to your professors/instructors and ask them to use a different book - your classmates will appreciate you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For School","review":"It seems to be interesting so far but we are going chapter by chapter for class it might be awhile before we reach the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"KINDLE EDITION: UNNECESSARY RIPOFF!","review":"The hardcover book sells for approximately $45. The Kindle edition for approximately $39. Yet the digital book avoids all the publication and distribution and inventory costs. One can only conclude that the publisher is making an unreasonable profit and is not willing to offer the public digital books in the spirit of reducing costs for the consumer and making more books available to persons who otherwise would not be able to afford them. Shame on them.The above comments do NOT pertain to the book's content, i.e. the information contained in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Left Behind","review":"This is a novel which shows you what the Left Behind series could be if only the humanity of the characters were more evident. Elgin Woodell is a study in character, perseverance and unconditional love towards a father who does not always deserve it.This is also a story which made me love baseball again. You can almost smell the grass and feel the whoosh of the ball against the glove. When will they make a movie out of this wonderful testimony to the love of the game?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very packed w/baseball action!","review":"Rookie, though jam-packed with plenty of baseball action, has too much stuff about Elgin's mother breaking up with Neil and all that mess. No offense to Jerry, of course, but I don't think that many kids like that much of a mom and dad breaking up. But, it was one incredible book!PS Will there be a sequel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"VALUE VALUE VALUE","review":"I think that this is really one of the best values you're going to find anywhere in the world of classical music, especially for beginners. You're getting 10 CDs, each filled almost to capacity, with the most famous works from the most famous composers in the history of classical music. The sound quality is excellent on every disc.While I would have made some replacements on the list of who was included, I feel that this collection is a must-buy for anyone interested in exploring classical music in depth. Quality is high, quantity is high, you really can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid start","review":"This collection is a solid beginning in music appreciation. We use these CD's with our children, listening to one each month of the school year. The music is beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good basic collection","review":"With selections from numerous composers, it is an easy way to familiarize oneself with some of the most popular classical works and excerpts. A pleasant listen for the initiated too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music for a great price!","review":"We got this set for our infant daughter. We play the CDs in the evening when we are getting her ready for bed. The music is soothing and the CD quality is great. I bought a used set of CDs, but would never know since all the CDs looked brand new and couple hadn't been opened yet. Very happy with the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wide-ranging selection at an affordable price--4.5 stars","review":"This 10-CD set is very reasonably priced. The CDs average over 60 minutes each. The orchestras vary but the quality is high. It's, of course, a great way to introduce yourself, your children, &/or others to a variety of classical music. Of course, they had to limit the number of composers--so Brahms, Handel, & (my personal favorite) Telemann are not included. Boo! But you can't win them all. As a baroque lover, I like the Bach & Vivaldi CDs very much, but also the Mozart. Many of the included pieces are familiar (and may be on other albums in your collection if you are already into classical music). I find that their quality is comparable to the others I have. IMHO, the value one would place on this set depends on which composers, compositions, & styles of music one likes. In any case, it's a fine way to round out one's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best intro to classical that I am aware of.","review":"I purchased these CD's over 10 years ago. I was not into classical music at the time, just curious. It has kindled a love for classical music in my life. The performances are full of life and the sound quality is quite good for the most part. I would recommended this as a gift that will be appreciated in the short term and could blossom into a full blown love affair with classical music. It is an ideal way to discover what styles, works, and composers you like best."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't stay put","review":"we're starting to have a pretty big collection of geotrax items and I love most all of their construction quality but this one let us down, geotrax usually connect pieces together by a clipping system very solid and sturdy, small kids have difficulties putting them together or taking them apart, I do like that so there is no need to go help put it back together every other minute.but on this one, no idea why, they choose to change the system for a \\"kinda fit in\\" slide in, it keep detaching itself from the main circuit every time a car or train try to go through, it is very frustrating for my 3y old and for me...beside that yes, sure, door open, track turn to put the truck into parking space etc, but overall frustrating, especially as I don't get it... why did they had to mess it up?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"Bad acting, low budget, no plot, no engagement, no nothing.

Commuting 45 minutes each way to work and back daily, I rent a lot of CD/books from a \\"Books on Tape\\" type retail store. Since all the PO'B books in the store are on cassette tape, I was thrilled to finally see one on CD and rented it immediately. I had already read this book and was keen to hear it read to me. Boy, was I unimpressed. The reader was dull, droll, awful. Aubrey sounded like a creep, and Maturin was worse. I turned it off within the first few minutes so that I would not have the reader's voice replace the one's PO'B helped me create in my imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue at Half-Staff","review":"A disappointing series of vignettes with major gaps in the story line. As a retired naval officer I'm aware that there is very little reportable during a long sea voyage, but the author hasn't provided bridges between the events he does report. Maturin seems the main character in this one. Hopefully, the next book (and I presume there's one in the works as \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" appears only at the next-to-last page of this one) will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"JACK AUBREY RIDES THE WAVES AGAIN","review":"Aubrey and Maturin, Maturin and Aubrey - their lives and fortunes are as convoluted as the plot twists of the latest of Patrick O'Brien's chronicles. Picking up where The 100 Days left off, the pair cross the ocean, engage in middle-aged derring-do, and save the day for the twentieth time, with a spot of unexpected romance thrown in. As always the historical references are accurate; the minor failures of plot in this latest episode are easily overlooked. After all, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin are men like no others in modern fiction; they fight, love, drink, indulge in excesses, mourn, spy, and get away with the loot better than anyone. They're a pair of upright Harry Flashmans, ready to rescue the damsel, make off with the gold, and free the oppressed colonials from their decadent rulers. Hornblower never had it this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky Jack","review":"Patrick O'Brians Royal Navy is alive and well in Blue At The Mizzen.I read it as a preface to his final partial novel. I have read all of the Jack Aubrey novels some twice and three times over the years and Blue At The Mizzen is one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biography or fiction. How distracting!","review":"I chose Stone Diaries as a book review for our readers club and although I knew it was very popular did not have a clue regarding the story line. When I read the physical description of Daisy's mother & father then compared it with the picture I was perplexed as neither the description or ages was close and in fact the woman in the picture looked like the mother of the young man. Of course by the time I learned this book is considered a fictious biography (what's that?) I had lost the flow of the story. The pictures of the grandchildren I understand are the author's children. A preface or introduction would have been most helpful. I am presently at Daisy's bridal shower. The reviews on the web are for the most part certainly complementary and for this reason I will continue reading Stone Diaries, with an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Tediously written, incredibly boring tale of a woman of no particular interest to whom virtually nothing happens. Godawful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman Represses Herself to be Socially Appropriate","review":"This well-written novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1995. It is a well-written story about an inter-generational family, centered around a woman who distances herself from her core impulses and desires in order to be socially appropriate.The story is peopled by many eccentrics such as a man who creates a tower sculpture of limestone to commemorate his dead wife. Each piece of limestone has tiny sculpted pieces on it. This same man then builds a scale model pyramid in his backyard.While superficially warm and eccentric, the book's characters are somehow distant and guarded. I enjoyed this book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A multigenerational family saga of daily life","review":"This highly praised Pulitzer Prize winning novel centers focuses on the daily life of an as-it- were ordinary woman. But the extraordinary is present in her life from the very moment of her birth in which her mother died. The story is a multi- generational one and focuses on the inner feelings of the characters especially the women. There is a dramatic difference between the male characters and the female characters in regard to their intimate lives. But there is sympathetic relation to both male and female characters.The book has been praised for its sharp and insightful language.While sensing these positive qualities I felt a certain absence of 'lift' of a kind of intense joy in reading that I have when involved in books I feel to be of the most inspirational kind.Good, but not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, but a little depressing","review":"I liked this book, although I thought it was a little disjointed the way it kept jumping back and forth between narrators (is it Daisy who is writing or someone else?). However, it was pretty depressing. I'm not sure if I would recommend it to anyone else just because I didn't leave with a feeling that I had learned anything or been made better by reading it. It just seemed dreary and depressing. Left me with the feeling of \\"what's the point of it all?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful recording","review":"I finally picked up this book-on-tape at my library, after passing it by a million times. I've read a few of the book reviews, many of which I agree with completely (the positive reviews, that is), but I just wanted to add an enthusiastic recommendation of the recorded book. I've never heard Alyss Bresnahan read before--I've since discovered she's read mostly children's books--but I'll be looking for anything she does in the future. She would certainly rank in the top three readers I've ever encountered. The perfect voice for Daisy's story. I keep looking for excuses to drive so I can listen some more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Better","review":"This is a well-written novel with great imagery and intersting characters. However, the technique that Shields used to abolish characters was instant and unprofessional. All of the characters killed during the novel experienced their demise instantly as if Shields was desperate to discontinue them in the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible and bo-o-ring!","review":"If possible I would have rated this a MINUS ONE Star. If this is an example of a Pulitzer Prize winner I certainly will avoid Pulitzer Prize winners in the future. This has got to be one of the most boring books I have ever read. I should have quit after the first few chapers, but was hoping that it would improve. Actually it contined to become more and more terrible. I regret my totally wasted time on this one and am so thankful I didn't spend any $$ on it--my local library had it. How could something of this caliber possibly be a \\"national bestseller\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suckfest","review":"No lies,Spoiler---The 'best' part of this book is the scene where the skinny quarry worker has sex with his fat wife-enough said. At least that scene evoked a reaction other than boredom. I guess disgust is better than nothing. Only a frustrated writer would buy this book. This empty suckfest makes the dryest phonebook of a novel interesting by comparison. Oh yeah, I guess if you're a fat, boring, and pretentious chick, then maybe you should add Stone Diaries to your library. This book is a waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, as always","review":"Carol Shields is a magnificent writer who fully deserves every prize she has garnered, and many that have not been invented yet. Stone Diaries was as gripping and finely crafted as everything she has touched. Not a shallow read, but one that endures. I adore this author, and cannot fathom the one stars here. I would have given it six stars or one hundred, but five will suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grabs your attention, then drones on, and on, and on...","review":"This book starts out as a page turner, but then I found myself turning some pages without completely reading each one. I had to force myself to finish the last few chapters. The first third had a lot of potential, but the story lost it's flair after Daisy gets married for the second time. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than watching paint dry.","review":"This book came highly recommended to me, so I was a little concerned when I didn't feel it warranted the same merit. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought this book was the most boring they had ever read. I've read slower, quieter books before and quite enjoyed them. However, this book was beyond slow. I didn't make it past the first three chapters, and I must say that if a book doesn't grab me in the slightest way within the first 120 pages, then it is not worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Richly Moving Account of an Ordinary Life","review":"The Stone Diaries touched me so deeply that it is now my favorite book. It takes the life story of an \\"ordinary\\" woman and demonstrates the universality of us all as well as showing the uniqueness of our experiences. It touches on family and how well they know, or think they know, each other. To me, this book showed how precious each and every person is and how truly remarkable an ordinary life can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author Ever-Present (Too Bad I didn't care for her company)","review":"Every fiction writer must play the role of God. However most writers are subtle about it, silently leading the reader to his own (but also the writer's) conclusion. There is no subtlety in Miss Shields. She hits you over the head with her overly analytical philosophy, and even on some of the most mundane things. Her characters never flushed out as real, but rather paper dolls to look at. I will soon forget I ever read Stone Diaries, but I will never forget Miss Shields."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stoned Diaries","review":"What a boring awful book. It stoned me into boredom. I hated it so much I wanted to cry. Can anyone really understand how this book won the PULITZER? Mother of all that is good, who was the final jury on awarding this book the PEW LIT ZER!!!?

I only thank God that I bought it at a used store. Small miracles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of tripe","review":"I don't mind complex, experimental books; I don't even particularly mind rather pretentious books.

Something comes along that's even worse. Such was the case with this novel. Boring, inexcusably long, overly complex, vulgar. To be very eloquent: BAD. Just plain BAD. BAD BOOK. BAD.

(I'm a traitor to my country!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful insights into the human condition","review":"I bought this book after browsing the first page.Its writing style immediately appealed to me.Her use of language carries you forward on a crest with frequent dips of shattering insight.I loved the book's depiction of an individual's whole life and the choices she makes.Its a searingly honest portrait of one womans life and for me most telling of all were the final chapters on old age when the character's lack of self development becomes crushingly clear to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll hate the protagonist","review":"The protagonist is sappy. She cannot make a clean decision and when she does you no longer care. The writing was too experimental. It was hard to follow and awkward. The story is completely uninteresting.

A woman who is boring, writing that is dull and gray, and hard to get through."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I ever came across............","review":"This book gives one an incredible insight into the human psyche.

Now I have ordered all the other books by Carol Shields. She certainly is a skilled and wise author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderul quiet story","review":"I've read this book twice in the past several years and enjoyed it the second time as much as the first. It records the life and thoughts of a fairly ordinary person from her (unusual) birth to her death.I loved the way the mood and the characters themselves change as the story proceeds. (Daisy's father is a gem.)Carol Shields' writing reminds me of Jane Hamilton's although the story lacks the drama and crises in Hamilton's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writing, Little Substance","review":"This book is one of the most boring books I've ever read. There are enough ramblings for Mars and back. Carol Shields is a very good writer, but the underlying pretensions makes the book just another romantic potboiler. If you're interested in books about generations of families, read Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlative.","review":"The evocative images of Daisy's more-or-less ordinary life struck me with far more force than have the images of hundreds of novels that have gone before. I never once had to work at reading it, yet it kept me pondering eternal verities for days: an absorbing, joyful experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a biography for many ordinary woman around us","review":"Many people wasn't sure of what's going to happen to him/her and why he/she do cetain things along varies stages of his/her life. The story switches between different perspective (which is one of the theme) simply because though many people intended to be a good mother, daughter etc, she/he really means a different entity to that different people.

THESE are the classic illustrations most of us grew up with. THESE are the soldiers and the peasants we read about. THIS is the story I'm keeping for my nieces. The telling isn't too clever, or too silly, or too watered-down, or too grown-up. The illustrations are neither too slick or too consciously old-fashioned.

And the concepts of war and wariness are thankfully not things they understand either.But having said that, I would still purchase this book again. It's a classic story, one I well remember from my own childhood and I think it deserves a space on almost every child's book shelves though you may have to wait for your child to comprehend what exactly is going on.Four stars.

Unfortunately, you miss out on the context of what you're doing if you just follow steps. A much better book, especially for the beginner, is Roberts/Gross's Director X Demystified. That book assumes that you want to learn the whys and not just the by-the-numbers hows of multimedia development.

This was the textbook that we used in the class, and after using it, I was not satisfied.This book consists of tutorials that you perform, which increase in difficulty as you progress. However, instead of teaching you Director and Lingo, and how to use them, this book just has you do mindless tutorials. Sure, it tries to explain a few things along the way, but for the most part, you just follow directions, and do the tutorials.I learned a whole lot more about how to use Director and Lingo from Director 7 Demystified. It explained things in clear terms, and taught you how to USE the program, instead of just telling you what to do next for the tutorial. Demystified is also a vast reference for Director and Lingo, whereas once you go through the tutorials in this book, you will probably never come back to it.If you are trying to learn Director, I would definitely go with Director 7 Demystified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not get IF YOU ALLREADY GOT the Director 6 and Lingo Auth","review":"I give only one star because I allready got the Director 6 and Lingo Authorized (good one).

With the bridge comes outside influence that will forever change the town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge On the Drina by Ivo Andric","review":"The way Andric writes, I sometimes forget it is fiction.

I would someday love to find and read Signs On The Traveled Road, some say is his best work. Of course Bridge On The Drina won him the Nobel prize in literature and reading it now I can see why.

What the book did was underline the complexity of the area and the culture clashes which underscore its history. I especially was struck by the contrast between the Austrians (always DOING) with the towndwellers, who couldn't understand this attitude. I was also taken with the descriptions of the changes coming along and how people took them in their stride or else were perplexed and misled.

This book ought to remain what it is a work of fiction and nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobel Worthy!","review":"Ivo Andric and his \\"Bridge on the Drina\\" were an extremely great surprise. I truly did not expect to enjoy the book when I first picked it up. What I found was a rich treasure of Bosnian history. I understand that the work is fiction, but it seemed like such a true glimpse of history. Andric was a master of giving characters throughout the book that stoked the interest of the reader. The main character was the bridge itself. Everything and everyone else centered around this great old Turkish bridge. We see hundreds of years pass by over the reading of this book. Each of those new generations faces new challenges, from the days before a bridge existed, to the days of World War I. Everything in between gives detailed day to day experiences, intertwining generations and people. Andric really had a talent worthy of the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature, which he won for this book.

After the King's death Bagoas is rescued by a rebel satrap who is out of favor with Alexander and uses the beautiful boy as a peace offering to get back in Alexander's good graces.Alexander, in spite of his military genius, is innocent in the ways of love and in profound need of affection, which Bogoas, who is irresistibly attracted to Alexander,and sophisticated far beyond his years, is more than happy to give.The saga is a vivid picture of the conqueror and his world, rich in historical detail as well as stirring human involvement.

What I heard sounded glib and superficial where it should be weighty; ponderous where it should take flight. Normally I would recommend Sanderling's work without a second thought, but he was definitely having an off day here.Perhaps because of lowered expectations, I didn't find the Kegel performance as disappointing. No thrills, but nothing I would call bad, either. In fact, I thought it got better as it went along; the last two movements were pretty good.Oh, well, at least the CD didn't cost me very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bolo The Ghetto Child: So Much Pain","review":"Bolo could never have had any exposure, as this album is not well known and has been overlooked. Personally, I commend him for his effort on this one. Bolo is a real rapper with consciousness, and he can kick a decent rhyme or two. He flips lyrics of ghetto tales, anger, love, struggle, dreams and ambitions... and in a way, he touches you... He reminds me of 2pac in some ways with how his lyrics touch, yet Bolo is on a different level. The beats are not the usual, he is from Nashville TN, but a couple of the beats have a kind of New York sound to them. Regardless of how I can possibly describe them, they are nice the whole way through, and overall this is a tight, slept on example of a fine hip hop album that's on a conscious gangsta level. Definately pick it up if you get the chance, because it's worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than the first one.","review":"This book was no better than the first version.

Some of those chapters are extremely good. Others are very poor. In fact, portions of the book are the most difficult to read technical text I have ever seen. In those areas, gleaning the information needed for the CISSP exam (or any other purpose) is difficult at best. Also, there are some significant accuracy errors in some places. I really believe your money is better spent on the Shon Harris CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, Third Edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Purchase","review":"I bought this as gift for my wife as she enjoys the program. The first and 3rd seasons played fine on my DVD player and are fine. The second season discs would not play on my DVD player though. From looking at the covers on each DVD it appears they are a recorded set not an original. I was however able to play them on my PC which is hooked up to my HDTV so we watched them that way but the quality was poor and not HD. We are still enjoying the third season. For the price of all three seasons it was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shop Around","review":"This is a great set, but you always need to shop around.

The name of the album alone conjures up a bunch of Irish bands. When I first heard about it, I tried guessing what was the actual band line up they came up with, and while it's not exactly what I imagined, it's still a lot of really good Irish artists from a lot of different genres. My favorites are the punk bands, it's good to see The Undertones (Teenage Kicks), The Pogues (Fairytale of New York - classic track) and Stiff Little Fingers (Alternative Ulster). There's plenty of big hits on the CD from U2, Van Morrison, Cranberries, Sinead... The album's definitely worth getting, especially if you're looking for lots of variety but songs you can still recognize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Slipper","review":"I purchased the slippers last year and they have held up very well.

After searching several department stores, I finally found these. With wide width available they were a perfect fit. He had them for about a week when they ripped at the lacing, causing a large hole in the top of the shoe near the toe. I returned them and had a second pair sent. I thought maybe there was just a defect in the first pair.He had the second pair about a month, with little wear, maybe an hour or so a night. This time the lacing broke at the bow. Now the lacing has loosened and is coming out of the grommets. He had to tie it back together just to keep it from falling apart.I will definitely be returning these and DO NOT WANT ANOTHER PAIR.

Everything except the uppers, even the \\"leather\\" strings are fake. I'm okay with synthetic materials, but I expect to be able to tie a bow in my new shoe strings without breaking them. They broke the instant I gave a tug to tighten the bow. It wasn't a hard tug. That's when I noticed they don't even look real. The lining looks fake as well, and looks like it would wear out in no time. They just don't look or feel like high quality, and with stuff breaking within 20 seconds of my putting them on, I felt sort of ripped-off. With this experience, I contacted Amazon and arranged a return. UPS just picked them up, and my experience with Amazon, at least, has been good. I just ordered a different slipper that costs a little more and made in USA instead of China. I was tempted to rate these slippers 1 star but I was feeling generous today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Split Seams - Unhappy Hubby","review":"I have bought these slippers in Navy for a few years, but this last pair has split at the seam near the toe area.

Also AMAZON disappointed me by not charging this to the AMEX gift card as I requested but rather used my Debit Card as a result I have deleted my profile this was the second time this has happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brutally honest account of industrialized America","review":"The novel version of T.S. Elliot's poem the Wasteland, Miller pours out his soul on the decay of industrialized America. Miller describes in an achingly beautiful stream-of-consciousness prose, the utter despair of life in a city with no soul. People that dwell on the sex and vulgar language are missing the bigger point as Miller describes the hypocrisy, racism, sexism, bureaucracy in a hopeless world. For all the despair Miller describes, I still find a hint of hope, even when he describes the lowest of low individuals, he does it in a lovingly way. In Capricorn, you can see Miller's heavy influence on the Beat Generation. Truly a masterpiece in literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tropics by H.Miller are bold Sexual Realities!","review":"I feel it's the duty of every American to read this book. Henry Miller tells the world to relax and enjoy the entertaining side of sex. I've read this book 2 x's and it gets better each time.

Ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A narcissistic book","review":"The first chapter is extremely long and simply dedicated to words and flaunting himself. Mr. Miller admits he loves words and he sure does, too bad he does not have the same love for plots. The second chapter is a teenager-like bragging of his sexual exploits, for which he loses his gift for words as the most common are 4-letters either to describe the act itself or the female anatomy. It's all about HIS pleasure. No concern about HERS. My guess is that his bragging is based on insufficient experience or he would find the long descriptions he reserves for the city buildings and cornices. But then, I admit I did not read to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"has not held up into the 21st century","review":"looking back during the period of time when Miller wrote this may have invoked more of a edgier feel for thebook. analageous to hearing lenny bruce today, miller doesnt shock or hold the attention for me these days. more of a description of life in brooklyn and manhattan and a distance from some of the sexual stuff would have this book a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point of this book?","review":"I am 17 and I got this book at the school library. I have found three main themes the author seems to be putting out: the main character tells the story of a tragic death, the main character complains incomprehenisibly about America, the main character rates the female anatomy in relation to it's personality. This book has absolutely no plot or even a story line, it is simply the ramblings of a sexually disfunctional person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notes on the Kindle edition","review":"Obviously the book is a masterpiece.

It has one of, if not the strongest opening images of any book I've read: the yearning for that which is impossible and that which will destroy us, put into image and action, the way fiction should do.

His description is not only accurate but lyrical; his characters are finely drawn; the plot is intricate and complex.

Much to my delight, the DVD is not the cesspool of quality others have rated it at; it's a good collection of classic Popeye, plain and simple.The quality could be worlds better here and there -- and the original makers of these cartoons could have kept them stored in climate-controlled, air-tight vaults. The thing to remember is a lot of these shorts were made for the simple reason of economics; they were made to make money, not for prosperity. Care of the original film wasn't a priority after it was made.Regardless, this collection is great. It's fun to watch, I'm seeing cartoons I haven't seen in years, and my son loves them. Could it have been a better DVD? Sure, given a lot of factors. For now, I'm happy to sit on the couch and enjoy Popeye with my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFIC ... TOOT, TOOT!","review":"He's short, balding and downright ugly. But he is everyone's hero, the man with the corncob pipe, long fuse (we mean temper, not that fuse!) and an equally unattractive gal pal named Olive Oyl. He's Popeye, the Sailor Man (toot! toot!) and his life and times is celebrated in these restored and digitally remastered cartoons. Wimpy? Never! Spinach not included."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for the military historian","review":"The title comes from the German view of the English soldiers who charged into their machine guns and barbed wire: \\"Lions led by donkeys.\\" The donkeys were the professional officers of the British army that was destroyed in those battles, officers who were unable to adapt to the awful technology that changed the face of war forever. When I was studying under Michael (now Sir Michael) Howard at All Souls in 1972-4, he insisted that this book should be read by anyone who wanted to understand the early phase of the Great War. It is a classic and must be read by anyone trying to understand the impact of the War on the English people, and the shock of the early battles on the perception of the British military of what needed to be done. It is judgmental to be sure, and would not be the only source one would need to understand this critical transition, but it is nonetheless an essential text.Bob Rizzi Bethesda, MD"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my most useful books!","review":"I've used this book more than most in my collection - quantities are easy to double (or more) and the menus go very well together.My favourites are the pea and pesto salad and the shortcakes with the cream biscuits. The tea sandwiches are also fantastic!I recommend this one to my friends all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I have seen Ina Garten on the Food Network and liked her simple and elegant foods. Her book is just as wonderful as her show. Her recipes ARE simple to follow, each with fabulous pictures. They are elegant and great tasting.

If I have one small criticism. it is that not all recipes have the amount of servings supplied. But overall, this is a wonderful asset to any kitchen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift thanks Amazon","review":"I bought this as a gift for my neice, but could not help but browse through it.

Love the fact that she does not have weird strange ingredinets necessary for the dishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and delicious","review":"I was given this book for my 40th birthday, and it has turned out to be one of my favorite gifts. Every recipe I've tried so far has worked, been delicious, and required little last-minute preparation to make them perfect for entertaining. The chicken chili for a crowd was a big hit. The popovers worked beautifully; my children loved them. The briscuit was a touch salty, but was easy to prepare and I'll reduce the salt next time. Ina Garten's instructions are very clear and just looking through the book gives me ideas and inspiration for entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite cookbook","review":"I loved this book, i rented it from the library and now i just purchased it.

Thoroughly enjoy her writing style and tried-and-true recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but intimidating","review":"She's a lively writer and her general attitude (don't work so hard that you nod off during the main course) is surely welcome. But there's little here for those of moderate means. Can you afford beef tenderloin for eight? And who eats this much, anyway? If you've got more splash than cash, try Prue Leith's Dinner Parties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! A cookbook for the rest of us!","review":"I love to cook and bake but I run screaming from complicated recipes. This cookbook contains simple recipes for really great-tasting food. It is uncomplicated and the adjoining photographs are simple and elegant. Never have I found a cookbook where page after page I have found recipes that I actually want to try.I made the ceasar salad the first day I bought the book, the sour cream coffee cake the second. Both turned out fantastic! Tomorrow I shall conquer the delicious-looking rugelach.The book is touted for parties but don't let that fool you. These are great recipes for simple family dinners as well as large parties. The book is also sprinkled with Ina Garten's advice and past experiences.I thank Ina Garten for this wonderful new cookbook - but moreover, my husband thanks her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you shouldn't believe your own success","review":"First off, yes, I like Ina Garten's books--and her cooking. Most of the recipes here are simple; the food, satisfying. But this book is too enamored with its own success. Most egregious are the listed recipes that are not found in the book, but are simply referenced to her first book. Savvy marketing, no doubt. It makes sure you buy both books. But irritating, nonetheless. And there's just so much rank sloppiness going on. The party for twenty? Look at the yield in the recipes--some are for 6 people, some are for 8, others, more. So what do you do if you're indeed having twenty over? Someone, I think, just slapped together a bunch of recipes and thought, well, we're already a success. Why sweat the details?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Butternut squash and apple soup recipe is awesome!","review":"I feel like I shouldn't be giving this a star rating since I don't actually own the book, but I've read most of it. My mom has the book and I copied out the butternut squash and apple soup recipe. It is delicious! I don't have dinner parties but I make it for myself as an everyday meal. I'm just out of college and always trying to find things that taste good, are easy/quick, inexpensive, and healthy, though usually I have to sacrifice one or more for the others. This recipe tastes amazing, one of my favorite foods, and is also really easy. Since it's made from apples, onions, and squash, it's healthy, relatively inexpensive, and the ingredients stay good longer than most fresh fruits and vegetables (I always have trouble with fruits, vegetables, herbs, etc. going bad before I make my dish).My mom also makes the beef tenderloin (filet mignon?)- though not with the sauce; it's our favorite thing for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barefoot Contessa Parties","review":"Ina Garten cooks the food I like to cook. It's uncomplicated to prepare and delicious to eat. Barefoot Contessa Parties has been a really useful addition to my very large cook book collection. I have used it mainly for everyday meals rather than specifically for 'parties'. The ingredients are generally readily available (in Australia) and the instructions are clear. I like that Ina has included some of the more basic recipes such as pesto for instance. I must have over 10 recipes for pesto but this one is the best (although I never add oil to the pasta water I've been told that the sauce slides off rather than clings to the pasta)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iam inspired...","review":"The book is well written.

What more can I say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessary for library","review":"Although I have enjoyed the beautiful photographs in her new cookbook I was disappointed in the cooking portion. It is not a book the serious cook would need for their bookshelf. Many of the recipes are variations of those found in her friends homes and restaurants. I was looking for a more original approach to her entertaining and found it lacking. Unfortunately it appears to have been written for her fame rather the cooking. With only 84-85 recipes in the entire book, I would have hoped to find something besides 'Mac and Cheese'."},{"rating":"1","title":"FGFV's Thoughts","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I thought it certainly was pricey and I expected much more then full page photographs of people I don't know and don't care to. Also I felt the childrens section was a total waste of space and paper.

This little volume is truly a blessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong and Touching","review":"This novel is a great novel for not just women, but men as well. In the book, the main character is Gertie, who has problems with decision making. She is looking out for the best interests in her family. With her unselfish ways, she tries to do her best. This takes place during World War II, in the United States. During that time, people had to help in the war. Her husband was chosen to help out in Detroit, which is the beginning point of her problems. Since she is from the south, she experiences a whole new world up north, and at the same time deals with her problems in the family. Gertie, is probably one of the strongest woman characters that I have read. By reading this novel, you'll be able to experience the adventure and drama that Gertie goes through, it will touch your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic","review":"It took me forever to read this novel because it is very, very descriptive and very long. I also found the story very depressing even though it is truly very well written.The story starts in the hills of Kentucky during World War II and Gertie is trying to get her sick child down the mountain to a doctor. She is a strong willed woman who will do anything for her children.The story progresses from the mountains of Kentucky to Detroit, where Gertie's husband take a factory job. Gertie leaves the Kentucky home that she loves due to her mother's nagging and her husband's insistence.From there the story goes down hill and never returns to anything good for Gertie or her family. The story is a treatise on city versus the country and also on industrialization and farming.I can not recommend it since it was so depressing, with one tragedy after another and because it was very tedious reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for this book","review":"I kept trying to read this book and just can't seem to get into it. Can't stand the way it is written in slang. If it would of been written in better language I may of gotten into it, but had to keep trying to figure out what the character was saying, so needless to say put it back up on the shelf and haven't taken it down since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"549 pages of misery. Reminded me much of Ken Rouch's painful movie \\"Ladybird, Ladybird\\". Depressing to read, especially when I thought I had figured out, about 100 pages before the end, what was going to happen. But the end, when it came, took me completely off guard, made me want to weep. Which says an awful lot about Arnow\\"s writing capabilities. You never saw her writing. No overblown metaphors or similes. Just a bleak portrait of one hillbilly woman who could not change or learn from her mistakes. And pays, oh so dearly. And yet she paints her characters with such vivid brush strokes that they leap off the page and into my thoughts in bed. A book not easily forgotten . Yet not remembered with ease either. What a tragic figure is Gertie Nevels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I am an avid reader but I found this book \\"over the top\\", too many characters, too slow, (stayed in one scene far too long), almost written in a 'foreign', very difficult 'language'. Unfortunately, not a good read at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time!","review":"I could care less about this book being depressing as that is the only thing that made the read realistic for a person trying to live in an urban city where things are much more expensive, and work much more fast paced then Gertie's(main character)original country home. The book was far too detailed. For God sakes one does not have to have specific step by step detail on every doll carved, or every pointless digresing thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave or Coward","review":"While I did enjoy parts of the book, I find it to be lacking overall. Gertie is a believable character but lacks in courage. She was supposedly a strong person. She did face many challanges but didn't overcome then. Instead she sidestepped her problems. Not until the last page does she actually become the character she is portrayed to be but I barely made it to the last page. The climax occurs far too early in the book so the resolution takes up far too much time. The one star was given on pity alone. Do not read this book if you have seen the movie. In fact do not read this book period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking books that I have ever read.

The language used to attempt to glorify Dr. Wecht had the opposite effect on me. I felt it was overdone, childish and unnecessary.However, other than that, I think this is a very sensible, readable book, and I do recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Ramsey case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely interestnig","review":"I completely disagree with readers who've called this book \\"disappointing\\" and said that it shares \\"nothing new.\\" Cyril Wecht's interpretation of the forensic report sheds light on motive, opportunity, and means. Charles Bosworth's writing is of a very high quality for true-crime books. The authors do an excellent job of providing the differing points of view in the case (police, DA's office, and the Ramsey family), but they don't shy away from educated speculation (which of course is what all of us who are so interested in the case are engaged in). I would recommend it to fellow Court TV junkies and those with an interest in true-crime stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy but interesting","review":"Cyril Wecht's theory of what happened to JonBenét Ramsey ( a sex game gone wrong) is interesting.

WOW what a mistake. Its my own fault but I thought this was the real People magazine and not the style version, My wife was very disappointed and I looked like a fool when she opened up the mail box. Apparently this magazine is a huge rip off and now I'm stuck with a years worth of a magazine that I cant even give away!

Imagine my horror when I realize their gifts are arriving sporadically IF AT ALL!!! Only received 3 out of 10 promised issues the entire year for my subscription. Seems to be a pattern with this Company. Yet they have the gall to send me my Renewal Notice. How about the Magazines I've already paid for!!!!!! Loved the Magazine when it did arrive. Nice change from the typical fashion magazines bizarre clothes that most people wouldn't even wear. These are actually real clothes that you can find in the store or find similar styles at a price point within ones budget. Wouldn't recommend subscription as it is not worth the cost given the sporadic delivery/missed issues, but would recommend reading it/flipping through the pages at perhaps your public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"People Style Watch Magazine order","review":"I ordered this Magazine (People Style Watch) December 1st it was supposed to arrive in 6-10 weeks it has been over 10 weeks and I have yet to see on issue.

I subscribed last year directly through their website, paid $20 for a one-year subscription and I only received 2 issues so that's why I tried subscribing through amazon... but it's been even worse. The magazine itself is good but it isn't worth the hassle of subscribing since you end up paying 10 dlls per issue if you only get 2 in the whole year.

This book went into the minds of rapists, tortured victims, and a lot more. Ted Bundy is one of the serial killers in this book. The people that were brutally abused raped and also were murdered. People that are so sick would rape little kids and that wouldn't stop there! It would soon lead to murder. This book could help others understand who and why these people did the things they did. It may help others aware of the people and realize what kind of behavior to look out for. Like the ones that are always teased and made fun of or the one's that keep to themselves. (They always look out in space wondering what it could and would be.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"This book was 900 pages too long. I liked the basic story but everything was so dragged out and the descriptions of the characters were boring and long. Plus the author used the word \\"pragmatic\\" incessantly.

I would recommend \\"An Absolute Scandal\\" however."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, readable, 1st-hand account of 20th-C. physics.","review":"Serber, one of the most important and influential physicists of this century, tells it all. His perceptive and candid accounts of Los Alamos, Hiroshima, and US physics before and after WWII is amongst the best I have ever read. Of particular interest are a series of transcribed letters Serber and his wife exchanged while Serber was leading a group to Japan to study the effects of the bombs. These original accounts of his first impressions, untempered by decades of reflection, alone make this book worth reading. Any scientist, historian or well-read person will enjoy and learn from Serber's reminiscences."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"first time i ordered the item i was pleasantly surprised each chocolate was filled nicely with burbon and had a strong burbon taste. second time i ordered the item there was very little if any burbon in the chocolate. attempted to contact the seller and had no response. don't waste your money on this expensive item"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good price...but short on interpretation","review":"This collection is a good bargain for people who want to be introduced to the romantic classical music. The 10 CD really contain a great deal of music. However, the playing falls short. The playing was dry and boring, with little hint of emotion involved in the performance. To be honest, even most of the bargain CDs I find in K-mart have much better playing than this. I never fast forwarded or skipped as many tracks on a classical CD as I did on this one. If you just want to hear a large selection of pieces regardless of the playing, then get this. But if interpretation and playing matters for you, there are better bets else where. The \\"Millenium Top 40\\" is also a collection, but the pieces there are actually beautifully played. Naxos' Romantic Pieces for Piano Collection are also a good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, dude, but there's only one Barry White","review":"I'm usually open to trying out anything where Maurice Starr is involved (he wrote all the songs on this album), because he's been a force behind a lot of the music that I grew up with. Despite his rich legacy, this is one album that's pretty well deserving of its obscurity. Starr tries his best as always with the songwriting, and some credit must be given to Rick Wes's backing crew for creating some lush, nicely textured backgrounds here (including saxophone work by Gerald Albright and backing vocals by Margo Thunder of the 80s girl group 9.9). However, whoever actually let RW himself take the mike should be spanked. He speaks too much (and in an annoying monotone fashion at that), he's not much better at singing, and his deliberate Barry White knock-off would probably have White turning over in his grave.Not grossly disgusting, but not recommended for anyone other than hardcore Maurice Starr fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great!","review":"The volt gauge is a little jumpy but all in all they look great and work great.

In this book, she takes a storyline that might at first seem a little cliche, then puts some fantastic spins in it so you never know what's going to happen next. I was really impressed by her ability to keep me guessing all the way through the book. Her characters are believeable and as usual, I couldn't put it down until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"I had this book before and lost it which is why I ordered it.

Although, I find the book engaging to some degree, I get really turned off by the misrepresentation of the Goddesses Ezili and Het-Hru (mistakenly called Hathor--the wellknown Greek name for the Goddess). If you're writing from the perspective of the people who originally worshipped the goddess, at least get her name culturally correct. It would lend more authenticity to the storytelling. The limitations given to Ezili in the story are painful to read (a goddess trapped inside a human?? A goddess being birthed in the 1800s??). Sorry doesn't sit right or fly right with me. The modern vulgar language used by the goddesses are insulting and disturbing. I was excited to read this book. I was dissappointed. Nalo is a talented writer. I give the writing 4 stars, however, because of the way the goddesses and African descended women are presented in the story, 2 star rating overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unimpressed","review":"The weight change is nice but as you hold the mouse and put pressure on the top, the weight releases up into your hand. The physical size of the mouse is too small, it does not feel comfortable. The cable is very stiff and lies in loops across the desk. After several ejections of the weight, many small pieces of plastic were broken off and were discarded. I expect that to be called a gamer's mouse all these deficiencies need to be corrected. Very annoying - I returned what was left of the mouse and received my money back and all this trouble was in two weeks time, save your money and get a logitech mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the first few days but...","review":"This mouse has some very good things going for it. After you get used to where you put your hand it's very natural feeling. The weighting choices makes it so all people can get approx. their favorite weight. The button to change sensitivity is made for first person shooter gaming. Going from sniper rifle to assault rifle sensitivity preferences is a snap. That being said, Mine started to double click after a few days. It's gotten progressively worse and now I'm back to using my old mouse. Avoid this mouse at all costs. Unless you don't like to have to click the button 2 times to double click. In that case this is the mouse for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive at all","review":"I didn't find the shape of this mouse particularly ergonomic. maybe it would be better for gaming, but i doubt the angular shape had any intent other than to look cool. right out of the box, there was a little rattle inside and i unscrewed things to find a little plastic nubbin broken off. the main problem is that after a few weeks, it developed a problem where it will double click on a single-click-- not every time but frequently enough to be really annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage. Really.","review":"I got this at a very low price because creative is trying to clear the channel. It still wasn't worth it.The design is okay, but the build quality is awful. The plastic piece that holds the weight in broke off and so I had to glue one of the weights in permanently. My left mouse button also has the intermittent click pressure problem which makes the mouse useless.If you pay for this thing you are insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good mouse...for about a month","review":"I bought this mouse right after getting a new laptop and Call of Duty 4. At first I was really impressed with the weights and the button to change the sensitivity. Unfortunately the honeymoon period didn't last long.After a few weeks inserting and removing the USB mouse cord would cause my computer to give me a blue screen and shut down (this hasn't happened with any other mice/mouses? on this computer). I learned to tolerate this...somehow, but after about 5 months the left mouse button decided it had a mind of its own. It was the same problem everyone else has had. Mouse double clicking or not clicking at all.Its a great mouse for gaming and other computing uses. Only drawback is that it will die out on you quickly.

And after about 3 months of usage it simple quit responding to most anything you tried to do. I would literally have to click something close to a dozen times before it would actually \\"Double-Click\\". Not to mention the feel of the mouse is just too bulky in my opinion. I fell into the hype of the \\"Fatal1ty\\" product line, which many gamers did. And what many gamers will tell you is \\"Don't ever buy anything with the Fatal1ty trademark on it, it will die.\\" For instance, look at reviews for the Creative X-Fi Fatal1ty.

It's not a small thing that you can ignore, its very annoying and time consuming. The dpi sensitivity LED is a nice feature, but that's the only good thing about this mouse. I am switching back to the old MS mouse. So far my experiences with MS and Logitech mouse have been great. I am surprised no one has sued creative labs for selling this defective product in mass quantity, I believe if the other customers who gave a glowing review to the mouse were asked to update their old reviews at least half of them will be changing their mind about this.

The weight rattles as the mouse moves and the button clicks are LOUD.I prefer the speed adjustment of the G5 rather than the 1010. The 1010's is just one button that you use to rotate through the speeds rather than, as on the G5, up/down buttons.The thumb button is oddly placed and kind of hard to push.I really do like the feel of it in my hand, and it slides really smooth.

I've since dropped the class and returned the book, good riddance. Maybe the expected level of education has plummeted since I finished school 3 years ago, but this was an early high school level book AT BEST. Yes, the pictures are colourful and pretty, but they were also gigantic, taking up entire half-pages in some places. That's called padding. The type size was enormous (more padding) and most of the textbook was just a not-that-brief summary of the bible text - you might as well just read the bible itself.This book is for COMPLETE BEGINNERS who have never picked up the bible and probably never plan on doing so in the future after reading this book.

Almost the entire movie demonstrates how violent and harsh the prison is. You see prisoners beaten, abused, and killed...and that's just by the prison guards. Don't get me started on the fellow prisoners. I kept waiting for something good to happen to the protagonist. WARNING: SPOILERS. When the movie is almost completed we see 5 minutes of a successful escape until he's thrown back in the hoosegow. We then see more abuse until finally in the last TEN SECONDS of the film, a narrator tells us the protagonist successfully escapes. We don't even get to see him succeeding.

I use these to store flour and sugar. Two major problems: 1. It's difficult to twist and open. The lid it too wide to get my fingers over it and there's no handle to grab and twist. I find it very awkward and difficult and approach it with dread. If it's not closed tight, bugs will get in. When it's closed just a little tighter than it needs to be (which you can't tell,) it's that much more difficult to open. 2. The opening is too narrow to be able to scoop flour out into a measuring cup without flour falling outside the container. I'm now in the market for a new cannister set.On the plus side, these cannisters will last forever. The ability to see what's inside the containers is always useful.

This sprayer can also be used as a generic sprayer. I usually set the dial to 3 oz, which feeds the liquid at that seeting per 1 gallon of water - which is what a standard 10 gallon sprayer will push out. This sprayer is fool proof, comes with instructions and the Ortho name recognition. The dial has over 10 settings and the tip rotates to provide up and down and side to side spray pattern. For streams up to 30 feet, gentle pull on the fanning nozzle to remove it which now allows for a heavy stream for tall trees. I have had and still use the same Ortho Dial n Spay hose end sprayer for over 6 years without any problems.

I don't even think it was mixing the proportions right when it was working, the Ortho insecticide concentrate that went into it ended in a few minutes - it was supposed to make 16 gallons and last a while, however I am sure it ended in like 5 mins or so of spraying.

Stay away from this horribly engineered product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"For years I had a old fashioned kind of Ortho sprayer where one had to measure the liquid before pouring it into the bottle. Worked like a charm until old age got the best of it and I had to purchase the newer dial n spray. First one I got sucked all the product out of the bottle in no time so figure somehow the water wasn't getting mixed in. This sprayer soon ended up in the trash. Think I have reluctantly purchased 2-3 others since then and all have ended up smashed to pieces due to frustration or in the trash.

One example a guy that can put an entire car together in an hour. And then the reason he did was totally stupid as when the remote control car was driven thru the wall he could have simply took the bag out of the hatch and drove the same car out of the store.

And the Classical Pilates has some advanced and super advanced movements that the Stott does not have.I gave it 4 stars because I prefer the 2nd edition to the 3rd. The warm up and the after workout stretch are better.

I've have this printer a year, and the magenta toner cartridge is low. $180 plus shipping. The other cartridges are just about as expensive. If I can't find some reasonable priced toner, this may end up being a $300 disposable printer. That's around $500 for a year's worth of toner.

Not just the fact it was much better written, but much more useful knowledge contained within it's pages.The only reason I would recommend this book is to a fellow Marine.

Unlike many \\"We did this, then we did this,\\" battle recollections, this work is a keen analysis of the US Marine Corps, its history, and America's reasons for having her.The book starts from the premise \\"The U.S. doesn't need a Marine Corps,\\" \\"Brute\\" Krulak articulates why America chooses to have one anyway. Not least among the gems of history in this book is the role Brute Krulak and others in the Chowder Society played in keeping the Marine Corps alive the last time the Executive Branch and Department of the Army conspired to kill her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brute Pulls no punches","review":"Brute Krulak had an exceptional career as a Marine officer. This book is close to exceptional as it details many of the behind the scenes workings to save the Marine Corps after WWII and again after Korea. The general public is little aware of how close the Corps came to an ignominious end at the hands of President Truman as well as high level Army and Navy officers. Fortunately for the nation they were, in the end, unsuccessful. Also Brute tends to somewhat give himself more credit than in some instances is due. That, however, is a small failing and his well written history of the Corps comes off quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Funny , and Fantastic!","review":"Have fun following Ojo the Unlucky, Bungles the Glass Cat, and Scraps the Patchwork Girl on their quest, in which they make some unusual aquaintances!

You'll learn about the regulatory politics and tv production practices that gave rise to classic children's tv shows like Sesame Street, Strawberry Shortcake, and GI Joe--and that have continued to influence the content of children's tv in important (and often deeply problematic) ways. It is a serious read, but well written and compelling. I have used chapters from the book in classes I've taught (university level) on children and the media, and the discussions that have followed (about deregulation, commercialism, gender, cultural imperialism...) have been very lively. In many cases, students have continued to refer back to concepts raised in the book throughout the course."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather be doing anything else...","review":"This book is entirely too complex to understand.

It is PURE PROPAGANDA from start to finish.Leaving aside the obviously Pagan elements, the major message here is that human beings are bad and that our very existence is a threat to Mother Nature. Every human in the movie is only interested in destroying the forest for profit. Never mind that wood is used so that we have homes to live in, never mind that all industry provides job so that we can pay for those homes, that does not fit with the Leftist narrative. Humans are always the problem.Next is the production value of the movie itself. My guess is that they spent all their money hiring Robin Williams because the animation and story are sub-par. The music is horrible as well.There simply is not one single positive thing to say about this movie.

We replaced it with Tarzan which is infinitely better. I do realize some kids may like this. I just don't know any of those kids.Nor is this something that adults could enjoy. The animation is not up to the level of other similar movies. Even if you can get past Robin Williams' grating voice, the story is simplistic almost to the point of stupdity.

I'm sure it wouldn't scare me now, although it might bring back bad memories, but it's just... freaky.

Once I got past the initial awe of having it right in my hands, I was dazzled by how well detailed it was. The designer kept everything, including the skull-shaped handle in the center of the cross, and little dots along the cross where the nails were. There were only two problems I had. 1: I'm not a Christian. Ever where I go people were asking me if I'd become a Christian, so I had to stop and explain the whole story behind me getting the necklace. My grandparents are Catholic, so they were thriled when they saw me wear it. (I didn't have the heart to tell them it was from an anime show) Problem 2: It snapped in half. I have to go and buy a new one because after almost a year of the cross going from neck to pocket and back, it broke one day.

The title of the book demonstrates his complete ignorance, as there is not such thing as \\"the emergent church.\\" Emergent is a conversation, re-evaluating and deconstructing our traditions and \\"traditional\\" approaches that is theological, ecclesial, and missional.

His research is limited - he looks for what he wants to find and looks no further. The use of a singular example (McLaren) as a sample shows how entirely unrepresentative his description of the emerging church is. Worse than this, Carson comes close to deliberately misrepresenting the movement by his category mistakes - attempting to portray the movements motivations as naive theological adventurism (as if George W. Bush were running the rock-show), instead of a multi-faceted attempt at greater missionary engagement with the contemporary context.Those who wish to embark on a witch-hunt will find all the 'absolutely true, objectively factual evidence' that they need here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrow, Shallow and Not Very Conversant","review":"Honestly I am dissappointed by professor Carson's 2nd rate engagement with the emerging/missional shift. He has many assumptions which he does not bring to the fore front and seems very sure that the Bible is a completely objective arbiter of truth. Yet the Bible is an interpreted and living text. We should all howl at Evangelicalism for burying the Scriptures under a plethora of big church programs and self-help, 1-2-3 psychologizing for a consumer culture. Mind you the emerging movement is being birthed out of a generation that grew up in boomer churches. I find it intriguing that D.A.

I always like it when the Romulans or Klingons appear in the Star Trek Series be it The Next Generation or Deep Space Nine or Voyager. But the original series really gets it right when it came to the Romulans (not only this epiode but in the episode \\"Balance of Terror\\"). This episode begins with the Enterprise crossing the Neutral Zone which is like the Iron Curtain during the Cold War between the USA and USSR.What the Enterprise is doing in Romulan Territory is anyone's guess until the last 20 minutes or so.

From then on, I had to be super careful to make sure the hose did not pull off again when reinserting the bladder into my pack.Despite that, the detachable hose (where it is supposed to detach) and handle are great features to have.

There was also no detectable plastic taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty junky","review":"Handle breaks frequently, the tube melted for some unexplained reason, and will have to be completely replaced.

On my first trip to Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky, I had no problems with it. It worked perfectly, no leaks and an ease to use. However on my second backpacking trip this past August to Dolly Sods Wilderness in West Virginia, the hydration bladder leaked like crazy. It soaked my backpack with water and made the trip a bit less enjoyable, hydration-wise. At the end of the weekend trip, I just filled my bottle from the creek and used my Aquamira Frontier Bottle Filter, another Amazon.com purchase, which worked great.I believe the leak is from the attachment of the hose to the plastic bladder.

The new design with the handle is very nice and seems like it will alleviate the problem with the joint between the tube and the bladder leaking. I've tried it out and so far, so good. The tube is quite a bit longer than the previous one and I may try the previous one (it came from an REI pack which REI no longer markets) as the new one is too long to connect to the magnate on the pack.

I tried to duck tape it, try to even wax it over, but none of these solutions worked. I eventually returned it and chalked it up as defective item, but not so sure anymore since other people are saying it leaks too. Design flaw possibly?

I am currently abroad and brought my 2 liter bladder with me to make carrying water while backpacking and traveling much easier.

I tried reattaching the hose and filling it up another time, with the same result. The hose simply will not stay attached to the bladder attachment, and this results in wet packs, wet backs, and no water left to drink. All around bad news. I would not recommend this bladder and I will be returning mine upon my return to the States.PS if anyone has any quick fixes for this, i'm all ears.

(Pages 85-120 are nothing but lists of artists and tunings, covering Chet Atkins, Sonic Youth and Led Zepplin just for starters.)

We take turns, he reads 3 paragraphs, then it's my turn to read 3 paragraphs.There are many valuable lessons that can be learned from this book. It is about real-life issues such as life, love, boredom, and death. It even provides a lesson in vocabulary, as Wilbur is always asking Charlotte what the big words that she uses mean.This is a perfect book for children ages 6-12. I wish more parents could spend time reading books like this to their children in place of the time that gets spent playing video games and watching TV.This book is a wonderful addition to all the other children's classics that make our world a better place!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading with your little one","review":"This was one of the first \\"long\\" books that my 5 year old and I have read together, as opposed to picture story books. He absolutely loved it. Our only issue was sticking to one chapter a night, as he was always begging me to continue for just 1 more page!The story is tender and realistic; a little sad in places, but good life lessons for even sensitive listeners - and a happy ending. My only very minor negative would be that in places the vocabulary and dialogue are a bit specific to time & place (American farmland), so culturally diverse young readers might need some explanation. I was easily able to substitute or explain a word here or there, and my son followed the story just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maple West Elementary - Mr. VanCise's Class -Charlotte's Web","review":"\\"Charlotte's Web\\", by E.B.

Though the concept of death is very well portrayed, I feel that it is a little too much for those under the age of 8 who have not fully accepted that concept, and though E.B.

White's classic novel was always one of my favorite books growing up. And today it remains one of my all-time favorites! I still can identify with Wilbur the charismatic pig, since I have been privileged enough to have many spiders as roommates. This book is probably especially meaningful to me, as an animal communicator, because it involves so many different animals trying to live and survive together on the farm.This is a wonderful book for young children, growing up, because it teaches them about their own self-worth in a busy world. It also teaches us about the value of lives, how short they can be, and how much we can make of them. Charlotte saves Wilbur by spinning words in her webs, using her short life to benefit his life and the lives of others.Harmony,Janet Roper"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Classic...","review":"We bought these two books for our daughter's fourth grade class.

We see Wilbur grow up and deal with fear, loneliness, and even the passing of a friend, all with the soft, easy prose of E.B.

White was not a children's book writer. This did not stop him from creating characters that children (and their children and grandchildren) have loved so dearly. When I was a child, I wrote Mr. White, thanking him for writing the books. I received a reply, the gist of which was that he would rather be sailing his boat than writing that letter. It was only after i grew up that I understood the humor in that. And so it is with Charlotte's Web. The book should be read at least every 10 years to appreciate it as a child, an adult and an old-timer."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"I'm 31 and still can't get over this book. I read it in my twenties (although I saw the movie as a kid) and still pick it up every year to read. Why? Because it's one of the best books--ever.E.B. White knows how to tell a story. Wilbur and Charlotte are two of the most memorable characters in all of literature. Put them in the same boat as Dorthy and Toto, Ma and Tom Joad, and Holden and Phoebe. Mr. White has written a beautiful book about friendship and redemption, and I found the Christian imagery to be facinating.There are lots of books out there, and if one had to choose the top 50 books in the history of the world, this would be one of them. I've read quite a few novels, but nothing in recent memory was as simple or profound as this little book.

The reason I think this book is the best and why I gave it a five is when it was first read to me I thought it was wonderful and that's why I think it's the best. Some of my favriote parts is when Charlotte has her babies, when wilbur won in the county fair and of course when Charlotte spends time working on her web to help Wilbur so he won't die.

This story of friendship, trial, and love is sure to warm anyone's heart. Despite the sad depth that hides within these pages, the heartwarming friendship shines brighter and makes for a pleasurable read.Charlotte and Wilbur's relationship together is realistic and helps draw readers into the story. While there are hardships and it can't be said that everything has a happy ending, this book has an ending that will leave readers satisfied.Not just a kid's story, this book shows deeper aspects of life. The fight for friendship, the circle of life, and the fact that not all things are as they seem.A true classic, I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading - and anyone who doesn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover doesn't fit properly","review":"This is just the right size for one martini but the cover doesn't fit properly.

Sometimes lighhearted, sometimes bewildering imagery, but always an adventure that takes the hero to hell and back - several times. When one wonders if Teidemann ever makes it back, one realizes that the entire book is written in the first person and this somehow adds to the value of the story. A wonderful examination of the very worst in human nature and nature itself. You will never see seagulls quite the same after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty good idea, not so good execution","review":"The idea is good, but the execution is poor.

The whole book consisted of an article or an event that had to do with the ethics of euthanasia and two people with conflicting views would write why. I wish that the book had some documented dialog between the two opinions. It was a little boring reading the same opinions over and over again. \\"euthanasia as long as it is consentual and necessary should be permitted yada yada yada\\" \\"killing another innocent being should not be permitted at all because it is murder yada yada yada\\" Each and every writer was very elegant and well spoken, but I simply wish there was more dialog between the two people, not simply between book editors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten cd's for one incredible price.","review":"Not only do you receive an entire collection of ten cds for a phenomenal value, but you get the best classical music ever composed.

It expertly examines the struggle between this father and son with real humor and raw emotion. Haskell Wexler is outrageously talented, famously outspoken, and unapologetically brash. The genius of this film is that it refuses to rely on the Mommy Dearest model but delves into the truths that lie between the lines. As we watch Mark discover the rare tenderness and surprising vulnerability in his father, we can't help but re-examine our own assumptions and relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD GENRE MIX","review":"When they mixed the supernatural with a crime movie, you sometimes get great results such as \\"Crow\\" which added the right about of sex, nudity, violence, music, and weird. Sometimes you don't get good results such as this movie. Simon Rex plays Taz, a wannbe-drug king. His dad, or step-dad, is played by the tough guy Ving Rhames, who starts out the movie as dead, comes to life in a flashback, then really comes back to life as a demon. Taz, in order to save his family from being murdered, makes a deal with the devil, (who would BTW already would have his soul) to become the new drug king of Miami. Ving as the demon goes around to eliminate the competition, although as it turns out Taz doesn't have the stomach for the job. Blood, killing, brief sex scenes, brief nudity and not enough of anything worth while. Not a good supernatural film, not a good crime film. The movie has us identify with a drug king who is both a bad guy and a coward. It just doesn't work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vin has range","review":"I at first thought that oh another kill or be killed drug dealer film well I was half right this movie is about battles amoungst dealers but with a twist. Vin Rhames plays the dead father of the lead character who comes back from the dead at Satans request as a demon,and brings death and destruction to those who are in the game to gain leadership of the trade. The film is okay a little above adverage what makes this movie a four star is Vin Rhames performance as the demon at times he comes off as eerie well acted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"This movie was very \\"corny,\\" low budget. I am very surprised that Ving Rhames was even in it. My husband order it to watch just out of curiousity.

Thompson's description of the flight portions of Apollo 14 is derived almost exclusively from Barbree and Benedict's unreliable \\"Moonshot\\" and, consequently, bears only a passing resemblance to reality. The critical events related to the abort switch and landing radar simply did not happen as described. In my work on the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, I have always found it useful to check astronaut memories against other sources. I can only wish that Thompson had exercised such care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marred by Errors","review":"This seems to be a decent enough biography that gives some insight into Shepard the man, his background and drives. However, I must caution that it contains many errors of fact that seem to be related to the author's apparent ignorance of the military, aviation and space. These errors range from niggling (referring to flying boats as \\"seaplanes) to significant (stating that modern aircraft are controlled by a \\"steering wheel\\" rather that a stick and rudder pedals, when in fact a stick is still the preferred control for high-performance aircraft). The shame is that these errors could easily have been, and should have been, caught by proper review and editing - so the publisher has to take some of the blame."},{"rating":"1","title":"For hardcore Keyes fans only","review":"Under the Duvet is a collection of essays by Keyes, most of which were previously published in Irish or British newpapers. It does give you a deeper look into the author's life, with chapters about moving back to Ireland, her past drinking problems (the inspiration for Watermelon), what a publicity tour is like, etc. There are also loads of columns about somewhat random things- shoes, soccer, mother's day, religon, and Irishness. Everything is well-written and most are funny, but I think they're more suited to newspaper features than a whole book.Note: I have the Brit edition, so the American edition may be slightly different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marian Keyes, brilliant","review":"This book is one I had been chasing for a long while but it was always elusive.

They're all live broadcasts, so I'm guessing they are probably all from his shows at the Ryman Auditorium. Nothing new here; all songs previously recorded, but it's fun hearing an excited audience, and it sounds as if Jim was enjoying it too. It sounds to me as if these broadcasts dated before he really started to modulate his voice in a lower key. At any rate, this is a pretty nice collection. It's mono, but fidelity is quite good.

I'll update after we've put it through its paces a little more.eta: 2012 (five years later)... I still own two of these cutting boards, the others have since met their maker.

Now, let me assure you that I was not overly rough with the boards. I always made sure that the backing was side down on the counter, I don't even own a dishwasher, I wash them with Seventh Generation all natural soap, which is extremely mild, and I followed all their directions. There's supposedly a guarantee, but I couldn't find a way to get in touch with the company, so it did me no good. So alas, it's back to old fashioned cutting boards for me!

I placed a hot pan on one and it melted onto the bottom of the pan which took a great deal of effort to clean the melted plastic off so the pan could be used again. I prefer a thick cutting board so I bought these thinking that they were heat resistant so I wouldn't purchase them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine fell apart with little use","review":"I've seen good silicone sheets for cutting surfaces before, but these particular ones were brittle and fell apart from just a little usage (they cracked at the edges and tore).

After that, they bent and would no longer lay flat, and the nonskid bottom was worthless. It's a good thing they were cheap because they were, well, cheap. I would recommend getting instead getting a good, solid cutting board and putting either a wet dishtowel under it or some of that nonskid shelf liner underneath. I also recently bought a real-size cutting board with nonskid \\"feet\\" on it that works great.Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get a quality item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on Herculaneum","review":"Very few people know of the other Napolitan city that was destroy in 69AD by the eruption of Vesuvius and because of this there are few good books that have been written on Herculaneum. Deiss' book on Herculaneum is probably the cream of the crop and an essential one to any scholar or amateur classicist/archaeologist who is interested in the other little seaside city. Deiss provides a good overview of the difference between the destruction of Herculaneum and the destruction of Pompeii which had a great effect on the excavation of the cities. He also chronicles the discovery of Herculaneum which occurred before Pompeii and the birth of modern archaeology through that discovery.Deiss also gives a good overview of the town and what is know about it, the objects that were found there and how different buildings were used.Essential to anyone interested in Pompeii, Herculaneum or ancient Roman culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Because this book was paired with the book Pompeii, I was expecting a book full of great images. It was not! It is virtually the same book published by Harper & Row in 1966. All the pictures are black and white and about the same quality as Amedeo Maiuri's who can be forgiven as his guide to Herculaneum was published in 1962. Having read Maiuri's book, I found Deiss's descriptions very similar. A very disappointing purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"Besides the usual detail related to the uncovering, this author does an excellent job of tieing the structures to the actual life of the citizens of Herculaneum prior to the envelopement.

All of them are truly 5-stars but I feel that The Wrong Trousers is the ABSOLUTE best. The Wrong Trousers is the second episode in the trilogy of Wallace and Gromit films. The story centers around a clever inventor; Wallace and his genius-dog; Gromit. This, the second time around, our dynamic duo are experiencing financial troubles. When Wallace decides to let out a room to a sly penguin the story really gets going and does not wind-down to the very end with the grand finale. The Wrong Trousers is very clever and cute and the animation is simply amazing. This is a very delightful and enjoyable film that is great for the whole family. Kids and parents both will love it! A Grand Day Out, The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave are all highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you want to succeed in business and have fun?","review":"This book has two themes that resonated strongly with me; 1) find your passion, and 2) get started.

Unfortunately, the kindle edition appears to be a scan of the original text, which makes it very difficult to read. The kindle edition looked like a rush job. The ink is highly inconsistent and the typeface cannot be changed. Only the size can be changed, which does not make it any easier to read. After reading the first few pages I found it too much of a pain and decided to go through the whole text rapidly.

The section on Saturn in synastry alone is worthy of the price you'd pay for this book. I have read relevant sections of this to a friend and this person's relationship was transformed almost overnight, and she thanked me for the clarity that she gained from the information. Saturn is not so intimidating after reading this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting a New Coat of Paint on the Great Malefic","review":"Liz Greene has done a wonderful job of dealing with the Great Malefic of ancient times, Saturn. Her book is one of the first to challenge the older ways of reading planets in natal interpretation. Greene's background as a Jungian analyst AND an astrologer gives her books depth, insight and credibility. You will learn, for example, that Saturn contacts in synastry guaranty a successful marriage because Saturn is required to provide the long term staying power!This book is a must in your astrological library. It can be well understand by an intermediate astrology student and it is an excellent building block for later interpretation skills, Saturn being the important planet it is, the timer, the teacher, and so forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saturn Himself would enjoy the book","review":"Liz Greene explodes the caricature of Saturn as the gloomy cynical taskmaster who only joy is making people miserable.

Very strong arrangements and powerful lead vocals by Jenny Hann push this set right along.Standout songs include \\"The Mexican\\", with its Latin-tinged hard rock riffing and cleverly incorporated Morricone \\"quote\\" during the break. The compelling \\"Joker\\" benefits from a dynamic \\"trade-off\\" lead vocal duet. The band also displays formidable musicianship with an excellent cover of Frank Zappa's complex instrumental \\"King Kong\\" (very few groups have covered Zappa material, and there's a reason-it requires some serious chops!)A successful balance of melody, hard-driving rock and jazz-like complexity that doesn't quite sound like anyone else in the genre.

All of the bands I can think to compare them to are from that time period, yet Killing Process doesn't sound like they came from then. Bands like The Birthday Party, Virgin Prunes, Christian Death, The Damned, and 45 Grave are obvious influences, yet there is definitely a modern twist. They take loud driving rythms, with powerful drums and lots of low end, add aggresive distorted guitar, then finally throw in schizophrenic vocals to get this unique sound. The songs are very dark and ominous with themes of horror and betrayel. It's like watching an old scary movie from before the days of gore. When you know you're terrified, yet they haven't even shown the monster yet and you don't want to see it. Highly recomended.

Sure enough water was coming out of the electric cord area of the maker. Not a great place for water to be flowing from. There is a 1 inch hairline crack on the bottom inside of the maker. Though it's a Canada company the maker is made in the current land of cheap plastic junk China. 1 year warranty. Made app. 20- 25 batches so it turned out to be a total waste of money.

We use skim milk, so to make the yogurt thick we add 1/2 cup powdered milk for every quart. The yogurt starter was great, but if we don't have any on hand we just use 1/2 cup yogurt with live cultures for every quart we make. The directions suggest to let the mix sit in the maker for 4-10 hours, and we found our perfect time to be 5.5 hours. If we let it sit for longer it gets more sour, and if we let it sit for less it is less firm. 5.5 hours gives us a wonderfully creamy yogurt!Thanks Mom, Amazon and Yogormet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy","review":"of praise, works efficiently and is very easy to use.

I won't be using it again.You have no automatic control of temperature or cooking time and there is no on/off switch. There's no built in temperature sensor. Without that, it's impossible to keep the milk and starter at the right incubating temperature. You'd do as well, or maybe even better, leaving the unit at room temperature and not plugging it in. Or using the low setting on a crock pot. At least you wouldn't ruin the yogurt because the crock overheated.It's not well insulated. You have to be very carefully about handling or touching the unit for fear of getting burned. It can and does overheat in warm weather or in a warm room. The manufacturer recommends using it in a cool room to avoid overheating. This is a potential fire hazard in my opinion.

I did not exceed the water level for the 2 quart processing, but water was overflowing or condensing during processing and leaking into the unit at the top lip where the lid rested.

And it's a natural fit with thedelightful songs of Van Heusen, who's perhaps somewhat overlooked these days. A very nice mix of some familiar and some very obscure (but worthwhile). Becky's voice is great on this material, if I find their last one 'Jump 1224' just a little bit more consistently really excellent. But that's quibbling. Wonderful treatments of such great songs as \\"I Thought About You,\\" \\"Deep in a Dream,\\" \\"Here's that Rainy Day' (to which RK brings a charming side not always heard in torchier treatments IMO) & others. One of three great albums by RK this year (along with \\"Easy As It Gets\\" w. John Sheridan Dream Band, & vol. 2 of her Maxine Sullivan tributes, \\"Make Someone Happy' w. the Bobby Gordon Trio). All very worthwhile. Yes, it sounds kinda like the '40's with better sound, but that's really the point. Timeless songs IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This shaker is a piece of garbage. For starters, the shipper sends it to you in the retail box with no padding. If that doesn't ensure that the shaker will be bent when it gets to you, you'll wish that it was, because the shaker is worthless. The 'stainless' steel is rusting after only 2 months, and the shaker top is infuriatingly impossible to remove, because it sits inside the 24 oz. resevoir.

The musical line-up is not what you normally see in a band what with the tubas, dumbeks, cello, and French horn - and they all get their chance to solo. Also features Chris Speed, Cuong Vu, Andy Laster, Matt Darriau, Andrew D'Angelo - some of the best brass or woodwind players working. Overall, the arrangements have a European bent; for a contrast Julius Hemphill's big band used a similar orchestration and the results had just as much elegance but a little more swagger. \\"Hold the Elevator\\" also contains the shortest recorded version of Tim Berne's \\"Bloodcount\\", clocking in at a mere 14:30.Recommeded to fans of Tim Berne, Chris Speed, Dave Douglas, etc..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent finish and Overall Look/Feel","review":"Bought these to finish off a 55 Chev in the shop. I was very happy with how easy it sprayed and how well it looked. A very nice gray with subtle white specks. This paint doesn't cover the greatest and I would recommend putting down a gray primer (or maybe even just plain gray rattle can) before this stuff. It will take double the coats if you don't. Took 2 cans to do the underside of the trunk lid without priming it gray first (the color was a medium blue), and it took 2 cans to do the whole inside of the trunk area, after priming it gray first. Warning! This stuff does dry very fast at all! This stuff almost sprays like tinted drywall texture. Allow plenty of time between coats.

You can't judge a book by its cover apparently. A new vampire has gone missing and a serial killer is operating in Seattle. There seems to be a connection, so Char, a new Enforcer is sent to solve the problem. She is also assigned to kill a vampire hunter by the head Enforcer Istvan. Jebel Haven and his partner were hired by the baby vamp's mother to find him also, so they are also in Seattle. Char finds that she needs his help to kill the demon and sorcerer who hold the vampire, and who are behind the murders. She is not sure that she will be able to kill him when the job is done, and he can't seem to hate her like he hates all the other vampires.This was a pretty entertaining book. The Enforcer concept is interesting and the novel was full of suspense. Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect smoothie maker!","review":"I'm very please with this little blender.

Don't bother.","review":"My old blender wasn't doing the job anymore, so I thought that I would try this. It is very poor at chopping up ice, so you have to stop it several times in order to get the ice unstuck. When you finally have your smoothie made, you have to wait a few minutes to let it thaw, so that it will run through the spout. We had to use a ladle in order to get the smoothie out, since the top does not have a place to pour from. Then, it started to leak from the spout. I think that I will go back to the old blender."},{"rating":"2","title":"A note about the Kindle edition","review":"This book contains more than enough positive reviews from more eloquent writers than me. Therefore, my brief contribution/warning is regarding the Kindle Edition of this book. I'll try to keep it as spoiler-free as I can.In the forward to the 25th anniversary edition, Pirsig writes that he used sans-serif type to indicate when Phaedrus speaks. He believes that doing so changes the ending significantly. This font distinction is missing from the Kindle edition.I haven't seen the paper edition, so if owners of that could clarify when Phaedrus speaks, that would help tremendously.Otherwise, a great read. My real rating would be 4.5 stars, if half stars existed. The deducted half star is only for the formatting issue detailed above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"OK, maybe I'm being a little too harsh. I actually enjoyed the idea of the cross-country motorcycle ride, the details about motorcycle mechanics, and especially the portrayal of the narrator's relationship with his son. The son was the best part of the whole book. Unfortunately, there wasn't much space for sonny, because dad was too busy advertising the author's brilliant philisophical insights. Even more unfortunately, the insights weren't brilliant, and consumed hundreds of tedious pages. It occured to me to wonder whether the author was trying to make the point that the narrator was a pompous idiot; however, the intent seemed to be for the reader to be blown away by the brilliance of the narrator's philosophical insights, and hence by the brilliance of the author who conceived of the narrator and the philosophical insights. I can't believe I made it through 380 pages of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zen and what?","review":"Nice book,easy to read. Has life lessons and stories.It tends to drag in places though.But overall I would recomend it.

At first they are accompanied by another couple, but, a bit later, father and son are left to continue their journey alone. Throughout the trip, the author is deep in thought which is reflected in the paucity of communication with his son and more communication with himself alone.A reader involved with this book must either have great fortitude or a fervent interest in philosophy to make it to the end of the story. Despite its haunting quality, its philosophic meanderings are often overwhelming for the casual reader. Best reserved for a reader who likes to \\"work\\" at reading, ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE, is a sad but profound story of philosophic theory, mental illness, and a father-son relationship which will leave a deep impression on those willing it struggle through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking - holism, reductionism, etc.","review":"I don't think I have anything new to say that hasn't been said before (positive or negative). I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, four stars out of five for me. If you haven't already read it, I suggest you read Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter next. Hofstadter picks up where Pirsig left off and delves further into holism, reductionism, dualism, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, a real introspective into life.","review":"I thought tha Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was a terrific book that really causes the reader to take a look at their own value system. It takes you into the past and present lif of a man in search of himself and reality. The only thing that kept it from recieving the full five stars was the fact that it tended to get a little slow at times and the writing seemed a little amatuerish. Other than that it was a gem. For me it allowed for a look into who I am compared to who I used to be and who I want to become. I would be very interested in reading more or Robert Pirsig's work. I would also recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a provacative, emotional book.

Booo! Low blow. I enjoy reading philosophy, but this book was awful. The author is just plain illogical. He draws ridiculous conclusions. If you are going on a journey of the mind, you should not have a guide who is incapable of thinking straight. If you love this book, then you will be very comfortable with illogical statements and I recommend you read a book on logical thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidity and Beyond","review":"When I take an account of the things that were a complete waste of my time in this lifetime, this book will be in the top ten. What a bunch of self-absorbed gibberish. In the beginning, when there were some real references to motorcycle parts, I was actually interested, thought there might be some nice analogy and life lessons to be examined. Nope. Turned into one long megalomania rant. I loathed this guy by the end of the book and wished I could have reported him to CPS for his lack of parental skills. Hiking up a steep grade and NO WATER? What a moron. Maybe the incredibly poor nutrition may have been 90% of this guy's problems.Presently, I live in a university town and the author reminds me of oh so many of the instructors who THINK they really have something to say...and everyone else KNOWS they don't.

This is truly a book that will force you to think. One must figure out what Pirsig is trying to say through pages upon pages of rambling about the meaning of things such as quality. This is a book to STAY AWAY from if you are looking for a good read.The book starts as a seemingly interesting story about a boy and his father on a motorcycle trip; however, as the book goes on, more and more of Phaedrus, Pirsig's other personality, comes back. The further one reads, the more complex and impossible to understand it becomes. At points, I was just praying for Pirsig to go back to talking about the motorcycle trip, yet as the end neared, I became very interested in what was going to happen, and I must say, I was not let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"actually, Water is not perfect\\"","review":"this book tries so blatantly to be metaphorical that it really ends up being quite shallow.

I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of books I've started but not finished. It's just not something I do. However, I quit on this book about half-way through. Some of the reasons were the author's fault; no doubt some were mine. I don't know that I was fully prepared for what this book ultimately is... a deep, drenching immersion into philosophy, metaphysics, quality of life, and personal self-worth. Writing about those things is a fine and admirable endeavor, but for me reading Pirsig's tortuous and complex prose just didn't work a majority of the time. He would sporadically grab me with a particular line of thought, only to veer off and lose me (interest-wise) for pages on end. I was far more attentive to the cross-country motorcycle trip than I was to his meandering \\"Chautauqua\\". In the end what made me put this book down was that I just wasn't interested enough in the subject matter. So, before you begin this book be sure of what you've undertaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"In maintaining an active interest in philosophy I was quite eager to tackle this somewhat enigmatic work. This title is one of thos that you oft hear mentioned and rarely discussed. What I encoutnered was a pseudo-biographical work that presents it's ideas and concepts slowly, poorly and seemingly as condescendingly as possible. I would only advise those well versed in classical greek philosophy to even consider this text. The areas of the text pertaining to Zen Buddhism are very welcome and far to short ... even if the points made are rudimentary and well known today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Boomer Indulgence","review":"I thought this book would be interesting and thoughtful but instead it seems to be more of the usual meism that permeated the Boomer generation and has so negatively affected my own generation. No wonder we're all screwed up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A touchstone for irrationalism","review":"I noticed long ago that people who tend toward irrationalism usually cite Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance as their favorite book or \\"Bible.\\"Pirsig seems to have insight-fully taken note of some unsatisfactory outcomes of philosophy, but instead of identifying the problem and fixing it, he embraces the very sloppy reasoning that precipitated the errors he bemoans.Two stars because it is slightly more interesting than Heidegger, but isn't anywhere near to being in the same league as Wittgenstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zen","review":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a very difficult, but helpful book. Although it may not be the most exciting or entertaining story, the concepts discussed by Pirsig in this book are very helpful in learning many of life's important lessons. The way Pirsig approaches his ideas is also somewhat peculiar and confusing, yet he will always find a way to tie up any mixed up thoughts. He has an interesting outlook on how the concepts he explains pertain to almost every aspect of a person's life, and he uses them when performing maintenance on his motorcycle. On Robert and Chris Pirsig's journey across the country, they face their fair share of difficulties between each other that they must overcome. At the end of the book, Chris begins to see a split personality in Robert who is deeply taken by the teachings of Phadreus, an ancient philosopher. The conquering of this and many other troubles also teaches readers important lessons about people's relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave enough not to like this classic","review":"Two stars! One for Pirsig putting pen to paper (all 514 dull pieces of them) and one for the apposite title. If Zen is patience, then I came damn close. What strength it took to not banish this book to my \`begun but not finished' bookshelf. A dull pontification on the definition of \`quality' (which is ironically lacking in the novel), and an unlikeable narrator who exemplifies the \`genius is madness' slogan. His philosophical ramblings are not profound, just disturbed. And hellishly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated book i can think of","review":"why this book became so popular i cant say. probably just because it has a great title. i hated it, but found myself giving it a second chance over and over again, because on paper im the exact target audience... until i actually couldnt take it anymore and left it 75% read. repetetive, prideful and not particularly deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I've read many books but this one I didn't get. I've heard so many times that this book is a classic, yet when I read it--I just asked myself why? I must be missing something. It took me two weeks to complete the book and I couldn't wait to put it down. I can never put down a book once I begin it--even a bad book--so I was forced to read the whole thing. And when I finished I was so relived--no more burdens; no more pain. I was finnally done.There was so much detail of scenery; So many pages with words without substance.

I made through 60 pages and realized it was just not the book for me. I found it long winded and I kept asking myself why I felt the need to go on.I finally had to good sense to stop.

Also, Persig, in his so-called quest, refuses to acknowledge such modern philosophers as Nietzche, Kierkegaard, Sartre, Camus, or even Rand. He also doesn't attempt to create a synthesis between eastern and western philosophy, as the title would suggest. Herman Hesse, for example, does manage an intriguing blend of eastern mysticism with western philosophy -- he is greatly influence by Nietzsche. Persig's prose is often flat, but his protagonists are very driven in their quest for metaphysical quality. But as characters, they don't -- for me, seem very interesting. If the reader is interested in the philosophical novel, may I suggest reading Sartre, Camus, Hesse, Rand, Mann, Dostoievsky, or Tolstoi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was required to read this book for an ethics class in college.

It is many books in one: A gripping tale, an autobiography, a philosophical treatise. It's one of those books that every time you read it, you glean new and wonderful information.

After I completed the book I checked Amazon.com and browsed through some of the recent reviews. Many of the reviews were favorable. Some even hinted that the book was life changing. Personally I felt the book was extremely boring and at times I even found myself thinking, what the.... Well you know the rest. It wasn't until about three-quarters of the way through the book that I found anything interesting or meaningful in the story. For those of you who found meaning in Mr. Pirsig's book I appauld you. If not may I suggest another book with a simmiliar title called Zen and the Art of Archery by Eugen Herrigel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it if you put in the effort","review":"I'm only 14 years old, yet I still made it through the whole book, not that I would recomend it to other 14 year olds. I actually thought the book was kind of slow and boring at times, but I had faith in Pirsig (I had previously read \\"Lila\\" which I liked even better) and at the end, I was glad I'd read it. The whole quality thing boggles the mind and leaves your mind full of questions, which is what I like out of a book, as long as they are not questions on what the book was trying to say. If you're thinking about reading this, I would recomend reading it slowly and with lots of patience, because it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - read and reflect on our culture and society!!!","review":"I constantly find myself picking up this book at least once a year. The book forces you to pay attention and to think; to reflect on the direction of our society and our culture, and to question if it is a good direction. Pirsig does an excellent job in not preaching, but telling a wonderful story, and uses the story as a tool to introduce and expand upon his philosophy and the zen philosophy. The book challenges us all to reflect and to work at understanding our lives and our culture in a time where everything is forcefed to us through television and 15 second sensationalized news stories. Read Pirsig and awaken your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"zen and the art of motorcycle maintence","review":"The gumption traps caught me. An honest book. A true book.

There are moments when the book is more of a narrative, but by and large, it's a philosophy book in the guise of fiction. It's much higher quality than something like The Celestine Prophecy, but not exactly unlike it in the way it wants you to see the world in a different way.I got 2/3 through it and that's all. Most people who read this book seem to love it, so my reaction seems to be atypical.

Like Atlas Shrugged, this book could have been about half the length and made its point."},{"rating":"1","title":"greek philosophy and motor maintenance","review":"There is little, to no Zen in this book. It is the story of a man, who at one time was in a mental hospital, traveling across country with his son on a motorcycle remembering the time that led to his break down. He was, before the break down, a anti-social misfit that passes time questioning everything not for answers but to prove everyone wrong. Then more that half way through the book he decides to ask what is quality? Not a soul stretching question, once he becomes fixed on finding the answer he destroys any quality his family once had. This is not an important book. It is only the story of a selfish man that puts himself above all else in his life. I can see where most of the baby boomers, that believed the \\"Do for you\\" \\"Put your needs first\\" type of psycho babble, probably thought this book was important. The book discusses more greek philososphy than Zen Budism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - another would-be guru explains it all for you","review":"This book is dull and screamingly pretentious. He promotes himself as having profound insights that qualify him to tell other people what's wrong with their lives and how they should change.

When I saw the Kindle ebook, I bought it on a whim and gave it a second read. Pretty incredible how different my impression was this time around. I understood more about the philosophers that Mr. Pirsig writes about, and the story line came to me more through the father's eyes than the son's. It was very enjoyable to read the sixites' slang terms like \\"square\\" and \\"groovy\\" and relate back to those crazy years. I have the sequel, Lila, in hardcover, and now that I've gotten this refresher, I will begin that book.PS the new foreword by Mr. Pirsig is very helpful in getting back into the story.

And it keeps going, and you can't freeze it. The mind, beholding Quality, or Tao, is all there is. After 4 reads and 15 years, I finally got it. It's super-simple, yet the hardest thing to accept. But once you do, watch life's Gordians knots fall apart.Thank you Mr. Pirsig, for your intellectual pit-bulledness in the face of Plato's inversion.The book's highly rich parallel structure is poetically satisfying.Why did the author collapse? He paralyzed under two fundamental reversals at once: philosophical conversion to Quality from Truth, and, moral conversion from power to \\"mu\\"?My opinion is that if he had been in the right hands at the time, he would have pulled out ok, ie, without the shocks.P.S.: It's Monism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that it's cracked up to be","review":"My philosophy course at university was exciting and dynamic and opened my eyes and mind to all manner of different ways of thinking about the world. Imagine my disappointment, therefore, when I finally got round to reading 'Zen and...' to find a subject I had loved as a student presented in such a messy and disjointed way. I'm sure Mr Pirsig means well, and there are a number of passages in his book (well, 2 or 3) which caught my attention, but when I'd finished I was left wondering what all the fuss was about. Essentially, having put the book back on the shelf, I can readily understand why 121 publishers turned it down. (What I find harder to understand is why no.122 accepted it!) Probably I should give the book another chance, but, to be honest, I feel I have better things to do with my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant, boring, odd","review":"I knew nothing about the author or the book when I first bought it, it just looked good. I got about half-way through and wondered why I wasted my time reading this. Some might think the author is really clever because he seems to talk about really complex stuff and attempts to dumb it down for everyone else. However, he covers too much material and it's all wrapped up in a quasi-fictional story that frankly is quite boring. If you're looking for a bonding experience about a man and his son, while they address philosophical concepts and everything, I'm sure there's other fiction authors who do a much better job and are known for their great works. Go to any used book stores and you'll see heaps of these books collecting dust; I say just chuck it in the trash where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"An over-rated and disappointing work","review":"When I studied philosophy at university, it was exciting and dynamic, and opened my eyes and mind in ways I'd never thought possible. Imagine my disappointment, therefore, when I read this highly-acclaimed work. Having heard so much about it, I wanted to like it, I really did, but, oh dear. All I can say is I'm glad Mr Pirsig wasn't one of my university tutors, for, barring a couple of passages, he succeeds only in turning a wonderful area of human experience into a cure for insomnia. I'll come back to 'Zen...' again some time in the future and hope for better things, but, for the time being, I have to consign it to my 'Most Disappointing Books' pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read.

Please do not buy this book -- if you feel tempted, get it from the library first to see if you like it. This book is famous for one reason and one reason only, in my humble opinion,.... it has a very unusual, catchy, interesting name. That's it. That's all it has. It is not really about Zen, or motorcycle maintenance (although both feature fleetingly). The new sub-title \\"an inquiry into values\\" is laughable marketing too. It is mainly the self-indulgent ramblings of a very dull, self absorbed person - probably on the edge of a nervous breakdown. The only thing I took away from this book was that I felt rather concerned for the author's son (on the assumption that this book is partially or fully auto-biographical). ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life","review":"This book helps one to deal with the conflicts one faces in the day to day pursuit of truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mental Games","review":"The author constantly defends his head games by trying to explain why people dislike head games, but this does not make the head games any more palatable. What a book. The other one star reviews have said it all: boring, dry, heady, rambling, burdensome, sluggish, heavy. And if that weren't enough, it's got mid-life-crisis written all over it.The one thing that really gets me is the author's note at the beginning:\\"What follows is based on actual occurrences. Although much has been changed for rhetorical purposes, it must be regarded in its essence as fact...\\"Are you kidding?Personally I say you're much better off - philosophically, spiritually, logically, rationally, romantically and in terms of quality - reading the Gita, or a Michael Chrichton thriller.Two thumbs the heck down for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much. What would it focus more on: Zen or motorcycles? I'm interested in both topics, yet this book came nowhere near to satisfying me on either of them.Zen and the art of Motorcycle Maintenance was a huge disappointment for me. I totally concur with the sentiments in the review by the guy from Seattle.I finished this book feeling depressed and disheartened, and all the way through it I wondered why there was hardly any love shown to the author's son.If you want to find out about Zen, buy a copy of Zen made Easy by Timothy Freke. If you're new to bikes, buy magazines or visit your local two-wheeler store and get advice from the experts.I could have gone for a hike, played a round of golf, painted the house or, better still, gone for a ride on a motorcycle - pastimes far more worthy of my time than reading this depressing, prolix book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is Too Short","review":"I remembered liking this book when I was 20. I bought it recently at a library sale and was excited to re-read it after more than 2 decades of (cough, cough) wisdom. Usually when I have read books that made an impression on me in my earlier years (I'm thinking \\"The Good Earth\\", \\"Atlas Shrugged\\"), I still enjoy it, although maybe in a different way. A classic is a classic no matter where you are in life or how it speaks to you. This book, however, just left me thinking \\"What WAS I thinking?\\" I can not fathom how it spoke to me or why I liked it. The underlying plot was just a thinly disguised means of rambling about the author's self-important ideas. It didn't take me long to get bored with both the plot and the philosophy. My personal philosophy of quality led me to abandon this book before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy thinker","review":"What a mess. Juvenile egomania with its occasional fervid appeal but overall Ayn Rand-ian laughability. The good points--most notably that the scientific method actually expands hypotheses rather than eliminates them (or creates them at a faster rate than it resolves them)--are buried amid macho-rebel gunk notable for a peculiar degree of lack of insight and self-awareness. Quasi-autobiographical road trip format is pure padding. Again, there are several strong points in here (though only a few are original) and I tend to agree with some of its anti-academic viewpoints, but ultimately this says more about maniacal egotism than anything else.

'Quality' is the term that Robert Pirsig uses to explain the unexplainable. If the previous sentence sounds too philosophical then skip this book. 'Zen and the Art' is a brilliant explanation not only about the source of happiness, but also about the source of the thought where happiness was formed.It gives me encouragement to realise that sitting in a classroom with teachers whose purpose is to indoctrinate not to teach and learn together may not be the ideal growth experience.I completed my reading of the book last night and many of the ideas, morals and guidance are yet to sink in.ZATAOMM is a classic and beautiful narration for the philosophically minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard for me to get through, but well worth it","review":"I heard of this book 14 or 15 years ago and finally got around to reading it earlier this year. I found it a little too challenging and then shelved it until a couple of weeks ago. This is a deep, deep book, and it took a lot of effort to understand what the author was trying to say. I blame this more on me than the author, and would just like to tell the casual reader to stick with it. I found that towards the end everything came together really well and finally made a lot of sense. I wanted to start over now that I know where it's going, and apparently (judging by the end notes in the book) a lot of other readers feel the same way.So I'd say stick with it, and you'll find it's really a great, great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS.

I found it to be one of the most self-absorbed, self-pitying, whining complaints I had ever been exposed to - and I know about those, because I'm a former junior high school teacher.Not only did it not contain any philosophical insights whatsoever, the book is just plain boring and badly written. The only book I have ever thrown in the garbage can - it's just rubbish, and that's where it belongs. I'm sure the author is a fine human being. I just think he wrote a very, very, bad book.

After all these years, and so many people telling me I had to read this, I finally picked it up at a used bargain book store, and I want my dollar back. The author's ramblings on motorcycle maintenance are sleep inducing, unless I suppose you enjoy motorcycles, and all this massive book is, at least from the first 88 pages I have suffered through, is a boring road trip, void of any sign of plot, used as an excuse to paste on philosophical rants, which make me think a root canal is not such a bad thing after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"ADD and the art of motorcycle maintenance","review":"Ugh. This book can't decide what it wants to be. Every time you get interested in a topic (and this book does contain some interesting topics from the travel narrative to some of the ideas expressed) it switches over to another topic before resolving anything. This is incredibly frustrating from the point of view of entertainment. Does this book want to be a novel and flow like one, or a middle-brow discussion of contemporary worldviews, or a amateur philosophy thesis?

If you answered \\"yes,\\" then this book is for you. Because you're not, and maybe it will help you. If you said anything other than \\"yes,\\" avoid this book. The reader's guide to this book says that it has something for everybody. This is true. But something for everybody stinks when you think about it as an individual. Who cares what's there for others? What matters is what is there for one individual, and it isn't much. Less than one would get from a ten minute conversation with an intelligent person. For me, there was a section ranting about universities which I quite enjoyed. But that was about ten pages. Wasting hours of time on hundreds of useless pages is absurd. Reading the Tao, a motorcycle handbook, and a seriously flawed psychology textbook will provide far more insight and knowledge in far less time than this book possibly can."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a joke...","review":"This is a layman's, cop-out guide to philosophy... what a joke.

After wrestling with this part of the book, I decided to focus on the trip, not the lecture.

And there is very little Zen!! It is hard to feel for the central character - he seems so interesting until he starts becoming so invovled in mind numbing minutiae. But there are some great sections on the riding and the 'art' that can be found in 'non-art' activities like motorcycle maintenance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad","review":"The only reason to read this book would be to learn a lesson about avoiding anything that has been hyped too much. This book is not only boring and badly written, it is astonishingly hypocritical: the tone is smug, self-satsified, preaching, everything that Zen philosophy is opposed to! The narrator's painfully inept treatment of his intelligent, sensitive son is all too typical: he doesn't listen, and tries repeatedly to impose his own vision of the world and of what his son should be like on the poor boy. What is Quality, the narrator asks? Well, maybe treating your child as a human being with emotional needs has something to do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about long-winded..........","review":"Man was this a waste of time.

Personally, I find that any book worth reading will change my life.

Now, if you need dead bodies, alien invasions, or journeys to retrieve the holy grail then you will not enjoy this book.Prisig's story is interesting and his quirky personal insights and observations are what keep the book moving. Much of the material about the motorcycle trip I found quite boring and unrelated to his internal journey.Prisig's genuine interest in philosophy is evident in his content and is readily digested because of his economical use of language.

It is well written trash, but nevertheless the prose is magnificent. Yet my years of studying zen reveal no such correlation between this individual who has learned to not try is the best way to not succeed (ref. the story of climbing the mountain with his son). Unfortunately, he is trying to pass this message on to others. If the story was written with less talent one could see the flaws inherent in this philosophy. It is as if one desired Marilyn Monroe's lifestyle because she brought such penache to the screen. In the end the only real loser is one who quits, and that seems to be lost on Pirsig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirsig's life-changing literary masterpiece 'ZMM'","review":"This book has the power to change lives...whether you believe Pirsig's philsophy or not. 'Zen & the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' is one of the most true books ever written. It is slopping over with brutally honest insight into the human frailties of mind and spirit. By the time you close the cover, you will have learned a little about Western philosophy, Eastern mysticism and yourself. An extraordinary effort"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic of softcore philosophy.","review":"While \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" has been criticized as mushy philosophy, it is still a great read, and it justly deserves its ongoing cult following. In the 21st century, we've grown accustomed to trash goods and services: corrupt corporations and politicians; shoddy consumer goods; diminishing or disappearing service. \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" still provides at least a psychological antidote -- viz, a benchmark for quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgruntled Philosophy Student","review":"As required reading for our philosophy class our teacher assigned us Zen... However, he failed to tell us how boring and unelightening the book actually was. Pirsig is not really a philosopher, but more of a rambler who just goes on and on about quality...whatever he means by that. The chautaquas were dry and the narratives only slightly better. I don't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"I don't really care for chatty writers, and Pirsig likes to palaver on like it's nobody's business. Just get to the point and back it up with facts. The first time I read Zen was when I was teaching college at the time it was published. There was a lot of buzz going around about the book. Some profs were assigning Zen to their students, while almost everyone was praising it as the book of the century. So I had to read it. It didn't live up to the hype. There's nothing really deep or novel here unless you're a fan of syncretism, in this case the meshing of Eastern thought with Western thought. It's my view that both are mutually exclusive, and that any attempt to combine them dilutes both of them. But I'm biased. I'll take the Greeks, Augustine, Aquinas and the rest of the Western tradition any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, great, great","review":"This tape set was in pristine condtion and has provided me with many enjoyable car rides since. The product was specifically what I requested and was sent to me within 6 days of ordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer Nonsense Disguised as Depth","review":"This book is NOT deep, and it appears only shallow persons think it is.The earlier reviewer is correct: He clearly states he received electroshock treatments against his will, and this tome appears to be his attempt to prove he wasn't mentally ill.He was, and the book makes no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk from start to halfway through","review":"This book is utter junk it is not even written properly the grammar is appalling and a simple sentence is made into a major trial to read. No wonder so many publishers rejected this book it is so poorly written. It is only utter junk half way through because no matter how I tried I could not read more than half the book.Even the story is all over the show,that is when I have deciphered WHAT the author is trying to write down.The standard of English display is that of an 8yr old. Not worth a penny.Fit for the rubbish bin only.Total and utter crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"zen and the art of crap","review":"I have thirty pages to go, and I then I'm going shoot myself in the mouth. All i could do the whole time was hope he crashed and took his irrevolcably traumatized son with him. Watch for all the typos and spelling mistakes in this paperback, just to give you a break from all the bad logic and contradictions on every other page. Don't read this book, pick up something by Vonnegut, anything, and pray with me for horrible things to happen to this terrible hack of a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was blown away by the depth of this novel","review":"I'am 18 and was required to read this for a high school english course. The teacher forced us to read the entire book in one week. All I got from it was confusion we were slammed into the book and then right at the point where I might have had a glimmer of understanding we were ripped away just as fast so this summer when I can take my time I will reread it because I think that if read over at a slower pace this would be a most fabuless piece of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectuals love it, the rest of us just struggle.","review":"Every 'professional' review of this book that I have read has been incredibly favorable. Just see the synopses given here. But for myself, I found this book very hard to read, very pretentious (\\"I opened up the throttle and Pheadrus said 'What is truth?'\\") and really, really boring. I find that books in which the author revels in his intellectual superiority to me leave me cold. Of course, there are lots of people who profess to liking this book because it it seems to coat them with a veneer of intellectuality. My mother calls that 'putting on airs'. And of course as we all know, a veneer is only on the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY Overrated","review":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is the rambling thoughts a philosopher who concludes that because he can't define quality, it can't be defined and is the center of all insight about the universe. (Quality Control professionals would have no problem providing such a definition.) Philosophers often come up with goofy conclusions about other people disciplines such as the nature of God or the universe and yet so often people look at these musing as profound. This book is neither profound or entertaining.The author takes what might have been an interesting story about a motorcycle trip or about the importance of understanding and maintaining your own equipment, and ruins it with these musings."},{"rating":"1","title":"oddball book","review":"\\"Zen and the Art..\\" is certainly a different kind of book. Personally, I couldn't get thru the entire novel. At pg 248, I just gave up. Phaedrus' rants about \\"Quality\\" are just horrible. It does give some good insights, no doubt about that; however, the author seems to take odd paths and use the novel with some propaganda means as well. (for ex. Sylvia and John need technology but can't work with it/understand it). This novel is different from others I have read, but a good read if you're up to the challenge. I would say give it a try up to 150 pgs. if you don't like it after that, then quit because you're not going to like the rest of the novel at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst literary experience of my life","review":"This work claimed to be a 'chautauqua'. By definition, it cannot be. There is no discussion in a book. The book is strained, trite and convoluted at best. While it raises some issues, I felt that no issue was truly addressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like A Golf Ball Through A Garden Hose","review":"The only reason I gave it one star was that they didn't offer a zero-option. When I first read _ZaMM_ I was crushed that such a good title had been wasted. It contains neither Zen nor motorcycle maintenance. The title was designed to sell in surburbia. And for some unknown, \\"emporer's new clothes\\" sort of reason, it does.The book drones on with successive street corner rants better contained in a tome entitled _Sometimes I Feel Like a Nut, Sometimes I Don't_. I know Quality (one rant which dragged on for what seemed like nearly a thousand pages) when I read it... and this ain't it. At the time I read it, I *had* Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance going with my motorcycle. \\"<Profanity>,\\" I thought, \\"I can write a better book on the subject than that.\\" (And there are many folks who think I did.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"I'm sorry, I just don't get it. I think this book is over rated. Maybe if I read the whole thing it would have changed the way I think and feel about my life, but after forcing myself through of the book I said \\"that's all I can stands I can't stands no more.\\" This book isn't about Zen or motorcycle maintenance, it's about a guy on a motorcycle trip with his son trying to find the truth about his life. Just too much philosophizing for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guests thank us for giving us opportunity to discover it...","review":"I never read this book. I bought it (first edition) a long time ago. Each time I lend it to our american guests in our Bed & Breakfast, they thank us warmfully for this. But no one could explicitely tell me why he was so impressed by this book. If you don't have time to come and borrow us this book in France, buy it from Amazon now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Intellectual stroll through a swampy morass","review":"I found this book to be quite tiresome and ineffectual. Despite all the hype leaped upon it, and having read numerous reviews, I failed to see the relevence between Zen and the shock treatment given to the main character. I simply got halfway through the book and had to move on to something more interesting. nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that all about???","review":"I read this for my book club - and if it weren't for this I would have given up after struggling through the first 100 pages. Some people seem to really like this book. I just didn't get it. The meaning of \\"quality\\"? Enough already!! I feel like I just read a book about the meaning of \\"the\\". I'm the dummy though, for not following my instincts and putting it down after the first 100 pages. Hey - for those of you that really liked this book - I know of a bridge here in Brooklyn for sale...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Overrated Book I've Ever Encountered","review":"Don't believe the hype. The whole premise that \\"Quality\\" is an undefineable thing is ridiculous, and the whole rest of the book is built on that flawed premise. A huge disappointment after hearing so many wonderful things about the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reread it as a parent","review":"I don't get it. All of this praise for a book with a misogynistic, selfish a-hole for a main character? A road trip with your child is something to be savored between the two; yet I remember reading only two or three conversations between them. Granted, it's difficult to talk while riding a motorcycle, but you have to get off of it sometimes.And one of the few conversations is when Chris is told people are saying that he has mental/emotional problems. When you think of everything the poor kid had to go through with that nutcase of a father, I don't think Chris is the one with the problems.The book is not about philosophy; it's the rantings of a schizzo whose parenting skills make Joan Crawford look like June Cleaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for more","review":"For years I have talked to people who told me that this book changed their lives. Looking for enlightenment, I read it a couple of times and finally realized that there is nothing in it that a thoughtful ten-year old could not come up with. The book has long been overrated. For those of you whose lives have been changed by reading it, try something like Nietze or even Karl Marx and get ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You May Be Expecting","review":"You would think a book about motorcycle maintenance and zen would be a very down to earth kind of read but a huge majority of the book is spent on philosophic meanderings and metaphysical mysticism. As many people have said the ideas in this book aren't exactly new these days but that's not the author's fault since he wrote it over 30 years ago. The problem is that he's taken very simple concepts and made them ridiculously complex.In contrast to this book, pick up something by the Dalai Lama about buddhism. I find it very ironic that while the spiritual leader of Tibet can explain a concept so simply, some guy on a motorcycle wants to tell me about how a dead greek guy's ideas relate to an undefined term called 'quality' that comes before everything else.It's just disappointing to me because I was hoping to hear a lot more about motorcycles and how they relate to life and zen but he completely forgets about the bike about a third of the way into the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Product of Its Times","review":"I didn't read this book when it first came out to rave reviews. Something about all that enthusiasm with no substance behind it made me wary, and rightly so, it seems.The narrator is a condescending, pompous egotist and I pity his son and his long-suffering friends who got dragged along into this anti-climactic non-dark non-heart of non-darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring..","review":"I bought this book because it was required by my English lit teacher!! Required reading!! Anyways, I didn't enjoy this book at all. Not my type, definitely.But if you are interested in reading this book, just remember, this is one book that you can judge by its cover. It's about exactly what the title indicates. Kind of a novel/bio about a man who gets into motorcycles and becomes philosophical about them. A little bit creepy, not too interesting and even some steamy scenes.Weird...and not worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time.","review":"A good friend raved to me about the book. I read it. Sorry everyone, but I don't think the king has any clothes on.-BB"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZEN and the art of boredom...","review":"This was by far the most boring book I have ever suffered through. Yes. I read it all. From all the hype on it, I knew it must get better. NOT...Don't waste your time on this book, unless...you really like to read someones philosophy on every thing except a mototcycle road trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Quality ???","review":"I finished the entire book to know the complete nightmare that the author put his son through. I read it recently with a author's postscript. He is just a creep and kind of scary and his \\"philosophy\\" is completely illogical. I just about cried for his poor son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I've been wanting to read this for years. I'm both a MC rider and a \\"child\\" of the 60's and early 70's. A harder reading bunch of crap I've never seen.

I do not believe that this set is truly being sold separately by Sony at this point in time. I think this set has been broken out of the 20 DVD box set and is being sold at a ridiculously high price to take advantage of those who purchased the 8 Stooges volumes, and do not wish to buy the 20 disc set just to get the bonus films. Note that this set is NOT being sold by Amazon, but rather by private sellers attached to Amazon. This set is also NOT being sold in retail stores, and to me that is a giveaway as to where these sets being sold separately are coming from. I have no idea if Sony plans to sell this 3 DVD set separately in the future, but as of right now I think I'm going to wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for professionally-trained teachers","review":"After 30 years of teaching, I was looking for a book that would help me evaluate my teaching experiences as well as give me some new perspectives and ideas. This excellent collection of the findings of recent research based on Vygotsky's brilliant work has provided me with both great insight and appreciation of my teaching career as well as the verification of my teaching instincts and the determination to follow through on what I feel are the best methods to use when teaching in today's multi-cultural learning environments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Featured in the bestseller early-childhood reference of 2009, \\"Nurtureshock\\"","review":"I just finished reading, \\"Nurtureshock\\" about the shocking results in the field of child development research and science. The authors discussed the use of the \\"scaffolding techniques\\" developed by the renowned educational theorist Leonid Vygotsky. This constructivist method (if it is implemented properly) does work and the kids are learning. The children are learning by leaps and bounds! The science proves it! If you are involved in the field of early childhood education (or if you're a concerned parent), you really should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sultry, Exotic","review":"The writing is gorgeous, the story sensual and mysterious and the setting exotic (19th century Turkey).

Very entertaining way to get educated, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange present tense","review":"I'm not sure why I bought this. I guess it sounded interesting. Which, I think it might be, if I could get past the author's use of present tense and third-person narrator. I simply could not get past page three because I was so distracted by this awkward combination. I don't mind present tense in an autobiographical or nonfiction book. But here, it just seemed like an awkward stylistic decision that didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fictional primer to Turkish elites","review":"This novel has its flavor of a good thriller but it offers more about the mentalities of late Ottoman Istanbulites. To make it more specific, although it provides a rich scene of everyday lives, it focuses on the elite lives of Istanbul. It is not partisan at all, it demonstrates the complex nature of relations and signs of the emerging leaders of the new Republic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good recording, Horrible packaging","review":"I would have been very happy with my purchase of this set, except for the packaging. The boxes for 3 of the 5 CDs came broken. That in itself was a sign of what to expect for the treatment these CDs must have gotten. When I opened the first box, I noticed that the CD had fingerprints on it right out of the box. I thought it might not have mattered, but on the last song of the CD, my player goes nuts skipping all over the last recording. I tried to clean the prints, but they won't come off, and I think that using anything short of some really caustic chemicals which would damage the rest of the CD will not take these prints off of it.

Do not attempt to put any ice in the cooler, otherwise it will melt and leak everywhere, it will not stay contained. My biggest complaint about this product is the quality of the tei down straps -- Every one of mine ripped in less than a 6 month period -- Or in about 3 to 4 3hour rides. For the price, it should have sustained the basic riding elements instead of falling apart. I have since thrown this in the trash.

Mine started coming apart at the seams on the very first ride. By the third use, several of the straps had torn loose completely. Unlike the other reviewer who had similar issues, our ride was easy. Long, flat, level trail. Once we get to the technical outdoor area, I removed the bag. So this came apart in the easiest of conditions. My brother's bag started ripping yesterday (probably the 4'th or 5'th ride of the summer. I liked the cooler, it's the reason I bought this bag in the first place. I'll probably buy a good quality bag and throw the cooler in there. So, if you want a very expensive cooler, this bag is for you.

Her characters are fascinating and complex, and their surroundings are magically detailed. The setting of this particular novel is at least as important as the characters.

Don't expect this author to hold your hand, and don't expect explanations. Do expect a haunting, perfectly written experience that you will want to return to again and again. Peter S.

As usual, McKillip ends the tale with more ambiguities--no simple \\"happily ever after\\" ending for this author!

The book has a good meaning and it has a realistic outlook to it. It would seem to give people a certain feeling of goodness that they would carry with them wherever they go. It shows that racism is a bad thing which is good to know. When I read the book I actually felt a new life spark into me and I feel like I changed somehow. I look at life differently now.

I must admit though, by looking at the cover and reading the summary on the back of the book it didn't strike me as being an interesting novel. It really isn't as bad as it looks! In my opinion, Kata does a good job using the interesting liability of a blind girl to tell a love story. If you like stories of love that knew no color, then I recommend this book to you. For her first novel I would have to say Elizabeth Kata did fairly well. The beginning of the book grabbed my attention, the middle lost my interest slightly, and the end was confusing and depressing.

This book is Muir's diary of his first summer in the Sierra Nevada. In the spirit of an ascetic mystic, Muir recorded his feelings of wonder as he discovered the awesome beauty of the Sierra Nevada. I held my breath and chuckled as Muir described his encounters with the denizens of the woods. \\"Having heard that a black bear will run from his bad brother man and deciding I would like to see his gait in running, I rushed and shouted at a large cinnamon colored fellow. To my dismay, he did not run. On the contrary, he stood his ground, ready to fight. Then, I suddenly began to fear upon me would fall the work of running.\\" For the reader or nature lover who would like to become more familiar with the father of the conservation movement, this is the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining historical perspective","review":"This is a journal-style book detailing John Muir's experienced in the land around Yosemite in the late 1800's or thereabouts. He describes in vivid detail the natural surroundings--clearly he feels very passionately about nature--in a style that can be a bit tedious at times. Overall, though, it is a great work, and captures a wildness that is difficult if not impossible to find ~120 years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is classic nature lit, then maybe its just me...","review":"I am going to resign from critiquing this book on a literary scale, and just say that I didn't enjoy this book for the same reason a couple others mentioned - its boring and repetitive.

Once I started this intriguing novel I couldn't put it down. It's a wonderful story about perserverance and determination.

It's great to bring that into the library and get the kids interested in past events.

It is about a girl named Charlotte Parkhurst going out to make her dream of living in a big house on a big ranch come true. This is not only a great book but it has historical facts.

Her favorite horse's name is Freedom. The horse dies early on in the book. I like the book because it is so good. The book is good because it is so realistic. It seems like she is still alive.

Despite my system meeting the minimum requirements easily, the software only works sporadically, and when it does it's often herky-jerky with pixelated graphics.It's also not at all clear what you're supposed to do, which makes it a tough slog. But even once you've figured it out, there's just not much to it. When it's working, it looks cool, but the 3 or 4 games it contains aren't anything to get exciteed about.I'm giving 2 stars only because my kid is an RPO fan and because of that has still managed to enjoy the game some.

I agree with the other review that says it's hard to figure out what you are supposed to do. The game doesn't make any sense. It's counter intuitive - a very bad thing for a kid game. I got it as part of a suite of kids software, and I'm thankful that I didn't buy it separately. But, I have to live with the never-ending cycle of my 2 year old wanting to hear the song and see the characters (she cried until I load the CD) like it's a cartoon. Then, she gets frustrated and cries when she has no idea what to do. And, my 4 year old became almost immediately bored with the game when it's pointless nature became evident to her as well. She went back to the Scooby Doo mysteries (which are really good). I think I'm going to uninstall it and throw it in the garbage just to get away from it. It's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next time will pay a little more","review":"I bought this for my 4-year-old. I had one like it as a kid and remember it as being mind-blowingly awesome. This one is not. It doesn't focus very well, there's no definition or crispness to what you see, which diminishes the educational value greatly, in my opinion. I won't send it back, because it was so cheap that postage will be half the price anyway, and at least I can console myself in knowing that when my kid loses interest in 3 minutes I didn't go under for this. Given that my kid is 4, this is no big loss... When he breaks it I will congratulate myself on the money I saved!

I found them wanting in optical quality. Specifically, the 'scope suffers from soft focus and chromatic aberration. Perhaps it would be useful if you knew exactly what you were looking for and just wanted to verify the presence or absence of a given microscopic substance, property, or flaw. Not good enough for general exploratory or educational use. The narrow field of view alone would make it challenging for a child to understand what they were looking at.That said, the seller provided the utmost service in fully addressing my dissatisfaction.

After reading two of the books from the **Light series I am convinced she knew what she was talking about. Witchlight revolves around the child of a magickal leader whose character reads as a cross between Crowley and Leary. The occultism is very accurate, and the story is nearly perfect. There are a few times you want to slap Truth for her stupidity, but feel you can't really blame her. She's falling under a spell, after all. I read this book straight through in one sitting.

Truth is supposed to be highly educated and working in the paranormal field but knows ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it...she misses such obvious things that it is amazing she can tie her own shoelaces without help.If this is a real exampe of occultists in the modern day they deserve all the bad press they get as none of these people has any intelligence of their own and blindly follow whatever \\"cult\\" leader is convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"It pains me to say it, but","review":"I'm a HUGE MZB fan, but this is definitely not one of Bradleys best.

The clip was good because of the quality sound. I am dissatisfied with the splicing that was done on the recording. When it repeats, there is an obvious cut. When it transitions to the development section (after the repeat) the horn is off in pitch (an obvious splice as well). Entrances are not always solid in the strings and there are a few intonation errors in the winds. I also feel there were some balance issues (sometimes winds are not heard). I am also disappointed that I don't even know which orchestra this is-- not on the CD cover or identified in the MP3 list. I will be more cautious next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but season 1 soundtrack better","review":"This cd was good but I think the season 1 sountrack was better. The first few tracks on this were my favorite and while the others are good it was hard to pick out where they belonged in the DVD because they were somewhat similar, like one long song instead of different scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stellar score for a ground-breaking show","review":"When Battlestar Galactica re-appeared it was clear that we were dealing with something that would challenge our expectations of a sci-fi drama, and it did so with such critical success that it made fans of people from widely varied and unlikely walks of life.A great deal of the success of the tone of this show is attributible to Richard Gibbs' score, which is as unconventional as the show itself. Stark Koto drum arrangements underscore battle scenes to add to tension, and the times of desperate peril are sometimes voiced by simple sad bell arrangements which run counterpoint to the direness of the situations. The music is truly another main character to provide reference to the action, and always in an unconventional way.Pick this up to relive the spectacle of the show, or to give similar mood to your day in the world which our heroes on Galactica are so valiantly trying to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Score","review":"Bear McCready (composer of the regular series' music) took many of Gibb's leifmotifs from this score, and for good reason. The Miniseries score begins eerily with the \\"Cylon\\" chiming, then progresses into a Galactica main theme (which is unfortunately not used at all in the regular series). The main theme is most dramatic in the the track, \\"The Storm and the Dead,\\" complete with vocals. It's not your everyday \\"space opera\\" Wagnerian music; people who like that stuff should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spot-on music for the show.","review":"This sound track was nigh-on-perfect for the show.

It just goes on forever, is just a mix of several 2 min sounds thrown together to make a cd or \\"season\\". I personally didn't find anything remotely musical about this cd & listened to it twice. Maybe after it sits a while & time passes, I'll give it another try.

The Divertimento K131,written when Mozart was 16 , but sounding more mature, is composed for flute ,oboe,bassoon,4 hornes and strings. Here the Salzburg Camerata Academica players are of the highest caliber both technically and artistically. The Divertimento K205 cast on a large scale, and dimanding of virtuoso playing provides a difficult but well resolved task of balance. Vegh directs another characterful,delightful performance,to round off a very desirable disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crescendo is A-One","review":"Mel Torme at The crescendo is one of his best of the early years. His voice is wonderful and as always, his live concert is relaxed and makes you feel like you were there in person. This is another one of his collaborations with Marty Paich and is definitely well worth having in your collection of Torme's works. He gives verbal credit to all his band members, and introduces each song. Although taken from a concert from 1957, the quality of the cd is great. There really is no down-side to this cd. The songs are great, the singer is fantastic, and the musicianship can't be beat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written Travel Narrative","review":"D.H. Lawrence is better known for his various novels, i.e., Women in Love; Lady Chatterly's Lover; and Sons and Lovers than for his travel writing. With that said, I highly recommend this book. Personally I love Lawrence's writing style and this particular book is exceptional even for Lawrence. You will feel as though you are there with him experiencing the moment he is describing. The people and places of Italy come alive through his prose. His writing moves, at times, from reality and physical descriptions to abstraction and philosophy, but it is so wonderfully written, you will cherish every word and never question the move from one to the other. Images abound in this work and the scenes he describes are beautifully sensual. I have read this work twice and plan on reading it numerous other times throughout my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I couldn't get into this book.

This story was originally published in the Oxford American and was copied over and over by bluegrass fans and mailed all over the world. It was such an underground hit that it was published in book form along with some additional musings by the author. Piazza recounts a visit he and Martin made backstage at the Grand Ole Opry. It's the kind of thing you will never read in Bluegrass Unlimited. It is just too real! If you've ever seen Jimmy in person, you know what an outreageous character he is, and you'll love this book. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, albeit quick, read!","review":"I'm so tired of music biographies where the subject is either villainized or practically canonized; none of us are perfect saints, nor are we completely evil. That's why I always find it refreshing when a writer presents the true person, most of whom are a little of both. Piazza has done that here.Martin is something of a tragic figure; a mad genius. In candid interviews, Piazza has found all the good in the man, as well as peeled back some of the bad. He shows that if Martin had been born in another era, or been a king of another genre, he would have been a hero, but in the holier-than-thou bluegrass scene, the hard-living Martin was considered something of a black sheep, despite his obvious brilliance.This is a great book, and definitely one of the best music biographies ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"great subject, poorly handled","review":"it's more about the writer's experience with Jimmy than about Jimmy himself, though it does shed some light on Jimmy's colorful personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Adventures with the King of Bluegrass: Jimmy Martin","review":"The book was informative but a bit disappointing in that it did not cover Mr. Martin's early life. It is a shame that a man with such potential ended up as an alcoholic."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste!","review":"Tim Piazza and Marty Stuart should have limited their ramblings to an article in Bluegrass Unlimited. Not enough here to make a book and certainly nothing we haven't heard before... The book covers the details of a couple of road trips but provides very little else. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally handy containers","review":"I wish I had these YEARS ago, they are the perfect size for condiments, nuts, holding assorted small amounts of any sort.

I know I did not even catch all the popular culture nods in it. I think Ms. Ashe has the potential to be a very beloved writer due to her unique style. She has the imagination and wit to do so. All she needs is a better editor. There were plenty of typos in this book that could have (should have) been caught by the editor. Despite the typos, the story still held my attention. I think it's an excellent first effort by a new writer, and I hope to see more from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun start to a wild ride","review":"This book brings a quirky sense of humor to the otherwise been-there-read-that genre. The characters are endearing and quickly break out of their molds, while the underlying universe is solid. As the heroine grows into herself, she learns what she's capable of and I can't wait to see what she does next. I'm really looking forward to the next installment to this series to find out what she does next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the Bomb!","review":"I got this book because I had read the authors previous work and was completely in love with it. I was not at all disappointed with the book. Elizabeth Ashe is truely an amazing unbelievable writer and her book just shows how much of a genius she is. I became totally caught up in the book and the characters. She make everything from the setting to the diverse character real and almost tangible to thr reader. I hope she continues to write so that I may continue to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly Not Christian","review":"Sad, sad book. I feel like I wasted my time reading it, and certainly my money buying it. I am very interested in Bible prophecy and thought this is what I would be reading about with this book Lamb.

I wonder if I could get some of my money back by selling it used?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamb Equals Yawns","review":"I had heard about Lamb and thought it would be a really different Christian book. But it was nothing but judgmental tripe. A conspiracy theory expanded into one very long yawn of a book. Nothing new here. Just the same old leftist jargon, mixed in with some newage tripe. Why do all these new age authors come out with books they call \\"radical\\" Christianity when it isn't even sound Biblical Christianity? Why not call your book a new age book as it should be called? I would rather read anything by Hal Lindsay any day of the week, even if he does run a church, than this judgmental work.

He has stripped away popular misconception about the darker side of what passes for religion these days.

Great, but then they go and make Him into something they like. Sure there are people in churches who are hypocrites. But to write off churches in general is totally ridiculous. Check out the website for the author of this book, check out the archives for his messages. The author seems more concerned about the war in Iraq, seems to determine a person's Christianity on their view of the war. Supporting President Bush on the war appears to make one a satanist, which makes me leary of the theology presented in his book. As for literary style, I found it interesting, but a bit confusing in parts, and somewhat boring in others."},{"rating":"2","title":"No magic to it","review":"Kreskin states right off the bat that he does not read minds.

It was well worth the wait. I'd forgotten what a fabulous voice this man has. Besides the title cut, you can tell from \\"Sunset Blvd\\" that this man was created to play the role of Joe Gillis. His duet with Linda Balgord, who he not only was paired with in the tour of Sunset Blvd., but also in Aspects of Love, which this duet is from, is amazing. I can only hope that the two of them will record a CD of Duets for everyone, who has not had the pleasure of hearing them sing together in person, can enjoy. His original songs like, When The Lights Go Out, shows you that he truly feels every word that he wrote. I was so fortunate to get to hear Mr. Bohmer everynight for nearly three months during the St. Louis run of SUNSET. Now I can listen to him daily once again. What a truly amazing voice and from a truly amazing man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One song...no...One CD...","review":"If you could only buy one CD by a Broadway star this would have to be the one! Mr. Bohmer truly out does himself with his versions of some of the most beautiful and touching songs in musical theater.

It is a sleek and modern looking watch, I like its square look and the way the watchseems to flow into the watch band. So far it is keeping good time. It feels well built, but not to heavy. Its a watch that you can wear for any occasion. The only reason I give it 4 not 5 is the color, and this may be my computers fault, on my screen the watch has a slight green tint (that I like) but the watch in fact is just shiny stainless steel, but still a very nice looking watch, one I will wear often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch!","review":"We purchased this watch for all of our groomsmen at our wedding. They loved it so much that my husband bought one too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality in Santa Fake","review":"Everything I've ever read about Santa Fe has clearly been through the eyes of people who didn't grow up there. This book paints a real picture of what living in a tourist town can cause for those who have to survive amongst the hype and out of control cost of living in such a place, as I've always read about. Jaramillo paints a picture of reality one can find in many cities throughout the country, but not expected in a city like Santa Fe. It's refreshing to read such reality through the eyes of a young, brilliant latino."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mara Returns...","review":"Just like the first Mara story, \\"Kinda\\", this has a very good plot in it. Unfortunately, like \\"Kinda\\", the story suffers badly from lack of action. Apart from the cliffhanger, part one wasn't that good at all, and part four has a confusing and mediocre ending. Apart from the regulars, the acting was terrible. And the costumes were hideous looking like the ones in \\"The Horns of Nimon\\". On the plus side, like \\"Kinda\\", the plot was excellent. There were some eerie and scary parts in this one, all the cliffhangers were great, and Janet Fielding's acting was breath-taking. She does a very good job playing the part of a possessed Tegan. She made my hair stand up. But in all, I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book from the Royal Diaries series.","review":"Princess Red Bird is the daughter of the king of all the Hsien people in Southern China, in the year A.D. 531.

She has learned to read and speak in Chinese, and to serve as an interpreter between her people and the Chinese officials. Red Bird is only sixteen, but she has had to grow up fast, and when war erupts, her life changes even more. She knows that if the Hsien and the Chinese could only become allies, they could fight together against their common enemy. But is an alliance between two very different peoples even possible? This new book from the Royal Diaries series brought to life Southern China long ago, and taught me many fascinating details about the life and culture there in A.D. 531."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Usually I go straight to the bookstore and buy a new DA/MNIA/RD book when it comes out. I'm glad I saw this one at the library first and got it there. After about 80 pages I had to quit. The plot was very weak and dragged on. Usually by that point in the books, something interesting has happened. Not so in \\"Lady\\". If you feel you have to read it, try to get it from a library or a friend first to decide whether or not it's worth it to buy it.

This book is so awful I had to put it down and not quiet finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big disappointment.","review":"\\"Lady of Ch'iao Kuo: Warrior of the South, Southern China, A.D. 531\\" was rather long and boring - it dragged. Perhaps if the length of the book had been shorter, it wouldn't have seemed dull. Yep seemed more interested in war strategies then the life of Princess Red Bird. I was disappointed he did not give more detail of her schooling and life at her palace. Another major disappointment was finding out nearly all the characters in this novel were fictional. This statement should have been brought up in the beginning before one begins to read, rather than after the book is finished. The final disappointed was in the epilogue - it was very un-detailed. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady of Ch'iao Kuo: Warrior of the South","review":"The Lady was sent from Southern to Northern China. She was to learn the Chinese language (what was it? Cantonese? Maderin? :S ) by Master Chen because she was to be an interpreter for her father. When the enemy (Dog Heads) striked, they murdered nearly everyone there, but Princess Red Bird saved a few people and some scrolls. She reads the scroll of Master Meng which talks about peace. The princess wasn't sure whether \\"peace\\" existed or not for she lived in a dangerous and dark time. The Hsien learns about a traitor, but they don't know who it is. The young aristocrat thinks of a way to stop the Dog Heads and unmask the traitor...The diary of the Lady of Ch'iao Kuo was yet another great piece to the Royal Diaries!

The characters were so real and funny. I also liked the emotions and the research that the author did. I think this book is a must-have for every avid reader. At the beginning I had a little trouble understanding the story, but at the end it's real good. I also liked the plot of this story and the way the Lady strives for peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Redbird is STUNNING!!!!!","review":"Princess Redbird is a Hisien,NOT Chinese. She is attending a Chinese school that is run by Master Chen who is quite odd for a Chinese. A majority of the diary is her assignment to make a history of her and Master Chen's land, not just his (Which is what Redbird supposed he meant). A wonderful book, but I think that our Princess needs a better name than Redbird or Lady of Ch'iao Kuo."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of the Royal Diaries","review":"I hate to be negative, but this book is just plain boring. It was far too long with too much pointless yakking and not enough suspense.

This fictionalized account of a great female warrior, diplomat, and peace maker of ancient China has issues relevant to today's reader. She wondered how things got so bad, why did this happen to her people, and how would they survive.

The only thing is, ALL the charactars are fictional exept herself, Little Tiger, her parents, her future husbend and his father.

I've read other David McCollough work and knew I couldn't go wrong with one of his. This is great history, greatly written. I knew a little about the history of the Panama Canal but this book excited my imagination while making it clear that I didn't know much. McCullough had a way of writing that is as good as or better than the best fiction. A rip-roaring true adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent telling of an excellent story","review":"I had no idea that a book on the building of the Panama Canal could be so fascinating, mostly because I had no idea that the story itself was so fascinating. David McCullough's 1977 telling of that story, in The Path Between the Seas, is excellent. From the debate over the path and the method, to the somewhat disastrous French attempt, through the triumph of the United States' completion of the canal, this 600 page history moves fast. The technological (sea level or locks?), natural (the landslides and the annual flooding of the Chagres River), and health (malaria and yellow fever) obstacles were enormous. The scale of the project was, literally, unprecedented. This book is just as much biography (de Lesseps, Bunau-Varilla, Roosevelt, Gorgas, Goethels) and political history as it is a description of just how the canal was built."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong Title for the Book?","review":"Great book, but potentially with the wrong title. It shows that the canal connected a lot more than just two oceans. Although the vehicle of this true epic was the search for a useful canal, the story touched on so many other aspects of the human civilization than just the engineering of what should be a wonder of the world. The cheapness of human life (thousands lost), the human desire for conquest and expansion, the psychology of business and investment, revolution and international affairs, the experimentation in social organization (pseudo-socialist lifestyle in the American Canal zone). The reader should be prepared for multiple off-shoots and tribulations that are all connected to the canal projects. The reader must be prepared for a long but fruitful journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent History","review":"I really enjoyed the breadth of this book. It ranges smoothly over political history, engineering, medicine, and finance. You come away with the feeling that you understand something about the people who built (and earlier failed to build) the canal. The discussion of alternate canal routes was also interesting. Maybe this book should get five stars, but I'm going to subtract one because sometimes there was just too much detail so things got a little slow. Of course not everyone will agree on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Path Between the Seas","review":"This is a fascinating story of the entire history of the construction of the Panama Canal, beginning with the French, who had recently completed construction of the Suez Canal at sea level.With virtually no advance surveys of the terrain at Panama, de Lesseps decided to build a sea level canal, since that had done the job at Suez. The French government became involved in the financing, and millions of francs were spent and thousands of lives lost to malaria and yellow fever, before the project was given up. This brought about the fall of the French government.With some highly suspicious maneuverings by Theodore Roosevelt, the U.S. gained independence of Panama from Columbia and eventually built the canal after discovering the cause of malaria and yellow fever and taking steps to avoid it.The usual excellent writing by David McCullough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great telling of an epic.","review":"McCullough is a master of the English language. This was my first non-biography of his and though it was very entertaining, it was not quite as captivating as his John Adams or Truman. The book is divided naturally into the French effort and the American effort, with ample interlocking references. Fleshing out the individual principal characters is McCullough's strong suit, and as always, they seem to come alive in this book. Research is complete and lends just enough detail without becoming too tedious. The book seems to end rather abruptly, but then again that seems to be historically accurate, as much of the fanfare was lost in the European conflict that had erupted just as the Canal was opened. In any case, this is a job well done and a book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant author, most exciting history book I know of.","review":"I certainly did not expect too much excitement from a 700 pages book about the Panama Canal, but David McCullough did an excellent job. He obviously did a lot of research, but his true accomplishment is putting all the little fragments together to one exciting story. This is not just history, it is politics, business, engineering, medicine, etc. And best of all, it is very well written and easy to read.I like it even better than \\"Truman\\", McCulloughs most famous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panama Canal Review","review":"David McCullough has one of the best minds today. His writing style is very easy to read and has a cadence that is natural, full of facts and makes you a part of history.I was so impressed (I have about 8 of his books) I sent a letter to him via the publisher thanking him for being who he is.He is a very gracious man and actually sent me a reply.Anything you read or see with his narration is a class act."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going through the Panama Canal?","review":"This is a 'must read' for anyone going through the Panama Canal. McCullough is a very good historian who writes in a style that makes for an interesting read, even the sections about the technicalities of building the canal. I had a much more enjoyable cruise for having read this book about the people and passions involved in the creation of the \\"Path Between the Seas\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Very factual but exteeeeeeeeemly boring and wordy. I read it before going through the cannal and it helped me greatly to enjoy the trip, but it could be 1/4 the size and still do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic history of a fantastic project..","review":"As time passes, people have grown accustomed to hearing about the Panama Canal, but have no idea of the time, work and difficulties behind this amazing achievement. It's well-written, and keeps the reader coming back for more. Anyone interested in learning would enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"STill the Best Overview Available on the History of the Panama Canal","review":"While on a small ship educational cruise with Smithsonian Journeys from New England through the Panama Canal this fall, I was introduced to David McCullough's classic history on the creation of the canal. McCullough's ability to comprehensively deliver on all the relevant historic facts, as well as present highly readable and entertaining human interest stories, made this book an outstanding read, even though it was published in 1977. When we toured Panama, the Panama Canal and associated museums, now all maintained by the Panamanian government, the museum display captions were all written in Spanish, and effectively translated by our multi-lingual guide, but it felt as if he was actually reading from McCullough's book. Once we returned from the cruise and I no longer had access to the ship's copy of McCullough's work, I had to get one of my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"History and travel classic","review":"This big volume on the history of the Panama Canal is a classic. Very detailed, a long read, yet consistently David McCulloch makes the minutiae interesting. Much historical and social detail about the role of France, and later the US, in the building of the Canal. Anyone visiting Panama for the first time should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down!","review":"My husband has not talked to me for days. He cannot put the book down. One of the best historical books he has read. A must read for anyone interested in the history of the Panama Canal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely recommended","review":"I found this book incredibly informative. The research that obviously went into it is incredible. I always have the same problem with McCullough's books - they need an editor. About ten percent of this book was superfluous and just didn't fit. Still I enjoyed it greatly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"save up $1000 before you read this book....","review":"... because you will be inspired to visit Panama to see the Canal. Fortunately tourism in the Canal Zone has become much easier ever since the US withdrew from the country. Many of the exclusive areas formerly reserved for Canal personnel are now open as hotels, restaurants, and for general tourism. McCullough writes about the flood of tourism that attended the Canal's construction and opening. He is probably responsible for quite a bit of the modern Canal tourism!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive!","review":"It takes a good author to make a subject like this interesting. McCullough accomplished it!The story behind the Canal is so much more than just the physical construction involved. The years of the French construction involved a lot of corruption and scandal that I'd never heard about!Then, after about two decades, American takes over, and within a few years the canal is open for traffic. The successful fight against the deadly mosquito was one of the turing points.McCullough talks a lot about some of the politics involved, in both the French and the American stages. The story behind the Panamanian revolution was quite interesting. . . the US more or less \\"stole\\" Panama from Columbia, I guess you could say.Definitely a good book, and worth your time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and detailed book","review":"I bought this book for my husband prior to going on a cruise through the Panama Canal. He loved it. It is a very detailed book, so if you want a quick read, this is not it. They sold this book on the ship, but he was glad to have read it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Enjoyable","review":"I found the part about the Ferdinand de Lesseps failings not to my interest and skipped it. I enjoyed reading about the lobbying of Congress, the congressional hearings, Teddy Roosevelt's \\"maneuvers\\" including the United States support of the coup d'etat taking Panama away from Columbia,, the construction of the Canal, the conquering or mitigating the various diseases (yellow fever, malaria, bubonic plague, small pox, typhoid fever, pneumonia, cholera, etc.) by Dr. Gorgas, the Jim Crowism in the Canal Zone during construction (Julie Greene has written an entire book on this), and the every day life of living in the Canal Zone during construction.David McCullough writes well. I have a feeling he is a helluva nice man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Path between the seas","review":"I got this for my father, he loves the book, I only wish that it was in Kindle format so I could read it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before you visit the Panama Canal, read this.","review":"The telling of history is McCullough's forte. History can be understood as a story of people in this great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review - The Path Between the Seas","review":"Very interesting book.Very well written and researched.Good discussions of social, political and economic issues regarding the building of thePanama Canal.The detailed history and descriptions were excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - but poor job of Kindle-ization","review":"This is a great book for folks who love the history of technology or politics.But whoever converted this to Kindle format did a lousy job! On the Kindle, typos occur on nearly every page, formatting of quotations is weird, notes appear in-line at the end of each chapter, and captions for images appear on pages by themselves instead of on the page with the matching image (which appears with no caption at all).It seems like the most likely explanation for the problems is a combination of the fact that this book was authored in the pre-digital age, and then apparently nobody proofread it after it was converted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Politics, history, and engineering marvels","review":"To this day the sheer scope of the undertaking of the Panama Canal remains simply astounding. It would be a challenging project with modern technology, which only makes you appreciate the imagination and the inventiveness of the engineers from a hundred years back. That's not to say that it all worked out smoothly, in fact, this book does a wonderful job of documenting the many false starts, failed enterprises, political schemes and machinations, and the engineering challenges along the way. If you're curious about the history, the individuals and the politics behind the project, then this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read before going through the canal.","review":"After reading this book I knew more detail and background aboutthe building of the canal than the lecturers on the cruise ship.Spent the day, May 7, 2005, cruising the canal and enjoyed everyminute of it. The background that the author gives the reader isin such detail that I got bug spray for the trip. The reader will want to cruise the canal and see all the areas mentionedin the book. I was not a reader of non-fiction before but wantto read Davids other books now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the read","review":"This is an excellent book and I recommend it.

I love history and this book is a must read. I learned so much about the Panama Canal! Good story, not at all stuffy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The moon landing of 1914","review":"Apollo 11's moon landing 20 July 1969 was a brilliant human feat. It crowned JFK's eight year effort (twelve years if one starts from Sputnik).Fifty-five years earlier the onset of World War I in August 1914 muted an equally radiant exploit: the opening of the Panama Canal. It had taken 39 years (401 years if one starts from Vasco Núñez de Balboa's trek over the Isthmus in 1513), and involved extraordinary expense (more than the sum of all territorial purchases in US history). Nascent advances in medicine, science, and technology were instrumental, but the project still involved innumerable deaths, a racial divide, and political intrigue worthy of modern best-selling fiction.McCullough's reputation as the consummate historian/storyteller is nowhere better advanced than in this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Path between The Seas","review":"The Path Between The Seas by David McCullough is a must read by anyone interested in the history of man's achievements in construction. The author masterfully presents details as to every obstacle that had to be overcome to create a path between the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean by cutting through the Continental Divide at the Panama isthmus. His coverage of the human aspects of the massive excavation and construction efforts is a great piece of literature commemorating both the engineering genius of many persons and the thousands of lives sacrificed in constructing the canal and its locks system."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest histories written in the 20th Century","review":"The scope and the sweep of Path Between the Seas is immense. Yet this is no pedantic list of train cars needed and tons and tons of slipping, sliding earth. McCullough has captured the immensity of the engineering and the health problems that far too many of us take for granted today as we transit the canal in cruise ships or talk about its future. I just saw him on Book CSpan at Claremont College and we are indeed fortunate to have such a gifted historian in our midsts. Get the book and admire the accomplishments of the historian and those whose story he tells.."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow and steady","review":"Interesting and factual...easy to follow very long story about a very long project.

As with some of his other works, McCullough gets into so much detail that unless the reader is essentially obsessed with the subject, the length really gets in the way of the overall story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick info about the Canal","review":"It was a short and interesting presentation. The book will be on my coffee table for my guests to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Path Between The Seas - A Journey Worth Taking","review":"The Panama Canal is probably one of the most overlooked achievements of the last century. David McCullough who you may know as the host of the series \\"The American Experience\\" tells us of the toils and troubles of the men who built this masterpiece of Engineering. McCullough's style is entertaining and imformative and makes one wish that he would write a book on everything. This book will make you see things in a brand new way. Also check out \\"Truman\\" by McCullough as it is equally intriguing and informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"A very informative book. I did not even know of the French involvement, or the workings of the \\"liberation\\" of Panama. The descriptions of the constant dealings of all the parties involved brought them all back to life. A book that has, simply put, educated me. Just what I expected. Never got too slow, and no loose ends. Made me appreciate the canal and the men who built it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read prior to taking trip through Panama Canal","review":"Arrived in timely manner as described.

A really good read, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent book by McCullough","review":"This is a review of the audio CD version of book. David McCullough does an excellent job of illuminating the history of early French efforts to build the canal and the later successful effort to do so by the Americans, and the incredible loss of human life that accompanied all of these efforts. McCullough also exposes the financial and political machinations that were at work prior to and during the canal-building years. McCullough's discussion of those machinations left me bored the first time I listened to the audiobook, but I found them much more interesting on subsequent listenings. The audio recording is excellent, as it always is with David McCullough's audiobooks. The only downside of the audiobook version is that it lacks the 80 photographs and 2 maps that are in the print edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Path Between the Seas","review":"Path Between The Seas : The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914I have just started reading this book.

It provides a detailed picture of all the activities from the 1800's up and until it's compeletion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Path Between The Seas by David McCullough--brief review","review":"Great, very long, book with much (sometimes too much) detail. It divides into 3 parts. Part 1 is all about background and the progress of the French in trying to build the Panamá Canal. That occured before 1900. Part 2 is all about the background and process the United States went through in making its decision to build the canal in Panama (and not in Nicaragua). Part 3 is about the actual building of the canal from the early 1900s until its completion in 1914. I'm so glad I'd read this book before going through the canal recently. Some friends of mine bogged down in Part 1 and didn't get into the rest; so one might consider starting with Parts 2 and 3 (although having the background of Part 1 certainly enriches the total experience)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Path Between the Seas","review":"Wonderfully detailed history of the conception, politics, and construction of the Panama Canal.

It comes from the years when the band were an English hard-rock version of Southern rock rather than a high-class version of Poison.

Everytime I find a \\"remixed christmas\\" cd, I usually get it, just because I'm hoping someday there will be one that actually transforms traditional holiday songs into club anthems. Unforntuanately, all of them have the same trend. They sound like 4th graders having fun with a computer. This one, as foul as it is, is actually better than most, however.There Are a few songs that aren't bad, Hark The Harold Angels Sing isn't exactly regrooved, but it's nicely mixed. White Christmas has good usage of vocals and beats. The rest however . . . well, Carol of the Bells, for instance, sounds like someone banging pots and pans to the music of a very, VERY slow paced funeral march. It is so bad. There are Dj scribble sounds, a demoic voice that whispers \\"Christmas\\", whoosey moans like a smurf taking a crap. It's horrid.

One spot in particular is the poignant scene where Judge Priest is talking to his departed wife in their room as he stands before her picture.

The story and script are very simple, with akward and over-the-top acting by most. The script included long, drawn out and very corny speeches by Will Rogers. But that's to be expected, since this film was made during the relatively early years of cinema. And the film quality isn't very good-the picture is very grainy. I also expected that the images and portrayals of African-Americans would be archaic and probably offensive. But I love movies for their historical value too. However, this film's treatment of Black characters is so racist and demeaning that I couldn't see anything else. I will only keep this in my collection as an example of cinema at its most mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"packaging","review":"Packaging is a disgrace. Discs are hard to remove and are scratched.

However, the Golden One brings the focus back on our favorite heroine, Amelia Peabody. The plot was delightfully complex and kept me on the edge of my seat. Even with Ramses and Nefret married, the book still had some tension, though I liked the series better before they were married. The book also did not tie up every single problem so we can all expect that the next Amelia Peabody mystery will be as interesting or better. However, I found Sethos' turn for the good a little unrealistic and I wished there was more from the rest of the family. This series is great for anyone who likes good mysteries or has an interest in Egyptology. Elizabeth Peters is a highly competant author who knows her subject and her Amelia Peabdody series is a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Pleasure","review":"I first met Amanda Peabody some years ago and have followed her for a long time. Elizabeth Peters draws vivid characters against the stark back ground of WWI Egypt and the vastness of the desert sands.Poor Amanda, to be a closet romantic in a family of realists is a humbling chore.

This growth makes the acceptance of the story more enduring against theme that have previously been played out in other titles.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little slow in parts but good","review":"I am a longtime fan of Ms. Peters, and I always enjoy any new Amelia Peabody mystery. Having said that, I found it entertaining. I didn't like the whole site switching thing. I see why they did it though. I continue to enjoy all the chaos that always surrounds them. I'm delighted that Amelia gets to be a gramdmother (again) I look forward to the next installment. Hands up for everyone who thought Maryam (Molly) would come after the Emersons for her mothers death. The book is certainly worth reading and for the most part well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden One is one of the best!","review":"Elizabeth Peters' gets it right and The Golden One is right at the top of her best style of writing. All the usual old friends, family, and bad guys show up. The Emersons are all over the place finding villians and Egyptian treasures. Nefret is much more pleasing following her 'confused' state in the past. Marriage has done much to calm her and Ramses, but not in their adventures. By the end of the book, we know a little more of what's to come and there is the introduction of a new villian. I hope Ms. Peters continues to write more just like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's also a USB drive.","review":"I need a USB drive for work, from time to time. The one I bought years ago (64MB) just died. I was actually driving to a store to buy another one when it hit me... my camera's SD card IS a USB drive.I can't imagine why anyone would buy a regular SD card - this is SO worth the small difference in price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool tool","review":"You have to love the \\"cool\\" factor of being able to just pop it into a USB. Now if they can make one where you can carry something like this or two in a credit card carrier for spare backup or for \\"you never know when you need instant storage\\" situations, that would be the ultimate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine was very bad, very bad.","review":"I was very enthusiastic about this purchase. The design is amazing and it was the perfect product of my needs...on paper. But, after using it several times in SD card mode without a hitch, I switched it to USB Stick mode and it just flat out rebooted the computer. My guess is that it created a surge in the USB 2.0 port on my Lenovo T60p which are not known to fail. I tried again, same result this time with XP not being able to recognize the card. When it was removed from the USB port, the computer restarted again. Now no device I have can recognize it. This could be a fluke based on all the other reviews (why I bought the card) but not mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Underrated Product","review":"The ability of the Ultra II SD Plus to act as a USB card makes it universally useful. No matter what type of computer I encounter, I can always take it from my camera and use the USB port to view images on the computer rather than on my camera. When travelling, this makes it extremely easy to upload images and thus clear more space on the card for more photography. Although I have yet to have any problems, I also appreciate having two choices for accessing the data should one or the other fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's been very good!!!","review":"it's the best to use between a palm Life drive, a camera pentax and a notebook.

The card allows him to take the pictures, remove the card from the camera and put it directly into the computer to show friends. Amazon's price was the best around and their shipping was great! I'd highly recommend the card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I've used this card for over 2 years now with no problems. It's by far the handiest card I own. I have several other types of cards--enough to last for a 30-day trip to the Arctic. There, I offloaded images to my iPod. This card was flawless. It's the card I keep in my Canon SD900 because it's so easy to use. Pull it out; fold it; put it in the USB slot. It just works. (Mac OSX.) I've also used it as a mini hard drive for data transfer. Brilliant idea. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice product","review":"I waited a few months after buying this card before I wrote the review since some people complained about how fragile it is. I am glad to report that this has been working great for me swapping back and forth between my digital camera and PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels like it gets stuck coming out","review":"Convenient little SD cards. Never again having to worry about carrying a card reader or USB cable. I just had to pick-up one of these after purchasing the 512MB version for a friend to use with a Nikon S7C. No noticeable write speed slow down (compared to a Lexar 133x) when used with a Nikon D80. There is one little nagging bit that some may find too annoying to continue using. Despite the car being completely snapped into place, the edges of the fold must be getting caught somewhere inside the D80 SD slot. Rather than popping straight out, it gets caught and you have to wiggle it ever so softly in order to get it to come out smoothly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fast and no cables or card reader needed! I love it!","review":"This is the best little gadget I've gotten in awhile. Completely eliminates the need for USB cables or a card reader. Heck, you can even replace your keychain flash drive with this baby! 2GB of space and super-fast upload and shutter speeds. I use it with my new Canon SD1000 and couldn't be happier. I've recommended it to everyone I know! Plus, the price on Amazon is just amazing. Buy one - you definitely will NOT regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than i hoped","review":"I saw this and thought I would gamble as this small a device with USB plug just had to be \\"flimsy\\" but it wasn't. Its solid when broken in half for plugging into the usb and it plugs in firm as well. someone else mentioned a speed issue which I didn't notice but I wasn't holding a clock to it iether.I bought this for my new treo 700w and it works great, very simple no software smooth as silk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little bugger","review":"5 Stars! Finally Great Innovation.I love my little flash drive. It fits in my Treo then pops out with no need for ejection (mostly) and pops right into a computers USB slot. Of course I have to eject it from the computer after it has mounted and I have saved stuff to it, but If I'm just reading or copying files from it I just pull it right out and back into my phone and away I go! No more little USB stick drives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Donald R. Burgett has produced four excellent works concerning his experiences while a member of Col. Bob Sink's 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the fabled 101st Airborne Division. His details of his experiences of training and jumping into battle at Normandy put you right in the thick of his experiences. His graphic descriptions of what he saw, smelled, tasted and felt will bring you right into this environment like no other book I've read. The action comes fast and this is a book that you can't put down and will read from chapter to chapter and then be disappointed when you finish the book if you don't have his next work about Operation Market garden,The Road to Arnhem.I recommend all of Burgett's books about his experiences and the humble man who wrote them. This is a must read for WWII history fans and 101st Airborne fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Account of the 101 in the Normany Campaign","review":"Excellent read, however those not versed in the WWII military venacular (e.g. B.A.R., D.Z., O.P., etc.) may have problems following some aspects of the book. Those who have read other accounts of the Normandy campaign (or other millitary history of the european theater) will tear through this easy and enjoyable read. Burgett was a very hard man, who killed 27 germans in one fire fight, and scores of others during the war. He proclaims to not understand the need for his colleages to mourn the loss of a buddy when there were still more nazis to kill! This book is a perfect compliment to Band of Brothers, it details the same training and battles of the same regiment only A company instead of E company."},{"rating":"2","title":"No pretense","review":"Horrific depictions of what it was like for the men on the ground. Burgett's account gives a good glimpse, but civilians like us can never fully experience what it must have been like. Reads easy; only took two days for me.What i didn't like was all the typos i found in my edition. There were glaring problems with the language and spelling. One of Burgett's buddies is alternately listed as \\"Brinninstool\\" and \\"Brennenstool.\\" Not the most efficient editing job...Overall, a good piece of memoirs. Hard to believe no one wanted to read this book when it was originally published. Must have been way before its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"sub zero","review":"Lied to, storied, misrepresentation.

Burgett just tells the story as he lived the invasion of Normandy and the fighting in the French hedgerows. I have never been in a war (thankfully), but his book really helped me understand how people felt in battle. I really recommend it - cannot wait for his book on Arnhem."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, easy to read","review":"had to read it for my college US history class and I thought it was going to be extremly boring but it was def NOT.

I loaned it out all over the school. I moved and spent the next 20 years trying to find another copy. Burgett has captured the daily life of a combat soldier candidly, truthfully, and without glamorizing it. His matter of fact approach, and easy to follow style make this a book that once started cannot be put down. Read it.

They worked right out of the box. Windows XP recognized them without any problems. They work. The sound is clear, but very shallow and weak. These speakers have absolutely no depth. They're almost as bad as my sub-par laptop speakers. I give them two stars because they actually DO work and the speakers are attractive looking. They'd work all right for travel, but for full-time every day speakers... I want something that actually has some depth.The nice thing is that they come with a speaker jack usb adapter that I can plug my OLD speakers into and use in my usb port, which solves the problem that lead me to wanting to replace my old ones in the first place. My old $20 creative labs speakers sound like gold compared to the samsung pleomax ones I just bought.Since I paid less for my old ones and after two years, they still sound better than these, I can't even say that these are good for being cheapie speakers. They're crappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price & great sound.","review":"Once you get over the product packaging, user manual and labeling; which all had a decidedly foreign feel, the speakers themselves sound great. They sound much better when connected through USB 2.0 than they do on USB 1.0 (although this too is passable). For the price they are a welcomed upgrade to the quality and power of standard laptop speakers. If I had one suggestion, it would be that the speakers come with a standard USB connection, instead of requiring a somewhat clunky adapter. However, for the price, I can understand why they went this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A few things they dont tell you1) the speakers have a standard mini audio connector with a 5mm->USB adapter which is about an inch and a bit in length. This is disappointing because i wanted to plug the speakers into my keyboard or monitor which have USB outlets and this is too large and unsightly for that.2) The cable is a nasty tangly sticky clear wire style very thin wire, im sure youve seen this kind before it is contributes to a wire rats nest very easily.3) Sound quality is poor, overpoweringly strong sound in the high ranges with weak mid-range obviously almost no bass (considering the price and size you would have to expect the bass problem). The simulated 7.1 is a gimmick.If you intend to listen to any music at all, dont buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you money buy Logitech instead","review":"As a computer teacher with a variety of systems to test these speakers, you'd think I could get them to work.... Think again. The systems I tried don't recognize the USB device. Used the disk, tried alternate, and creative ways to install the drivers, downloaded drivers on the PLEOMAX website, tried XP and VISTA ... no luck.Also bought the Logitech S150 USB Speaker Oem which worked right out of the box!

His hero in the book is what he would that he would be if he were still in good standing in the Church. Frankly, I found the writing amateurish, the plot silly and incredible. The book has lots of gore and everything about the book is unsubtle and heavy-handed and I suppose that is why it is published by a publisher few have ever heard of rather than a major publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where did Lucifer come from?","review":"This book is a great history lesson on the origin of Lucifer. The Roman Goddess Diana Lucifera was the illuminator or en-lightener, the Catholic church demonized this pagan Goddess and transformed her into Lucifer. Pan, the god of nature to pagans was used as a model for the devil with horns and cloven hooves. The snake was traditionally a symbol of wisdom in myths. The author does a great job explaining the mythical origins of Lucifer, Satan, and the devil and how they are different personages. Lucifer was an enlightened pagan goddess. Satan was the adversary of the old testament. The devil is the tempter of the New Testament. Read this book for the full story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but opinionated","review":"This book is an interesting read if you are willing to sift through the authors personal opinions, a lot of which goes off on a tangent and at some places there are paragraphs that don't seem to follow on from or have relevance to previous paragraphs. The author seems to dislike men and religion in general and unfortunately she seems to have used this book as a platform to purvey that sentiment rather than telling the story that was intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but Goodie","review":"the seller was timely, the disc in great shape!

I wish there had been - as I thought the book would be set around the 1900s and the only story that was set in that time frame was the first. The first story WAS good. But I had purchased it more for research into the Victorian times in North Dakota and so I was disappointed. I was also disappointed in how little I got for my money. The rest of the stories were only so-so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good material, but too many asides to wade through","review":"The only good part of the book is his enthusiasm and his knack for getting \\"right to it\\" in his life. The idea of not waiting but doing it right now is well illustrated.But most of his pointers are copied from others or are ones that we have all heard before. Very little original.Plus he blends his points with crude and crass examples which detract from the book.He is a good example that you can have money without having class."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want a sports team!","review":"I got this for Christmas from my girlfriend's aunt.

Being that this was a book about Pat Croce by Pat Croce, you would expect some rambling, and there was plenty. Many passages just seemed to step right off the page and into some other place. And that place was not the story of Pat Croce--even if it was the story of Pat Croce. Pat goes into distinct detail on his secrets of success in business and in life, which after you read the book you'll relize its more like common sense. Which is pretty much the point that was being made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book...Very Motivational","review":"This book appeals to everyone, not just sports fans. Personally, I enjoy reading books about optimism and self-help, and this is one of the best that I have read. Croce tells the story of how he became successful while presenting inspirational tid bits along the way. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for an inspirational uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Read","review":"If you pick up this book and expect to get a lot of insight on how to develop personal success or feeling great, this book isn't for you. I picked up this book expecting lots of insight, and saw many shallow, reworked quotes that have been used by other people. I got something out of his customer service commandments, but that was one chapter out of a book. He kept talking about feeling great, sustaining all kinds of energy, but he really never got into the deeper discussion on how he did it.If you pick up this book for a quick laugh and lighthearted reading, then this book is for you. It wasn't a bad book if you want to hear his life story, I just felt it didn't give a lot of in depth information. There were a lot of adolescent anecdotes and funny tales, definitely a book geared at \\"one of the boys\\", since a lot of the humor in the beginning of the book was directed at the male passage through college."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely GREAT!","review":"Before reading the book, I was very skeptical. How could the life of Pat Croce, an NBA owner, influence my life and decisions? Well, I was completely wrong. The book absolutely fires you up to perform your best everyday and pursue your strongest desire. The stories are very inspiring and the entire book forced me to reflect upon what I was doing.

Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Feel Great and You Will Too!","review":"I have followed the work and success of Pat Croce during the past 20 years. His life is the classic American rages to riches story. He is in your face with challenges, no excuses given or taken. His books [also 110 Percent] are inspirational, thought provoking, a good dose of smelling salts in the conformity of America's lackadaisical attitude of today regarding conducting oneself in day to day activities.There are many excellent reminders throughout his book borrowed from other writers/poets.

At page 81, I just gave up and getting to that page took me a couple of months! It is also tiring to constantly read how great Sri K. was - I know that already!There is very little if any information on the discoveries that Sri K. made from studying Sanskrit literature sprinkled all over India. There is also very little information of his life, hardships and realtionships with his chief disciples.Interpretation of the Patanjali Sutras is also done from a very physical Hatha point of view which I have never agreed with - see \\"Bringing the Inner God to Life\\" by Swami Shankarananda Giri or learn Kriya Meditation to see what I mean. The book by Swami Shankarananda Giri is a translation of Patanjali's Sutras and goes much deeper and beyond Hatha Yoga and presents more logical arguments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good overview","review":"I enjoyed the book overall, but found it lacking in someperspectives.

He, along with Billy Porter, is the strongest tenor voice out today. I was overwhelmed with his vocal accrobatics. I was impressed as well with his lyrical phrasing. However, I was a bit dissappointed in his choice of subject matter. Sperm bank donations...(Sweet Charity) I thought it to be a waste of talent on such useless topics. I am a bit surprised that he did not blow up...just from Pride alone. Destoy Me is the best song on the album (assisted by another favorite of mine Rahsaan Patterson). I look forward to future projects from Rachid. I just hope he brings his subject matter down to earth a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachid Makes an Excellent Debut","review":"The album \\"Prototype\\" proves that the entire music industry doesn't rely on formulas. While the album lacks the visual luster of most CD's out now, it more than makes up for it in it's musical content. The production on \\"Prototype\\" is top notch and more than rivals that of most of the more well known production teams in the business. Rachid is a wonderful lyricist who makes you stop in your tracks and pay attention to what he has to say. His voice though is the selling point of \\"Prototype\\". Rachid journeys through R&B, Pop, Rock, Dance, and Indie within the span of a few songs. He moves in and out of moods like a spider, and his moves are just as intentional. Rachid is a young man who knows what he is doing and I look forward to future music from this brilliant artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachid fan","review":"The vocals are some of the most incredible in years....a singers singer... and evidence of how screwed up the record business has become... and also proof that success in the industry has nothing to do with talent....excellent album w/amazing lyrical content & music production as well....Bravo Rachid & thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"From the very amateurish cover to the demo-quality sound, Rachid's debut is an album full of good intentions gone awry. Unfortunately, while he is ambitious, he lacks the hubris to really listen and carefully edit, and he tends to do a little too much showing off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated but good intentioned","review":"One look at the album cover, and I hate to say it, but you can tell the lack of overall quality that went into this album. It feels like a demo, with lousy reverb, cheezy strings. There are hints of inspiration, like the submerged drum'n'bass influence and the awkward string passages, but these seem more forced and show-offy than an integral part of his sound. Amazingly enough, they managed to get a stellar cast of supporting artists, like downtown bassist Greg Cohen, but the overall feel is that of someone who is yet unformed. You'd be better buying Terence Trent D'Arby, Prince, or D'Angelo, for solid soul. Maybe even look for Neneh Cherry's import releases. But Rachid is not yet an important musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"considering that his father is part of Kool&the Gang you would expect some funk.but then again they went pop soft in the 80's.but still you'd expect something in the DNA to rub off.but it doesn't happen.much like Eagle Eye Cherry whose Father is a Legend in Jazz Don Cherry he is at best a 2nd tier artist.that's not much in these lame times of music.his voice&music never rise above run of the mill material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Strathern not enough socrates","review":"Having a great interest in philosophy,I so looked forward to what promised to be(based on the title)a wonderful experience reading this and 3 other books I purchased with similar titles by Mr. Strathern. Sadly,the experience was a terrible disappointment. One learns more about MR.Strathern's personal philosophical preferences and predjudices then about the men in question. Most good writers and teachers of philosophy I have been exposed to do their best to disengage their personal feelings and try to express the philosopher's ideas. Unfortunately,Mr. Strathern can't bring himself to bo that. These books are not worthy of anyone serious in their quest to learn about these great thinkers. I would recommend Stumpf's \\"Socrates to sartre\\" for anyone wanting to know more about these great men in a shorthand format."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good try, but...","review":"I found this book to contain all the necessary information a Differential Equations textbook should have, but it was often presented in such a way as to make it confusing to the reader, if the reader did not already know the subject matter.

I have since seen 5 of his movies and am not impressed. he is not a bad director but he is way below average. this movie is very interesting to see the Frac's opinion on who Jack the Ripper is, and i like it.

I will not waste either my time or those of reviewers with a long diatribe. Unless you want to build a collection of the worst films ever made, then you probably want to stay clear this Jack The Ripoff who lurks the dark corners of your video store.All I can say is that I bought this film because I'm a Klaus Kinski fan: particularly of his work with Herzog. Without knowing it, this catchy title with Klaus Kinski caught my attention in an obscure corner of the video store very much like the infamous killer jumped on his victims from out of the London fog. Next thing I know, I fall victim to the jabbing pain of pathetic scenes and horribly fake special effects.This is quite a stretch from Herzog's work and Klaus Kinski is horribly underused in this film: he barely utters any lines! Everything about this film is cheap and just bad: the plot, the acting, the directing, the filming, everything! Avoid this film at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Most of you will not be able to watch this \\"Jack\\"","review":"With the release of \\"From Hell\\" sure to revive interest in Jack the Ripper, this 1976 effort from exploitation director Jesus \\"Jess\\" Franco is going to get some revived interest. But this \\"Jack the Ripper\\" is only loosely based on the historic murders. Klaus Kinski plays the title character and his \\"true\\" identity of Dr. Orloff. The explanation here is that \\"Jack\\" was abused by his prostitute mother and so he starts butchering prostitutes on the streets of London. Even in a film career based on dishing out the gory, Franco finds a way to go way over the top with this one. This is a movie of stomach turning, savage violence that is rated \\"R\\" only because they did not have NC-17 way back then. You do not want to know anybody who can laugh their way through the gore in this one. The DVD version includes the theatrical trailer (\\"Close your eyes and whisper his name...\\"), photo stills and liner notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanksgiving Dinner","review":"Definitely one for Thanksgiving Dinner - a real turkeyPutting on one side the appalling print and sound quality, and suffering from a dreadful transfer to DVD, the film itself should get an award for awfulness.Inept mis-en-scene, risible dubbed dialogue, incoherent story, and pathetic acting.

However, I was very disappointed. The poor sound quality is excusable - you have to use the material that's available. What's not excusable to me is that only the highlights of the fights are presented. Instead this CD seems to be a promo for Bill Cayton.

With glue and all the exciting items in this barrel, that would add immensely to the fun.

A credit card could open any dead bolt lock.The film has camp value if you pay attention. Oh yes. It is nice to know a street hooker costs the same now as it did in 1974. How do they get by?Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.In an early scene a would-be John calls prostitute posing Christie the N-word when she asks for too much money.

This is the second of Maya Angelou's books that I have read, and I really enjoyed it. It's truthful and honest, but frankly, some parts of the book disgusted me. But, although I don't agree with some of the author's choices, this book is a good read. However, because of some of the content, I would only recommended it to a mature reader.

They make an excellent set.)As a point of reference, I have a science and engineering background. My experience to date in this area has been limited to some minor instrument repair and set-up. I have a fair amount of experience in woodworking. I found this book to be very clear and readable.

It is not a dissappointment, it is a folksy blend of music, with a lot of guitar accompaniment, the tunes are great to listen to, the words have meaning and I am singing along (always a good sign)!!It is still winter here in Wisconsin, so the tunes go right along with this beautiful season.

I followed the care instructions for cleaning and restoring the tack, and after wiping with a damp cloth and going over it with a shoe brush it is the best feeling ball i have ever had. The ball is official size so it can be big for average hands, but what do you expect, Its meant for professionals.Bottom Line: I would not recommend this ball for kids, but if you and the fellas are going out for a weekend game of pick up ball I think you will enjoy playing with this ball. My recommendation for this ball is also for high school and up. Not only for the kid looking to elevate his game with and official size ball but also the \\"Joe the Plumber\\"{LOL} who only plays on the weekend.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate the product sold!!!!","review":"This ball was absolute garbage.

It has a great grip, feels amazingly sturdy and durable. You haven't played with a football until you play with this one. The box also comes with care instructions on how to bring back the tackiness, if lost. This football is so high quality, that feels like a collectible, instead of an item you play with. Every football fan, collector and enthusiast should get this football, and at $58 it's a steal! And yes, the football feels kinda \\"hard\\", but what do you expect?

Rod's version do them justice, though the words may differ. Overall a great deal and a great collection!

He claims he'll clear their names if they steal something from the Company that's very important to them. While Sarah is really alive and joins Michael's team.That's only the beginning of the season. There's many twists and turns as the season goes on. This last season certainly doesn't disappoint and it's probably the best next to season 1. The season was packed with action and drama. The series finale was one of the more satisfying ones to any show. The only thing that bugged me a little was the very end but I can't really say it didn't work. It's just not how I preferred to see it end."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this show---sad its over.","review":"i've been watching this from the beginning and its so sad to see it over but it was coming. The only reason i'll be buying the dvd is so I can see the two extra episodes. I mean them just showing Michael's cemetary plot is just insane especially since i thought lincoln wouldn't make it to the end. I'm not the only who watched it to see michael and sara end up together with their child then four years later and no more michael. I'm just hoping these two straight to dvd episodes can show me more than the finale on tv.

I stuck with this show and then was repayed for my loyalty by the writers killing off the main character, Michael. Fans are irrate and the writers did not have to go this route. I won't be able to watch the previous seasons, nor will I recommend them to anyone, because what's the point. Michael, the good guy, that deserved his life back, gets it taken away.

I would say season one was the best but season 4 was a close second. Follow by season 2 and season 3 even though that was a short season do to the writers strike. There were so many twist and turns i was on the edge of my seat all season. I couldn't wait to watch another episode. The great thing about watching a tv series on dvd. You don't have to wait a whole week to see what happens next. The writing and acting were top notch. If your a fan of 24 like myself then you will love Prison Break!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see why it was cancelled","review":"The first two seasons of this show were amazing, never dissapointed, and the characters were rich, motivated, and unique. Watching season 4 makes me want to watch season one and two again. These are not the same characters. The writing is hokey, and awful. There is no driving force, and too many hokey \\"aha!\\" suprise moments. The characters seem to be written wrong deliberately. T-Bag pronounces a word wrong, and is corrected (would never happen), Sucre has a man crush on Bellick, and Bellick is a smarmy good guy. No way. I know they had to hurry up and end it since they probably knew they were cancelled halfway through the season, but they really screwed it up. Just buy the first two seasons (possibly the third), and pretend like the end of that season is the end of the show. You will be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best TV Shows EVER!","review":"Prison Break was a full-circle of entertainment show: suspenseful, dramatic, humorous and action-packed. The characters exuded personalities which could charm you, endear you, excite you or repel you. We will greatly miss the sparks between the characters, the emotions they shared and getting to know their stories as they evolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Break","review":"While no series lives up to the original, the fourth has a lot going for it. The introduction of Lincoln and Michael's mother into the story is a great twist. I watched this series almost in one sitting and Mrs Schoefield is quite a piece of work. The story heats up several notches and the death tally is high. For anyone who has followed the first three series this is must-see viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"At first I did not like it much but now, I love it!","review":"I got the other three season in hard core packs that looked very nice.

I don't get involved in a lot of tv shows but I have been watching Prisonbreak for 4 years and have loved every minute of it. I never got tired of the crazy plot twists or mindgames. I love how they ended the series even though I am going to miss it terribly. I own seasons 1,2 and 3 and have pre-ordered season 4. I don't agree with the negative comments at all. I think the writers did a great service to the die-hard fans who deserved a good, strong ending that doesn't leave us hanging. The devoted fans who have followed from the beginning are proud of this show and the writers and directors and actors who gave so much entertainment to our Monday nights (and Friday night toward the end).

A must for any punk fan and one you'll never get tired of."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little older.","review":"This is certainly an excellent album. Some people out there may critisize the change in style, as in the music being not quite so rough, but I think it's just a sign of the growth of the particular artists growth. Ness has never been frightened of allowing his music to age with him, and it shows in his work. It just gets better with age. I can't say I like any Social Distortion album better than another, but this is more than worth the purchase. I've seen a few bad reviews for it, but I got the impression that most of the people who wrote those were very young just from the style of writing, and it seems as if the young have a hard time appreciating an artists growth and ability to mature, they just want the same thing over and over again. Bottom line, this album is wonderful, sure there's a song or two that could've been a little better, but they were still great songs. If you're a fan of Social Distortion then this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FIRST SOCIAL DISTORTON ALBUM I EVER BOUGHT, & ITS GREAT","review":"I've known about Social Distortion for years - This is the first album of theirs ive bought though.. I wanted to look more into SD after seeing Pearl Jam's lead guitarist, Mike McCready, praising them as one of his favorite bands & always wearing their shirts during concert'Highway 101' is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard, & alone gives the album 5 starsIve always admired bands like Pearl Jam; Pixies; Radiohead; Tool, etc.. that rely more on word of mouth to get more fans than promotion - & Social Distortion is incredible for doing this longer than any of those bands... & after all these years, still getting new fans such as myselfIf my opinion doesnt get you to buy this album... notice the average 5 star rating this album has, thats very rare on amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surreal Iconic Anthems!!!","review":"I'm 29, an old schooler(bloodstains79,you have one dead as hell soul, man), and a sucker for music about damagedpasts and tortured souls...And Ness always delivers! These slabs of down n'out punk rock shaken in a whiskey sour tumbler cut right to the \\"Heart of the matter\\" and I often think of my new-school soldiers and how fresh their wounds and battle scars are...and more often than not...social D is chimin' away in the background...all that needs to be said is that this album moves me to tears...and any peice of music that accomplishes that task is f**kin' priceless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anti Climactic","review":"I have to say first of all that I am a true blue SD fan, but this album left me a little unfulfilled. Don't get me wrong...they still rock. Mike Ness should focus on his solo career and stick to singing from heart. P.S. We'll miss you Johnny Maurer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Is there anything more to say about Social D? Being a little \\"older\\" & growing up in SoCal - this band was a fundamental part of my teenage angst years. Of course there were so many essential \\"old-school\\" punk bands - but for some reason you just always knew Social D would be around for the long haul. This band is phenomenal all the way around. Not many bands can sound BETTER live than they do on their recordings. Social D is one of the few and undeniably one of the best. This album shows they have no sign of slowing down - and thank you for that!!! Well, I know there are a lot more talented writers/reviewers out there - I just had to put in my twenty-seven cents and praise one of the greatest most influential bands of all time. Here's to you - and thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I've been a fan of Social D for many, many years. They have consistently been one of the best live acts I've seen, and I've probably seen them 25 times. Unfortunately during their last concert at Avalon in Hollywood, not only did their new material not measure up but I had to listen to Mike Ness' political commentary. I'll never ask President Bush to sing, and I am not interested in having someone with a high school education and no understanding of economics or foreign policy impart his ignorant viewpoint when I'm paying to be entertained. To all \\"politically minded\\" musicians: \\"SHUT UP AND SING!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have given up years ago!","review":"Social Distortion is, was and always will be great in concert, but the music on this album does not reflect that at all. It is nothing but rewritten old songs from past albums, and they are not as good. Mike Ness is a genius, so why does he put out such horrible music for his fans to waste thier money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back, Social D!","review":"As a testimonial to how good this album is, there are now 8 reviews on Amazon for this album - in its first day of release! I have listened through the album 2x and can assert you will not be disappointed. The lyrics are a little more thoughtful and pensive than Mike Ness and company's previous offerings, but I think this just underscores the evolution of the band. It's been 8 long years, but fans of Social, it has been worth the wait. The first two songs on the album are fantasic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but.....","review":"First off let me say that I like this album, and am glad to own it. I mean \\"Reach for the Sky\\" and \\"Highway 101\\" are as good as it gets! The only downside is how much the bands music has changed since the last album. Much of the aggression in Social D is long gone now which has Mike Ness writing some slower, more heart felt songs. But what can I say the guy isn't a 20-year old junkie anymore. and if you're a long time fan like me you're probably in a different mind set now then you were when you first heard \\"Mass Hysteria\\" right? But again a great album. Gave it 4 stars because the more catchy songs just weren't doing it for me. Still recommend it but its one for fans. If you're new to Social D check out the self-titled album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I have been listening to Social D since the 80s and I have always been impressed with their ability to maintain their own style while constantly tinkering with their sound. From the pure punk roots, to the country/rockabilly sound, and into pure wall of noise rock, Mike Ness and crew have always stood out as one of the all time great bands and probably my personal favorite (along with the Cramps.) Sex, Love and Rock and Roll, rumored to be their last album stands out as a strong, solid, and mature work. The hards edges in the music has softened, but the vocals make up for that. Mike Ness has again opened up his heart and soul and made an album which truly distills what it means to grow from young street punk to an older and wiser performer. I hope this is not the last album from Social D, but if it is, I can accept this as being their final work. If your a Social D fan, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Social D. Delivers Year's Best","review":"Perhaps the best release of the year, Mike Ness and the band deliver a blistering collection of amped up rock-n-roll which stays true to the incredibly solid legacy of Social Distortion.From track 1 thru track 10, as with any Social D. record, there is no fluff here....Ness displays another side in his lyrics this time around, yet amazingly manages to perhaps eclipse the power of SxDx's last studio record, White Light White Heat White Trash with this latest offering. It's a tough call.Rock and Roll of this caliber is a finite resource in an industry dominated by whiney pop poser punk, yet to call Social D. simply a punk band, is almost a diservice to them. These guys are perhaps the greatest American Rock-n-Roll band of today, with all the grit, energy and pedal to the medal tempo intact.Worth noting too is Charlie's amazing drumming on this record which propels the songs like a locomotive blasting through your living room.The 8 year wait for this record was worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"all time favorite social distortion album","review":"I had this album before but I lost it. Since this is my all time favorite Social Distortion album I just had to get it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best work since \\"Somewhere between heaven and hell\\"","review":"This album is by far the best work Social Distortion has put out since the early '90's. It has moved on from the rough and tough origins of early Mike Ness and it fits. Mike's not in his mid 20's anymore and this album shows it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Wait","review":"I just downloaded the new Social Distortion CD and I cannot wait to buy it when it comes out next week.

In fact, we almost didn't watch that version at all- but I am so glad we did! While I love the b&w seeing it in color made it so that you noticed things that didn't show up in the b&w version. Especially people's faces that were slightly behind the person in front. It made many of the other characters shine more and thereby deepened the film. I highly recommend purchasing this set- we loved not having to wait till Christmas Eve for it to be broadcast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but definitely a beauty!","review":"I had forgotten how beautiful this film is. Definitely deserves to be a classic. Highly suggest you make it a Christmas tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad :-)","review":"The story is about service to others in a world where people are commonly tempted or bullied into passivity. George Bailey though is unafraid, curious, an activist, and is drawn to see and get involved with everything in the wide world. It's just that no one can replace his services in Bedford Falls, and he feels his duty is there. The story builds to the moral that George's investment in his native town pays off well for him as well as for others -- an early illustration of the advice to \\"Think globally, act locally.\\"The story is told in microcosm in the scene where George's mother sends him to Mary Hatch's house. This is one of several scenes where George's frustration seethes and boils over, but it's here that he knows it's finally done for keeps. More surely than the angel Clarence Oddbody, Mary Hatch represents salvation in this funny, terrible, iconic moment. James Stewart and Donna Reed are splendid."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if I were never born?","review":"Have you ever had the thought that things would be better if you were never born ? Well, I have and I'm sure many others have had the thought too. This heart warming movie with Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed is one of my four must see movies for the Holidays and my most favorite of all. You have-to love the children and Clarence too. The chemistry between the lead characters is magic and Donna Reed is a knockout. This Holiday movie is so good it'll send you to the moon. My four must see holiday movies are... It's a Wonderful Life - A Christmas Carol w/Alastair Sims - A Bishops Wife w/Carey Grant - and A Miracle on 34th St w/Natalie Wood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"Haven't had time to watch it this season, but it one of our favorites to make it a good Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel good movie","review":"I had heard great things about this movie and had never seen it.

Instead of being stuck in a second rate savings and loan with a partner too senile or stupid to hold onto $8000, he might have been a bank president in a big city.Instead of tearing his guts out helping ingrates, he could have been helping himself to a glass of properly aged scotch, given to him by someone in the banking industry who appreciated his abilities.And what about Potter? If he'd gone to jail, I might have said the movie had a happy ending.Potter had hopes and dreams, too, how would dullsville have changed into Potterville just by removing the Jimmy Stewart character?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"This is the story of an ambitious young man with dreams of leaving his small town, but due to circumstances beyond his control, has to stay there the rest of his life. His savings and loan has to constantly help out the poor inhabitants, who seem incapable of either earning or saving money. At the first sign of financial trouble, all the dear friends that George has helped out demand their money back. George is such a poor businessman that at the prospect of missing ONE payment to Potter his business will go backrupt and he is prepared to kill himself. Then a angel shows up and convinces George that his miserable life has at least made OTHERS happy.In a cruel irony, George is forced to accept hand-outs from the townsfolk he helped out.

This is a lousy movie!","review":"This movie never won any awards. It was so bad that the studio could hardly give it away when they first puit it on tape, then they let it be colorized just so they could sell SOME copies of it, and suddenly the big war cry from the Hollywood liberals was -- \\"OOH! Save a classic black and white film!\\" Baloney! No one liked this movie when it was made. No one liked it the 1950s. No one liked it in the 1960s. No one liked it in the 1970s. No one liked it in the 1980s, then SUDDENLY! -- it's an American classic. NOT!

If you are ever depressed an you think life is getting to you, a good dose of Frank Capra's classic will adjust your attitude.

EVERY major character is developed, you enter the story, HATE Mr. Potter when he tries to get a good guy arrested, etc. Gritty enough to have a near suicide, touching enough to be a great Christmas movie emphasizing importance of family and friends.I try to go with BluRay every time with a good screen and sound, whether old or new movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Love It!","review":"I finally have my own original copy.

But for some reason I waited 20 years since it's video release to watch this movie. Back in the 1980's and 1990's it flooded the tv channels at Christmas time. All my friends watched it and said it was great. As a Christmas treat I decided this was the year to see it. What a let down. First of all it was about a half hour too long. Jimmy Stewart's character was a born loser. Everything bad happened to him from the beginning. He also passed up opportunities to better himself. He ignored the prettiest gal in the movie (Gloria Graham) for a plain Jane (Donna Reed). To me, Lionel Barrymore's was the best character in the movie and he certainly gave the best acting performance. This was a big Frank Capra disappointment. With the length of the movie and the failings of the George Bailey character, when he was on the bridge near the end I was yellinh \\"JUMP JUMP JUMP\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get it to work","review":"Each time I started the movie, it would run for a minute or two and then stop.

Results of this process were then at best mediocre. No true reds (they often look brown), and an overabundance of pastels and broad-brush tinting made this one of the color-enhanced movies that stigmatized the process, perhaps for all time.A 2007PARAMOUNT DVD releaseoffers both a b&w; and a reworked colorized edition, and is recommended. If a VHS is desired, stick with a major studio version, as all budget labels dubbed their tapes at slower speeds. Anything other than SP mode gives diminished video sharpness (and sometimes tracking problems)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"As a lover of classic films, this one tops them all.I remember watching this as a child every Christmas and the tradition continued into my adulthood that I now share with my husband.A movie to really make you think and appreciate all that surrounds you - a fantastic \\"glad to be alive\\" message that is as powerful today as it was in 1947.I believe everyone should at least see it once....yes, it's an older movie and not quite up to par with what is produced today (with all the special effects and fast paced story lines, etc..), but it is worth the time in everyone's busy schedule to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Wonderful Life","review":"This is one of the most beloved movies in film history.

For once, he becomes depressed and is granted a wish to never have been born; he returns to his town and is shown how many lives would be impacted if he never existed.If you've never seen the movie, you'll have to watch it yourself to see the ending...which is really heartwarming.

Though often and incorrectly referred to as only a Christmas movie - it is that but so much more! - IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE brings to life a simpler time in American life and culture, the best of which we're always trying to get back to.One thing that really amazes me is that the hero of the movie, George Bailey, was not allowed to serve in World War II, because he was 4-F, a status that drove some men to suicide! And here it is, 1946, right after the end of WWII, and our protagonist and hero is 4-F! I often wonder what that did to the morale of many of the 4-F men who desperately wanted to serve.For many of us who live in small town America, there is an even greater connection and appreciation for Bedford Falls and its inhabitants. No, George you can't leave that crummy old town. You need it as much as it needs you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Holiday Favorite","review":"My children grew up with this movie, now my grandchildren will have this among their Christmas favorites.....How could you not love Frank Capra's story telling., not to mention Jimmy Stewart , who makes this movie come alive for all generations..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The film that will change your perception of life!","review":"This film is the reason that I am still single so my sister says! I am looking for George Bailey and will no doubt never find him. I have seen this movie somewhere in the vacinity of 80 times and never fail to be moved by it. George is a simple man with great expectations yet he never gets where he wants to - isn't that how it often is in real life? But George has the chance to see what life would have been like for others had he not been born. It really makes you think that maybe you have touched someone's life and made it a little better in some way. That is a nice thought. George is the richest man in the county because no man is a failure who has friends!

Searching on Amazon and finding a few different versions, I ran accross this nice double-disc version that not only contained an updated color version, but the original black-and-white as well. The item came rather quickly in the mail, in great protective packaging, and my wife's eyes lit up once she had opened it! And to put the cherry on top of the sundae, it came with a little collectors Christmas ornament, which my wife loves to collect during the season. The version was literally \\"the whole package\\" for any fan of the movie! It even includes original trailers and behind the scenes footage.

For $9.99 I expected a lot more. The audio was fine, but to not be able to SEE the movie in detail is a big deal to me.I also don't like that all of the reviews for this are mixed, so it's impossible for me to see which reviews are for the \\"instant watch\\" version as opposed to the DVD or Blu Ray versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WIDESCREEN!!!!! SAME DISC'S!!!!!","review":"Amazon has mislabeled this particular \\"Two Disc Collector's Gift Set and Limited Edition Ornament\\" DVD of It's a Wonderful Life, as presented in Widescreen in the stats section. IT IS NOT. I own the previously released Collector's Two Disc set (full screen), which looks fantastic by the way, and this is the SAME EXACT set. I bought this thinking it was even newer and was presented in Widescreen, as it said it was, but was duped. You are only paying more for a flimsy plastic package that will just be thrwon away anyway and a cheap little bell on a thin red ribbon. NOT worth the extra money at all. SO, the only difference to this one is fancy packaging and a bell. DO NOT buy this if you are looking for a Widescreen presentation because it is NOT! Didn't open the DVD at all because when I got it, it even says \\"full screen\\" on the bottom of the packaging. At least I have a gift for next Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not colorized after all....","review":"As additional information about this release became available after I wrote my initial review, I have decided to go back and revise my comments as follows: the DVD is in B&W after all. And that's as it SHOULD be. Those complaining that the movie on this disc was not colorized probably prefer full-frame DVDs over properly letterboxed ones too. So, just so we're all clear here: this 'new' DVD is basically the same as the 'old' DVD. It has new color cover art which is very misleading, and for that reason I will retain my one-star rating. The film itself, of course, gets five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advertising","review":"The film rates a 5. The anniversary edition rates a 5. The packaging rates a 0. At the beginning of this dvd is a preview for a movie. You can't remove it, you can't skip over it. All you can do is mute and endure. I resent having to pay for advertising when all I wanted was [It's]a Wonderful Life."},{"rating":"1","title":"There they milk us again!!!","review":"One movie on which the studio will milk the fans the world over for as many times as they can! Alright, I held back buying the 60th Anniversary edition released last year thinking there will be a definite release of this gem. When this double-disc release was announced, I was very hopeful that at least now after countless releases, this will be the definitive edition of the film but man, they proved me wrong again. Rather than working on the new release, they just repackaged the 60th Anniversary edition alongwith another disc featuring the colorised version of the film. No new extras or commentaries here, so in case, just like me, if you were looking forward to own a definitive release of this wonderful film, looks like you may have to wait a little longer. Maybe for a few more years till the publishing house milks every drop from the fans.A billion stars for the film and no stars for this so called \\"2-disc collectors edition\\" and the studio releasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic...","review":"This is an old story of \\"be careful what you wish, for because you just might get it.\\" Set during Christmas-time, George Bailey gets into a little financial trouble and wishes he had never been born and it actually happens. Then a guardian angel named Clarence rescues George after he jumps into the water and shows him that his life is worth living. Somehow, when George returns back to the real world, he recieves a lot of monetary help from the town, who somehow have been impacted by him. In the end, it's a picturesque moment, as we see George and his family in the Christmas spirit. \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" will definately make you a little teary-eyed (just a little). With great acting by James Stewart and Donna Reed, this movie will forever stand as a black & white classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retrospective of perspective","review":"A beautiful story, well told through the vision of Frank Capra. It is the story of a very typical middle-class man. He lives in the future dreaming of what his life will be, not seeing what it is. He lives for when life will become his dream. Then he is given a rare gift---a chance to see the truth of his life through the open and loving heart of his guardian angel. He then begins to understand that his true life was what was going on while waiting for his life to start. And, he gets to do this when there is still a chance to change. We all have this watershed event, albeit not all of us see it. The truth is always right in front of us, but it is very scary to see. So, like George Bailey we dream about what it should be and wait for that to happen. George opens himself to the truth and finds his true love and happiness. Would that we could all have such a wonderful life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"This really makes our Christmas merry! I liked the value for this 2-disc set.

I was interested in this release because the colorized version was the only remastered version I knew of.

It never grows old to see Jimmy Stewart realizing that being rich sometimes has very little to do with how much is in your bank account and more to do with how many friends you have. Get the hot chocolate out, cuddle up with your sweetie, build a roaring fire in the fireplace and put the DVD in the machine and remember that your life does matter in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anybody Got a Hankerchief?","review":"This is my favourite Christmas movie of all time.

That was a mortal sin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!","review":"This is by far my favorite movie of all time. George Bailey is so real. I have been that man.

I had been looking for a DVD copy of that colorized version for awhile, which was fruitless until I did a new search right after Christmas 2007. That's when I found this one!

Love the restorations!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best Christmas Video","review":"It is a Christmas tradition to watch this movie every year. The Blu-ray edition came with both the original B/W version and the colorized version. I never liked the colorized version because the color was never very good, especially in the shadows, but showing the colorized version to my sister and her husband, I found out that they fixed to color on the movie and it looks pretty much like it was filmed in color.

This is the best colorized version I have ever seen. Normally the mouth is not colorized or what is already shown as black or white are not coloriozed and detract from the movie, because all that I would notice is what was not coloriozed or coloriozed poorly.

Much as many people would like, you can not re-write the past. I think this is a great movie, with an awesome lesson.

It's too bad they invested in appealing packaging instead of sensible interface design.I was required by the program to change my screen resolution. This is odd because most programmers have little trouble integrating that into code. Well, this is a flash-based program, so I guess we can t expect that level of sophistication.The animations are crude. It's without exaggeration to say that most people can hand draw better than this.The whole product amounts to little more than a mishmash of other programs thrown together by people more interested in selling than educating.

It comes across as giving the pilot all these tips and formula&#65533;s but falls way short on the task. First off, the typeset fills only half the page making the book in reality about 25 pages. It goes on to show you basic math found in any private pilot instruction guide. FH/C temp conversion, subtracting military time, and RVR which is all the same as in the NOS/Jep charts and Ops manuals for the plane you fly. The second half of the book has the times tables, subtraction tables, and division tables. He put fuel dump calculations in along with wet runway computations, this is not only a waste for pilots flying anything short of a jet, but worthless due to FMS and EFIS on bigger airplanes not to mention the F/E sitting sideways behind the captain. In short the book is outdated. finding reciprocals, compass turns to a heading, and ANDS are all in the flight manuals. In short this book fails to teach much. It is not worth the [price] that is for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Interview Prep","review":"This book covers all the neat little tricks to getting the job done quickly and right.

It is the perfect book for those in the academic world that do not spend their working life in the cockpit. Furthermore, for the price of the book, the content is very limited.

Like the newly releasedDefiance, this movie shows the Jews fighting back and that is an important part of the whole story.Escape From Sobibor will leave you both breathless and sickened at the same time.

They are very poorly made and mere onedimensional. Also, like in an early Western one is to tell good from bad in a second. The good (or noble) people are blonde, tall, muscular, intelligent, blue-eyed and strong willed. The bad ones are dark, small, fat or skinny, dumb and dark-eyed. This, pardon me if it is not so, looks to me (a concerned Austrian)like Nazi- ideology and some kind of Übermensch- fantasy. It reminds me of the ideal Aryan: blonde, blue-eyed, tall and muscular.

What it didnt have was decent writing. This is a cautionary tale for writers and directors that have no clear vision for what the film should be. It was all over the place, unable to commit to being a dark comedy, a drama, or an action flick. It was utterly disappointing. The only thing that made it watchable were great performances by Jude Law and Forest Whitaker. They obviously had the budget to create a good film; the sets were darkly atmospheric, they had an A list cast, etc, but they couldnt make it work. It reminded me of Robocop, in that they tried to blend dark comedy with action and drama in a corporate-run future society, but where that movie committed to a premise and worked, this one failed.

Sadly, his best friend - turned - killer is just a foil for the protagonist, and watching him fall out of love with his bestie is agony. For God's sake, if you're making an action movie, get the betrayal over with quick and move on to the retribution.

In a distant future, everyone can get a second chance in life by having an artificial organ put in their body. But for such high technology lease on life, there is a steep price. Most people cannot afford it. They fall behind in their payments for the surgery and that is where our main character's repo men come into play. These men will kill if necessary in order to retrieve organs which can then be recycled to the next patient, or shall I say a victim.Film has many twists and moves, but Marx brothers rumble between two main characters played for Forrest Whitaker and Jude Law goes over the top at times. I watched unedited version of this film and some of the scenes of organ retrievement are quite graphic and perhaps even unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget's Review","review":"I really liked this movie.

This could have been a good film. The concept and acting are good, it just had very poor writting and editing. I am not squimish but this was gross in a totally unnecassary way, it actually detracted from the movie. The character development was poor, you never understood why he cared for her, why she was special or why he was so trapped into the relationship with his best friend. I really was truely horrible and you should stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Money and Talent","review":"This movie isn't worth buying, let alone renting. The concept is asinine and it is a liberal screed that tries to portray the horrors of private medical care, as if public care doesn't already do the same and worse. Rather than get into a debate over rationing of medical care (every system does so, public & private alike), this violent and pointless film comes down on private medical care with bad guys (the greedy corporation) that are so ridiculous that it was a joke.A more realistic future would be one where the government was led by a committee (we'll call it the Berwick Committee instead of the \\"Union\\") that decided who lived and who died, and what procedures would be covered by government-provided coverage that you were required to pay into. Of course the Berwick Committee would have much better coverage and wouldn't have to worry about the same coverage and life and death issues as the rest of society. What a movie that would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhmmm...where they do that at?","review":"OMG this movie was unbearably horrid. I was so distracted while watching this. Distracted by Forrest Whitaker's wandering/lazy eye as well as Jude Laws disappearing hairline. And believe me that baby's hairline was doing some mad disappearing acts. He looks like the white version of Peabo Bryson round about the head. But as for the film all I can say is no Ma'am!! Did not want and/or need this hot baked hard boiled mess of a film. The acting was weak, plot was all over the place and they could have kept the bad dialog and lighting to themselves.

His past is intresting and would make for a great story,the same goes for Angel but I just didnt feel any sparks between the two main characters besides having lots of sex. It was all together boring, ummemorable, and bland. Really just to reiterate.. The book had potential but lost it from the very begining with a lukewarm love connection, a very boring mystery, and nothing much else going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't work","review":"I love Patti Berg. This story is different from her others, but that's okay. Writers should try new styles and plots. This one is darker and hotter than Ms. Berg's other books.But this one doesn't work. The story and the hero's background are VERY dark. To lighten this up and add humor, Ms. Berg adds a flakey heroine who wears almost no clothing and lots of hot sex.It doesn't work. Putting fluff on top of a dark plot doesn't lighten the plot. It's like putting whipped cream on meatloaf. That doesn't turn it into dessert, just makes it more obvious they don't fit.

The description of harbors is little changed from a 1978 printing but having visited some of these harbors in 2004, I found the names, phone numbers and parts of the onshore facilities' descriptions totally out of date.

The few black & white photos in the book look dated.Sentences like \\"The latest miracle machine is GPS.

It was extremely interesting and informative and even entertaining at times. There were times though that I just couldn't watch with some of the footage of animals being treated so cruelly that I could never have imagined it could be so bad. I don't know how anyone can support eating animal products after seeing how horrendously the animals are treated. Makes some serial killers look like good guys.

It follows three average Americans from different walks of life; a college student, a bachelor, and a single working mother, for six weeks of trying a vegan diet. It covers a lot of different aspects, health, social, and enviromental issues. I also like that it covers fish, which a lot of people don't think is bad, and a lot of so-called \\"vegetarians\\" continue to eat. I know when I first went vegetarian, I had to phase different items out of my diet, I just couldn't completely switch overnight, and fish was the last thing I gave up.I also like the message at the end that even if you don't continue eating a completely vegan diet that you can still do something rather then nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"They forgot that great humanitarian and vegetarian ...","review":"Adolph Hitler.

This movie was a great film that made me realize again why I choose to be vegan. I liked how not only were they changing their diet, but they were educated on the food business in America - factory farms and meat industry. Made me sad to know that innocent animals are mistreated and people in society are ignorant of it all. I loved how they documented the three persons' improvements and their struggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"i've been vegucated","review":"rather entertaining and informative during the beginning. the true intention of the movie, divide and conquer, soon reveals itself. it lost me at global warming and cattle burps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Described","review":"I was intrigued by this film thinking that it would be about \\"normal\\" people making the transition to veganism. How they adjusted to the food? What they found to be good substitutes? How they felt, etc. etc.Instead I got a lot of stories/videos about how animals are harmed in the processing of food. It wasn't helpful at all.Ironically, the film starts by trying to dispel the stereotype of vegans....however, this film just perpetuates it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less health conscious and more anti meat","review":"I was expecting to watch a documentary about the benefits of a vegan lifestyle and instead found myself watching a documentary concentrating on the inhumanity of producing meat products. I was looking for the former and not the latter. Their examples of meat production included a slaughterhouse from 1979, so I couldn't take the film seriously. While I doubt producing meat \\"protein\\" products is an overly humane process, I also seriously doubt the examples provided in this film are representative of the norm.Unfortunately, I have to rate this film low. If they had spent more time on how a vegan lifestyle is healthier over how eating meat is inhumane, I would have rated this higher and perhaps reduced my meat intake. I'm not at the end of my investigation, but this film provided me very little insight to influence my opinions of eating meat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information, gruesome footage","review":"I have been a vegetarian since I was five years old, and an on-again-off-again vegan since I was thirteen. You would think that by now I would know all I need to know, but I did learn a few things from this documentary. Unfortunately, I think it was a bit unbalanced, leaning a tad too much towards slaughterhouses and not quite enough on health and environmental factors. To me, veganism is a lifestyle--not just a diet--and therefore it is a choice based on ethics. Still, it is hard for me to watch such graphic imagery. And if I feel as though I'm being accused of something, how must the target audience (omnis) feel? You catch more flies with agave than with vinegar."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good film for vegan start ups","review":"Anyone interested in becoming a vegan should watch this film.

I am a little bit petrified after watching the clip of the pigs balls being pulled off by some dudes fingers. They really didn't need to include the extremely graphic content, as this may have triggered viewers to turn off at that point.Also they push GMO-laden processed food products too much.

It mundanely plays the animal-cruelty card and promotes meat and dairy products as major health hazards; so what else is new? Typical of homemade documentaries, it's childishly manipulative and simpleminded in its intention. The cutesy-poo director does a lot of yammering that leads to bigger questions about population control and global industrialization, which are neglected with convenient conviction. Are people really dying off too quickly in the new millenium? Is there any evidence that vegans are more sympathetic or less cruel than carnivorous consumers? Is being a vegan more rational than not? Is vegan recruiting stupid?In the end, moderation in all things seems to be the simple solution. You won't be missing too much if you want to pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"i understand this is someone trying to educate people on their own personal beliefs. all the animal cruelty stuff is sad and really horrible to think about. but some of the messages in the film are ridiculous. for example, it tries to draw some correlation between eating vegan and going to the gym, as if veggie people work out & meat eaters don't? these things are not related. also, it acts like the only way to eat meat is hamburgers and hot dogs and other highly-processed, deep-fried, high-fat preparations... as if eating meat automatically means you only eat the worst kind of foods. once it started exploring the Bible as a resource, i starting tuning out. oh -- and suggesting that the farting of farm animals is contributing to the destruction of the environment? that's where i turned it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"As other reviews have said, it was a very preachy documentary. I was expecting more of a trials and tribulations of people adjusting to a new diet, it was clearly a conversion film. On a personal note, having grown up on a small farm, growing vegetables and raising animals for slaughter, I hate how they use the simple ignorance of the fact that many animals are raised to be slaughtered as a reason to convert. Please take the information on organic farming with a grain of salt too, there is a good deal of misinformation spread in that section of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called Veganicated.","review":"So yes, they do follow these people on their vegan diet, which is better than eating poor animals. But they were not Vegecated. When did they teach them to eat a HEALTHY diet including mostly plants? You can eat french fries, potato chips, fried zucchini and vegan chocolate, but you sure aren't healthy. I think the emphasis should have been put on truly Vegecating (like Forks over knives or Fat, Sick & nearly dead). Teach them to eat VEGETABLES and FRUITS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.

For those who are deeply bothered by images of animals being tortured and killed like I am, please know that you may have to look away several times during this film.

The eat healthy parts are good at showing the benefits, not necessarily the drawbacks. The animal rights parts drops quickly in to calling people on the phone and asking deep questions such as \\"do the chicks get to see their mothers? (should have edit that one out).As mentioned in previous reviews, you really need two movies. One should be on the eat healthier, which could more seriously discuss the challenges of eating Vegan (besides taste). The other should be on animal farm practices, with responsible questions about the challenges of moving to that system.Eat healthy and exercise. And don't get hit by a bus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought this movie was going to be on the level of Forks over Knives but this one wasn't even close. To summarize a girl in college attempts to convert you and the individuals in the movie to become vegans. That's pretty much it. The film gets worse as it attempts demonize the animal based farming industry. It does so by taking some of the bad things that a very few have done and presenting it as the standard in the industry.The documentary is very bias, and does a poor job of presenting the positives of eating plant based diet. If you want to become Vegucated watch Forks over Knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not vegucate.","review":"I was hoping to learn about how to be a vegan, the nutritional and health benefits.

There are several scenes that are difficult to watch. I wish the film had more information about the various nutrients that different fruits and vegetables provide. There is also a bit of bad advice given in this film; just because oreos and dunkin heins frosting are vegan products does not mean they are healthy.

But in the first week of their \\"experiment,\\" virtually the first thing the subjects did was go to a supermarket and start fawning over all their animal-free, supposedly \\"vegan\\" junk food options like Oreos, and the protagonist made no effort to derail this gluttonous senselessness.

I thought it was overall a well put-together documentary with a good message. Although I do think animal cruelty is an important factor in veganism, I wish the film maker would've focused a little more on hard data and statistics associated with a plant based diet and how it benefits overall health and the environment.

And, you are right, no citation of sources! Then, to bash small farming, organic practices and everything else in between! Has she visited CSAs who raise livestock for the farmers markets? No! Has she researched modern livestock handling in the newer processing facilities? No. Has she read/researched Dr. Temple Grandin regarding humane livestock handling? No. If this was a college project I would grade it F. I am not naive and understand that there occurs some inhumane practices but to paint all of the industry as cruel is dishonest to say the least.

I don't buy the argument that eating fake meat is a gateway to no meat.At this point I turned off the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"somewhat informative, but hugely one sided. it was more about animal rights than healthful eating. maybe duncan hines frosting is \\"vegan\\" because it contains no animal products, but it's loaded with other garbage that should be left on the shelf. there's absolutely nothing healthy about it. oreos? really? this was not vegucational. it made me sad about our modern farming practices, but didn't inspire much into vegan practices. if you're interested in learning about food and how it actually affects your body, start with reading the omnivore's dilemma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vegetarian, but not for this movie","review":"While I agree with most of the ideas in this film, I think the way the ideas were conveyed contribute to the bad rap that my type of lifestyle gets.Appealing to logic is always a higher road than appealing to emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"You only fail if you never try","review":"I am a vegan - this film is a good portrayal of what social pressure people undergo, and the discrimination, when they attempt a vegan lifestyle. Do it for yourself, do it for your health, and take no stock in the criticism of others. Small minds, after all. Its not easy to change, but people seem to think it has to be all or nothing - and that's bunk. Start slow, pace yourself, set goals if you must - its almost impossible for a carnivore to go vegan overnight. I wish the film had stressed that the transition doesn't have to be done cold turkey - if people just start making better choices and work their way towards vegan, then that is positive. If I had a dollar for every time someone said to me \\"I can't live without cheese\\"... well, way back when once upon a time, I had said the same thing. YES - you CAN live without cheese, and you will live longer and better for not eating animal products... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and compelling","review":"I loved this documentary- It was so interesting to see how each person developed and grew as they gained more information about what truly goes into our food and how going vegan can help. I liked how the people involved were real and approachable. This film shows so many aspects of how making simple changes in our eating habits can have huge results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vegucated is very uneducated","review":"This movie is an extreme in-your-face movie as to why you shouldn't eat meat. The movie gives all the wrong reasons as to why you shouldn't eat meat. The movie shows peoples reactions to how animals are processed or a few of them getting injured in the process and it shows the people crying. I'm going to assume people have never seen a butcher slaughter an animal or cut the neck off of a chicken in order to humanly kill it for eating.That's my main issue with this movie; it wants you to think that killing animals for food is inhumane and torture. It also finds extreme cases of hurt animals being abused to make you think it's like that for all animals. The stupidest part was the lady calling someone on the phone and asking them questions about bulls and chickens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not based on fact","review":"I stopped watching this as soon as they claimed the chicken we buy are genetically modified. This is absolutely untrue, as they are \\"created\\" by cross-breeding two varieties of chicken. If they are blatantly stating misinformation as fact in this case, I have to assume they do elsewhere in the video as well. I am tired of \\"foodies\\" labeling everything they disagree with as a GMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad","review":"The show started out as you would expect a decent documentary to; a little background and character introduction. The big problem with the film is that it rapidly descended into a poorly made film full of scare tactics. I respect the views of vegans, as a vegetarian I sympathize with the plight of informing the public of the issues surrounding CAFO's, chicken ranches, etc. The movie is not comedy, and it is not helpful to the plight, I was completely disgusted by several scenes that seemed to be spliced in to surprise. The scenes did not fit in sequence; they seemed to be there catch you off guard so that you weren't ready to fast forward through pigs convulsing after being shot or cattle, still moving, dangling from meat hooks. I will not finish the movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. The graphic scenes serve a purpose, but they drive people away from the concept. Don't watch, especially if you are looking for a comedy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite documentary!","review":"This film is perfect for anyone even remotely interested in becoming vegan or curious about the vegan lifestyle.

However troublesome that usually is, in the case of Ramakrishna it was a great blessing to mankind. Ramakrishna was a god-man with deepest spirtual insights, and an enormous richness of spritual diversity. At the same time, in this book, human ascpects are shown as well. The book does not pretend a perfect world or a perfect Ramakrishna. The time one invests into spiritual development is obvously lost from investing into other things, like presentig oneself in an optimized way. I'm sure, Ramakrishna wore no tie and would fail in a modern management school. This is no joke, because many people do not beleive certain enlightend people, because they behave not quite propperly according to social standards.

He praticed many religious paths because in the end he saw God (not to be confused with just the male aspect) He was also a Tantric and he was a very open minded annd ecclectic man. He served as a priest in the Dakashineswar Kali temple in Calcutta India. He was a priest of Kali. He died of lung cancer. In this gospel there is history about the man-god Sri Ramakrishna and his teachings. Although I personally dont agree 100 percent on everything he said, not because he was wrong or right, its because I have my own beliefs. But his teachings are very much alive today as they were back then. His teachings are spiritually uplifting. Im attracted to him because I had some of his experiences and if he were alive today in the flesh he would totally understand where Im comming from. This is a book I wont ever give away.

This review covers the 2nd edition, which was published in March 2004. The 2nd Edition by J. Siegel and D. A. Swanson is hardbound and has around 850 pages. The price ($89.00) is unbelievably low for such a comprehensive and well-written book. It is filled with references and examples and provides updates on data sources while covering the many advances in methods and technology that have occurred since the publication of the first edition. This book can be used both in the classroom and by practitioners. Besides covering and updating everything that was in the 1st edition, it adds new chapters, appendices, and a cross-referenced comprehensive glossary. The 2nd edition by Siegel and Swanson is a worthy successor to the 1st edition by H. Shryock, J. Siegel, and E.

The children summon their \\"friendly angel\\" Gorgan, who tells them to take the U.S.S. Enterprise to a planet he can control. By garbling Kirk's words and deceiving Spock, the children are able to take control of the starship. Finally, seeing Kirk's anxiety at the loss of his ship, Spock realizes that something is wrong and helps the Captain regain control. Kirk shows the children tricorder tapes of their parents... and their graves, demonstrating to them that Gorgan is not a \\"friendly angel\\" but an evil force.

Bring in a salesman (Raymond Burr) neighbor (could it be Willie Loman going off the edge) in an unhappy marriage. Add in the master suspense director Alfred Hitchcock and you have the making of a classic suspense thriller. The plot revolves around the clues picked up by Stewart as he, out of boredom or otherwise, hones in on the apartment across the way. By the time Stewart and crew are done old Raymond Burr is going to need more than Perry Mason to get out of this fix. A word on Grace Kelly.

It certainly makes us all wish she had never married and given up making movies. All the other reviewers have talked about all the aspects of this movie but one--the fact that it gives us such a wonderful glance at life in New York City in the 1950s. Granted, it is a very narrow look, but it is one that has kept me enthralled since I first saw this movie more than 25 years ago.

I thought Rear Window was boring. It starts off agonizingly slow and I thought it was annoying how all the action takes place in one setting (ala 12 Angry Men). The acting isn't half bad but the film is so slow...I can't imagine anyone wanting to sit through this film more than once. There's my 2 cents. Buy it if you like Hitchcock."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Hitchcock movie ever","review":"I have always been a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock movies, but I have to say that Rear Window is one of my all time favorites. It has all the elements of a great picture; A star studded cast with Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, and Raymond Burr, suspense and intrigue, and even thought provoking dialog.Jimmy Stewart is a photographer that has been laid up with a broken leg. Unable to leave his apartment, he becomes board and has found that his only entertainment comes from watching his neighbors across the courtyard. He becomes obsessive about a particular neighbor played by Raymond Burr whom he believes has committed murder.With the help of his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly, they set out to find the evidence they need to prove that the crime has actually been committed. Acting as his legs, Grace Kelly finds herself in some very dangerous situations, and all Jimmy Stewart can do is watch from his rear window."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't make films like this anymore...","review":"I must admit, the first time I saw this film, I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. However, upon my second viewing, I began to realize what all the fuss was about. This film is extremely deep with so many subtle nuances that it would take multiple viewings to catch them all. Every scene, facial expression and foleyed sound adds something to the story. Hitchcock constantly attempts to lead you astray from what you want to believe and you find yourself changing your mind over and over as to what is transpiring, just as Jimmy Stewart's character does in the film. This character empathy is what draws one into the movie. It's a film that has so much to offer than just what's on the surface and the fact that nearly the whole film takes place in one space makes it that much more brilliant. This film must be released on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcock","review":"This is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies. So suspenseful, exciting.

It's much more main-stream, American, 50's era, middle of the road. That's not entirely bad. The cast is great. James Stewart is charming and likable as usual, Grace Kelly is exquisite, as usual in her gorgeous Edith Head created wardrobe, Thelma Ritter is endearingly wise-cracking as usual.The story is clever enough featuring a photographer who approaches life through the safe distance of a lens. I didn't see a lot of chemistry between Kelly and Stewart; he seemed much older than she was, which strained the credibility of her adoration and patience. There were other things that didn't really make sense, but overall the film pulls you along pleasantly.Hitchcock fans will go gaga over it, uncritically, because it is, after all, Hitchcock. But if you just want to enjoy a movie on its own merits, this is fun, but a little dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit slow, but entertaining","review":"Rear Window is somewhat languidly paced, lacking the taut direction of some of Hitchcock's best films (Notorious, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder, etc.), and this one-set movie does start to feel claustrophobic. I was hoping for Stewart to be able to get out of that wheelchair, leave his small apartment with the oversized lamp shade, and get out into the world.The climax was a bit disappointing. It is chilling to hear Burr coming up the stairs, but once he comes in to the apartment he just starts asking questions -- that's not too scary! And he doesn't even have a weapon on him!It's not one of Hitchcock's best films, but it still is interesting and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and little action","review":"Boring film.

From early successses likeThe Man Who Knew Too MuchandThe 39 Steps - Criterion Collectionto his later years masterpieces likeVertigo (Collector's Edition),North By NorthwestandPsycho (Collector's Edition), Hitchcock is one of the most celebrated filmmakers in history.Rear Window is nothing short of a masterpiece. A movie set in and around the front window of a man in a wheelchair. This entire movie, from the shots inside and outside of the window, to the superb acting from James Stewart and Grace Kelly, to the use of only diegetic to set the mood. A wonderful movie.One of the greatest of all times.Must Have.I also recommend:Strangers on a Train (Two-Disc Special Edition),Marnie, andRope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcock's Finest","review":"I'm glad to see that overall, this film got 5 stars seeing that I am a huge Hitchcock buff and have seen all but a handful of his movies. But reading some of the other comments, it just goes to show that all movies are rated to our own opinions. My only disagreement(at least the one I care to share) is that this movie is not based on voyeurism in a good light necissarily, although I think we all have it in us to some extent. Speaking of propaganda-I really don't think ALL OF THE SPY CAMERAS EVERYWHERE are because of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie","review":"I saw this movie when I was a kid in elementary school.

Will say the same thing about Rebecca, and the rest of his wonderful movies...."},{"rating":"2","title":"best hitchcock movie","review":"One of Hitchcock's first movies in color and his best movie. It is filmed extremly well concetering it was made in 1954. James Stewart gives an exelent performance as a world troting photographer who breaks his leg and is forced to stay in his tiny apartment for 6 weeks. Soon he gets bored and begins to look at his neighbors threw the rear window of his apartment. One night he sees some suspicious things and begins to suspect that one of his neighbors is a killer. His high class girl friend Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly)joins him in solving the murder. Also along for the ride is the insurance company nurse Stella ( Thelma Ritter) who delivers some comidic lines very well. The movie is very entertianing surprisingly it never gets boring even though the whole 2 hours takes place in Jeff's apartment. I belive that this is Hitchcock's greatist movie ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Hitchcock's best!","review":"Excellent performances by James Stewart and Grace Kelly, along withRaymond Burr.

I would see it again anytime>"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Hitchcock","review":"I've wavered on this over the years. First Rear Window. No, Vertigo. North By Northwest. Psycho. Now back to Rear Window. And I credit the new DVD release with its excellent documentary feature. All the discs in this series are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"What can I say? Rear Window is probably Hitchcock's best movie. Grace Kelly is even more fabulous than usual, and Jimmy Stewart is brilliant too. However, this can be a more demanding movie to watch than some may expect. Obviously, this film is largely psychological and thus requires effort to watch. And it is also really slow, although it is ingenious, precise, and somewhat formal in its development. For these reasons, viewers accustomed to different/new types of movies may find its value as pure entertainment to be diminished."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing puzzle","review":"I fell asleep when I tried to watch the film the first time, so I attempted the next morning. Many scenes of in-action, with what I learned later to be one of Hitchcock's blessings upon film, the subjective point of view, although when watching it the first time, was very boring. My second watching proved much more fruitful and I enjoyed puzzling out what was going to happen. For once I was actually wrong about the outcome of the movie, which surprised me. I did identify with the main character; that is a line of work I would like to be in, and often I find myself in the same conundrum he himself is in. The Everyman worked perfectly for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dumbest movie ever","review":"I dont see how anyone could rate this movie 5 stars...the mosthorrible movie ever...There is nothing left to say i dont wanna waste my time talking about this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest movie of all time","review":"This is Hitchcock at his best. I believe that this movie was also the peak of James Stewart's and Grace Kelly's career. Everything in the film is perfect, and the basic cinema is brilliant. Thelma Ritter was superb and hilarious, also. The suspense was perfect, especially when Grace Kelly gets involved and of course the most suspenseful part is when Tharwald looks out of the window and sees that he is being watched. I love this movie so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantasic movie with okay extras.","review":"The movie doesn't need reviewing in my opinion. Everyone at least knows about it. It's one of the greatest movies made. Not everyone loves it but most do, and should be on the shelf of anyone who likes classic movies. Not many reviewers comment on the extras. They are decent and are enjoyable enough to watch if you're interested in film. I will say that the hero worship of Hitchcock is still going strong and colors the extra features. Hitchcock was VERY talented but was possibly more master of PR rather than suspense. He did know how to put together a good team, though. A look at the extras onAlfred Hitchcock Presents - Season One(I think this was the one) was much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hitchcock classic","review":"This old classic (with photographer James Stewart confined to his apartment with a cast on his leg and his girlfriend Grace Kelly providing legs for their sleuthing) never fails to satisfy. And it's really, really scary, especially the scene where the suspected murderer (Raymond Burr with menacing gaze and heavy brow) sees Kelly twiddling her finger behind her back, glances out the window and up, up, up to where Stewart is framed in his apartment window across the courtyard. Ridiculous, but even as I type this, I'm getting goosebumps.The beauty of this film is the way it plays on the role of the voyeur. Stewart amuses himself by spying on his neighbors in the apartment buildings that surround his Greenwich Village courtyard - and we, the viewing audience, get to peek over his shoulder. It's incredibly titillating - until Burr's invalid wife goes missing.Terrific cure for boredom, both Stewart's and ours, especially with the truly terrifying conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ORIGINAL ROOM WITH A VIEW","review":"This is my second-favorite Jimmy Stewart movie ( VERTIGO being my favorite of both Stewart's, and Hitch's ). I have always been amazed by the intricacy of the staging, and set design in this beautifully, and brilliantly orchestrated psychological thriller, that juggles droll humor, social commentary, and mounting suspense with such aplomb, and twisted, though, surgeon-like precision. REAR WINDOW is an exquisite film, and should be in any serious collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"a completely original suspense masterpiece!","review":"One of the most original films ever made! A man in a wheelchair, with a leg in a cast is trapped in his Greenwich Village one room apartment, watching his neighbours through the window onto a courtyard, during a heat wave in the summer. Sometimes what you see, you don't believe and what you believe you don't see and that can be murder. The set-up and premise of the film is outstanding and completely original. With excellent dialogue and excellently mounted scenes without dialogue, Hitchcock enters the dangerous world of the peeping tom and gives it his masterful twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"GALILEO STEWART?","review":"When Alfred Hitchcock offered the lead role in this film to Jimmy Stewart in 1954, Stewart was reluctant:\\"Gee, that didn't seem like much of a part. But, Hitch could do that..create a good film out of next to nothing.\\" So, Hitchcock paired Stewart with Grace Kelly (old enough to be his daughter) and came up with a gem. which seems to have faded a bit with time. Laid up with a broken leg, Stewart all but rejects his girlfriend, Kelly, preferring to snoop on the neighbors with a pair of binoculars. Just imagine a Matt Damon or a Leo DiCaprio pulling a stunt like this today with a Kate Winslet type, Anyway, Stewart\\"s reconnaissance missions eventually turn up what he's convinced is a wife murderer; the type that likes to dismember his victim. But our voyeur is having the darndest time convincing police officer Corey until... This is still a very good movie, well worth your time. But time does change one's perspective, especially after 53 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rear Window is great Hitchcock","review":"Hitchcock at his best. Builds the suspense and it never gets old.

In future, would seller please verify that the product is in viewable condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"If you are a Hitchcock fan then you cant go wrong with this one, at true classic.Jimmy Stewart's innocence mixed with the absolute beauty of Grace brings hope to the sinister and dark shadows cast by Raymond.

This is such a classic that if you are a fan of Jimmy Stewart or Alfred Hitchcock it is a must have. The suspence keeps you going until the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of build up with very little pay off.","review":"I didn't really care for this movie and I don't think it belongs in AFI's top 100 movies. The acting is definitely the best part of this movie. I mean you can't really go wrong with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. But It is not enough to make this a good movie in my opinion. I believe this movie is shot all from one room. The movie is mostly dialogue between Stewart and whomever is in his room at the time. During the times where there is no dialogue the camera is panning into the other windows of the courtyard. Stewart really doesn't have much evidence to go on but he is convinced one of his neighbors killed his own wife. The movie builds and builds until we find out he is right. There are no twists, He and his girlfriend are threatened twice but it's really not that threatening. I think it's a good idea but Hitchcock missed on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcock's true masterpiece","review":"forget Vertigo, forget Psycho even. this is Hitchcock's real masterpiece. if there was a Hitchcock film i would most likely view frequently, this is it! stellar performances, excellent direction and superior setting and plot make this one an unforgettable experience in cinematic drama.as for the DVD, awesome documentary, great trailer, informative interview with John Michael Hayes, a poster gallery and more interesting facts in the production notes. this DVD is a must for collectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth $0.02","review":"This book will do very little in giving you an idea of how to grow a practice, or not have it fail. It talks a lot about cloning yourself and selling your practice eventually, which is something I'm not interested in - at least not now - it's been 3 years since I graduated. There is nothing substantial about doctor-patient communication or patient acquisition, which I believe has a lot to do with why practices fail. The reason I would pay $0.02 and rate it a 1 star is because it has some decent philosophical concepts, but you can get those just about anywhere with all \\"self-help\\" manifestation-type books that are out now. The author probably had a good 1st book (haven't read it) and then just figured he could use the same template to clone a dozen others on a different topic. Invest your money elsewhere - really disappointing, and was able to finish it about 2 hours. And I'm no speed-reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book is a quick read, but honestly did not provide solutions. Sure it discussed problem areas, but pretty much the book just identified what the problems are. I already know what they are. For example, in the section regarding problem patients I thought that it would address how to handle a variety of \\"problem\\" patients. No, it just skimmed over the topic offering no new information. I don't think I really gleaned any pearls of wisdom from this book. I'm just happy that I didn't waste more time, as it was a quick read. Overall, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as The Successful Physican","review":"If you don't have much time then read the following book instead: The Successful Physician: A Productivity Handbook for Practitioners. It offers better solutions that you may not think of. The E-Myth Physician talks about things that don't work but suggest little of what to Do About It."},{"rating":"1","title":"fluff","review":"I thought that the first couple of chapters were enticing at first. Then I realized that this book was really all fluff. Basically, a pep talk to get you to do what you want. He fails to address so many issues and has a very simplistic attitude towards them.He starts off saying that doctors who want to go off on their own do, so that they can rid themselves of a boss who is controlling and runs everything. However, he then explains how later on, you have to hire doctors and basically train them to be a replica of yourself. I see a problem there. Because unless you hire followers, doctors want to have their own autonomy. How does he address this problem that made the doctor go off on his own in the first place?Basically a fluff book. read it in the book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"A couple of good ideas and filler","review":"The author has a couple of good ideas: management is about building processes not about managing people, and the value of a practice is it's process. The problem is that we get no details about how develop such processes. Instead we get a bunch of meaningless psychobabble about change and motivation and the same two presmises simply repeated over and over again. This is nothing like a practical guide on how to rework a medical practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"He did it again!","review":"In the line of the E-myth & the E-Myth manager, Michael Gerber does it again. Being a Physician from Buenos Aires, Argentina, it's amazing how the problems are similar in every western country and the solutions are right there in the face of any thinking person. This book while written in very simple languaje is painfully deep. And I mean painfully, because I had to change in my practice everything I was taught (or not) from Medical School to now. Moving away from the technician's point of view is the most important thing that had happened to my in my work life. Don't just read it study it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Vague","review":"We expected more out of this book. No fresh, new insights into improving efficiency or systemizing a medical practice as would be expected. E-Myth Revisited & Mastery are still the best to me.

It offers no specifics related to anything that would actually improve a medical practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I liked the E-myth Revisited. I think every business owner should read it. After you read it, don't assume that his other stuff is good, because it isn't.

Thanks to Michael Gerber and this book, my practice is on its way to becoming a business. This book is bringing much sanity and predictability to my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The useful message from this book could be stated in two pages. Gerber doesn't understand what motivates most physicians or what differentiates the practice of medicine from other forms of human commerce. It's true that most physicians are inept at business and have much to learn from entrepreneurs. However there are many aspects to the commerce of health care that pose unique challenges for the entrepreneur. Moreover, many business tenets are antithetical to traditional principles of the patient / caretaker relationship.

Korda mocks his readers with his self-congratulatory tone throughout the entire book. Korda has talent as a writer, but wastes them here in a high class, status conscious, name-dropping book (who cares if he lived for 2 years as a child in Beverly Hills? Isn't the title \\"A Memoir of OTHER People\\"??). A well-written memoir engages the reader by adding creative flavor and story-telling to its non-fiction nature. Korda fails to do that here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Korda needs an editor!","review":"This book drags and is repetitive. Korda constantly reminds the reader of his \\"accomplishments\\" such as being the only publisher who rides daily in NYC. Yawn. He's very busy talking about how wonderful he is to the detriment of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Runaway Train","review":"Korda chronicles his thirty-year career in trade-book publishing at Simon and Schuster at breakneck speed and with great enthusiasm. He's met a bazillion celebrities, both distinguished and tawdry. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this page-turner.A previous reviewer, Peachaggi, says Korda never mentioned THE LOVE MACHINE. Pea must have skipped Chapter 19 in Part 4, where THE LOVE MACHINE is mentioned at least thirteen times. I counted.I have just three complaints: Korda seems ignorant of the subjunctive mood, neglects to make his pronouns agree with their antecedents, and splits his infinitives unnecessarily throughout. Of course, there's more to trade publishing than grammar and usage, subjects about which few people seem to know very much and care even less."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid chronicle of the publishing business","review":"Korda edited many well-known writers and he shares those experiences.

Less than Zero really delved into the lives of young adults, drug addiction and personal struggles in a very genuine and creatively wonderful way.

Charlie and his friend, \\"act black\\", use drugs, disrespect women and are just extremely unlikable and stupid characters. You don't see anything beneath the surface on these character have no redeeming qualities. You dislike them from the beginning and really end up hoping they get what they deserve in the end.

The cover art reveals a mid-1980s Roger, not an early 1970s Roger - that's the first clue that maybe it's not going to be full of original recordings. If you want a longer CD of his hits, buy \\"Now and Then.\\" The great redeeming feature about this album is that it contains \\"Albany,\\" which only appears on the special order \\"Legendary\\" CD from Australia and on some of his German CDs.

It was disheartening to find so many re-recordings done just enough differently to not bring out the wonder that was Roger back in the 60's and 70's. We attended a concert about 6 years ago and found that not only did he not perform those wonderful oldies he was famous for, but his interest was really more about his love and concern for his African countrymen.

The rising conflict between Curly, Laurie & Jud has more nuances and pathos here than in the original.

I think Laurie is splendidly outfitted in overalls - and she and Curly create a wonderfully playful and quick-witted relationship (which unfortunately in the original film seems soley founded on appearances - i.e. the cutest guy & girl in town).If you found the characterizations of the original film a bit superficial and fluff-o-lite, you may enjoy this more thought-provoking version with far superior directing and acting, which actually touches upon the innate conflict between cowboys and farmers, and the changing face of the American landscape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good stage production","review":"When I realized I was confronted with a 4 hour production, I decided to watch until I got tired of it and then quit.

The stage production itself is fantastic, with fairly simple props used to greatest effect - right down to the electric train set. Oklahoma is a musical, a story mainly told in song.

All the characters in the musical are really surprisingly deep and it takes some prowess to pull them off. So what if they're Brits and Aussies pretending to be Oklahoma...uh...ians?

This was OK, but the staging and sets sometimes seemed like High School.Also, I felt there were so many endings! Every time I thought it was going to end, it kept right on going. Also there were characters in the show, that I didn't remember. I don't recall the foreign salesman at all, but it was many years ago.The chorus and the music were pretty good, but the dance sequence seemed very different and much longer than I remembered. I also don't remember the auction or the many scenes with Judd. But again I haven't seen it in a long time.

I've seen bootlegs with better quality than this. Even if you're a fan, I wouldn't recommend this, because you should get what you pay for. This dvd, you don't get nothing even remotely watchable. The japan footage is the worst. It's so dark, and blurry, ya can barely even see the band. I wouldn't have even released this if it couldn't be up to today's standards.I've seen TV series' that were not remastered, and were still about 500% better in quality than this.

The 2 disc sets are priceless for the extras they contain, and the commentary tracks are spot on (at times just as funny as the episode being watched). I agree with others that a year is too long to wait, but I guess it takes time to dig up all that archival material.

This is the first time that I have not liked one of their leashes, and for the sole reason that they made the retractable cord too thin this time. The result is a leash that does not retract well, and gets somewhat hung up, having the effect of drooping and dragging rather than being taut at all times. I bought this for my chihuahua, who likes to be way out in front and always kept previous leashes stretched to their max. With this leash, and even though he's well out in front, the leash is just not performing as expected.I think if they had stuck with their original cord width, the leash would work just fine.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome leash!","review":"The handle is a little too big, I wish they would have had one that was just as long, but with a smaller handle.

The Damned is the story of a family belonging to Germany's establishment, those people who thought they were so smart they could use the Nazis; the movie shows quite clearly who really hold the strings. But more interesting is the way the theme of damnation is waved into the historical description of the rise of nazism: Faust is never very far as everybody in the movie except for the occasional hapless innocent soul (Herbert, best described as a reactionary rather than a socialist) sells their soul for whatever reason they have: greed, hatred, envy. Grottesque and grand in turn the atmosphere is one of utter depravation, conspiring to make this movie an authentic modern tragedy. Appropriately, the Oedypian reference is also, hm... quite explicit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decadence Reigns!","review":"Based on a family's foray into unadulterated corruption during the third Reich. Initially, the relationships of the various characters were difficult to follow, but their manipulations and depravity slowly and memorably reveal their personalities.

Visconti is a brilliant director!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Visconti's grand failure","review":"From the Director of Death in Venice and the Leopard, comes an appalling mess of a film. While it has visual style, superb looking actors and directorial flourish, it simply goes way over the top. Martin - the personification of evil - is both a child molestor and mother fixated as well as being a transvestite.In the Leopard, Visconti weaved history and cinema together. In the Damned, he creates a parody of that work. The Nazis were one of the great scourges of the twentieth century and 50 million people died to destroy them.Visconti had a great idea of witnessing the Nazi's rise through a Krupp style family, but he simply lapses into poor taste and high camp too often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Springtime For Hitler","review":"I think I understand what Camp is. \\"The Damned\\" is a film taking upon itself the allegorical rise and fall of Nazi Germany in such an overindulgent manner that one cringes and giggles at the same time. I guess Gay folks everywhere can blame Luchino Visconti the \\"great\\" director for making a laughing stock out of homosexuals in Nazi SS garb. Mel Brooks realized in his film \\"The Producers\\" that Nazi's are damn funny, but not even Brook's vision could foresee the downfall of the Essenbeck family as the currents of early Nazi bloodshed swirls about. The uniforms are Art Deco at its worst. The young blonde, Aryan, cross-dressers are a bathhouse dream until they're lined up against the wall. Rome may have had Caligula, but The Reich had blonde pedophiles. What a thrill to see Helmut Berger swishing about in Marlene Dietrich bodice and stockings.

The story, which concerns a doctor who goes mad and determines to kill off his imagined enemies according to various devices found in Poe's works, is more than a little farfetched, but Bela Lugosi and company play out the plot with considerable conviction, while classic Universal Horror cinematography lends considerable atmosphere to the tale. Ultimately, however, it is the scenes in which Lugosi prepares to torture and kill his victims that remain in the memory--and very disturbingly so. One of the best examples of 1930s horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrific Fun With Boris and Bela","review":"The second teaming of Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff is a fast-paced horror melodrama from the Universal factory. Lugosi delivers a bravura performance as the Poe-obsessed Dr. Vollin, with Karloff playing second fiddle this time around.

This is one to see again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Ol' Flick!","review":"This movie, along with THE BLACK CAT, are two of the best movies that paired Lugosi and Karloff. As THE BLACK CAT had Karloff as the evil one and Lugosi as the hero (but not a typical one indeed!), this film reverses their roles. Lugosi goes completely over the top with his portrayal of the mad Dr. Vollin. He chomps the scenery big-time, but it's all part of the attraction of this film for me.Outside of a few moments of forced attempted comedy, this movie is a classic!

In it, you have a point-based character creation system, and a superhero power system based around the d20 level mechanic, so that power level scales naturally.However, the failing of the book is that it is based on a 'damage save'. Basically, instead of skill or effectiveness of your abilities, the roll of 2d20 (damage + 1d20, save + 1d20) is the biggest influence on whether or not you succeed.

The show revolves mostly around the Vicar & the parish council & the less than \\"sharp\\" Alice who helps the Vicar. The cast of characters is funny & delightfully diverse. I have watched this a lot since I got it & it never fails to make me laugh. It like most British comedies is far superior to most American comedies. I have to have the complete series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is funny?","review":"I read all the good reviews but really, I didn't think this was a funny show.

Vicar is awesome though."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Subtitles","review":"I got this as a sampler after a friend told me how much he enjoyed the series and found the level of slapstick to be a little over the top. I enjoyed the characters who answered \\"No,no,no...\\" but found the lack of any subtitles to defeat of the purposes of buying programs on DVD. The bit of telling a joke after the credits was a good thing too. I guess it was just not meant to match up with my taste but it could still be good for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roll around on the floor laughing!","review":"As an English girl living in the States I have slowly been introducing my 13 year old son to good quality English humour and they don't come any better than this. Dawn French is fantastic as the new Village Vicar and whilst there are quite a few of the Boob jokes and references it certainly wasn't anything bad enough to stop my son watching it. This is one of the best series that the BBC has ever produced and it is a shame that it didn't continue longer than it did. My 13 year old son was literally was rolling on the floor laughing hysterically, and that is a rare occurrence. He loved it and we will be watching the entire collection bit by bit. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this whole series!","review":"I love this entire series! I own it and consider it a classic- something I can watch again and again. Once againthe BBC put together a brilliant cast and long running series of quirky British characters in a small village with the main one, Geraldine Granger (Dawn French), as a power pack of morality and witty humor that the people of Dibley need."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vicar of Dibley","review":"Great BBC comedy that will make you laugh.

The ending was really supprise. I never thought that Doodle was going to die, because they had so much fun, some many great things they had done together. How could that be the ending for this story after everything is going so smoothly? the author of this story should make a new and happy ending for this story... but ... HE'S DIED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid.","review":"I was forced into reading this last week by my freshman language arts teacher, and I didn't like it at all. The author spent far too much time hinting at what was to come, so that by the end of the first paragraph it was obvious that someone was going to die.I can't believe other people didnt realize this.. but alas...The main character was very cruel, and the other characters were rather flat.I just... didn't like it, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is only a story of sadness...","review":"I have never read such a depressing book. The brother of the story treats his younger brother as any child today would, showing cruelty for being embarassed by his brothers handicap. He only does things for his brother for his own good yet he never knows how much he loves him until he is gone... Throughout the story even when he is joyous with his brother he does not realise what he would miss if he were gone. The only thing I dont like about this is the grotesque ending which forced itself into my mind permanentely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heartwarming story, great!","review":"The Scarlet Ibis is the best short story I have ever read in my life!

Just as good as their first 'Go To The Sugar Alter' (see my review). I saw the band play some hole-in-the-wall dive on this very tour. Tunes here that I certainly got the most out of were \\"Future Boy\\", the seductive \\"When He Calls Me Kitten\\", \\"Stripper\\", \\"Confidence Girl\\" and the rocking \\"Get The Writing Off My Back\\". Line-up: Kelley Deal - guitar, bass & vocals, Marty Nedich - bass, Tom Mund - guitar and Todd Johnson - drums. Not a bad alternative '90's title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the critics give her credit for","review":"I found this used for $5.95, so I grabbed it, knowing I wouldn't feel bad if I didn't like it. But it really is very catchy. It seems that most people who've reviewed this CD can't separate Kelley Deal from her sibling Kim, which is a shame because they really are quite divergent in their musical pathways and approaches. It's not the Breeders, and this is a good thing. Very listenable, you should pick this up. She has an odd humor that comes thru, and her vocal talents pretty much wipe the floor with those of her more famous sibling."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES","review":"Finally a great Lezzy rock Goddess!!!!! Drop that divine hammer Kelly, you are much more talented and way more smokin' hot than you're sister, Kim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"Elsa Beskow is classic! What a wonderful book deeply explorative of the Earth. Elsa is accurate with her botanical drawings. She has such a beautiful mind! She places fairy children and elf children as the helping hands to Earth's changes. As the insects and bugs are preparing for Spring's entrance, the children paint and polish them. Perfect book for ages 2-6. Innocent, perfect for homeschooled children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishing this was the RIGHT STORY","review":"Received the mini edition of this book (the large version being difficult to find) for Christmas. The story is completely different from the story we've rented at the library, i'm assuming a \\"more\\" original version. It seems to have been americanized by Floris Press or whoever it was that decided to re-write this story and put names to all the children and animals and take the beauty out of reading it in verse. If I would have received this book not having read the one we love, I would have just chalked it up to a so-so/boring children's book with pretty illustrations. PLEASE do yourself the favor of finding the actual Children of the Forest book- the story in this one bums me out. I wrote to Nova Natural who is the only retailer I'm aware of that carries the large version, and am awaiting a reply on whether theirs is the correct story..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagination and Nature tie together","review":"My daughter and I have been readingThe Littlesseries by John Peterson - I wanted to branch out a bit, and found this book and the others by this author to be a perfect fit! We have read this book MANY times, and love how it follows a woodland sprite family through the seasons of the year. When I ordered this, I made sure to order the large format of this book (12x9 inches) - I feel that the board book version would not do the illustrations justice, plus my daughter is 5 and a baby book would be inappropriate for her at this point. The story ties imagination and nature together quite nicely as the family interacts with the animals of the forest through all of the seasons, as well as some fairies in the fall. My daughter loves this book for the illustrations and the story as well - it has led to a lot of imaginative play for her outside as the weather begins to warm up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irony, joke novel, or simply bad?","review":"The novel starts of with promise but then the griding of the authors personal axes starts to whine in your ear. And it gets louder and louder as the pages turn. The NASA sections are just plain unbelievable. Why must every Sci-Fci author paint them with the incompentant pen pusher brush? The scenese of modern society are not beliveable. The characters are less complicated and real than the plastic toys you find in McDonalds fun meals. Once on mars it just gets more and more stupid until you wonder at your own personal skills in picking this book up and not noticing the smell it gives out. A stinker. I thought it may be trying to be funny ala \\"the stainless steel rat\\" but I suspect the author just can't write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Originality","review":"I did not buy this book, rather, I borrowed it from a workplace \\"book swap rack\\" and I am glad that I did. The writing is fair enough, but the lack of originality really drains your enthusiasm. Science fiction is a tough medium to write in as most of the truly great ideas have already been explored, but it's not an excuse to re-work works from Philip K Dick (\\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep?\\", i.e. the movie Total Recall) and Stanley Clarke (\\"2010, The Year We Make Contact\\"). Do yourself a favor and read those two books...and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss Arthur C. Clarke so much...","review":"Barely readable.

Not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning, Warning, Stay Away, Don't Waste Your Time","review":"There are only a few books I have given up on before finishing, and this is one of them. Being a fancier of possible life and artifacts on mars, I was drawn to the enticements of the book jacket. Unfortunately, once I began reading I became repelled by the prose, plotting (or is that plodding?) and characters. The writing is pedantic, the people and human situations unbelievable, the science meager, the frame of reference nerdishly undeveloped. I knew that if I persevered, I would only be angry at myself and the author for wasting my time. I must express my gratitude to the other low score reviewers for helping warn me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely worth 1 star","review":"This book is a real stinker. Written in amateur prose with cardboard characters and a plot that reads like a Saturday morning cartoon. The continuous references to a vast amount of future tech and the ridiculous amount of exposition slows down the first part of the book to the point of pain. Add to that the disjointed nature and many clichés used by the author and you've got yourself a truly childish piece of work. There's far better science fiction out there, don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"Only to be used as very distant background music, if that.

Art historian Linda Nochlin, in an essay in Deborah Kass: Warhol Project, writes, \\"Gender is an act, Kass seems to be saying, but it is an act with consequences. For the Jewish lesbian artist who wants to make something of her complex identity, the consequences are particularly interesting.\\" Five essays position and discuss Kass's art and take on the issue of whether or not there is a lesbian aesthetic. I loved Kass's use of irony and humor, and her appropriation of Warhol's signature styles to project a different slant on content."},{"rating":"2","title":"JESUS THE CHRIST","review":"I NEED A DICTIONARY WHEN I AM READING THIS BOOK, BUT I THROUGHLY AM ENJOYING THIS BOOK, AND HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT JESUS CHRIST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious writing...","review":"Pretentious writing and dated view point. I mean saying the native americans are cursed... what's up with that? I was stunned to read this. I shudder to think what he would have to say about the African race, or the Chinese, or the Greeks... for that matter, what about the Italians, or the Koreans... Then I realized the book was copywritten around 1915... I guess that was the opinion of the day back then. But nearly a hundred years later, surely no sane person is walking around thinking any physical race is cursed. Are we not all children of God. This is something I would not want my children to read, nor could I in good conscious recommend this to a friend. I can't believe any church would endorse such racist teachings. On a positive note - the author's academic knowledge regarding Christ seems pretty sound. However, I stopped reading at the first racial slur.

I strongly believe that there first two albums are still the best material they have released. This DVD consists of virtually all songs from those albums as well as one or two which were released afterwards on there later albums. As enjoyable as the Corrs are live in a stadium or arena type atmosphere the 'Unplugged' session shows best of any of the Corrs DVD's there fantastic musical talents and also the best sound of any of the DVD's. The set list is as good as you could hope apart from one or two that were left out.

I practically worship the four of them. I just adore them, and when I saw this video, it made me love them so much more. It is SUCH a fantastic video. The band is relaxed, they look fantastic, their performance is brilliant, and they're hilarious! Jim makes a joke about Caroline's mistake on \\"Runaway\\", Andrea shoots her big big smile every 2 minutes, and they truly look like they're having a good time. It is brilliant. Amazingly brilliant.

HOWEVER--- this edition of his book, which I assume has long been out-of-print, is unreadable. It has, according to a disclaimer inside the front cover, been produced by robotically scanning an old copy of the book. The disclaimer says there may be \\"a few typos\\" and some \\"missed pages\\". (Missed PAGES?) This is an understatement-- the punctuation in this edition is haywire and the spelling is almost as bad (hilariously, in some cases-- on one page Shakespeare is printed \\"Quakspere\\"!). At first I thought I could put up with the errors, but there are so many of them that you get no sense of the flow of Mr. Lewes' thought and no pleasure in the reading. I ended up sending it back. I had purchased this edition with the idea of giving it to an actor friend-- it would have been a very sad gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, shoddy execution","review":"This could be a really great piece, but the construction quality is incredibly shoddy.

There are so many CDs with the same old \\"off the shelf\\", \\"paint by number\\" slammin beats I need something a little creative.Whenever I hear a mediocre Chemical Brothers cut, I know I'm listening to Crystal method.

Every single song on this album is it's own unique, awe-inspiring, trippy, mind blowing journey into the infinite possibilities of electronic music. Over the past 5 years I have accumulated literally tens of thousands of electronic music tracks, genres spanning breakbeat, drum and bass, house, electro, electro house, hardcore, hardstyle, trance, prog house, prog trance, psy trance, ambient, dubstep, jungle, minimal, etc...........and this album still stands out."},{"rating":"2","title":"kickin","review":"from the synthy, dark beginnings of Trip Like I Do to the end of the CD, the Crystal Method delivers an awesome variety of material.

'Vegas' is about as groundbreaking as an earthworm on Valium. But, the boys do succeed at creating a wretchedly catchy album. A word of warning though, 'Vegas' seems to have served as a gateway for many into purer forms of electronic music--a move I highly recommend. Once you discover the infinite possibilities available just from techno and trance, 'Vegas' will seem about as played out as any Celine-Mariah-whomever generica. In the Grand Scheme of Things (tm), the Method is a faint blip on the radar best left to ad execs hopelessly trying to sell junk to 18-to-35 year-old males.

There's just nothing that really seperates each song from each other. They have strong beats, weird samples... but nothing particularly different, unique, or interesting. Also, the songs are generally about twice as long as they need to be.If you can still find it, buy the KHA single instead of the album. \\"Vegas\\" is really just sonic wallpaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stirs My Soul","review":"I just bought this album and I have thoroughly fallen in love with it.

The track BadStone is the tightest track in the album, and is a one to keep on your list for top 10 breakbeat songs.

Has pumping basslines and jaggered guitar riffs make Vegas good for road rage but hardly party music."},{"rating":"2","title":"My intro to Electronica","review":"This album is my first serious introduction to Electronica. But as a newcomer to the genre, I can at least note how mercifully accessible I find the CM. Of course, thier music has been used in commercials, movies, vid. games, ect.. So even if you don't realize it, there's a good chance you're passingly familiar with the sound. 'Vegas' even features an actual song or two, given voice by a fine female performer. The entire album, however, is apt to hold your attention from front to back. I find it difficult to turn off once I've thrown it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely misleading","review":"I've never written a review before, as I find most of the reviews written by other Amazon.com customers are sufficiently helpful. But there's a first time for everything.I'm a long-time Amazon.com shopper and browse a lot. I'd never heard of this CD, and as no cover image was available, I relied heavily on the advise of others...However, once I received the CD and popped it in, was there any music from Coldplay? Nope! The back cover states:\\"This is a spoken word product and contains no original music by the artist. It is not authorised by the artists, their record company or management.\\"If you want to hear a history of Coldplay and why they are great, go ahead and buy the CD; but don't expect to hear any material by them.Long story short...buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be prepared!

I bought it based on the cover, thought I was getting a 'kung fu' flick, you know lots of choreographed fights, etc. It was just a [bad] bunch of meaningless stuff strung together and called a movie. I laughed briefly once, at one line in the movie when a female victim rescued by one of the male characters says, \\"how can I repay you\\" and the guy smiles at the camera. Other than that, I watched with a blank, irritated expression. Do not buy this movie under any circumstance. My only hope now is that this movie will become a cult classic by virtue of the fact that it is so bad, and I will be able to sell it to someone else and get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Fist of Fear Touch of Death is a ludicrous exploitation of the name of Bruce Lee. Little of it is even about Lee, and the footage of Lee is borrowed from his films.

A complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Piece Of Garbage","review":"I bought this title back in 1993 and it was not worth it. This video is a complete waste of money if you are a Bruce Lee fan. This video is not even worthy of having Bruce Lee's picture on the front cover.

It seems impossible that a film could be created such as this without it being some sort of comedy. No film has ever gotten enywhere near this abstract, its a very Dadist take on film, random and choppy - and incredibly meaningless, which makes Adolph Caesar's closing monolgue about \\"what we've learned from all this\\" all the more hysterical.

What a rip-off. The Kung Fu tournament discribed on the box is completely fake, like a WCW matchup without the realism. At one point a fighter \\"in a dazzling display of showmanship plucks his opponents eyes out and tosses them into the crowd.\\" Fred Willamson appears in a stupid role, complaining of a Bruce Lee title that doesn't exist, and having sex with someone who was rejected from a porn film.

If you ask me the 4 dollars they are asking is too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Bruce Lee movie","review":"This movie takes place after Bruce Lee's Death. The plot of the movie is that the top martial artists of the world are going to fight for his title. The only catch is that in only shows maybe three fight scenes in the whole movie and none of them are Bruce Lee. It shows Bruce Lee's head a couple times with someone trying to portray his voice. The movie was very low budget, even for its time. I purchased a DVD frisbee for 6.99+s/h. Don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fist of dough, Lost on this show","review":"Words can not express how bad this movie is.

First off, there are hardly any fighting scenes at all. The plot is fairly simple, however, its hard to follow because it seem as if lots of other movies were spliced in. I honestly dont know if this was meant to be this bad, or if it was some kind of joke. The scenes with \\"Bruce Lee's Great Grandfather\\" are pretty cool - its the best action in the movie. Other than that, this movie is a major let down. The only time Bruce Lee appears in the movie is during some interviews, in which its dubbed over in English by someone who sounds very similar to \\"HAL\\" from a Space Odyssey 2001. This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen... Please, I beg of you, do not buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this movie only to see a Legend be disgraced.","review":"This movie has nothing to do with Bruce lee.. This movie often confuses karate with gung fu as well as Japanese culture with chinese. Has no plot and the tounament scenes have no actual fighting. This movie is a total hoax. Buy it if you want to feel pity for the makers. WARNING: There are no facts stated in this movie.. most of the the interview scenes were fake, you can tell from the contrasting video qualities and colors. If you can buy it for 3.00 or lower then buy it just to see how disgusting it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"shameless cash-in on a legend in our time","review":"This video is typical of those who seek to profit from sensations and indeed, legends. Although the director seems to attempt to fool the audience, his attempts are laughable at best. Respect for Lee's name means not buying this video. The only redeeming quality to be found is that the filmaker got his hands on Lee's pre-kung fu films, and you get to see how he acted in Hong Kong at an early age. Although the dialogue is faked as well.

Many of the characters are ones who appeared in \\"Northbridge Rectory,\\" and the situations in this book are often rehashes of situations from that book set several years later in time (\\"Northbridge Rectory\\" takes place during World War II, and this book takes place in 1953, when preparations are being made for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation). The committee scenes are copies of the working party scenes from the earlier book, and none of the characters seems to have changed in the least in 10 years. \\"Northbridge Rectory\\" is much more enjoyable. In my opinion, Angela Thirkell was at her best in the books written in the 1930s through about 1946. The later books just don't come up to that standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all!","review":"This book is actually pretty good.

His devilish character intruding on the newlywedded Dr. Frankenstein, and corrupting the monster to do his bidding.I was disappointed with the film's predictable \\"happy\\" ending.

I fully admit to have lived in Savannah for the past ten years and probably read it for curiosity value moreso than desire to read another historical fiction. However, I had great difficulty putting this book down to work or sleep. I found the characters and plot most riveting. I found myself asking friends and co-workers that are native to Savannah about the events and descriptions of the town in earlier days, only to determine the extreme accuracy of depictions. I, too, will be awaiting the sequel eagerly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading!","review":"This novel tells a great story set in Savannah. I lived there for a short while, and this book brought back some fond memories.

However, this novel is crippled by its cliches. Worse still, the writing is tasteless and adolescent, and because of this scenes that strive for drama are sadly laughable. I believe I said in my earlier review that this is some of the worst prose I'd ever seen between hard covers. Any reasonably intelligent high school student should have developed a better prose style. That this book could have found an audience at all is a sad comment on American culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't Whiskeytown on every radio in America?","review":"I own over 500 CDs and this is one of my favorites, along with Uncle Tupelo's No Depression and Steve Earle's El Corazon.

You will want to listen to it before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth a listen.","review":"I don't know much of anything about the personal history of this band in general, or it's singer, Ryan Adams, in particular. It really doesn't matter because the songs contained in this album are so gripping that they make you believe them. I don't care if Adams grew up in a happy suburban home and never left his neighborhood until he made this album. His words, arrangements, and delivery, as well as the performances of the band, convey loss, longing, hurt, and the traversing of thousands of miles. \\"Avenues\\" is pretty, quiet, acoustic, and I'm not entriely sure what it's about, but it will make you weep. \\"Houses on the Hill\\" evokes years long passed and a love affair that was not meant to be. \\"Dancing with the Women at the Bar\\" might sound like an ode to line dancing, but it's story of a son following in his father's footsteps is really quite haunting. If you really appreciate great, evocative songwriting, check out Whiskeytown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other stuff to check out","review":"I am a huge fan of alt-country, roots rock, Americana or whatever you wanna call it.

The vocals, in fact, are better than you'll find on just about anything out there. Whiskeytown lives in the shadows a little bit of both Son Volt and Wilco, and it may not be justified.This record gets better with repeated listens. The songs grow in complexity and the layering effect on the final 4 songs in particluar is tremendous.Faithless Street is next on my list, and I look forward to Whiskeytown's next new release."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME!","review":"As a HUGE fan of the Replacements, Townes Van Zandt, Gram Parsons, early REM, and the Byrds, I find this album to be a calculated, pretentious and uninspired rip-off of the Uncle Tupelo sound. Whiskeytown sound like they're trying to hide weak songwriting skills behind a facade of Americana authenticity.Although one or two songs start to take off a bit, the most promising song--\\"Houses on the Hill\\"--is a near-plagiarism job on Neil Young's \\"Thrasher\\". Once you make the connection, you just might have to get rid of this CD, not only because it is one annoying album, but on principle.And glorifying being a drunken loser is a dead end, not just musically--in LIFE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak distillation of the Uncle Tupelo sound","review":"This was a very disappointing buy. I immediately returned it when I realized the best song was basically the borrowed chords and vibe of Neil Young's \\"Thrasher\\" with different and sometimes embarrassingly pretentious lyrics; show me someone who can use the word \\"artifact\\" in a country/rock song without sounding ridiculous, and I have a bridge in NYC to sell you!This stuff doesn't come anywhere close to the raw honest emotion of Paul Westerberg's stuff when he was still writing great songs. Whiskeytown's attempt at a hard-luck, wizened stance sounds like a total pose to me, especially when I saw them playing on public television and noticed how much hairspray and or money their singer must have spent on his carefully messed-up hair!He does have a good voice, but they might be better off as a Gram Parsons cover band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking Forward To Seeing You","review":"This is more of a thank you than a review. Last December, leaning on the bar in the back of New York City's Irving Plaza before Golden Smog ignited their own magic, this girl, maybe in her high 20's, turned to me, and asked if I had ever seen Whiskeytown. When I said no, she said, \\"Just go get their albums.\\" I did, and now I'm just waiting for their next tour. If I could find this girl in the crowd, I hope its to the strains of \\"Losering.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreakingly beautiful","review":"This is definately a favorite album of mine. The emotion is just so real and so raw, unpretentious and unapologetic. It really helped me through some hard times, just to listen to it and absolve the meaning. Favorites include \\"Inn Town\\", \\"Losering\\", \\"Everything I Do\\", \\"Not Home Anymore\\", \\"Houses On The Hill\\", \\"Yesterday's News\\" and \\"16 Days\\". The group went through a lot of changes through this period, with lots of people quitting, being kicked out, and so forth. You can't deny a good piece of music, quite frankly it changed my life.

Young children will be able to express their own feelings of gratitude as they look at the photos. Older children could even make a book of a similiar format themselves with their own personal photos or drawings.

Now, if you like Rod McKuen, this set is for YOU! Personally, I am not THAT fond of the man or his voice, and I'm REALLY annoyed that he replaced Anthony Newley's rendition of Johnny Mercer's \\"This time the dream's on me\\" with his own.

It's like this throughout. Quammen comes across as a pretentious, book-learned auto mechanic.If you can stomach the prose then the articles are interesting for the few factual titbits. But Quammen is a difficult read because of the ackward prose.A better writer for non-fiction is John McPhee.

Trancers is a great 80's sci-fi classic about a cop from the future, Jack Deth being transported back to the 1980's to stop Whistler from wipping out the members of the counsel (from Deth & Whistler's own time). Whistler uses the body to one of his ancestors to \\"trance\\" people to do his bidding. Trancers themselves have a yellowish zombie type look. Trancers is just a fun campy 80's flick. I give the movie itself 5 stars, but the dvd version stinks! The picture itself if blurry, as if it was out of focus, and of the course the famous bar scene where the picture goes black for a few seconds. If you still have a vcr I'd suggest purchasing this on a vhs tape until a decent dvd release appears, that's what I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major B-type sci fi","review":"Wow - a real B-movie...or perhaps a C or D.

However,I believe you will need to get the DVD,rather than instant streaming or download.As delivered by Amazon streaming it is nearly unwatchable due to a faint double image on each character,as well as a general \\"fuzziness\\" of all objects with a slight color \\"halo\\".I realize that it is poor form to comment on technical matters rather than the film quality. However..there is a rapidly expanding market at Amazon for streaming and downloading films. I have used both methods on Amazon Prime;approximately 10 films/week, for more than a year-without problems. This movie (or the copy being streamed) is unacceptable.Regardless of the merits of \\"Trancers\\" itself,it is unwatchable as a digital download-regardless of hardware/video card, ISP connection,bandwidth,or line quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miscast","review":"The the acting was marginal, and the effects were weak.

If you liked \\"They Live\\", you should stay away from this film. \\"They Live\\" was fun and cheesy at times, but well done. This is just a crappy movie in which they started with a VHS copy, transferred it to Laserdisc, and then transferred it to DVD.

Placing a plastic tarp over the area while you are gassing helps to keep the gas from leeching out or the ground. The diameter of your exhaust pipe need to be 3 inches or less.

Also I have a dual exhaust so I'm not quite sure that enough exhaust fumes were going through the hose as the fume smell was not that strong. Let it run for 15min and filled in the holes.

In a plan that is devised the warrior is teamed with a Georgia doctor to halt the production of the deadly nerve gas. The race against time will keep you on the edge of your seat.The final ending situation will give you bad nerves. This Jewish warrior shows no fear as he accomplishes his mission.

It's extremely suspenseful; the last couple of hours are almost unbearably intense. Because some of it takes place in a WWII concentration camp, it is at times quite graphic and hard to take, but I don't think he was being sensational, just conveying the depths of horror that some people had to endure in that place and time.

Even though Black Cross got me hooked from the beginning, when you get to the last third of the book - I dare you to try to put it down! While I was reading - I actually stopped and realized my heart rate was as though I'd been running a race! Greg Iles' knowledge and obvious research was one of the things that made this book great - but his charachter writing is probably the best I've ever read - and even *that's* just the frosting. The whole cake is filled with nail-biting suspense, intrigue, sadness, warmth, bravery and pride.

The range of topics he uses in his novels is impressive. Black Cross is one of those stories that you just don't want to end. The way he describes the action makes you feel as if you are right there with McConnell and Stern. Definitely a must read - this book would make a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-Rate WWII Thriller","review":"This is the first of Greg Iles' books I've read, but if this book is typical, It won't be the last. It's been said that all great novels are family stories, and so it is with BLACK CROSS. The author skillfully draws us in on the opening page and hooks us with a mystery about the narrator's grandfather--a mystery that will keep us turning pages right up through the explosive ending.For those of us who love thrillers, Greg Iles delivers a well-researched, multi-faceted plot involving an Allied attempt to prevent Hitler from using deadly Sarin and Soman gasses to thwart the D-day invasion. Ripe with unforgettable characters, prose so good it's almost literary, and non-stop action, BLACK CROSS will hold you spellbound and take you on a ride you won't soon forget. Highly recommended!Maurice MedlandAuthor of CHINA STAR"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar!","review":"This was my first Greg Iles book. Since Black Cross, I've read all of his other books. I enjoy books that contain good character development, dialogue and an interesting plot. Most authors are good at one or two of those.

This made-for-TV movie is one of the only film adaptations I'm aware of. Staring Rock Hudson, the film has a fairly good cast. Not heavy on special effects, the set design is outstanding in representing Martian design and architecture. You simply feel like the sets potrayed could have been the remains of a past civilization.Despite the book being rather short, the screen play writers felt they had some better ideas to offer, which doesn't really hold true. The first chapter----The Explorations, holds pretty true to the book, but then drfts a bit. But the first hour or so do make this worth watching and the newly created scenes have some value in and of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"A potentially-great miniseries, and one which is quite nostalgic for people in their late-20s, but it's not actually all that good. Essentially, the book is a masterpiece, but it's a collection of short stories - the television series might have worked as a 'Twilight Zone' anthology, but by concentrating on just three stories, stretched out to 45 minutes each (by Richard Matheson of 'I am Legend' fame), it becomes lengthy and dull. The acting is solid, but then again the actors don't have much to do. And the low budget is painfully obvious - whilst the martians are interestingly designed, the whole thing is too close to 'Doctor Who' for comfort.Is this review - 'YOU KNOW THE TWISTS AND TURNS' - actually of the series, or is it just copied and pasted from something else?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book Instead","review":"I read almost everything written by Ray Bradbury before I ever saw this...I wish I hadn't.

The movie is a good representation of the book and will make a great addition to a \\"true\\" Sci-Fi collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Bradbury has to wince a little...","review":"Even the illustrious writer himself (whom I consider one of the greatest short story writers of the 20th century) would have to wince seeing this production.

This is an excellent demonstration of how far the quality of television productions have come since 1980."},{"rating":"2","title":"overdue dvd release of an old sci fi classic","review":"Anyone brought up on special effects as seen on big blockbusters such as star wars will probably not want to see this old Rock Hudson number. A diamond in the rough, however it is a prime example of a genuine sci fi story, without so much distracting eye candy. Unfortunately the UK video release butchered the original 3 installments into one made for TV movie. The film has an interesting moral perspective and one cannot help but draw parallels with the native Americans. The Martians similarly die from diseases brought over by the Europeans and hastily erected tin cities desecrate the otherwise flawless martian landscape. Sure, most of the budget went to pay Rock Hudson and there's an obvious paucity of special effects, but the story itself narrated in a dispassionate manner will grip you nonetheless, if you are a real science fiction fan that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bradbury didn't like it - but I do.","review":"When I was at the San Diego Comic Con during the summer of 2006, I attended a panel where Ray Bradbury was speaking. He touched on a lot of topics, and I recall him murmuring some disapproval at the 1970's Martian Chronicles series starring Rock Hudson. Notwithstanding the author's views - I actually really liked this mini-series. Maybe it was the direction, the subject matter or the location for the filming, but this show managed to hit a very odd note of alienation and desolation that built upon the events depicted in Bradbury's celebrated novel. There are moments in this admittedly \\"TV movie of the Week\\" quality production that are very eerie, evocative and memorable. On the whole, when I saw this years ago it left me feeling frustrated and a little depressed for the sad state that human, and Martian, affairs had come to. In other words, I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmm Rocky!","review":"Well, to say I love this piece of work is to understate the matter. If it were to be remade, the only things needing retouching might be the space-ship sequences, and the glowing globey Martians.The Sand Ships could be reworked, but we do not rework Metropolis (and walk the streets alive) so I just wear it. The Digital Transfer was wonderful, and gave the work a facelift, that brought it back to life. The soundtrack is a bit dated, but that is part of its charm. More features would have helped (maybe an interview with the director, or Mr. Bradbury), but we are all so spoilt for extra features these days. If you love Sci Fi, this is a must for the collection. The Martians stand up even now as characters.

What's happened to science fiction in the interim since then? This work was based on genuine innovation and a truly original storyline. Unbeknown to men who land on Mars, a civilisation already exists there. One cannot but help drawing parallels between the Martians and the native American indians, destined to be driven from their lands and who also die from human pestilence brought over by the first settlers.

My favorite series leitmotif: the grotesquely colossal American flag shoulder patches worn by all members of the (mainly boorish yahoo) Mars expedition crews...subtle as a flying mallet, and, yes; boring.

It would be more appropriate for an advanced college class in intercultural communication. The theoretical framework is mainstream intercultural communications, and as such is very good and thorough.

However, with the fantastic special effects (especially those worms!) excellent acting from a superb cast (look out for Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck) and Sting at his grotesque best as the sadistic Feyd, Dune is well worth watching every time.

The absurd comic-opera costumes, like palace guards in Lichtenstein. The bald nuns or whatever, and their creepy costumes.

And the special effects were very poorly executed. The giant sandworms looked like glove puppets. The last scene with the totally miscast little girl lisping the final grand statement was so bad I still can't imagine what David Lynch was thinking. Lynch should have just told this story as a straight ahead adventure and dropped all the internal thoughts, they felt very awkward.

This sliced-and-diced widescreen version dropped at least two vital sequences (I haven't had the time to look for more). First, Paul's call-out fight upon his and Jessica's first ecounter with the Fremen, the transfer of responsibility for the children of the slain Fremen and the passage of his water to Paul for safekeeping for the Tribe limns the character of the Fremen and their relationship to tradition and water -- a must for better understanding of actions to follow. Also cut was the process of removing the bile of the infant worm (The Water of Life). It's origin is vital to understanding one facet of the planet's importance to the Bene Gesserit and the relationship between the worms and the mystical culture surrounding them. Again, widescreen is nice but why, oh why, for a few cents' worth of tape, did they cut anything? The original, albeit in TV format, deserves a full row of stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remembering the first time I saw this.","review":"I knew very little about Dune until the movie hype.

The attempt to condense this MASSIVE story into one movie is beyond understanding - But that's Hollywood. And even Lynch's trademark eccentric touch is annoying - Think Eraserhead meets Star Wars.The sets are actually impressive (to a degree), but the visuals are some of the worst I've ever seen for a big budget sci-fi. They look like something out of some kind of cheezy Roger Corman flick from the 60's.You might find this movie somewhat understandable if you're a hardcore (and I do mean HARDCORE) lover of the tale.

Heck, the only aspect that impressed me were the giant worms, but even they were too slow to stun audiences. It's difficult to keep a straight face when watching it, because there are many characters who have laughably fake hair and moustaches. On the whole, silly, overlong and drab.

It's also an incomprehensible mess with a lot of insulting interior monologue (\\"Arrakis...Dune...desert planet\\" is a phrase repeated no less than three times in the first ten minutes, as if though we couldn't get it the first time!). Certainly, this will hold much appeal to hardcore David Lynch fans but everybody else will probably be smarter and stay away. Special note to the final battle scene, which features not a single loss on the Fremen side!"},{"rating":"1","title":"See the Sci-fi Channel version instead.","review":"David Lynch's dune is a monumental mess. The novel's fabulous story is now incomprehensible, and the film's poor editing and unwise choice of scenes to adapt makes the film feel choppy and unfocused. The special effects are terrible, the idea of a weirding module is hilariously bad, and the battle scenes are so poorly filmed, you'd think you were watching an Italian spaghetti western (actually, it's arguable action scenes in those were better). So see the 2000 sci-fi channel rendition instead, which unfolds in a captivating, enthralling manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the movie - NOT impressed with the blueray adaptation","review":"I took the wrapper off this last night and sat down for the 3 hour marathon.

Both the sound and the video were lacking the quality that I have been taught to expect from blueray."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DVD?","review":"The movie looks like a poor quality Kazaa download burnt onto a DVD.

It is a masterpiece! However, in a reverse of the usual read-the-book: watch-the-movie usually disappoints, it is the opposite here. You simply will not get it, you will not feel it unless you read every word of the book. Herbert is a genius and this movie does not disappoint.Use the book as a primer, than grab the popcorn and put your head in a good place."},{"rating":"1","title":"VIDEO NOT 1080P OR I","review":"I had been waiting for the bluray version; but his is poorest quality not even 720p more like VHS transfered to cd.

Then I read the book, and realised just how BAD it was in comparison. It's now impossible for me to watch this and NOT think about what it could have been, if there'd been a genuine attempt to transfer the book's depth to the screen.Not bad if you've never read the book; but if you love good sci-fi, READ THE BOOK INSTEAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, good movie --- just don't compare the two","review":"I saw this movie long before I read the book. Maybe that's why I like it. Big fans of the book seem to not like the movie since it isn't very faithful to the book. Me, I can enjoy the visuals of the movie and enjoy the literature of the book separagely. Compare the two and the movie fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent visual interpretation of Herbert's classic novel","review":"Dune the movie is an outstanding translation of Herbert's *very* original novel. If you read the book (and I HIGHLY recommend doing this before you see the movie) you'll find that the fusion of gothic and sci-fi story elements are well represented. But, be aware that Dune is a complex story, with at least six interweaving plot elements and the movie will likely be incomprehensible if this is all you see. And so I give the movie 4 stars because it is such a literal translation of the book that it needs some explanation to the lay moviegoer. Get the expanded version if possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The subject is the DVD format","review":"I think the movie is a 4 star movie. But, I am commenting about the DVD format. This DVD was not \\"cleaned up\\" for the release. The movie was cut big time to fit on DVD. When I buy a DVD, I expect a lot. That is why I bought a DVD player. Why not release it as the director's cut and clean that film?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A popular misconception about the 'Alan Smithee' version...","review":"The TV version which Lynch disowned was LONGER, not shorter than the theatrical release, with much footage from the original five hour rough cut. For instance, instead of Irulan's opening prologue we get a much longer intro from an old man (don't know who). There are also scenes involving Gurney playing music, and scenes with Gurney and the Duke, plus the (disgusting)scene which details the distillation of the water of life. The footage was often badly acted and added nothing to the film, reportedly, and hence Lynch disowned it with the classic 'Alan Smithee' pseudonym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal another studio disappoints me","review":"Well I was hoping for the whole movie. The director's cut of this movie. Which was excellent. But of course the studio sells the cheap version of the movie. I wish these studios would give the consumer what they want. I want all those scenes that you deemed to delete, which then makes people ask well why did he do that? I all these studios realize their stupid mistakes and put out some better dvd's with more features. Like a director's cut, or deleted scenes, behind the scenes. In my opinion don't buy this movie wait and hope it comes out in the director's cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Dune story made today would work","review":"This DVD should be great. But people looking for a complete or mythical 6 hour version are the same people looking for the Holy Grail. This is the best we are going to get it seems. (Unless they can find missing footage. Was it mysteriuosly destroyed like Blue Velvets?) After the Lord of the Rings success I hope filmakers revisit the Dune Series. The Lynch one is great and visually stunning, but the books and further story have much to relate to in today's world.(Robots going wild, the drug trade, bad Leaders, war etc.) Someone like Peter Jackson should make the Dune series of movies. A master at making thick and interesting literary material into a visual narrative he could and should make the Dune books a reality. If the unfilmable Lord of the Rings can be made, and made well, Dune deserves another look. until that happens, this DVD should be watched and put in the context of Lynch's life and films. Which is of the highest quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll miss the sea...","review":"Even virtually 15 years (can you believe that!) after it's initial release it still mesmorizes me. Although there are obvious holes in the movie that those of us who read the novel are very much aware of, this adaptation of Frank Herberts epic novel feeds the imaginative senses with its wild, fantastic and mystifying vision of a world and a future that descriptively displays the familiar and continual struggles and intrigues of empire and civilization that is the story of human history. Schemes and plots, mystery and fantasy, sacrifice and violence, trials and triblutation, this story has it all. I highly recommend this movie and just like many other I know, still hope for the release of the 190 minute version which helps fill some of the holes found in the initial theatre release. The absolute best closing music score I've heard, ever. It just so perfectly complemented the movie. any way, I've babbled enough about this movie.....indeed, THEY SHALL COME ALL FOR VIOLENCE.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique, one of its kind, Sci-fi film.","review":"True, Dune is NOT a film too easy to digest with a TV dinner. It is immense, shocking and confusing. One has to watch it for several times before full comprehension. I have watched it at least 15 times, and still I find in it new elements (some very well and intentionally hidden) and disturbing innuendos. It is far from being Lukas' white and plasic sci-fi world, quite the contrary. It is a world of desires and mostly cruelty of oil, blood, sand and disease. One has to know darkness in order to know light... is the common motif. It is a pity that the 4 hour version is practically a collector's item and not to be found. ELRIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious, Pseudo-religious Bombast!","review":"I am a fan of the original books written by Frank Herbert.A 2 hour movie could never hope to capture the detail present in those novels.David Lynch does not attempt it. His Dune looks like a slice of religious instructional propaganda from the year 10 000 A.D. You can't watch this as a version of the book, it almost isn't. It's a peek into the Dune universe and enjoyable in its resulting inscrutability.If you can learn to enjoy movies for something other than straight narrative and character development, then you might enjoy this. leave that stuff to other movies.I still think it sets the pace for visual interpretations of science fiction novels. When I read Dune, I think of the David Lynch movie. The mini-series looked like a campy stage production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sharpness and clarity","review":"Well, you may nitpick this DVD with \\"weak blacks\\", etc., etc., but the bottom line is that if you watch the VHS and then slap in the DVD, you'll notice about a 500% difference in clarity and sharpness. This DVD is a MUST for anyone who has watched the VHS for the past few years and want to upgrade!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish","review":"This movie is beautiful and reflects some of excerpts of the true spirit of Frank Herberts vision. Do not even think about bying a Dune miniseries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie other can't Rivel","review":"When I first saw this movie I was a little disappointed in the details left out of the novel. But after seeing a more lavish production that was just an abject failure, I realized that this was a great movie of a great science fiction novel. I still think Gordon R. Dickson's Dorsai would make a better movie, but it would be harder to get the subtile shadings of meaning. It is capturing what makes a science fiction novel great in film that is hard! This version of Dune is a success at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"My vote for the worst film ever made.....","review":"It is quite telling that that the only people I've met who have enjoyed this film saw it while stoned. Let's face it folks, this film is pretentious, dull, lifeless, incoherent, and all the analysis in the world won't make it any more entertaining. Frankly, I don't care if this film holds the secrets to life's meaning; it's still unwatchable. Who are these characters? What does the plot mean? Who could possibly care? Save some time and take a nap instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes no sense if you haven't read the book, and a bad adaptation if you have.","review":"I watched the bluray Dune a few days after I read the book. I can say that the movie is terrible by comparison.As others have said, it seems that they tried to stuff too much into this film without actually going into any details. Most characters seem completely misrepresented in my opinion for what little you are able to see of individual characters, and there is not explanation of the background or process of events. For example, in one scene Paul decides that he must ride a worm, then in the following scene, he does it right away without any indication of being trained or any time passing. This story should not be told in a 2 hour movie. It is impossible to understand what is going on and why unless you have the time to explain and develop ideas. If you enjoyed the book, do yourself a favor and pass this movie up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Sci-Fi Remake, for your own sake!!!","review":"David Lynch killed the mystical world that Frank Herbert created. It diverts so much from the wonderfull book, that most of the plot is lost, and the rest is a botched attempt. So many things are left out that are key elements to characterization, that if you havent read the book, you have only a shallow idea of what is going on. But if you have read the book and then watch this, then you are disgusted. The sci-fi remake is well worth your money, and sticks to the book for the most part, making it a worthy version of Frank Herberts epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS FILM IS BAD BY: ANTHONY BENEDETTO","review":"A FILM THAT COULD BE LOADS OF FUN...

What I read was a thrilling political novel, only set in another time and another place.

I wonder if Lynch really read the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book, don't watch the movie","review":"This movie did have some redeaming factors, but it isn't really worth the effort of sitting through it.

If you really want an enjoyable experiance, read Frank Herbert's book, which is definately more worthwhile than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wait","review":"This is not an entirely comprehensible version of the book. There is a longer - I believe 3 1/2 hour version of the video that can be found in some exotic video stores that will eventually be transferred to DVD (I hope) which is a much more satisfying series of selected illustrations of the book. But the book is so well written (in parts) that it would be worth the effort just to skip this altogether"},{"rating":"2","title":"Many extras can be found on this BLU RAY but...","review":"... the overall image quality isnt really good!

Others learned to love this master piece of sci fi done with no holds barred on the excellent filming, acting, directing, and music. Truly David Lynch was masterful. Ok, now let's get to the 'Extended Version' . This was just god-awful, it is obvious why David Lynch refused to have his name associated with the ridiculous mess with added footage and where good footage was replaced with bad. This version could be the basis for an entire course for movie Editors. It clearly makes one appreciate what good editing can do for a film, and how bad editing can destroy it -as it did for this Extended version of Dune. No wonder they had to use a fake director's name like 'Smithe'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starting Point for the Gigantic Space Saga","review":"Frank Herbert's Dune series is a lot more than the origianl story for 1984 David Lynch film. 2-hour theatrical version is a nice starting point if you are not that deep sci-fi fans. Now you can have the extended version or 3-volume TV movie version with different cast of characters.What the movie connoisseirs must not overlook in this film is not the basic line of story which cannot be complete but the artworks, music and excellent works of acting done by the super British actors. TOTO also did the brilliant score music adding some rock vibe to the background music when the sandworms move. Artworks also are stellar blending well with modern gadget and classic European decor. Sting as an actor did brilliant acting and the last duel scene is a must-see part.Verdict: An entertaining adaptation of Frank Herbert's huge saga.Rating: 88 out of 100Recommended for: Casual movie fans, TOTO and Sting fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aspect ratio comparison . . .","review":"Just to add this bit of information; the Dune \\"Extended Edition\\" DVD spoken of here is a true widescreen version - after the Introduction at the beginning of the film. I compared a VHS recording of a Sci-Fi channel broadcast to this DVD. My hopes wained at the beginning; the Introduction montage does simply have black bars thrown up over top of the 4:3 image to give the impression of widescreen. Immediately following the Introduction, however, though the bars stay the same proportion of the screen, the viewable area IS extended. (Yay for a real widescreen version!). So, whether or not you like this version, the DVD provides something I've never seen before, certainly not on DVD.Hope this helps!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First time I recommend the DVD for the extras..read on.","review":"This will be the shortest review I write for Amazon. The only reason to buy this DVD is for the deleted scenes and the special features. If you believe this to be the seminal Dune movie, then hit the back button. If you believe the Sci Fi Channel Dune and Children of Dune mini series were far more true-to-the-book than the theatrical or extended version of the De Laurentis movie, then you will see why the former fell flat. The deleted scenes are so powerful and evocative of the book and it was a shame they weren't incorporated into the movie. Even the long and somewhat choppy Princess Irulan intro was refreshing.Buy it for the deleted footage, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This movie leaves so many important details from the book out that it is really confusing and hard to follow.

However I never watched the movie cause I kept hearing and reading it was awful. On a whim I bought it on DVD last year and was very surprised to find a genuinely brilliant movie. It has a sweeping epic feel reminiscent of Lawrence of Arabia but with a lynchian character of its own. If watched with an open mind (and preferably with a projector an a large screen) this movie will reward you. Having watched the recent awfully childish, stupid and very boring TV series adapted from Dune makes me appreciate this movie even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The book was better\\"","review":"I made the mistake of seeing this movie before reading the book on which it was supposedly based. At first, I thought it was an interesting enough movie, with a few oddities and curious names thrown in, but then I read Frank Herbert's masterpiece, Dune. This film throws all the important details out the window, discarding key concepts that make Herbert's Dune Novels some of the most memorable books in the science fiction world. I must give the director credit for creative (if completely inaccurate) sets and props, and going through all this trouble to create a movie that didn't do so well, but the film doesn't do the book justice. Read Dune first, and you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludicrous.","review":"I understand that no movie is ever just like the book. However, the movie shouldn't casually discard key premises of the book the way this one does. I think Lynch's decision to convert the Bene Gesserit fighting techniques of the book into \\"weirding modules\\" that shoot death rays ultimately cheapened the entire story.I could live with the weird visuals of the movie if they had been made to serve the purposes of the book, but as it is, Lynch went too far afield."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!","review":"I'm feeling like I missed something considering all the positive reviews the other Amazon cutomers wrote.

I read a lot of reviews on here about David Lynch legacy garbage...I could care less about the director, Santa Claus could have directed it for all I care as long as it's faithful to the novel. This didn't accomplish it. Don't even get me started on \\"Toto\\" doing the music. I expected them to break out with \\"Africa\\" at any moment. An epic story deserves an epic soundtrack.

Unsurprisingly (given the length of the original book) the story is truncated here, with the result that the Fremen lose some of their mysticism and we don't get a impression of the great leader Muad'Dib becomes. But all the essential elements are here: the spice Melange, the worms, the glowing blue eyes and the Harkonnen-Atreides feud.

What water means to the people, how Paul had to earn the Fremen's repect, how he failed on his 1st attempt to ride a sandworm, not to mention the landslide that burries his mom, and definitely how it only took one night for them to get across the desert.

Dune, however, catches that deep mysterious, psycholigical character of the book most brilliantly. I have seen 3 different edits of this movie. I, like someother reviewers here, want the entire film, all scenes, unedited, in one volume; both DVD and VHS (for those of us without DVD players). At heart this is not a special effects sci-fi movie. There are some original effects but at the heart of the movie is a psycholgical, mysterious type thriller. I think that this is one of the best movies of the last 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had the four hour version","review":"I love this movie, but I do wish that there was a full edition of the movie out on DVD or even Video. I have it on VHS and DVD and the DVD has a little more, very little, like a minute of two. I just wish I could see the full version, just once. PLEASE RELEASE THE FULL MOVIE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A step short of wonderful","review":"Dune, as a novel, is incredible. To make the transition to a movie would be difficult, if not impossible. David Lynch made an excellent attempt, and while the version sold commercially is unfortunately difficult to follow for the Dune Novice, the uncut version is fantastic(if you have the time!)My major complaint is the lack of attention to Liet-Kynes and the Fremen society, which is the center of Dune. Too much assumption is made by Lynch.If you're interested in Dune, read the book. The movie is a nice addition, but is also completely unnecessary. :) Just enjoy the weirdness of it.What a story. I hear it's being remade, based exclusively on the novel, so we may yet gain further visual insight into Mr. Herbert's ecological epoch."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned","review":"DVD was not compatible with my player.

The movie itself - especially if you are a Dune sci fi fan - is excellent, a very good rendition of the book. And the BluRay quality is up to snuff for a movie of this age.-'s - The BluRay functionality is clunky. The change from entry to menu to play to actually seeing the movie is incredibly slow. Don't lose your patience because it will eventually come onto your screen. The other mind bloggling goof is if you pause the movie, it goes into some kind of stasis and reverts to start. DO NOT DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE YOUR CONTROLS ONCE YOU HAVE BEGUN.In short, for Dune lovers it's a great movie as long as you can bear with the poor functionality around the presentation. Hang in there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dune - Awesome Movie!","review":"I own the original, extended version and now the Blu-Ray version.

No wonder David Lynch disavows this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie","review":"I think this is a good movie. You might have to watch it twice before you understand it. The story has been compressed very tightly, transitions are short, characters develop suddenly, and nearly every line of dialogue is essential. This doesn't prevent it from being an enjoyable movie; it just requires the viewer to pay close attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good portrait of Dune","review":"The movie is a little cheesy, but dark and strange enough to be original.

The only exception to this being the title scenes of the TV Version which are presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio created by cropping (matting) the 4:3 TV Version.To say again in no uncertain terms: The TV Version of Dune offered on this DVD set (ASIN:B0007PAMR4) IS presented in 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.I make a point of mentioning this as this has been an area of uncertainty for quite some time with much speculation circulating (as perpetuated by reviews like the one written by \\"T. F.\\" from Visalia, CA)Please see here: http://www.duneinfo.com/giedi_prime/dvd_extended/ for screenshots and further confirmation of this fact.Also it can be confirmed that this release does NOT contain a DTS track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive transfer for this 22 years old cult sci fi","review":"Whether you adore or totally disdain Dune( that's the kind of film ), the original movie from David Lynch, the hi def 1080p transfer really shines. The Universal compressor(s) that did the job really made it to be one of the very few pristine movies from the 80s comparable to video quality of newer releases being 5-10 years old. Interior shots are incredibly rich, detailed ( even revealing source focus and limitations, yet very occasionally ). However, some black spots, exteriors at night and special effects still show some grain and noise - but how to expect better from analog effects made then ?Sounds are OK, sometimes amplified through good bass effects ( like the thumper scenes ). Extras are on standard def, as for any catalog movie.Dune HD DVD will most probably be the ultimate home version for the years to come. Highest recommendation possible, for fans of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"In Dune, Frank Herbert crafted a complex society with extreme deftness. The book contains so many layers that one can read it again and again -- as I have at least once a year for the past 30 years -- appreciating it anew each time. OTOH, this movie is so cartoonish and ham-handed, that it made me squirm with discomfort. All of the subtlety of the book was discarded in favor of special effects and carpet-eating performances. Possibly the most distressing feature was the transmutation of Voice from a special physical ability developed through diligent effort into a mechanically-produced effect. Since one of the underlying tropes of the book is the development of self, this betrayal of the essential unity of the piece was shocking in the extreme. Save your money, and read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustingly Terrible","review":"Dune is my favorite book. This is one of the worst book to movie adaptations I have ever seen. Fans of the book will notice many glaring inaccuracies, the story speeds by in a blur of confusion and everything seems rushed. The Sardaukar uniforms look like the came out of a a childrens' cartoon mixed with a nuclear powerplant. If you like Dune, skip this mess and buy the superior Sci-Fi channel six hour-long epic. If Frank Herbert saw this, he would be disgusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious! Not Atreides!","review":"This is the worst possible adaptation imaginable. I would have given them credit for changing the story in positive ways -- due to the difficulty of translating such a complex novel. However, this adaptation doesn't even succeed as good space opera.The script, the art direction, the editing -- everything about this movie sucks.I'm not one of those people who thinks that a movie should be faithful to a novel. In fact, a few movies have been definitely better than their books -- notably Jaws, even Silence of the Lambs (book was very good, the movie a masterpiece). However, the point in changing a story is to make something worth watching. Read the book and hope someone makes a better version some day. (I don't recommend the whole of Herbert's series. Dune is excellent. The rest get worse in rapid progression)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the book instead.","review":"If you've heard all of the hype about DUNE and want to experience it for yourself, DON'T get this movie. A lot of it is hard to understand if you haven't read the book first, and there is so much left out of the movie. They could have made the movie 12 hours long, and it still would have been missing stuff.The book is my favorite novel of all time; the movie is something I could have lived without. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacrilege to an epic!","review":"Ok, I admit I'm kind of a goofball. I knew this ENTIRE movie by heart for over a decade, and when I saw this, I was appalled. I only watched the first 20 mins of it before shutting it off, so my opinion will be short, but heated.The voiceover that was once Virginia Madsen is know some annoying older guy, and quoted Ms. Madsen rather poorly. He did get the year wrong (it's 10191, not 10192 like he said).The handdrawn pics depicting the \\"Butlerian Jihad\\" were cheesy, which was misnamed the 'Great Revolt'.What killed this movie for me was a severe mix-match of graphics. This is where I have to get into the storyline. When the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohaim was to report to Caladan to meet Paul Atreides, they showed her as a passenger, sitting behind 2 Harkonnen pilots on their ship...flying toward the city of Arakeen on Arakis!!! WTF???That's where I shut it off. Thanks for reading my rant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the book a great diservice","review":"You know.... in the book, no one fights with the lasers and stuff that they used in the movie. A laser hitting a shield is supposed to cause a nuclear explosion. Oh, and the fremen used crysknives... swords made from the teeth of a worm, not stupid little devices that bluh stuff up based on voice... and the Atradies have fanatical troops because well... read the book. This movie should have had a different title, because it is only superficially similar to Frank Herberts great work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the book","review":"In 2004, I finally read Dune. Awesome story and I plan to read it again someday. Movies often fail to meet up to the book they are based upon and this is no exception, in my opinion. Maybe I am mesmerized by all the amazing special effects in movies these days, but I actually laughed much through this movie. I realize the story is complicated and long, but the 1984 version just doesn't cut it. I would LOVE to see a remake of this, not so much for updated special effects (the worms were great in the 1984 version) but for a more engaging storyline. Like LOTR, one is going to appreciate the movie much more if they've read the book, but LOTR followed the books quite well, IMO, AND they came out with movies that awed even non-book-readers. I think DUNE could be like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"as bad as it gets","review":"Without a doubt one of the worst sci fi movies ever made. A horrible movie. An incomprehensible \\"groaner\\" to any who loved Herbert's Masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"DUNE\\" gets better with age (and maturity)","review":"I think one of the main reasons the film bombed in 1984 was that the mainstream audience was not yet familiar enough with the \\"weird\\" and original artistry of David Lynch, despite the fact that \\"Elephant Man\\" had been nominated for oscars only 4 years earlier. Later, after \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"Twin Peaks\\", Lynch finally hit gold with the public. Watching \\"Dune\\" again after that or now, the film has a much more literal and appreciative quality. For those who can only deal with \\"speed\\" sci-fi films, stay away from this one. You just aren't intelligent enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is captivating","review":"NOTE WELL: As other reviewers have noted, you MUST avoid the t.v. version. It is AWFUL. Now:Dune is gorgeous, stunning, grand, ingenious, bizarre. If you wish to be transported through time and space, you can do no better.The use of the slightly silly weirding modules is perhaps the only significant drawback, serving as a convenient plot device. Brian Eno's score is compromised by Toto's \\"triumphant '80s guitar\\" (ick!) contribution. Beyond these minor points of inferiority, this movie is one of the most captivating cinematic experiences ever devised. And it is long. You must sit quietly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What about a special edition?","review":"For once, I had not read the books for Dune and thus have to look at the movie expecting exposition and plot to explain itself. Well, it doesn't. The movie is long and intriguing, in fact the more I watch it, the more I want to watch it. Why? The bizarre costumes and convoluted story actually make the movie act as a strange narcotic.So many things are not explained, some can be infered, but much is lost. Are the Harkonans cannibals? Are they gay (not meaning to be derogatory-> there are no women), and so on.To be true, when I watched the 3+ hour Japanese Laserdisc (japanese subtitles), much more is explained in the prologue, and the cut scenes. And the few times the Sci-Fi channel played the uncut TV edition, again more is explained.Suffice it to say, this does not stand well on it's own. It is fun and not to be missed, but reading Dune and Dune Messiah are prerequisites for seeing the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dune Bad","review":"This is one very poorly made movie.

It's still hard to believe the first book was written in 1965 when horn-rimmed glasses were still in style. The 1984 movie version is, unfortunately, truly awful. Truly awful. There are some great actors in the movie who perform embarrassingly bad. The movie comes across as an odd blend of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" and science fiction movie special effects made about 20 years before the original 1976 Star Wars.

I must admit it did have some problems, number one of which is that it was too long. But I liked it a great deal. Richard Lynch, who directed this film has directed some impressive movies including the brilliant Blue Velvet. Several actors from Blue Velvet also played in this movie and played intense characters. The evil aliens in this movie represented by the Harkonnen's were top rate bad guys played by Sting and Kenneth McMillan. For me the movie really worked because is of it's weirdness and brutality. I see weirdness as a strength in science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's not even good","review":"The most interesting thing about this movie is that you can see how George Lucas ripped off the original book, 'Dune' by Frank Herbert, for his 'Star Wars' series. By the time Lucas gets to filming 'The Phantom Menace,' he has graduated to David Lynch's level of making sci-fi movies like 'Dune.' These kind of movies are filled with sword fighting, endless expository monologues, stilted dialogue, worries over economic warfare and pained attempts to invoke classical and religious themes. This movie shows Kyle Machlan teaching ragtag sand dwellers how to tear apart stone by making resonating sounds with their voices. Oh, and it has big worms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"For anyone who has read Frank Herbert's Dune, this Lynch adaptation is an absolute farce. The star-studded cast notwithstanding, there is nothing redeeming about this movie.

Evidently, the manufacter of this Dune DVD never bother to check quality of it's product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is TERRIBLE!","review":"This movie is terrible on so many levels it is hard to do it justice here. The acting is terrible. The story is terrible. The special effects are terrible. Fans of the book will hate it because it completely departs from the book. People who do not know the book will hate it because only someone who has read the book can even fathom watching it in the first place.Anyone who sees depth and meaning in this movie is intellectually masturbating. Save your money. Do not buy this DVD. Buy the Sci-Fi Mini-Series Version. I can only hope this review saves at least one person the pain of seeing this rendition of Dune."},{"rating":"2","title":"lynchian inspired","review":"to appreciate this film you need to think of it as yet another david lynch film inspired by the book. it is rare to see people complain about the differences between 'blade runner' and 'do androids dream of electric sheep' because i believe most people accept, it is ridley scott's vision inspired by the book. once you have seen david lynch's 'blue velvet' and 'mulholland drive' and approach 'dune' as a david lynchian inspired vision all the comparisons will become meaningless and you will be swept away by this fantastical dream. the four star rating is simply because david lynch did not have full control over the project, one can only wonder what could have been. nevertheless i still prefer the shorter theatrical release, because sometimes, less is more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film","review":"This is a great adaption of the book. It still holds up today. Costumes, sets and acting all great. Especially the performance by Sting. Wish he would do more acting. I really liked the remake of the story the made for TV one with William Hurt, but this film still is the top for me. Well worth the price, and something you can see over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the Baron himself.","review":"Other than the total inaccuracies in the entire thing, and how nothing was explained, leaving anyone who hasn't read the book clueless. (Hell I studied the book and I'm still quite confused as to how things happened) They did not spend NEARLY enough time showing Fremen culture, or the struggles Paul and Jessica went through post-attack. I did not feel connected to anyone in any way, so when a character reappeared, or was in danger, I was like \\"nah man i don't even care\\".Overall this movie was complete garbage. If you have read the book and are debating watching this movie I wouldn't, you'll be sorely disappointed. If you haven't read the book, go read the book and never watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I get eaten by a worm, I won't have to watch this . . .","review":"There are different ways to approach a subject as complex as Dune:You can either take the time to tell the story properly, which requires either a mini-series or a series of movies (a la Lord of the Rings). You can also boil the story down to the bare minimum and tell a very basic story, or you can do what they attempted to do here, which was to take the entire story and compress it into two hours.The end result, of course is similar to flying over Disneyland. Sure, you get an idea of what's going on, but you miss actually experiencing it.Dune is like that. Huge chunks of narrative exposition and brief, shallow storytelling that doesn't have the time to explore anything in depth.Save yourself.

However, I am very disappointed. There are 5 parts (6 if you include the lid) to this bottle. If not put together just right, they leak! The bottom of this bottle screws on. It has 2 parts. The liner must be put in the bottle just right and then screwed on tight. The nipple must be pulled all the way through (you'd think that'd be easy to tell, huh). If either of these areas aren't put together right, WATCH OUT! Oh, and be careful trying to tighten one end while holding the other. Nothing like a lap full of liquid!One other thing, this bottle takes longer to warm than other bottles whose bottoms aren't as bulky.I would not buy this bottle again.

I don't know if the constant dribble is to resemble let down??? Anyway, would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lot of work","review":"Well first off these tended to be leaky. The bottom had to be screwed on super tight not to leak, then it would be difficult to unscrew to clean. And it must be unscrewed everytime you wash it or milk gets caught in it. Also my son didn't take to the nipples. So we used the avent w/these, but though the avent appeared to fit, they often leaked by the nipple w/the avent nipples. Perhaps if your baby likes these nipples and you don't mind the bottom part then they would work for you. Oh yeah I bought them to save looking for a cheaper bpa free bottle w/a wide neck.

I still don't know how it works.The rest of the book is a very dry, vague desciption of the Cularin system. The system is so broad and generic that any reasonable GM should be able to re-create the same thing with a pencil and piece of paper.

I consider myself an above average reader and I must say that I struggled all the way through. The book would have been far more enjoyable had Mapp conversed in a style more acceptable to those of us who aren't quite up to his education level.His use of language, quite frankly, makes his biography quite boring.

After I finished reading I found myself becoming a raving fan of his \\"art\\". I use the commas because to me he lacks the art aspect and his art is purchased because of the man behind the paintings(Which I learned from Phoebe's book). He is more of a pioneer of street art, having made it so much more commercially available to the public; but he is the street in essence. Phoebe painstakingly researched Basquait through real life relatives and close friends, it almost felt as if she was becoming obsessed with him herself; perhaps that is merely me noticing the devotion to the writing material...If you are a fan of art and expressionism you will find a kindred spirit in Basquait.

This is a book about fame. It took Ms. Hoban 7 years to write about an artist whose career wasn't even that long. This is a book about the eighties, fame, and excess. You will not learn much about Jean-Michel by reading this book. You will learn about the climate of the eighties art world and the ever-present parasites that the enormous speculation over great artists can create(Braghoomian for instance). The photographs of Jean-Michel are interesting, but because of the ownership of the artist's works, none are present to look at while reading this work. Buy a book of Basquiat's work if you are interested in the artist.

I had high hopes, but upon first listen I discovered this album really lacked everything previous albums had. Even \\"CLAYMAN\\" which I also thought was a very horrible album beats this. It's main problem is its not In Flames. It sounds like some Nu-Metal band trying to be something their not. I do like Nu-Metal, but In Flames isn't that type. They never have been, and they shouldn't have changed. They made a big mistake with this album. They also created a void in fans with this album. Even if their next album were back to basics it wouldn't be able to save this fan. I like change, but I like change for the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad....","review":"I bought the CD.

Back when Whoracle was new I was listening to it constantly. Then Colony was just as awesome. Then Clayman was awesome too... but granted not their best. Now I think their popularity has overcome them. To be honest with you, I think they are trying to sound like Soilwork on this album; and do it poorly. And whats with all the ... quiet clean vocals? They sound awful. ... If you heard this cd and didnt know it was In Flames, you'd probably say it [wasn't good]. Bad CD; not In Flames. VERY DISSAPOINTING"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tired of the N-bomb","review":"I am a huge In flames fan, I own every cd (except the live in tokyo one) and I have had the incredible priviledge of seeing them live.The main message I want to get across is to possible newcomers to in flames reading all these reviews and getting the idea that this and STYE are \\"nu-metal.\\" First of all, when did nu-metal become a dreaded insult? Second In Flames is not and has never been nu-metal.These two albums definately have a different feel to them than earlier works, but they are still heavy, they are still very much In Flames. People are always to afraid of change. Don't listen to the band-wagon saying they sold out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing And Generic","review":"In Flames has officially lost their touch. WIth this album, they moved themselves into the generic mainstream metal genre, and in doing so, turned themselves into \\"just another\\" band.

I loved every album they made before this one, and I've hated every album after it. A true shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a \\"reload\\"","review":"Ok after Clayman came out I'm sure noone thought that In Flames were ever gonna go back to their previous sound. This album, however is NO \\"ReLoad or Load\\", I see it more of an \\"Tuonela or Um Universum\\". So their style is different from what they were six years ago, but bands change and if every album they put out sounded like Jester Race I dont think I'd own all of them. You need some variety. Granted few songs didnt have to be on the album but Cloud Connected, Reroute to Remain, Dark Signs, Drifter, and Dawn of a New Day make this album worth owning. Andres hits all the notes and I give him credit for using some clean vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great record","review":"This is a great record.Sure it is melodic. It is also very good.The more I listen, the more I like.I think it is the best In Flames yet, and so will you if you have any sense.It is heavy, powerful, emotional, man, it is just an excellent metal album.I can hardly wait for the next one already.I hope they come tour America, and bring Soilwork with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome, but bad production","review":"im really giving this 4 1/2 stars, because the production is really bad.

I have been a fan of In Flames since \\"Whoracle\\", and have bought the last 2, \\"Colony\\", and \\"Clayman\\". I don't care what anyone says, this cd is awesome. There isn't really a bad song on here. This band hasn't \\"sold out\\", they have just gotten better and expanded their musical ability.

Sure their album cover doesnt fall under the formula of their previous art and the lyrics are a little different, but really if you are going to make a life of art based on a simple formula, then its all over before you begin. With reroute to remain, in flames puts forth some of their most solid work ever. All the songs sound like a band with excellent chemistry. The only gripe would be the slight lack of guitar solos. However, long time in flames fans sould not be disapointed at all. All the songs have the classic in flames vibe to them. This is solid in flames."},{"rating":"2","title":"True metal doesn't get any better then in-flames!","review":"In-flames is defenaly any true deathmetal head's first pick!

If you want that, go buy Dying Fetus - Stop At Nothing or any Cannibal Corpse album. If you want something with a little more substance, then i suggest this disk. Yes, they have succumbed to writing catchy, melodic music...so what? If there wasn't any evolution in the world of metal, we'd still be in the duldrum world of Black Sabbath and Motorhead (gross). Final word, open your mind to the possibility that there are different types of \\"extreme\\" music, whether or not they have melody as a musical basis.

I'm not a fan of nu metal and to me, that's what it sounds like. I don't think In flames are selling out or anything like that I think they were simply experimenting. What ruins this album for me is purely the way its been produced. The catchy melodies typical of In Flames are still present but it seems they've been put into the back ground and a thrashy nu metal guitar rhythm overpowers them in the foreground. I find myself straining my ears to hear the real music. Its a bit of a shame really - I think it could have been a really good album. Having said that, the track Metaphor is a little bit different, very interesting and worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down...","review":"Ive been into In Flames since the day \\"The Jester Race\\" came out, so I can proudly say they have been my favorite band..up until 9/3/02. Holy ... Batman, what a load of donkey doo-doo. I can honestly say this is not the old, good In Flames we used to know and love. Gone are teh uplifting melodies that used to be stuck in your head for days...replaced with some of the worst singing I have ever heard. His growling vocals are still jsut as good, but the clean vocals remind me of.. *shudder* Jonathan Davis of KoRn. The music is a bit heavier than previous albums, but that is becasue the melodies have been pretty much scrapped, and there are 3 or 4 solos on teh whole album, the weakest the band has ever done. If you are new to this band..please dont get this..get one of the masterpieces before The Jester Race, Colony, or Whoracle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even seem like In Flames","review":"I love just about every In Flames album except this one. Compared to my other favorites such as Episode 666, Clayman, Jotun, etc etc, these songs are horrible.

It only gets 2 stars overall from me though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reroute To Sellout","review":"Is this the same band that put out Whoracle or is this another Ozzfest//MTV NU-Metal band?

In Flames was one of the only bands I could count on to consistently put out good music... I guess that has come to an end with this ... of an album. They seem to be following in the the footsteps of another formerly good band, Amorphis.(If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out Tales from the Thousand Lakes, then check out Tuonela). There's terrible, at times laughable (non-death) vocals, rarely any decent guitar work, and mostly just the same tired, uninspired metal riffs we've heard a hundred times over. And that's not considering the corny ... lyrics (which you can now understand), poorly done keyboards and other annoying, terrible sounding ... that's thrown in there for good measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright, but doesnt match to their previous work","review":"all and all this is a decent album , but doesnt come close to the meoldic and heavy songs on colony, clayman, or whoracle , (my favorite in flames albums). this album just goes a little too mainstream and lacks some of the melodic, original solos that are on the previous albums. its almost like evry song sounds the same with a lame chorus added to it. Dont get me wrong, i love in flames and cant wait until their new album comes out, but i just hope its heavier and more melodic metal we have seen on their pervious works before R2R."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy another In Flames CD","review":"this disc is NOTHING compared to \\"The Jester Race\\", \\"Whoracle\\", and \\"Colony\\". im not saying that because i dont like the new sound (i like \\"Soundtrack to Your Escape\\", also), im just saying it because this album has 3 good songs...and thats all.Standout tracks: \\"Trigger\\" - one of the band's best songs (the album version is much better than the single version)\\"Reroute to Remain\\"\\"Cloud Connected\\" - i like the remix on the \\"Trigger\\" single better, though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff, not as good as old though.","review":"When I bought this CD I had mixed opinions about it. It has some good new material, Reroute to Remain, Trigger, Dark Signs, Clouds Connected, all good new stuff. It just doesn't compare to old In Flames, Jester Race, Colony, Clayman, they probably won't put out anything as gnarly as that again, put they still kick ass. The melody of their msuic has downgraded a bit, you can still find some, Trigger and Dark Signs are the best guitar lines on the CD by far, the rest of the songs sound a little the same and aren't as detailed. The clean vocals don't mix with their style that well, they are about melody. It's still a good CD, worth buying and all, but you should buy some of their old stuff first, it's better."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Flames: A New Direction","review":"In Flames has been, and always will be one of my favorite bands. Yes, it is true that they have slightly departed from their \\"old\\" sound, but that is to be expected after a band puts out about 8 albums (if you want to count Black Ash Inheritance, go ahead). How many bands can you think of that still have the same sound that they had on their latest album as they did on their first album?Peronally, I enjoy the new album. Songs like Cloud Connected, Drifter, and Egonomic have a heavy enough melody to them while others like Trigger and Dawn of a New Day infuse a little more melody. There really is something for everyone on this album. So if you ever actually liked In Flames you'll like this album. It may not be your favorite (mine is Colony), but you'll definitely find a few songs on it to warrant the disc some time in your CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great dissapointment","review":"I used to be a In Flames fan, but where are the double guitarmelodies and the cool structures. These are hits who are easily to listen to but none of them are any interesting or fun and they sound very similar. Buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and Better","review":"In Flames' albums each have such a distinctive sound you could probably convice someone unfamiliar with them that each CD is a different band. I have never been disappointed with any of their albums, and they are a fun band to watch just to see what they'll do next.Reroute to Remain is their most unique album yet, and possibly their best. I've never heard music so heavy, but yet so clean. It's loud and pounding without ever sounding messy or rough. RTR has a very digital sound to it, but it fits well with the music.If you've never listened to them, this is definitely the album to get to get into In Flames."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"What in frikkin hell happened? They are such sellouts, especially now they released the Trigger single with the new song 'watch them feed'. Thats a totally nu-metal song. I liked Clayman, I don't know why people bash it, it was a departure from their sound, but still was Swedish death metal. My favorite is still Whoracle. I only gave this 2 stars cause I still liked some songs on it, like Trigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak!!!","review":"This album put the classic heavy In Flames to shame. The clean vocals are much too poppy to be anything this band would put out. The music isn't wild enough either. I must agree with the aforementioned Dark album analogy. This is not black metal, simply put. People who do like intense death/black shouldn't look here, or even on Clayman for that matter. It's too bad they had to sellout and go for the masses instead of where they were truly appreciated. Fans of this album should check out Killswitch Engage, other pop-metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"New route for In Flames","review":"Not as good as whoracle and about as good as clayman. best song is egonomic. Its heavy and punkish. in falmes has a very new sound in this cd. They have more keyboards and synthesizers and Anders growls less. More mellow songs. Again, the lyrics arer verry well thought of."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN FLAMERS","review":"Way to be trendy and lose all your real fans. The people like me that have listened to metal since the early 70's know when a band sells out for the teenage audience and if want to get rich by marketing your music that way fine,but I'm listening to (Naglfar,Night In Gales,Dissection) while In Flames takes a downfall into NU-Metal.

Take for instance Metaphor, what is that even doing on the album, In Flames is usually way too creative to let a song that bad to make the final cut.Anyway lets get back to the main problem. The best example of the inconsistent song writing come when you listen to System. The song is one of the best songs they've ever recorded as long as you skip past the chorus, it just kills the song.The best song on the album is by far Black & White, it is the only song that has a chorus that doesn't destroy the balance of the song. It's one of their best songs ever.On the whole it's a pretty good album. By no means is it their best but, it's still In Flames so it's a step up from most other albums in it's genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"IN FLAMES!","review":"OK First I've got to say, I've been a FAN of in flames since 1999 when i saw them at a small club in seattle and let me tell you if you like old school HEAVY METAL like judas Priest and Iron Maiden, Groups like Mid-Late 1980's era Metallica & Megadeth You Will LOVE this group.. they have what most \\"metal\\" bands on Mtv don't have TALENT and the ability to get people to drive 100's of miles to see them in a small venue.

Normally, I only read books that would be dubbed 'classics' by masters such as Hemingway, Steinbeck, Dostoevsky, etc. As a result, I have EXTREMELY high standards when it comes to books and what constitutes good writing. This book absolutely DID NOT disappoint me. This book contains side-splitting humor, but there is so much more to it than that. Don't let the publisher's description scare you away-this book is brimming with insight, intelligence, and sensitivity as well as humor. It's compelling, extremely well written, and at times contains a type of sharp, biting satire that caused my eyes to be glued to the pages and left me pondering its meaning long after I set the book down. I enjoyed it immensely, and I can't wait to see what this author comes up with next!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful account of the history of Russia - not just for","review":"If you are afraid that you need to read War and Peace to learn about Russia, fear not.

But there is something here for lovers of things Russian of any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title...for an Eyewitness book","review":"Having purchased several Eyewitness books in the past, this book is very sketchy, just a basic history....on a grade school level.The seller got it to me promptly and in good condition, but I was disappointed with the content, not the seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible and unbelievable","review":"There is no need for me to exult to this movie, it is deservingly world famous. I do agree with one of the reviewes here that Mann's novella makes a different impression, although I would still hesitate to say that it's a swallower work of art. What I wanted to share is the feeling of before and after - if you see Venice first and then see the movie, and then come back to the city again, you will see it differenty. I do think that it's one of the most profoundly influential movies, and for everyone who liked it and appreciated the music there, Ludwig by Visconti is a must, too. Just to conclude, I did find it puzzling to find Death in Venice in the gay section in a video store; I think the movie is about the appreciation of beauty that goes beyond society-imposed limits and the individual's fright and astonishment when the power of beauty hits him. Enjoy this masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sad but beautiful","review":"Dirk Bogarde brought a sadness to his character that made me cry everytime he was on screen, especially when he went to the mens beauty shop, trying to look younger to attract the young boy he was infatuated with. Every shot in this movie looks like a painting. It was so beautiful and, dare I say it again, sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning.","review":"Death in Venice, is a visually alluring portrait of obsession, decay, beauty, and mortality. The dialogue is scarce, but I believe the film would not have worked out, if otherwise.You may or not like it, I can not say you will, like others have said, it is not for everyone, but I must say it is, for me, one of the most beautiful, touching films I have ever seen, if not the most. I found myself, entranced in a strange everlasting spell. I somehow, felt, Bogarde's emotions, and like him, I followed Andresen through the degenerated streets of Venice. I adored, idolized, the feeling of contrast, the imagery, between the decayed, horrific characters Bogarde/Gustav found in Venice, and the exquisiteness of a fifteen-year old boy.And you can never, ever go wrong with Mahler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"A classic! Not only is the cinematography superb, the acting and the dramatisation of the Thomas Mann novel---wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film of superior visual and emotional beauty","review":"What makes this a great film? Top of the list, of course, is Bogarde's amazing performance. Also, the haunting atmosphere that grabs you from the minute the boat appears through the mist. Meandering scenes and sparse dialogue provide an effective sense of place.It is not about homosexuality but about creativity and beauty and how, to appreciate these, we have to be truthful. Most of all, it is a very emotional film and that's the kind I like.What makes this a bad film? Not much. Some of the flashbacks are puzzlingly clumsy coming after the delicacy of earlier scenes. The dialogue in the flashbacks is like amateur dramatics.Generally, though, 'Death in Venice' is to die for."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst movie I have ever seen","review":"this is the worst movie I have ever seen. it was painful to watch the whole thing. the only reason I did end up watching it was I was a captive audience in a film class. this film has no entertainment value at all.

The trailer for this film is available at the Internet Movie Database, and if it doesn't completely turn you off, you probably will enjoy \\"Death in Venice\\"The film is elegantly shot, and it's pacing is so elegaic, you can feel the protagonist slowly loisng his will to fight against his worst instincts. Bogarde's twitchy performance is hugely watchable, and, for such a slow movie with very little dialogue, the big ideas are tossed out in noisy blasts (of course, it helps to have one of the characters as an obnoxious provocateur).Unfortunately, the film suffers from some rather abrupt editing, and the sound mix is awful. The scenery is so important that watching on video is also going to reduce the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film only for those gifted from Muses and Graces","review":"It is hard to believe that some fellow from Illinois or the Midwest in general may enjoy this Gift from Venus.

Guess those people never read the book, or any book by Thomas Mann, who is a great writer of caricature and humour. I personally think Bogarde nailed the part of the german intellectual who \\"has lived his life like a closed fist\\". With the exception of the flashbacks and the fact that Aschenbach should have been a writer, the film follows the book closely. I looked forward to seeing some of the comical highlights of the book, like the gypsy band, the annoying old makeup-wearing on the boat and my favourite: the visit to the hairdresser. Films are seldom as good as the books they are based upon, but I think this one is great as a supplement, as the spectacular setting can be difficult to visualize when reading, especially as it belongs to a long gone era.The DVD I wathched had the italian soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"beauty vs emptiness","review":"Despite the visual beauty , the exquisite music and outstanding performance by Dirk Bogarde..I still found this movie missing something. At first I wasn't sure what it was until I watched it a second time and realized that there was little,if any warmth in this film.The scenes in the hotel with the Countess feel 'staged' with the girls,in particular, sitting like dolls, barely showing any expression or reaction to conversations. The beach scenes,although it's summer have an oddly empty feel and look about them. I found it strange that a lady should be walking through what appears to be a rather dark and unsavory part of the city with her children... There is coolness everywhere..perhaps it's the light..perhaps it's the oh so leisurely visuals..but most of all, although the film is about love and obsession, I found little passion in it in the end. A very difficult role for Bogarde but he was extraordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"...simply beautiful...","review":"...and way ahead of its time...Dirk left us two solid gold treasures...\\"Victim\\" and \\"Death in Venice\\"...his finest works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine video but appalling audio","review":"Warner Bros strike again - ruining yet another cinematic masterpiece for DVD by ineptly encoding the audio as only Dolby Digital \\"1.0\\" - instead of \\"2.0 mono\\" or \\"2.1 mono\\" as most studios with half a brain (and an ounce of concern for their customers) would have done. Very few surround sound systems would have a full range centre speaker, and even if they did, they would find the audio on this DVD lacking in quality and presence. I was so annoyed with the audio that I found the DVD unwatchable in it's original form. Today I went to the trouble of doing a DVD-R copy, accepting the fact that the video would degrade slightly, but I ran the audio as downmixed 2 channel mono through a graphic equaliser to adequately boost the lower frequencies. I won't ever buy a DVD again which has its main audio track limited to Dolby Digital 1.0 and I recommend others do likewise."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a gem, history picture book makes GW come alive!","review":"Put this in your home library!

However, to turn on and off, you turn the switch clockwise. Well the way this lamp is designed, the switch you use to turn it on, it kind of like screwing a screw into a piece of wood. After you do it a certain number of times, it hits the end. And then it won't turn anymore, so you are either stuck with it off or on.You can mess with it for a minute or two to get it to turn on or off, by turning the switch counterclockwise. But after manipulating the switch like that for about 3-4 days, it just stops working completely. Now, I have it stuck in the \\"on\\" position, and I turn it on and off by plugging it in or unplugging it.I would definitely not recommend this lamp.

The cord on this lamp is way too short. As are all of them now at all the office supply stores as well. Also, if you handle the outside of the shade, you'll burn your fingers. It gets way too hot to the touch. One should be able to position where you want the light to shine (hence the bendable neck), however, after it's only been on 20 minutes, it'll burn the hand that tries to move it! It's very hot even with just a 60watt bulb that it uses, and by which it emits super great light for its size. I ordered these because I had gotten 8 of these type of clip-on lamps from Office Depot a year or so ago (a bit bigger) so they would throw out more light than the minis. I've loved them every day.

I let it cool down and the bubble is gone, but the surface is not smooth as before. I would be appreciated if you let me return this item now.*** My first Review:(3 stars) I got this for my dry eyes. It keeps the heat very good, like for 5 minutes. but its not in direct contact with eyes, there is a little space. However, it is very tightly touching around my eyes, and kinda burning. I heated in microwave for 20 sec as instruction said.I like the idea of rubber band used in this product. Also keeps the heat long enough. But I dont recommend for DRY EYES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and cool","review":"Light weight and used for post sinus surgery.

However, the product description at Amazon says that it can be heated in the microwave oven \\"or even hot water,\\" so my intention was to use it dampened. The directions that came with the device say \\"do not get the product's wet.\\" The two directions seem to be mutually exclusive. It is not worth my time to send it back, but if you want to use it for moist heat--forget about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This product is the best quick fix cure for head aches, eye cramps, restlessness, and as a general sleeping mask.

The stitching that held the outer cover onto the inner gel came unstitched. Not a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fit - Cold Just doesn't Last","review":"This mask fits nicely on your face, doesn't put a lot of pressure on the eyes and WHEN COLD it feels great. The biggest drawback is the cold sensation doesn't last for long. Mine lasted for 10-15 minutes and that was it after being in the freezer overnight. I just ordered another one as I like to have a 30 minute session. I just wish they could find a way to make the chill in the gel last longer-- the mask is just the right size (even for a guy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works!","review":"So soothing.

I was using theCervical Collar by Elasto-Gelover my eyes and forehead for headaches and such and was so pleased to find this version of the Elasto-Gel. The products are great ... meaning they are very comfortable and well constructed.I use them for their cooling not for heat. The unit can be heated in a microwave or conventional oven or placed in the freezer. Super versatile and when used for cooling, it is not cold enough to cause ice burn / frostbite and merely is extra cool. Super soothing. The cooling factor lasts for about 20 minutes. I can switch off between both of mine but may consider buying another mask in the future.Great for hot flashes too :)5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"The cold and hot functions work great, although you do need to remember that it won't be staying at that temperature for very long.

If this is intended then I apologize and will change this to a better rating, but it looks odd to me. And it's not mentioned anywhere about there being a giant part that isn't stitched closed. It's kind of in the middle but more to the left a little bit. And also when the product came the velcro part of the strap was stuck to the blue gel part (the side you put on your face) and even while gently pulling it off it managed to damage it a little bit. While that's a bummer, the biggest issue for me is the stitching at the top. As far as I'm aware there's no reason to ever take it out of it's pouch so why would it be like that? I hope they didn't send me a used product..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money!","review":"This mask is worthless if you plan on using it as a cooling mask.

Be aware however that some animals are duplicated in other sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed fan","review":"I have read all the 'in death' books and often count the days until the next one comes out but I was very disappointed in 'Purity in Death'. The playful 'here they go again' tone to the rampant sexuality of the books was completely overshadowed by the unnecessary introduction of practices that shouldn't be hinted at, much less described in detail and the vivid descriptions of crime scenes (which usually drive home the grisly nature of police work) were painted with such minute and gory detail as to be completely distracting from the story line and, frankly, nauseating! Reality may have it's place (even in fiction) but if I wanted to be scared and sickened by what I read, I'd read the daily newspaper.Because overall the series is so entertaining, I will no doubt read the next offering but if you're picking up J.D. Robb for the first time, I don't recommend you start with this one.In fact ... unless you're an addict don't read this one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Techno Babble Bore","review":"Robb/Roberts may have romantic novel qualities, but lacks originality and persuasion in the crime sector. None of the past reviewers seems to have noticed that the book is based on the movie script for the \\"Star Chamber\\" (with Michael Douglas), with a few added features.

The further down she digs, the higher up their suspects seem to go.As Eve and Roarke try to follow their leads back to the killers, Peabody and McNab draw closer. And another secondary character announce big news that makes Eve squirm.Reading the \\"In Death\\" series is like coming home. The mystery is always engrossing, but it's watching the characters develop, watching their relationship evolve, that keeps bringing me back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Reading this series in order is not necessary, but makes it more interesting since the development of the character of Lt. Eve Dallas is part of the compelling draw of the JD Robb books. Robb spins a good mystery and is creative and unique in the plot lines. What is disappointing, however, are the love scenes. They are cookie-cutter and as someone continues to read the books, you find phrases and adjectives that are the same over and over again. Additionally, with each successive book, those scenes become nearly brutal. This is, of course, a fantasy and given that, if you find these scenes tedious, you can skip ahead because they don't add to the plot line one bit. I will suggest, however, that the romance, no matter how it is presented, does contribute to the discontent of all women in all relationships. Nevertheless, they do not diminish the character development which is nicely paced and accurately presented in light of the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robb is #1 in Death","review":"I picked up this book after hearing women on my Janet Evanovich e-list raving about how good this series was. I was leery. I've read Nora Roberts. I don't like her! I was supposed to read something else by her and enjoy it? Oh I don't think so.I was pleasantly surprised! I found this book to be refreshing in its creativity and characterization. Eve Dallas is a woman to envy. She's witty, intelligent, and she's got a drop dead gorgeous husband.She is won't let anything keep her from finding out what is going on with murderous victims' displaying \\"ABSOLUTE PURITY ACHIEVED\\" on their computer screens.

HOWEVER, there deaths are the result of a terrible virus that is coming from their computers. \\"Someone\\" had decided that selected victims must die and has programed a virus into the computers they use which utimately causes them to self-destruct.The In Death series is set in 2059 and has futuristic references combined with good old fashioned detective work. Eve Dallas and her ever present billionare husband Roark combine forces to solve the high tech computer problem, working out of Eve's home with all her staff police staff on hand to help. Purity is another good fun read in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"I have enjoyed the Eve Dallas series very much but I have the sense that either JD Robb has run out of new ideas or is just tired of the series. The phrases in this book are repeitions of dialogs from past books in this series. It gave me the impression that she had phrases mapped to keys on her keyboard and she just pressed keys to insert dialog. I'll have to think before I spend money on any more of these titles and I'm sad that these aren't enjoyable any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"This is a truly bad book without a single original moment in it.

However, it does work okay and if you are the kind who spends hours in your car then this may be very useful should your battery dies when you need it the most. Another thing I found about this charger is the rubber/plastic covering the wire is cheap and started to turn white and then flake off after a while making it useless after that.

The characters are odious, one keeps rooting for either of them to die and thus end the film promptly. (alas, my brother insisted on sitting through this thus making me a captive audience).The self-absorbtion, greed, sadistic tendencies, abusiveness, and general cruelty of both Verlaine and Rimbaud culminate in a tedious, vile, and overly lengthy waste of celluloid.

Her fine directing is undermined by Leo DiCaprio's inept acting. Getting Leo to play Rimbaud is like asking Burt Reynolds to play Macbeth; this is just way out of Leo's league, and it's painful to watch him struggle with the dialogue. Apparently this was filmed before his breakthrough into superstardom; I read that once TITANIC came out, DiCaprio's agents tried to have copies of TOTAL ECLIPSE pulled off the shelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual DiCaprio Flick","review":"He doesn't die. He's not all sappy, He actually acts. I never thought he had it in him. As you can probably tell, but I'm not much of a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but in this movie, he demonstrates that there is a reason he became an actor and it wasn't from looks and for his ability to die well.This movie is based on the true story of the 19th century French poets, Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud. It is the story of a volatile romantic triangle of the two poets and and Paul Verlaine's wife, set in early period era. The movie illustrates the cruelty of genius and the constant creative forces that exist within an artist.Definately a movie to see and add to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally tedious","review":"DiCaprio and poetry don't mix. Although intending to portray one of the world's most intense homoerotic relationships (and with a few glimpses of frontal nudity), it all adds up to they-make-up-they-break-up-they-make-up-they break-up ad nauseum. With endless talk, and a good deal of virulent misogyny. You end up sympathizing only with Verlaine's long-suffering wife. For the two lead characters are completely insufferable. Quite a disappointment from the director who brought us \\"Europa, Europa\\" and \\"The Secret Garden\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry in Motion","review":"Despite the negative criticism of this film, it is a priceless asset to serious Rimbaud scholars. Although some creative liberty is taken by the director, the film does generally tell the story of the young poetic genius. DiCaprio is amazing in this role. The cinematography, music, and and attention to detail add to the profundity of the film.

The fact that they were persecuted for their sexual preference left this reviewer with ambivalent feelings.

Leo di Caprio as the French Symbolist poet, Rimbaud? Well, it's actually WORSE than I could have imagined! It's as if he's accidentally wandered from Los Angeles, 1995, into a Masterpiece Theatre production, complete with typically excellent British actors. It even sounds as if he's ad libbing lines, they're so utterly anachronistic. I guess I could try to see this as a time-travel story-- then his fist-in-the-air \\"woo!\\" wouldn't seem like an asonishing directorial lapse as much as an illustration of behavioral differences between fin de siecle France and contemporary American teen culture.I'd love to see what Mystery Science Theater could do with this goofy waste of film and decent British actors. I second the previous reviewer who suggested just getting a couple of books of poetry instead of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leo Stinks","review":"This movie was Fair. I dont understand why if Leo's character was supposed to be french then why didnt they have him speak in a accent. The rest of the characters did. I dont understand why people and critics praise Leo has being a great actor. Hes just fair. Not terffic. Im very upset that one of the movie magazines qouted \\"was he robed of an Oscar\\" for Titanic. Please he wasnt that brillant of an actor. Please dont watch this movies becuase of Leo. The movie could have found better actor for the part. Titanic should have found a better on too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"This film educated me about Rimbaud's life, which I was glad to learn about, but DiCaprio, who can act brilliantly, doesn't act well here. (He's playing a Frenchman, but speaks in an American accent: a mistake). For the prurient among you, the opportunity to see Leo's bare rear (and even his shadowed package) and to see him French kiss another man, might be reason enough to see it. But, really, this movie is rather a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing movie","review":"Having read so many reviews about \\"TotalEclipse\\", I rented the movie with great expectations. To put it mildly, I was disappointed. There was no quality at all, and even though DiCaprio tried his best, the movie just wouldn't lift. I suggest that you read some of Rimbaud's poetry instead of watching this poorly-made film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transport yourself in time and mood","review":"A beautiful film. The music and cinematography transport you to a latter 19th century Paris that feels too dark and damp to inspire the genius of Arthur Rimbaud, yet it does. The film eloquently illustrates that Rimbaud interpreted the world to have a fourth dimension, in which he easily transcended corporeal banality to inhabit his own experiential realm. Rimbaud is played to perfection by Leonardo DiCaprio, who brilliantly captures the essence of the haunted, petulant poet. The screenplay is remarkable in its wit and leaness of hyberbole. David Thewlis delivers an unforgetable performance, as does Rohane Bohinger as Rimbaud's sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a wise move for Dicaprio","review":"I just saw this film two days ago because I think Dicaprio is a great actor. This film is really not entertaining AT ALL. The two actors do not have chemistry to fulfill the story. They break up constantly and \\"use\\" each other. At the end we don't even see why they come apart, and the potrayal of Leo as a older man w/ a fake mustache silly. Personally I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Don't watch without a barf bag","review":"A team of movie producers must have come together and said to each other, \\"Instead of making a movie that is actually entertaining, why don't we see how many ways can we find to disgust, bore, and depress the viewers?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but should of had another focus.","review":"I thought this was a wonderful movie,about the romance between two poets, and the special bond between them.Rimbaud was a genius, and this movie depicts it, somewhat.The movie should of focused on the genius of this poet rather that his sexuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality","review":"My husband and son bought PVC pipe and created a cheap frame to attach this to since we did not have the LAX goal.

I'm hope the leather gives abit after i wear them and streches over the toe area to avoid any digging in. Its too bad Naot does not have a wide fitting shoe, for all of us that have a wider foot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, Not for the Average Business Person","review":"This book was a disappointment in that it appears to be primarily aimed at high-level diplomats and/or very, very high level corporate people at the biggest corporations. It seemed pompous and snobbish and out of touch with real life situations outside of the diplomatic corp. I would not recommend it for the average Joe Business man who just wants to know the proper real-life etiquette in a majority of corporate environments today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for serious professionals","review":"Think it doesn't matter how you write thank you notes or eat lunch with the boss?

Read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date and out of touch","review":"This book describes a world that most business people do not inhabit. It is stuffy and irrelevant. Business etiquette is based on business situations that constantly evolve. There is no evidence here that the authors have any idea about the reality of the work environment. Business etiquette is not about place settings at the White House or how to address diplomats when you have them over for dinner. It about putting one's associates and guests at ease when the atmosphere is social but the agenda is business.

I bought it and was excited to read it. I kept on reading waiting for the part of the book that would make me feel justified for the money I spend on it. But it never came. To my opinion, the story is lacking big time. It is very repetitous. The main characters (totally unrealistic) tell and retell their dreams over and over and you wonder if there is a end to it and if they are ever going to get to the point. A \\"wannabe\\" philosophical version of the Love Boat. I had to force myself to read it and I could not wait to finish to move to something else worth my time. In my opinion it is not worth the paper that is written on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviewing the reviewers","review":"I dont think that the other people that have posted reviews of this book are talking about the same book, because if they are then they are either friends or family of the author.

If you are an independent reader please dont bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Cassie's Done Stripping...\\"","review":"Very misleading cover art, if you are expecting a grindhouse B-Movie sexploitation film... I was. The cover is made to look like a 60's drive-in poster, (must have got the idea from a recent release called \\"Teenage Hitchhikers\\" which DID deliver a classic sexploitation film. BUT if you pay attention to the text, \\"Cassie's Done Stripping...\\", well her stripper days were BEFORE they made this film, even in her sex scenes she remains fully clothed. And at the strip club,the strippers never appear in less than fully covered lingerie. Except for maybe 5 seconds, from a distance, and edited so tight you better not blink. Other than that, its a fair attempt at the consequences of finding drugs and money that are not yours. The only exploitation is in misleading the buyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Streaky--not good for cleaning polished surfaces or LCD screens","review":"I bought these based on another review that indicated they were streakless. This is simply not the case. They are about as wet as a baby wipe and nearly as messy. In fact, they are easily the most streaky electronic wipes I've ever encountered. Even the instructions on the wipes state that cleaning with a dry cloth is necessary to avoid streaks! Anything this moist is guaranteed to leave streaks unless it also is quick evaporating and the cloth itself it sufficient to wipe out 'drying marks'. These Weiman Wipes are closer to Armor All car wipes than anything else, and while they will get your electronics clean, they don't work well at all for things like TV or Notebook screens, or the polished exterior of a phone, camcorder, or laptop. I was less than pleased with them and won't be buying them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on these","review":"I bought this 4 pack a few years ago and just used my last one.

These are the brightest and most powerful pair I could find well within my price range. Beware though, they are almost too powerful. So much so that they are hard to hold steady.

They are great for viewing objects at great distances. I can count the points on a buck deer from a quarter mile away with no problem. The craters on the moon look so close you think you could touch them. If all you want binoculars for is viewing sports activies and concerts, then these are probably not for you. These are very powerful binoculars and therefore not suited to short range usage (probably less than one hundred yards) They are very lightweight for their power. If I do have any dissapointment in these binoculars it is that they do not have provision to mount them to a tripod. With the 20x power of the glasses, holding them steady on small or very distant objects is sometime difficult. All in all, these binoculars are a very good choice and a good value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This locking fuel cap did not work well, the key would get stuck and not open the cap.

Bought the package from Amazon. At the beginning, everything is fine, the guitar is good, and the amp also works well. After about 6 months, the third string start hitting the fingerboard when I play it on the first fret. That's fine to me, it is just some little extra noise.I usually practice scales on high frets. This morning, I wanted to play C major to see how it's nodes fit in the major scale, and I just found out that all 6 strings would hit the fingerboard on the first fret. It's not just a noise this time. If I play the strings, all I hear is the sound of a metal string hitting on another metal. I won't call it music.Also, I cannot find Baja's website or any information about them. I'll just keep it like that and stick with my scale practice in high fret.For those who consider this one, even for a beginner, I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guitar!
